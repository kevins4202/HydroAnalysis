introduction industrialization and urbanization have triggered severe environmental pollution particularly eutrophication niu et al 2021 traditional technologies can effectively remove most phosphates from wastewater however the effluent still contains low phosphate concentrations making meeting discharge standards challenging vijayaraghavan and balasubramanian 2021 a phosphorus concentration of 0 1 mg p l has been recommended as the eu s regulatory target concentration for eutrophication liu et al 2022 phosphorus is also a non renewable resource that is worth recycling to improve soil fertility in agricultural cultivation phosphorus fertilizer is over added to form deposition increasing agricultural costs and soil salinization and compaction phosphorus eventually enters the ocean through surface runoff and leaching resulting in the loss of phosphorus resources hao et al 2013 therefore exploring technologies that effectively treat low p wastewater and capture the p from the effluent is imperative current wastewater treatment methods for low phosphorus containing wastewater include physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2020a existing phosphate recovery methods have drawbacks in terms of cost operational complexity safety and maintenance which lead to wastewater treatment problems such as sludge generation disposal and secondary pollution hu et al 2020 lin et al 2021 low phosphorus containing wastewater recovery requires a novel and efficient advanced treatment strategy with low energy requirements to prevent eutrophication in natural water bodies electrocoagulation ec technology has been widely recognized as an efficient approach for treating wastewater because of its ease of operation and eco friendliness das et al 2022 however electrocoagulation technology usually requires high energy consumption ben sasson et al 2009 electrocoagulation with an air cathode uses the potential difference between the oxygen reduction and sacrificial anode electrode reactions to compensate for most of the applied energy and can significantly reduce energy consumption yang et al 2015 electrocoagulation with a migrating electric field enriches the local phosphorus ions increasing their concentration simultaneous electrocoagulation and desorption effectively reduce the working time of the sacrificial anode thereby reducing energy and material consumption aljaberi et al 2022 to further improve the removal of phosphates choosing an appropriate electrode with a low cost and high adsorption desorption capacity is essential biochar is an economical environmentally friendly and efficient electrode material prepared by the pyrolysis of biomaterials in an o2 free environment zhong et al 2021 conventional synthetic electrodes such as carbon aerogels welgemoed and schutte 2005 and activated carbon huang et al 2014 can effectively reduce high concentration phosphate through co precipitation or complexation reaction mechanisms however it is difficult for traditional chemical synthetic electrodes to achieve excellent removal performance in wastewater containing low concentrations of p because metal ions need to be released in excess to stabilize binding and form precipitates under low concentration phosphate conditions which also leads to excessive consumption of sacrificial anode materials bellier et al 2006 biochar has been widely applied in environmental pollution treatment because of its stable adsorption capacity owing to its high specific surface area adequate pore size distribution and relatively high mechanical strength ji et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 these properties benefit the phosphorus recovery of biochar electrode material via adsorption from low concentration phosphorus wastewater john and arumugam 2015 yin et al 2019 recent investigations have suggested that biochar converted from agricultural residues can bind chemicals in wastewater including heavy metals and organic contaminants inyang et al 2016 the unique properties and environmental merits of biochar make it an excellent material for electrochemical systems the investigation of three dimensional 3d bulk carbon materials have recently attracted substantial attention robles et al 2020 compared with traditional 2d layered carbon materials 3d carbon materials have a higher total capacitance and hardness providing a low cost and easily modified method to achieve extracellular electron transport almarzooqi et al 2014 capacitive deionization cdi is commonly used in desalination technology to remove ions from water based on pseudocapacitive adsorption hong et al 2020 additionally cdi can selectively concentrate the ions in water jia and zou 2012 efficiently separating the charged ionic solutes from the solvents jiang et al 2019 lado et al 2021 a cdi unit was evaluated to treat phosphate containing wastewater at different ph values and a novel composite electrode was constructed to achieve selective phosphorus removal huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 moreover integrating cdi electrodes into the electrocoagulation process could help phosphorus recovery selectively in the effluent for resource regeneration applied to low phosphorus wastewater and the local concentration and efficient precipitation removal of phosphate ions can be achieved in this study we propose integrating the migration electrode into a capacitive adsorption electrode in combination with cdi which can enrich the adsorbed phosphorus ions with low energy consumption using the reduction reaction of the air cathode the desorption process utilizes the negative potential of the sacrificial electrode to compensate for the energy consumption of desorption while achieving concurrent resolution and flocculation to efficiently produce precipitation and increase the phosphorus content of the precipitate the migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was modified to use new materials to

per step 4 s 2 3 measurements and analysis the electrochemical characteristics of the fabricated sponge biochar electrodes were evaluated using a three electrode system the electrochemical characteristics were measured using an electrochemical workstation chi760e shanghai china and the electrolyte solution used for the electrochemical tests was 0 1 mol l na2so4 the reactor configuration for the electrode tests included the working electrode as sponge biochar the counter electrode as a platinum sheet with an area of 1 cm 1 cm and the reference electrode as an ag agcl electrode the durability of the sbc electrode was tested over time in charging and discharging tests with an air cathode and a synthetic phosphate solution the charge and discharge times were set at 300 s with an applied voltage of 0 5 v for 100 cycles cyclic voltammetry cv tests were performed from 0 5 to 0 5 v at scan rates of 1 mv s 0 7 mv s 0 5 mv s 0 3 mv s and 0 1 mv s the processing time was 300 s for

slope of the log i vs log v plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphate removal in low concentration phosphorus wastewater the phosphate concentration gradient was set from 1 2 5 mg l for phosphate removal in low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater using meaec reactors with sbc as an adsorption electrode sbc meaec each treatment cycle consisted of an applied voltage of 0 5 v between the sbc anode and air cathode for 10 s for electro adsorption followed by a constant voltage of 0 5 v between the sbc cathode and sacrificial fe anode for 10 s as electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation fig 1 the iron mesh was used as a sacrificial anode to compare the performance of sbc meaec and the control air cathode ec and reach the effluent phosphorus class a 0 5 mg l standard of the wwtp in china gb 18918 2002 when the influent phosphate concentration in synthetic wastewater was 1 mg l the sbc meaec system required only one treatment cycle 10 s electro adsorption and 10 s electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation to achieve an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 4 0 04 mg l saving 90 electrolysis time compared to the control 100 s electrolysis time for a similar effluent phosphate concentration 0 46 0 02 mg l fig 1a moreover the minimum effluent phosphate concentration of the sbc meaec system achieved with 10 treatment cycles was 0 12 0 03 mg l phosphate removal was 34 higher than the control for 100 s electrolysis time the sbc meaec system 100 s electrolysis time took only one sixth of the treatment time to achieve the same effluent phosphorus concentration 0 13 0 01 mg l as the control 600 s electrolysis time the charge transfer quantity in the charge discharge test was used to examine the sacrificial anode loss of sbc meaec and ec for a similar effluent phosphate concentration the sacrificial electrode transferred 83 less charge of the sbc meaec system 1 05 c than the control 6 3 c as calculated using eq 2 for 1 mg l influent phosphate concentration with the same total electrolysis time which demonstrates that the sbc meaec system notably reduced the loss of the sacrificial anode to achieve a similar effluent phosphate concentration compared to the continuous mode operation of the ec the batch mode operation for the sbc meaec consumed less of the sacrificial anode liu et al 2017 an electric field was applied between the sbc electrode and air cathode to drive the migration and enrichment of phosphate anions towards the sbc electrode tian et al 2016 a current was then applied between the sacrificial anode fe mesh and the sbc electrode and the electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation process caused the electrocoagulation of phosphate the electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation process demonstrated that phosphate was enriched concentrated and combined with iron ions to form flocculation the phosphate concentration was reduced by the sbc meaec treatment from 1 5 mg l to 0 44 0 02 mg l in 10 treatment cycles with 70 4 1 8 phosphate removal fig 1b in contrast the phosphate removal of the control was only 59 9 1 6 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 62 0 02 mg l taking the same electrolysis time finally with a working time of up to 600 s electrolysis time for the control the effluent phosphate concentration was 0 41 0 02 mg l the effluent concentration of sbc meaec was 0 5 mg l in 10 treatment cycles for 2 mg l synthetic phosphate wastewater which was still better than the phosphate removal of the control 0 77 0 04 mg l after a total of 100 s electrolysis time the sbc meaec required only 100 s to achieve a higher phosphate removal of 77 6 2 2 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 45 0 04 mg l fig 1c when the influent phosphate concentration was 2 5 mg l the sbc meaec treatment achieved an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 52 0 04 mg l and 79 07 1 5 phosphate removal after 10 working cycles fig 1d after a total of 100 s electrolysis time the effluent phosphate concentration of the control was 1 08 0 06 mg l with 56 67 2 4 phosphate removal an overtime treatment 600 s electrolysis time was also tested but the effluent phosphate concentration was still 0 5 mg l 0 58 0 03 mg l the sbc meaec system could achieve effluent phosphorus standard class a 0 5 mg l within 100 s total electrolysis time 10 treatment cycles even if the effluent phosphorus concentration standard were lower 1 5 2 5 mg l than class b 1 mg l in china gb18918 2002 furthermore the phosphorus concentration requirement for the surface water class iii standard 0 2 mg l could be achieved within 100 s total electrolysis time of total treatment time 10 treatment cycles in 1 mg l influent the sbc meaec system with a pseudo capacitance electrode significantly improved phosphorus removal efficiency from low concentration phosphate containing synthetic wastewater with less electrolysis time achieving the same effluent level as the control demonstrating the advantages of using the sbc adsorption electrode for low phosphate concentrations the primary factor leading to the excellent performance of sbc meaec was the use of the sbc electrode and its impact on ion migration and concentration due to the electric field and electro absorption which localized the accumulated target phosphate and enhanced the precipitate formation with metal ions according to the environmental quality standards for surface water in china gb 3838 2002 the phosphate concentration of the effluent could meet the 4th level of surface water quality standards with the sbc meaec treatment the phosphate concentration of secondary clarifier effluent was similar to that of synthetic wastewater at approximately 1 0 1 mg l fig 2 the phosphate concentrations of secondary clarifier effluent decreased significantly from 1 0 1 mg l to 0 3 0 027 mg l with the sbc meaec system which was 0 5 mg l after 100 s total electrolysis time phosphate removal by the sbc meaec system 90 98 3 7 was higher than that of the control fe ec 55 33 3 2 after 15 treatment cycles compared the synthetic wastewater 1 mg l influent with real wastewater treatment by the sbc meaec the total electrolysis time of real wastewater required 50 s more to reach a similar effluent phosphate concentration 0 1 0 03 mg l to that of the synthetic wastewater 0 12 0 03 mg l with 10 treatment cycles fig 1a considering other possible conditions affecting phosphate removals such as suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand the sbc meaec performance was still applicable for secondary clarifier effluent treatment zhou et al 2022 we performed approximately 1000 cycles of continuous charge discharge tests using the sbc electrode in 1 mg l synthetic wastewater and secondary clarifier effluent to investigate the long term working performance of the sbc electrode the line graph in fig 3 illustrates the changing charge and discharge efficiency trends from 1 to 1000 cycles the charge quantity with the most significant value in the first cycle showed a slight drop in the following 100 cycles fig 3b although the value decreased significantly between 100 and 200 cycles it maintained this level from 200 to 1000 cycles despite a fall at 800 cycles meanwhile the discharge efficiency exhibited the same trend the average discharge quantity per cycle 0 01864 c was less than the average charge quantity per cycle 0 02123 c which is attributed to sbc electrodes accumulating phosphate ions the phosphorus content before and after electro adsorption confirms this fig s1 however the number of charge quantities shows a different trend in fig 3d which started at a lower value of only 0 015 c and fluctuated insignificantly before 100 cycles 0 01497 0 000136 c then the number showed a slight downward trend to 0 0135 c from 100 to 1000 cycles the discharge quantity exhibited a similar trend but the charge quantity reached a slightly higher value the charge transfer efficiency decreased from 200 1000 cycles from 89 97 to 84 46 indicating that the secondary clarifier effluent contained solid suspensions and additional coexisting ions which reduced the electrochemical performance of the sbc electrode overall both wastewaters had good stability and durability and performance could be restored to 100 after the adsorbent regeneration test fig s3 3 2 elemental composition determination of precipitates by xps and xrd the elemental composition and atomic percentages of precipitates from the sbc meaec system and control were determined by xps analysis and the precipitation components were determined by xrd analysis the precipitate phosphorus signals fig 4 a in sbc meaec were identified as po4 3 133 7 ev and hpo4 2 134 7 ev this change in ph is likely the reason for the existence of the hpo4 2 signal moreover the fe precipitates fig 4b were present in both fe2 710 6 ev and fe3 712 8 ev 725 3 ev oxidation states zhang et al 2018 the most abundant elements in both precipitates were c o fe and p and differences were observed in the atomic number percentages table 1 the elemental precipitate composition of sbc meaec had no prominent characteristic peaks compared with the control indicating that the use of the sbc electrode did not cause changes in the composition of the precipitates fig 4 the atomic percentages of fe elements in the precipitate from the sbc meaec system and the control was similar at 7 11 and 4 57 respectively the atomic percentage of phosphorus was 13 01 for the precipitate from the sbc meaec system which was three times higher than that of the control 3 89 indicating the high efficiency utilization of iron ions in the sbc meaec system the xrd patterns of the flocculated precipitate showed several peaks at 24 21 31 27 and 38 63 2Î¸ corresponding to fepo4 the peaks at 17 85 33 32 and 46 18 2Î¸ were attributed to fe oh 3 and those at 46 21 and 55 18 2Î¸ to fe oh 2 zhang et al 2022 the main component of the precipitate collected in the sbc meaec was iron phosphate which can be directly utilized nieminen et al 2011 because the low phosphate concentration was uniformly distributed in the wastewater it could accumulate and concentrate near the sacrificial iron anode via electric adsorption and desorption processes in the sbc meaec system consequently the fepo4 content in the sbc meaec system differed significantly from that of the control fig 5 in contrast the main components of the precipitates in the control were fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 which depend on the change in ph the xrd results substantiated the better performance of the sbc meaec compared to that of the control fe ec without an sbc adsorption electrode in treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater because of the sbc adsorption electrode phosphate was concentrated by electro desorption and highly complexed by simultaneous electrocoagulation which proved that the metal ions released by the sacrificial anode were effectively utilized compared to the control the xps results also confirmed that the application of the sbc electrode reduced the loss of the sacrificial anodes moreover the precipitates generated contained a significant amount of iron phosphate which can be directly returned to the field and utilized as fertilizer nieminen et al 2011 3 3 characterization of sbc electrode after carbonization the sbc showed a rich pore structure interconnected pore sizes fig 6 and a weight of 2 0 2 g the surface of the sbc was smooth with large interconnected pores forming a sponge like porous structure four elements c n o and p were present in the sbc with c being the main element the c content of the sbc was up to 85 82 which is beneficial for high electrical conductivity robles et al 2020 sbc contained 0 34 elemental p this low phosphorus content means that the sbc would have minimal phosphorus leaching into the water and avoid secondary contamination the surface of the sbc was rich in oxygen containing functional groups fig 7 a clear oh stretching vibration peaks were observed at 3438 cm 1 which indicated that sbc had a high amount of bound water and excellent hydrophilicity guo et al 2019 the intensities of the c o bond 1591 80 cm 1 were significantly enhanced owing to the pyrolysis of carbon containing materials at high temperatures the c o functional group enhanced the biochar performance in pollution remediation which provided a negative charge on its surface wang et al 2021 furthermore the c o and c o 1090 16 cm 1 vibrations indicate that sbc had many oxygen containing functional groups sbc had prominent symmetric and antisymmetric aliphatic c h vibrational absorption peaks at 2930 cm 1 and 2855 cm 1 which demonstrated the formation of a dense ring structure in the biochar after high temperature treatment for the high stability of the sbc zhang et al 2020b the ftir results provided further evidence showing that these functional groups in sbc are essential for enhancing the performance of biochar in pollution remediation the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm shown in fig 7b was used to calculate the specific surface area volume and average pore radius of the sbc the bet surface area of sbc was 738 63 m2 g with a micropore volume of 0 25 cm3 g according to the iupac classification system the n2 adsorption and desorption curves belong to the type i isotherm adsorption fig 7b which indicates that the sbc pore structure was mainly microporous feng et al 2021 the pore size distribution curve shows that the pore diameter was mainly distributed between 4 3 7 6 nm fig 7b the surface area and pore size structure of biochar materials play a decisive role john and arumugam 2015 a high pyrolysis temperature and long pyrolysis time introduced many micropores and a high pore volume to the biochar wang et al 2020 therefore sbc is suitable as an adsorption electrode with a large specific surface area and rich pore size structure a charge discharge test was conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the sbc electrode the voltage was set at 0 5 v constant voltage for 100 cycles with a charging discharging time of 300 s per cycle the voltage charge and discharge of sbc were constant at 0 10 and 90 100 cycles fig 8 the sbc electrode was charged for 150 s and the current was close to smooth the charge of discharging was 2 96 c while that of charging was 3 3 c during one charge discharge test cycle the voltage variation through the sbc electrode tended to become smoother as the operating time increased after 100 cycles of continuous charge discharge tests the charge transfer efficiency remained stable indicating that the sbc electrode had excellent durability and electrochemical properties which is consistent with the long term charge and discharge results described previously in addition to the charge accumulated by the active electro adsorption process passive physical adsorption may lead to a higher total charge of the discharging process than that of the charging process the surface morphology of the sbc electrode after continuous charging and discharging were characterized using sem and eds mapping fig 9 after 100 cycles of the charging discharging test the surface structure of the sbc was still smooth the smooth protrusions on the surface of sbc after charging and discharging were filled with phosphorus elements and the elemental content of phosphorus reached 10 83 which indicates that sbc has adsorption and enrichment properties for phosphate comparing the sem images of the surface and cross sectional samples of the sbc electrode after the continuous charging and discharging tests the degree of wear out was relatively less than that on the surface and only a few spots could be seen in the cross section there was no obvious deformation in the cross section and the phosphorus content was low 0 82 indicating that the sbc electrode still had good adsorption performance and durability the phosphorus content of the new sbc electrode was 0 34 after the charge and discharge tests the phosphorus content of the surface increased by 10 49 and that of the cross section increased by 0 48 indicating that the surface was the primary site of sbc electrode adsorption 3 4 energy consumption phosphate removal increased with treatment time whereas overtime treatment resulted in high energy consumption however the influent concentration was the same and the treatment time of sbc meaec was significantly reduced compared with that of the control to reach a similar effluent concentration to reach the class a 0 5 mg l standard for effluent phosphorus the energy consumption of the sbc meaec system was only 0 0058 kwh m3 for 100 s total electrolysis time and the effluent phosphate concentration was 0 52 0 03 mg l for 2 5 mg l influent phosphate concentration treatment this energy requirement decreased by 65 compared to the control without the sbc electrode which consumed 0 017 kwh m3 to reach a similar effluent concentration moreover applying the sbc adsorption electrode saved up to 74 of energy consumption compared to the previous study tian et al 2018 these results suggest that the electro adsorption effect of the sbc electrodes in the meaec reactor can significantly decrease energy consumption to achieve a good effluent level activated carbon and metal materials table 2 were compared for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater which indicated that the sbc meaec system is highly efficient and energy saving even economically reaching china s surface water class iii phosphate standard 0 2 mg l the sbc meaec system showed energy consumption savings for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater in comparison granular attapulgite and epigallocatechin gallate have a high phosphate removal efficiency and high cost and the composites may cause secondary pollution to the environment lv et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the sbc electrode was prepared from waste biomass without chemical reagents and did not introduce exogenous pollutants into the water environment that could cause secondary pollution the results of the phosphate effluent level treatment efficiency sacrificial anode consumption and energy requirement demonstrate that the performance of the sbc meaec system is promising for treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater 4 conclusion the sbc meaec system showed high phosphate removal efficiency and low energy consumption for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater the sbc electrode was prepared from waste flour forming a three dimensional rich sponge like pore structure with uniform pore size pseudocapacitive properties and good durability in the sbc meaec system the sbc electrode works as a pseudo capacitance electrode for electro adsorption and electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation processes to enhance phosphate treatment efficiency and metal ion utilization the target ions accumulated around the sacrificial anode by electro adsorption using an sbc electrode and concentrated by electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation in the meaec reactor the phosphate concentration was reduced from 1 mg l to 0 12 0 03 mg l after 100 s total electrolysis time with the sbc meaec system only consuming 0 0058 kwh m3 which was 65 lower than the control these results indicate that the sbc meaec system is a promising and cost effective method for treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater furthermore the generated precipitation enriched in phosphate accumulated at the bottom of the reactor for convenient phosphorus recycling should be further investigated based on the effectiveness of this laboratory investigation a detailed cost analysis should be conducted in future studies to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up the proposed sbc meaec system credit authorship contribution statement yushi tian writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization methodology nianhua chen

through surface runoff and leaching resulting in the loss of phosphorus resources hao et al 2013 therefore exploring technologies that effectively treat low p wastewater and capture the p from the effluent is imperative current wastewater treatment methods for low phosphorus containing wastewater include physical chemical and biological processes zhang et al 2020a existing phosphate recovery methods have drawbacks in terms of cost operational complexity safety and maintenance which lead to wastewater treatment problems such as sludge generation disposal and secondary pollution hu et al 2020 lin et al 2021 low phosphorus containing wastewater recovery requires a novel and efficient advanced treatment strategy with low energy requirements to prevent eutrophication in natural water bodies electrocoagulation ec technology has been widely recognized as an efficient approach for treating wastewater because of its ease of operation and eco friendliness das et al 2022 however electrocoagulation technology usually requires high energy consumption ben sasson et al 2009 electrocoagulation with an air cathode uses the potential difference between the oxygen reduction and sacrificial anode electrode reactions to compensate for most of the applied energy and can significantly reduce energy consumption yang et al 2015 electrocoagulation with a migrating electric field enriches the local phosphorus ions increasing their concentration simultaneous electrocoagulation and desorption effectively reduce the working time of the sacrificial anode thereby reducing energy and material consumption aljaberi et al 2022 to further improve the removal of phosphates choosing an appropriate electrode with a low cost and high adsorption desorption capacity is essential biochar is an economical environmentally friendly and efficient electrode material prepared by the pyrolysis of biomaterials in an o2 free environment zhong et al 2021 conventional synthetic electrodes such as carbon aerogels welgemoed and schutte 2005 and activated carbon huang et al 2014 can effectively reduce high concentration phosphate through co precipitation or complexation reaction mechanisms however it is difficult for traditional chemical synthetic electrodes to achieve excellent removal performance in wastewater containing low concentrations of p because metal ions need to be released in excess to stabilize binding and form precipitates under low concentration phosphate conditions which also leads to excessive consumption of sacrificial anode materials bellier et al 2006 biochar has been widely applied in environmental pollution treatment because of its stable adsorption capacity owing to its high specific surface area adequate pore size distribution and relatively high mechanical strength ji et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 these properties benefit the phosphorus recovery of biochar electrode material via adsorption from low concentration phosphorus wastewater john and arumugam 2015 yin et al 2019 recent investigations have suggested that biochar converted from agricultural residues can bind chemicals in wastewater including heavy metals and organic contaminants inyang et al 2016 the unique properties and environmental merits of biochar make it an excellent material for electrochemical systems the investigation of three dimensional 3d bulk carbon materials have recently attracted substantial attention robles et al 2020 compared with traditional 2d layered carbon materials 3d carbon materials have a higher total capacitance and hardness providing a low cost and easily modified method to achieve extracellular electron transport almarzooqi et al 2014 capacitive deionization cdi is commonly used in desalination technology to remove ions from water based on pseudocapacitive adsorption hong et al 2020 additionally cdi can selectively concentrate the ions in water jia and zou 2012 efficiently separating the charged ionic solutes from the solvents jiang et al 2019 lado et al 2021 a cdi unit was evaluated to treat phosphate containing wastewater at different ph values and a novel composite electrode was constructed to achieve selective phosphorus removal huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2022 moreover integrating cdi electrodes into the electrocoagulation process could help phosphorus recovery selectively in the effluent for resource regeneration applied to low phosphorus wastewater and the local concentration and efficient precipitation removal of phosphate ions can be achieved in this study we propose integrating the migration electrode into a capacitive adsorption electrode in combination with cdi which can enrich the adsorbed phosphorus ions with low energy consumption using the reduction reaction of the air cathode the desorption process utilizes the negative potential of the sacrificial electrode to compensate for the energy consumption of desorption while achieving concurrent resolution and flocculation to efficiently produce precipitation and increase the phosphorus content of the precipitate the migration electric field assisted electrocoagulation meaec system was modified to use new materials to reduce energy production and improve nutrient removal biochar electrodes with a three dimensional structure were prepared from waste flour and characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem fourier

cm 3 cm 1 cm and dried for 24 h fourier transform infrared spectra ftir of the biochar functional groups at 4000 400 cm 1 were collected using a thermo fisher spectrophotometer thermo fisher usa the surface structure of the biochar was analyzed using field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem the powdered sample was evenly attached to conductive adhesive tape fixed on the sample stage and scanned at 10 kev the specific surface area and pore volume were obtained through brunauer emmett teller bet measurements asap 2460 2 02 usa at 78 k with relative pressures ranging from 0 1 p p0 and

high resolution spectra of the identified elements were corrected using the c1s signal 285 ev as a reference then the percentage of each element present in the generated sediment was calculated relative to this signal xrd patterns were obtained using a d8 focus bruker germany powder diffractometer equipped with cu kÎ± radiation current 40 ma tension 45 kv measurement range 2Î¸ 5 90 and time per step 4 s 2 3 measurements and analysis the electrochemical characteristics of the fabricated sponge biochar electrodes were evaluated using a three electrode system the electrochemical characteristics were measured using an electrochemical workstation chi760e shanghai china and the electrolyte solution used for the electrochemical tests was 0 1 mol l na2so4 the reactor configuration for the electrode tests included the working electrode as sponge biochar the counter electrode as a platinum sheet with an area of 1 cm 1 cm and the reference electrode as an ag agcl electrode the durability of the sbc electrode was tested over time in charging and discharging tests with an air cathode and a synthetic phosphate solution the charge and discharge times were set at 300 s with an applied voltage of 0 5 v for 100 cycles cyclic voltammetry cv tests were performed from 0 5 to 0 5 v at scan rates of 1 mv s 0 7 mv s 0 5 mv s 0 3 mv s and 0 1 mv s the processing time was 300 s for

slope of the log i vs log v plot 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphate removal in low concentration phosphorus wastewater the phosphate concentration gradient was set from 1 2 5 mg l for phosphate removal in low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater using meaec reactors with sbc as an adsorption electrode sbc meaec each treatment cycle consisted of an applied voltage of 0 5 v between the sbc anode and air cathode for 10 s for electro adsorption followed by a constant voltage of 0 5 v between the sbc cathode and sacrificial fe anode for 10 s as electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation fig 1 the iron mesh was used as a sacrificial anode to compare the performance of sbc meaec and the control air cathode ec and reach the effluent phosphorus class a 0 5 mg l standard of the wwtp in china gb 18918 2002 when the influent phosphate concentration in synthetic wastewater was 1 mg l the sbc meaec system required only one treatment cycle 10 s electro adsorption and 10 s electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation to achieve an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 4 0 04 mg l saving 90 electrolysis time compared to the control 100 s electrolysis time for a similar effluent phosphate concentration 0 46 0 02 mg l fig 1a moreover the minimum effluent phosphate concentration of the sbc meaec system achieved with 10 treatment cycles was 0 12 0 03 mg l phosphate removal was 34 higher than the control for 100 s electrolysis time the sbc meaec system 100 s electrolysis time took only one sixth of the treatment time to achieve the same effluent phosphorus concentration 0 13 0 01 mg l as the control 600 s electrolysis time the charge transfer quantity in the charge discharge test was used to examine the sacrificial anode loss of sbc meaec and ec for a similar effluent phosphate concentration the sacrificial electrode transferred 83 less charge of the sbc meaec system 1 05 c than the control 6 3 c as calculated using eq 2 for 1 mg l influent phosphate concentration with the same total electrolysis time which demonstrates that the sbc meaec system notably reduced the loss of the sacrificial anode to achieve a similar effluent phosphate concentration compared to the continuous mode operation of the ec the batch mode operation for the sbc meaec consumed less of the sacrificial anode liu et al 2017 an electric field was applied between the sbc electrode and air cathode to drive the migration and enrichment of phosphate anions towards the sbc electrode tian et al 2016 a current was then applied between the sacrificial anode fe mesh and the sbc electrode and the electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation process caused the electrocoagulation of phosphate the electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation process demonstrated that phosphate was enriched concentrated and combined with iron ions to form flocculation the phosphate concentration was reduced by the sbc meaec treatment from 1 5 mg l to 0 44 0 02 mg l in 10 treatment cycles with 70 4 1 8 phosphate removal fig 1b in contrast the phosphate removal of the control was only 59 9 1 6 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 62 0 02 mg l taking the same electrolysis time finally with a working time of up to 600 s electrolysis time for the control the effluent phosphate concentration was 0 41 0 02 mg l the effluent concentration of sbc meaec was 0 5 mg l in 10 treatment cycles for 2 mg l synthetic phosphate wastewater which was still better than the phosphate removal of the control 0 77 0 04 mg l after a total of 100 s electrolysis time the sbc meaec required only 100 s to achieve a higher phosphate removal of 77 6 2 2 with an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 45 0 04 mg l fig 1c when the influent phosphate concentration was 2 5 mg l the sbc meaec treatment achieved an effluent phosphate concentration of 0 52 0 04 mg l and 79 07 1 5 phosphate removal after 10 working cycles fig 1d after a total of 100 s electrolysis time the effluent phosphate concentration of the control was 1 08 0 06 mg l with 56 67 2 4 phosphate removal an overtime treatment 600 s electrolysis time was also tested but the effluent phosphate concentration was still 0 5 mg l 0 58 0 03 mg l the sbc meaec system could achieve effluent phosphorus standard class a 0 5 mg l within 100 s total electrolysis time 10 treatment cycles even if the effluent phosphorus concentration standard were lower 1 5 2 5 mg l than class b 1 mg l in china gb18918 2002 furthermore the phosphorus concentration requirement for the surface water class iii standard 0 2 mg l could be achieved within 100 s total electrolysis time of total treatment time 10 treatment cycles in 1 mg l influent the sbc meaec system with a pseudo capacitance electrode significantly improved phosphorus removal efficiency from low concentration phosphate containing synthetic wastewater with less electrolysis time achieving the same effluent level as the control demonstrating the advantages of using the sbc adsorption electrode for low phosphate concentrations the primary factor leading to the excellent performance of sbc meaec was the use of the sbc electrode and its impact on ion migration and concentration due to the electric field and electro absorption which localized the accumulated target phosphate and enhanced the precipitate formation with metal ions according to the environmental quality standards for surface water in china gb 3838 2002 the phosphate concentration of the effluent could meet the 4th level of surface water quality standards with the sbc meaec treatment the phosphate concentration of secondary clarifier effluent was similar to that of synthetic wastewater at approximately 1 0 1 mg l fig 2 the phosphate concentrations of secondary clarifier effluent decreased significantly from 1 0 1 mg l to 0 3 0 027 mg l with the sbc meaec system which was 0 5 mg l after 100 s total electrolysis time phosphate removal by the sbc meaec system 90 98 3 7 was higher than that of the control fe ec 55 33 3 2 after 15 treatment cycles compared the synthetic wastewater 1 mg l influent with real wastewater treatment by the sbc meaec the total electrolysis time of real wastewater required 50 s more to reach a similar effluent phosphate concentration 0 1 0 03 mg l to that of the synthetic wastewater 0 12 0 03 mg l with 10 treatment cycles fig 1a considering other possible conditions affecting phosphate removals such as suspended solids and chemical oxygen demand the sbc meaec performance was still applicable for secondary clarifier effluent treatment zhou et al 2022 we performed approximately 1000 cycles of continuous charge discharge tests using the sbc electrode in 1 mg l synthetic wastewater and secondary clarifier effluent to investigate the long term working performance of the sbc electrode the line graph in fig 3 illustrates the changing charge and discharge efficiency trends from 1 to 1000 cycles the charge quantity with the most significant value in the first cycle showed a slight drop in the following 100 cycles fig 3b although the value decreased significantly between 100 and 200 cycles it maintained this level from 200 to 1000 cycles despite a fall at 800 cycles meanwhile the discharge efficiency exhibited the same trend the average discharge quantity per cycle 0 01864 c was less than the average charge quantity per cycle 0 02123 c which is attributed to sbc electrodes accumulating phosphate ions the phosphorus content before and after electro adsorption confirms this fig s1 however the number of charge quantities shows a different trend in fig 3d which started at a lower value of only 0 015 c and fluctuated insignificantly before 100 cycles 0 01497 0 000136 c then the number showed a slight downward trend to 0 0135 c from 100 to 1000 cycles the discharge quantity exhibited a similar trend but the charge quantity reached a slightly higher value the charge transfer efficiency decreased from 200 1000 cycles from 89 97 to 84 46 indicating that the secondary clarifier effluent contained solid suspensions and additional coexisting ions which reduced the electrochemical performance of the sbc electrode overall both wastewaters had good stability and durability and performance could be restored to 100 after the adsorbent regeneration test fig s3 3 2 elemental composition determination of precipitates by xps and xrd the elemental composition and atomic percentages of precipitates from the sbc meaec system and control were determined by xps analysis and the precipitation components were determined by xrd analysis the precipitate phosphorus signals fig 4 a in sbc meaec were identified as po4 3 133 7 ev and hpo4 2 134 7 ev this change in ph is likely the reason for the existence of the hpo4 2 signal moreover the fe precipitates fig 4b were present in both fe2 710 6 ev and fe3 712 8 ev 725 3 ev oxidation states zhang et al 2018 the most abundant elements in both precipitates were c o fe and p and differences were observed in the atomic number percentages table 1 the elemental precipitate composition of sbc meaec had no prominent characteristic peaks compared with the control indicating that the use of the sbc electrode did not cause changes in the composition of the precipitates fig 4 the atomic percentages of fe elements in the precipitate from the sbc meaec system and the control was similar at 7 11 and 4 57 respectively the atomic percentage of phosphorus was 13 01 for the precipitate from the sbc meaec system which was three times higher than that of the control 3 89 indicating the high efficiency utilization of iron ions in the sbc meaec system the xrd patterns of the flocculated precipitate showed several peaks at 24 21 31 27 and 38 63 2Î¸ corresponding to fepo4 the peaks at 17 85 33 32 and 46 18 2Î¸ were attributed to fe oh 3 and those at 46 21 and 55 18 2Î¸ to fe oh 2 zhang et al 2022 the main component of the precipitate collected in the sbc meaec was iron phosphate which can be directly utilized nieminen et al 2011 because the low phosphate concentration was uniformly distributed in the wastewater it could accumulate and concentrate near the sacrificial iron anode via electric adsorption and desorption processes in the sbc meaec system consequently the fepo4 content in the sbc meaec system differed significantly from that of the control fig 5 in contrast the main components of the precipitates in the control were fe oh 3 and fe oh 2 which depend on the change in ph the xrd results substantiated the better performance of the sbc meaec compared to that of the control fe ec without an sbc adsorption electrode in treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater because of the sbc adsorption electrode phosphate was concentrated by electro desorption and highly complexed by simultaneous electrocoagulation which proved that the metal ions released by the sacrificial anode were effectively utilized compared to the control the xps results also confirmed that the application of the sbc electrode reduced the loss of the sacrificial anodes moreover the precipitates generated contained a significant amount of iron phosphate which can be directly returned to the field and utilized as fertilizer nieminen et al 2011 3 3 characterization of sbc electrode after carbonization the sbc showed a rich pore structure interconnected pore sizes fig 6 and a weight of 2 0 2 g the surface of the sbc was smooth with large interconnected pores forming a sponge like porous structure four elements c n o and p were present in the sbc with c being the main element the c content of the sbc was up to 85 82 which is beneficial for high electrical conductivity robles et al 2020 sbc contained 0 34 elemental p this low phosphorus content means that the sbc would have minimal phosphorus leaching into the water and avoid secondary contamination the surface of the sbc was rich in oxygen containing functional groups fig 7 a clear oh stretching vibration peaks were observed at 3438 cm 1 which indicated that sbc had a high amount of bound water and excellent hydrophilicity guo et al 2019 the intensities of the c o bond 1591 80 cm 1 were significantly enhanced owing to the pyrolysis of carbon containing materials at high temperatures the c o functional group enhanced the biochar performance in pollution remediation which provided a negative charge on its surface wang et al 2021 furthermore the c o and c o 1090 16 cm 1 vibrations indicate that sbc had many oxygen containing functional groups sbc had prominent symmetric and antisymmetric aliphatic c h vibrational absorption peaks at 2930 cm 1 and 2855 cm 1 which demonstrated the formation of a dense ring structure in the biochar after high temperature treatment for the high stability of the sbc zhang et al 2020b the ftir results provided further evidence showing that these functional groups in sbc are essential for enhancing the performance of biochar in pollution remediation the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm shown in fig 7b was used to calculate the specific surface area volume and average pore radius of the sbc the bet surface area of sbc was 738 63 m2 g with a micropore volume of 0 25 cm3 g according to the iupac classification system the n2 adsorption and desorption curves belong to the type i isotherm adsorption fig 7b which indicates that the sbc pore structure was mainly microporous feng et al 2021 the pore size distribution curve shows that the pore diameter was mainly distributed between 4 3 7 6 nm fig 7b the surface area and pore size structure of biochar materials play a decisive role john and arumugam 2015 a high pyrolysis temperature and long pyrolysis time introduced many micropores and a high pore volume to the biochar wang et al 2020 therefore sbc is suitable as an adsorption electrode with a large specific surface area and rich pore size structure a charge discharge test was conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the sbc electrode the voltage was set at 0 5 v constant voltage for 100 cycles with a charging discharging time of 300 s per cycle the voltage charge and discharge of sbc were constant at 0 10 and 90 100 cycles fig 8 the sbc electrode was charged for 150 s and the current was close to smooth the charge of discharging was 2 96 c while that of charging was 3 3 c during one charge discharge test cycle the voltage variation through the sbc electrode tended to become smoother as the operating time increased after 100 cycles of continuous charge discharge tests the charge transfer efficiency remained stable indicating that the sbc electrode had excellent durability and electrochemical properties which is consistent with the long term charge and discharge results described previously in addition to the charge accumulated by the active electro adsorption process passive physical adsorption may lead to a higher total charge of the discharging process than that of the charging process the surface morphology of the sbc electrode after continuous charging and discharging were characterized using sem and eds mapping fig 9 after 100 cycles of the charging discharging test the surface structure of the sbc was still smooth the smooth protrusions on the surface of sbc after charging and discharging were filled with phosphorus elements and the elemental content of phosphorus reached 10 83 which indicates that sbc has adsorption and enrichment properties for phosphate comparing the sem images of the surface and cross sectional samples of the sbc electrode after the continuous charging and discharging tests the degree of wear out was relatively less than that on the surface and only a few spots could be seen in the cross section there was no obvious deformation in the cross section and the phosphorus content was low 0 82 indicating that the sbc electrode still had good adsorption performance and durability the phosphorus content of the new sbc electrode was 0 34 after the charge and discharge tests the phosphorus content of the surface increased by 10 49 and that of the cross section increased by 0 48 indicating that the surface was the primary site of sbc electrode adsorption 3 4 energy consumption phosphate removal increased with treatment time whereas overtime treatment resulted in high energy consumption however the influent concentration was the same and the treatment time of sbc meaec was significantly reduced compared with that of the control to reach a similar effluent concentration to reach the class a 0 5 mg l standard for effluent phosphorus the energy consumption of the sbc meaec system was only 0 0058 kwh m3 for 100 s total electrolysis time and the effluent phosphate concentration was 0 52 0 03 mg l for 2 5 mg l influent phosphate concentration treatment this energy requirement decreased by 65 compared to the control without the sbc electrode which consumed 0 017 kwh m3 to reach a similar effluent concentration moreover applying the sbc adsorption electrode saved up to 74 of energy consumption compared to the previous study tian et al 2018 these results suggest that the electro adsorption effect of the sbc electrodes in the meaec reactor can significantly decrease energy consumption to achieve a good effluent level activated carbon and metal materials table 2 were compared for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater which indicated that the sbc meaec system is highly efficient and energy saving even economically reaching china s surface water class iii phosphate standard 0 2 mg l the sbc meaec system showed energy consumption savings for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater in comparison granular attapulgite and epigallocatechin gallate have a high phosphate removal efficiency and high cost and the composites may cause secondary pollution to the environment lv et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the sbc electrode was prepared from waste biomass without chemical reagents and did not introduce exogenous pollutants into the water environment that could cause secondary pollution the results of the phosphate effluent level treatment efficiency sacrificial anode consumption and energy requirement demonstrate that the performance of the sbc meaec system is promising for treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater 4 conclusion the sbc meaec system showed high phosphate removal efficiency and low energy consumption for the advanced treatment of low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater the sbc electrode was prepared from waste flour forming a three dimensional rich sponge like pore structure with uniform pore size pseudocapacitive properties and good durability in the sbc meaec system the sbc electrode works as a pseudo capacitance electrode for electro adsorption and electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation processes to enhance phosphate treatment efficiency and metal ion utilization the target ions accumulated around the sacrificial anode by electro adsorption using an sbc electrode and concentrated by electro desorption synchronous electrocoagulation in the meaec reactor the phosphate concentration was reduced from 1 mg l to 0 12 0 03 mg l after 100 s total electrolysis time with the sbc meaec system only consuming 0 0058 kwh m3 which was 65 lower than the control these results indicate that the sbc meaec system is a promising and cost effective method for treating low concentration phosphorus containing wastewater furthermore the generated precipitation enriched in phosphate accumulated at the bottom of the reactor for convenient phosphorus recycling should be further investigated based on the effectiveness of this laboratory investigation a detailed cost analysis should be conducted in future studies to evaluate the feasibility of scaling up the proposed sbc meaec system credit authorship contribution statement yushi tian writing original draft writing review editing conceptualization methodology nianhua chen

15116,wet chemical approach is widely applied for phosphate recovery from incinerated ash of waste activated sludge was along with metals removed recovered the high contents of both aluminum al and iron fe in was incinerated ash should be suitable for producing coagulants with some waste anions like cl and so4 2 with acid hcl leaching and metals removing approximately 88 wt of phosphorus p in the ash could be recovered as hydroxylapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh fe3 in the acidic leachate could be selectively removed recovered by extraction with an organic solvent of tributyl phosphate tbp and thus a fecl3 based coagulant could be synthesized by stripping the raffinate with the original brine containing abundant cl and so4 2 furthermore a liquid poly aluminum chloride pac based coagulant could also be synthesized with al3 removed from the ash and the brine which behaved almost the same in the coagulation performance as a commercial coagulant on both phosphate and turbidity removals both p recovery from the ash and coagulant production associated with the brine would enlarge the markets of both blue phosphate and green coagulants keywords waste activated sludge was incineration ash phosphorus recovery metals recovery coagulants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the emerging phosphorus p crisis calls for efficient and sustainable p recovery from wastes wastewater it has been practiced to recover phosphorus from wastewater and or waste activated sludge was jupp et al 2021 liu et al 2021 ma and rosen 2021 ranging from struvite hao et al 2013 to vivianite hao et al 2022b wijdeveld et al 2022 however the proper environments suitable for formation of both struvite and vivianite are relatively strict hao et al 2022b 2013 prot et al 2021 and moreover p recovery efficiencies of struvite and vivianite are not very high at 15 30 and 40 70 respectively chrispim et al 2019 van der kooij et al 2020 wijdeveld et al 2022 wilfert et al 2015 in another approach to p recovery was incinerated ash 5 10 p or 11 23 p2o5 have a high potential in the p recovery efficiency up to 90 fang et al 2020 jupp et al 2021 liu et al 2021 furthermore incineration has been identified as an ultimate approach to disposing was galey et al 2022 hao et al 2020a ma and rosen 2021 as a result p recovery from was incinerated ash would become a mainstream approach to handling was especially under the current condition that european counties generally emphasize to cover at 80 influent p load from wastewater treatment jupp et al 2021 liu and qu 2016 in practice p recovery techniques from was incinerated ash have become relatively mature among others wet chemical approaches seem the most sustainable methods fahimi et al 2021 followed by thermochemical methods fang et al 2020 galey et al 2022 liu et al 2021 however each of these techniques involves metal removing processes indeed was incinerated ash contains both heavy metals copper cu zinc zn lead pb chromium cr cadmium cd mercury hg and nickel ni and ordinary metals calcium ca magnesium mg aluminum al iron fe sodium na and potassium k boniardi et al 2021 geng et al 2020 particularly the contents of al and fe are so high as 6 18 8 and 2 4 14 5 wt respectively liang et al 2019 petzet et al 2012 smol et al 2020 which could be utilized to produce coagulants flocculants in wastewater treatment thus recycling al and fe seems necessary associated with p recovery towards a circular blue economy hao et al 2022a there are some limited studies on reusing al as a precipitant morf et al 2019 petzet et al 2012 2011 and clearly some in depth researches need to be carried out especially for reusing fe cohen and enfÃ¤lt 2018 different from al fe cannot be extracted by alkaline dissolution but it can be extracted by some organic solvents including tributyl phosphate tbp wei et al 2016 yi et al 2020 methyl isobutyl ketone mibk saji and reddy 2001 di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa azizitorghabeh et al 2016 primary amine n1923 deep et al 2007 etc potential reuse of al and fe should orient towards producing coagulants flocculants under the circumstance available anions like cl and so4 2 would play an important role in reusing al and fe on the other hand seawater desalination swd has become a trend of acquiring freshwater along near coastal areas jones et al 2019 pistocchi et al 2020 the brine from desalination contains a high salt concentration containing such anions as cl and so4 2 up to 41 829 and 6050 mg l respectively ortiz albo et al 2019 both cl and so4 2 can be extracted from the brine by some methods including adsorption qi et al 2020 nanofiltration nf pÃ©rez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2015 and electrodialysis ed zhang et al 2009 thus the cl and so4 2 rich brine could have a considerable potential in producing coagulants flocculants with al3 and fe3 from was incinerated ash which has been preliminarily testified in our recent work hao et al 2022a in principles a small stock of cations or anions should be transported to a large stock of anions or cations for producing coagulants flocculants like aluminum chloride alcl3 ferric chloride fecl3 poly aluminum chloride pac hao et al 2022a poly ferric chloride pfc poly ferric sulfate spfs poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc and polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate pafs with this study phosphate from was incinerated ash was recovered as a main product and both fe and al were removed to purify phosphate and then utilized to produce two coagulants as by products as shown in fig 1 there were three steps in the study i to remove fe3 and produce fecl3 based coagulant with the brine ii to recover phosphate in the form of ca p iii to remove al3 and produce pac coagulant with the brine 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of was incinerated ash and desalinated brine was incinerated ash was prepared by incinerating actual was from a wwtp in beijing for 6 h in a lab scale muffle furnace 850 c followed by drying at 105 c for 12 h then was incinerated ash was naturally cooled down in the furnace and ground in a mortar down to 500 Î¼m in particle size desalinated brine was prepared by evaporating seawater with 50 water content evaporated acid leaching of was incinerated ash was carried out in a batch mode with magnetic stirrers on the bottoms of beakers 500 ml at room temperature then mixed liquor leachate in beakers was separated by 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane to determine the concentrations of p and metals like al3 fe3 ca2 mg2 etc 2 2 phosphate recovery as a ca p product after extracting fe3 the raffinate were adjusted with 1 0 mol l naoh up to ph 3 4 to separate heavy metals poor phosphate in the form of al p an intermediate when al p was dissolved again in an alkaline solution up to ph 13 a part of high valent metals was generally insoluble in the alkaline solution petzet et al 2012 as a result dissolved po4 3 was precipitated with a low valent metal forming a ca p compound in the experiments cacl2 solution was added as a calcium source and the optimal molar ratio of ca to p was 1 5 petzet et al 2011 finally al3 remained in the relatively pure alkaline solution which could be utilized as a raw element to produce the second pac based coagulant with the brine 2 3 fe stripping to produce fecl3 based coagulant fe3 stripping from acidic leachate for extraction was conducted by an organic solvent tbp 99 all other reagents were of analytical grade extraction experiments were performed also in beakers 500 ml with magnetically stirring at 400 rpm for 15 min 25 c then mixed solution was transferred into a separatory funnel allowing to stand for 30 min until an oil water interface became clear finally the lower part raffinate was drawn off from the funnel bottom and the upper part organic solution was remained for fe3 stripping the concentrations of metals without fe and po4 3 in the raffinate were respectively detected and the concentration of fe in the organic solution could be calculated by a mass balance based on the original fe concentration in the leachate fe3 in the organic solution could be stripped by either hcl 0 1 0 5 or the brine 0 3 0 8 mol cl l in beakers as conducted above 400 rpm for 2 15 min at 25 50 c the lower part in the separatory funnel was mainly fecl3 solution to be used as a coagulant the performances of fecl3 based coagulants fecl3 s1 hcl stripping and fecl3 s2 brine stripping could be compared with a commercial fecl3 based coagulant fecl3 c and also another pac based coagulant to be produced with al3 associated with the brine based on both p removal and turbidity removal 2 4 production of the pac based coagulant with al3 associated with the brine in the experiments the brine was directly added to the remaining al3 solution as mentioned above polymerization of the pac based coagulant was tested under different working conditions after the polymerization was completed the solution stood for aging in a constant temperature oven 70 c and then the liquid pac based coagulant was obtained the liquid pac based coagulant could be concentrated and dried to form a solid pac based coagulant for the characterization by infrared spectroscopy the performance of the liquid pac based coagulant pac s was compared with a commercial pac based pac c al2o3 wt 27 0 basicity 45 96 on both p removal and turbidity removal based on the same al2o3 concentration the liquid pac based coagulant could be also compared with the fecl3 based coagulant synthetized in the first step 2 5 comparison of coagulation performance wastewater containing p was prepared with pure water as solute po4 3 5 mg p l ph 7 0 7 5 effluent having turbidity was simulated with a kaolin solution 10 g of kaolin in 1 l pure water by ultrasonic dispersion for 2 h vigorously magnetic mixing for 6 h and sedimentation for 1 h 800 ml then the supernatant of the kaolin solution was diluted to 30 ntu the coagulation experiments were conducted at 1 0 l water sample with t 25 c and ph 8 0 stirred at 500 r min for 30 s and stirred at 100 r min for 15 min finally the stirred solution was settled for 30 min and the turbidity of the supernatant was measured 2 6 analytical methods po4 3 and metals were measured by a spectrophotometer cary 5000 agilent co ltd and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap 7000 series thermo fisher co ltd respectively the recovered ca p product was dissolved by aqua regia and determined for the chemical composition via icp oes by mass balance the mineral phases of the ca p were identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd dx 2700b dandonghaoyuan co ltd china at 30 kv and 40 ma using mo kÎ± radiation Î» 1 54056 Ã¥ with 2Î¸ ranging between 5 and 90 at a scanning rate of 0 5 min the morphologies of the ca p were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi japan the p bioavailability was an important parameter of fertilizers which was checked by dissolving 1 g of the ca p precipitate in 100 ml of 2 citric acid and stirred for 30 min braithwaite et al 1989 kratz et al 2019 wang et al 2012 the content of al2o3 and the basicity on oh al ratio simplified as b value were the two main indicators to evaluate the quality of pac based products which were measured according to the chinese national standards of water treatment chemical poly aluminum chloride gb 22627 2014 2014 the chemical compositions of coagulant products were also determined via icp oes the chemical functional groups were analyzed and evaluated by a thermo fisher fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectra of the solid pac products were measured at the wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 with kbr pellets 100 mg kbr 1 mg sample spectrum pure the spectra of commercial fecl3 and pac were also recorded as the standards to estimate of the quantitative similarity of chemical functional groups between the commercial coagulants and the synthesized coagulants the mineral phases and morphologies coagulant products were also determined by xrd and sem respectively the concentrations of cl and so4 2 were measured by an automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer aq1 seal analytical germany the metal elements of the desalinated brine also were measured by the icp oes the turbidity of water samples before and after flocculation was measured by a turbidimeter 2100 n hach america 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphate recovery as a ca p product 3 1 1 chemical and mineral compositions of was incinerated ash as listed in table 1 macro elements in the ash were mainly al ca p fe and mg trace heavy metals were zn cu ni mn and pb and both cd and cr elements were not detected which is quite similar to literature liang et al 2019 the p element content in the ash was 10 1 wt 23 1 wt in p2o5 demonstrating that was incinerated ash would become a promising secondary phosphorus source meanwhile the contents of al and fe elements in the ash were 8 9 and 1 2 respectively which also reveals their value and potential on producing coagulants the sem images of the raw ash and leaching residue are shown in fig s1 particles of the ash were very rough and irregular with open pores fig s1a after leaching with hcl acid soluble compounds in the ash were leached out residual ash particles were broken to small granules still having porous morphology loosen structure and irregular surface fig s1b as described in literature li et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the xrd patterns and the main mineral phases of the raw ash and leaching residue are depicted in fig s1c after the acidic leaching the peak intensities of substances other than sio2 became weaker which corresponded to po4 3 al3 and fe3 obtained in the acidic leachate fig 2 a reveals that the higher the acid concentration the more p al fe ca and mg extracted from the ash when the molarity of hcl reached to 0 50 mol l the leaching rate of phosphorus became faster up to 0 03 mol p l however a higher acid concentration is not expected due to increased costs luyckx et al 2020 the experimental results shown in fig 2b confirm that the higher amounts of p al and fe could be extracted by increasing the l s ratio due to an enhanced contacting efficiency this case was especially suitable for fe3 recovery and the leaching efficiency increased significantly with increasing the l s ratio from 11 1 to 90 1 the leaching efficiency of al3 also reached to a higher ratio 94 6 when the l s ratio was increased to 100 ml g as a result a compromise on both recovery efficiency and costs were made 0 5 m hcl and 100 ml g of the l s ratio were selected as the working conditions for subsequent leaching experiments 3 1 2 synthesis of ca p product as shown in fig 1 phosphate recovery from the ash consists of three main steps i acidic leaching of the ash ii extraction of fe3 iii precipitation and separation of al p and heavy metals based on three chemical equations petzet et al 2012 semerci

solvent extraction process fe3 was extracted from the acidic leachate and finally recovered in the form of fecl3 solution the molar ratio of al to p was 1 06 in the raffinate just enough to precipitate po4 3 with al to form an al p compound in addition the remaining heavy metals were removed in the step of generating al p precipitation based on the sephos process petzet et al 2011 finally phosphate was recovered by adding cacl2 ca p 1 5 to form an alkaline leachate to generate the precipitation of ca p furthermore the leachate residual solution â² was rich in al3 0 28 mol l which was used as an al source for synthesizing a pac based product in the next step overall approximately 88 0 wt of p in the ash was precipitated and hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh hap was identified as the main crystal phase in the ca p precipitation by xrd as depicted in fig s2a which is a more versatile phosphorus fertilizer than struvite the morphological image of the p product is presented in fig s2b indicating a relatively regular and smooth layered crystal structure based on the analysis on the chemical composition in fig 3 most of the common toxic heavy metals cd hg ni sn and mn in the p product were not detected the content of cu pb and zn was 13 2 11 3 and 35 5 mg kg respectively which were all below the limited values for fertilizer standards in most countries xu et al 2012 overall the recovered p compound had a high phosphorus content 37 1 wt in p2o5 and a good bioavailability 60 1 soluble phosphorus 3 2 production of fecl3 based coagulant 3 2 1 extraction of fe3 organic solvent extraction of fe3 from acidic leachate in hydrochloric acid medium by tbp includes the following steps i fe3 and cl diffuse from the main aqueous phase to the two phase interface respectively ii tbp molecule diffuses from the organic phase to the two phase interface iii a chemical reaction occurs at the interface to generate an extract that diffuses from the interface to the main body of the organic phase the liquid liquid extraction system is a complex extraction of neutral molecules composed of neutral organic phosphorus and high concentration hydrochloric acid the following two reaction eqs 4 and 5 represent the solvent extraction of fe3 from chloride solutions with tbp according to the different concentrations of h and cl yi et al 2020 4 fe3 a 3cl a mtbp o fecl3 mtbp o 5 fe3 a 4cl a h 2tbp o hfecl4 2tbp o the extraction efficiency e and distribution coefficient d are provided as eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 e v org c org v f c f 100 7 d c org c r where vorg and vf the volume of organic phase and feed solution corg or cr the concentration of metal in organic phase or raffinate when reaction reaches equilibrium cf the concentration of metal in feed solution in order to study the selectivity of tbp extractant of fe3 the extraction experiments were carried out using the acidic leachate under the optimal acid leaching conditions hcl 0 5 mol l l s 100 ml g t 25 1 c and t 6 h the content of mainly involved elements in both the acidic leachate and raffinate is shown in fig 4 a one contacting stage extraction shows that tbp has a high selectivity and a good extraction ability 88 3 for fe3 moreover it has no extraction ability on al3 ca2 and mg2 yi et al 2020 although a high concentration tbp might also extract phosphorus based on some other researches zhang et al 2020 the phenomenon did not happen in this study anyway it is necessary to have a reasonable tbp volume fraction during fe3 extraction to avoid the loss of po4 3 in addition such factors as acidity of feed solution cl concentration initial h3po4 concentration and even the ratio of po4 3 and fe3 might also affect the loss rate of po4 3 during the organic solvent extraction process of fe3 by tbp jin et al 2015 the extraction effect of fe3 under different ratios of organic phase to aqueous phase o a are shown in fig 4b when o a 1 0 moreover the third phase and emulsification are easy to appear which made it difficult to separate due to the low solubility of the generated complex in the organic phase zhang et al 2015 at o a 1 0 the third phase could be avoided but the extraction rate of fe3 is not improved too much zhang et al 2015 the distribution coefficient has reached to its maximum value 5 2 at o a 1 0 an even higher o a would result in a larger equipment volume and increased operation costs which is not conducive to the subsequent stripping and enrichment of fe3 for coagulant production as a whole the o a ratio was selected at 1 1 the extraction performance of different tbp concentrations in kerosene is shown in fig 4c the extraction performance of fe3 increased along with increased tbp volume fraction however when the tbp volume fraction ranged from 80 to 100 the distribution coefficient merely varied between 7 4 to 7 7 moreover the density and viscosity of the organic phase increased with increasing the tbp volume fraction which resulted in a decrease in surface tension and a slower rate of phase disengagement zhang et al 2015 thus the extractant consisting of 80 vol tbp and 20 vol kerosene was an effective mixed system for fe3 extraction from the acidic leachate the performance of tbp in kerosene is shown in fig 4d the extraction performance of fe3 increased with increased stages the two extraction stages could have recovered more than 97 of fe3 therefore it was no necessary to further increase the extraction stages 3 2 2 fecl3 stripping 3 2 2 1 chemical composition of desalinated brine as listed in table 2 the concentrations of cl and so4 2 in the brine were so high as up to 33 0 g l and 4 1 g l respectively demonstrating their applicability to be recycled as anions for producing coagulants besides some main cations in the brine can also be referred in table 2 3 2 2 2 fecl3 stripping with hcl and the brine extraction is to extract extractable substances into the organic phase while stripping is to strip extracted substances from the loaded organic phase in the simple stripping process the dilution effect of the stripping agent can reverse the extraction equilibrium and then the extraction reaction proceeds in the reverse direction so as to achieve the purpose of stripping based on the existing researches cohen and enfÃ¤lt 2018 hcl has been identified as being the most effective stripping agent for the fe3 loaded tbp azizitorghabeh et al 2017 saji and reddy 2001 similarly desalinated brine could be used as a novel stripping agent for fe3 stripping which was trialed in this study as a comparison with hcl among others the stripping efficiency s is presented in eq 8 v aq and c aq are respectively the volume and the metal concentration of stripping aqueous phase 8 s v aq c aq v org c org 100 in order to obtain the optimal stripping conditions o a temperature cl hcl concentration and time the experiments were carried out using the loaded organic phase under optimal the one stage extraction condition 80 tbp and o a 1 1 and the results were showed in fig 5 according to fig 5a o a suitable for fe3 stripping was determined at 2 1 with increasing o a from 1 0 to 5 0 the fe3 stripping efficiency tended to quickly take off and then slowly descend between o a 1 0 2 0 the stripping efficiency of hcl and the brine both increased from 79 6 to 91 1 and 71 4 to 87 5 respectively at o a 2 0 5 0 conversely the stripping efficiency significantly decreased even though fe3 was further concentrated in a word the brine had almost the same stripping efficiency as hcl which could be used as a stripping agent to produce fecl3 coagulant according to fig 5b clearly the stripping could be carried out at 25 c or room temperature for saving operation cost the two striping agents were endothermic and had the same temperature dependent trend however the stripping efficiency did not further increase after 35 40 c as the organic phase might volatilize at high temperature according to fig 5c the optimal concentrations of hcl and cl were determined at 0 3 and 0 5 mol l respectively with increasing the concentration of hcl or cl the two stripping agents had a similar tendence on slightly improving the stripping efficiency based on eqs 4 and 5 the dilution of the stripping agent can make the reaction proceed in the reverse direction while increasing the concentration of hcl or cl is not conductive to the reverse progress of the reaction the lower the acidity the easier the stripping if the acidity of the stripping solution is too low however it is easy to cause fe3 to be hydrolyzed in the stripping solution which would make the stripping solution turbid and difficult for phase separation zhang et al 2015 in order to avoid introducing excessive salt in fecl3 s2 the lower cl concentration should be used finally the proper time for stripping was set up at 15 min according to fig 5d because the stripping efficiency of hcl and the brine became almost same and maximum in 12 min 3 2 3 characteristics of fecl3 product according to the representative ir spectrum of tbp and fe3 loaded organic phase shown in fig s3a the peak around 1280 cm 1 was assigned to the p o bands which was highly affected when the organic phase interacted with fe3 the p o band stretching vibration at 1280 cm 1 in tbp was shifted to 1270 cm 1 this was because of the high affinity of oxygen of the p o ligands of both organic solvent molecules for fe3 p o fe3 and the addition of fecl4 complex ions to p atom restricting the p o vibration azizitorghabeh et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 according to fig s3b the solid fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 product should be an analog of fecl3 6h2o as shown in figs s3c e the morphological images the irregular surfaces of fecl3 c fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 were similar although the latter had a larger surface particle moreover the eds analysis in fig s3f on fecl3 s2 confirmed its chemical composition consisting of fe cl na mg k ca and o which could be speculated as fecl3 3 3 al recovered for pac based coagulant pac contains different amounts of hydroxyl and the empirical molecular formula is alm oh n h2o x cl3m n 0 n 3 m li et al 2010 the chemical reaction during the formation of pac is presented in eq 9 guo et al 2022 a gradually increasing ph can promote the hydrolysis of al3 when ph increases to a certain value bridging polymerization occurs between the two adjacent oh zhao et al 2009 2012 along with the polymerization progress the concentration of the hydrolyzate decreases thereby prompting the hydrolysis to proceed li et al 2010 tang et al 2015 during the polymerization reaction the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 are carried out alternately so that the reaction develops in the direction of forming a hydroxylated flocculant with a high al2o3 content a high b value and a high degree of polymerization by controlling the polymerization conditions well a pac solution with the qualified al2o3 content and b value could be obtained the leachate residual solution â² was used as the al3 source for pac based production and the anion of cl from the brine was added at a molar ratio of al cl at 1 3 and then the mixed solution was used to explore the optimal conditions for the polymerization including ph temperature and time 9 2 alc l 3 nnaoh Î´ a l 2 oh n c l 6 n nnacl 3 3 1 synthesis of pac based coagulant the polymerization ph of the mixed solution containing al3 from the ash and cl from the brine was a key factor to synthesize pac based coagulant at the polymerization temperature t of 70 c and the polymerization time t for 2 h the relationship of the polymerization ph and the pac content calculated by al2o3 w w as well as the b value of pac based coagulant were investigated as shown in fig 6 a at ph 3 0 there were too many free acids in the mixed solution which would inhibit the hydrolysis of hydrated aluminum ions and then the degree of polymerization and the b value was too low which could ultimately affect the coagulation effect of pac based coagulant at ph 3 the aluminum hydroxide colloid was easily generated in the mixed solution and pac based coagulant was difficult to exist stably resulting in a rapid decrease in the content of al2o3 clearly ph was significantly related to the degree of hydrolysis of al3 in the mixed solution and ph 3 0 should be appropriate for subsequent experiments the polymerization temperature also has an important influence on the formation of pac at ph 3 0 and t 2 h the results of temperature dependent polymerization are shown in fig 6b at t 70 c both al2o3 content and b value reached up to their maximal data at 3 7 and 69 4 respectively when t 70 c the reaction was not sufficient and the time to form the polymer had to be long resulting in a long reaction and a low degree of polymerization however the hydrolysis process of al3 is an endothermic process as a result a higher than 70 c would cause the structure and stability of the polymerized state destroyed resulting in the decomposition of a part of the polymer and the formation of al oh 3 precipitation for this reason 70 c was fixed for subsequent experiments at ph 3 0 and t 70 c the results of the polymerization time vs both al2o3 content and b value are shown in fig 6c there was the best polymerization time for the b value and also the al2o3 content at t 2 h as a result the optimal reaction conditions of the polymerization of pac based coagulant could be determined at ph 3 0 t 70 c and t 2 h 3 3 2 characteristics of pac based coagulant the commercial pac pac c was used as a counterpart to compare the characteristics of pac s the ft ir spectrum fig 7 a in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 reveals that two main absorption peaks were quite similar to each other among them the absorption peaks at 1093 and 1100 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peaks of al oh al indicating an aggregation state guo et al 2022 moreover the absorption peaks near 870 cm 1 were the in plane flexural vibration peak of al oh al which reflects the bonding between aluminum atoms through oxygen bridges in the process of reconversion of aluminum chloride to pac tzoupanos et al 2009 finally the strong absorption peaks at 700 400 cm 1 were the overall flexural vibration absorption peak of al oh superimposed on the absorption peaks of water molecules which also indicates that the pac s molecules contained hydroxyl and polymeric aluminum tzoupanos and zouboulis 2011 therefore the synthesized compound could be confirmed to be a pac based product based on fig 7b there was no diffraction peak of alcl3 in the xrd pattern of the pac s indicating that al3 cl and hydroxyl structure oh reacted to form an amorphous polymer compared with the powder diffraction file pdf card no 96 430 0181 the diffraction peaks at 31 6 and 45 5 were the characteristic peaks of sodium chloride tang et al 2015 the crystallinity of sodium chloride was good which masked the diffraction peaks of the amorphous polymer tzoupanos and zouboulis 2011 more sodium chloride was generated in pac s which was formed by the combination of na in naoh and cl in the brine in contrast the xrd pattern of pac c revealed an amorphous shape which was related to the fact that it is derived from a commercial synthetic process and contains less sodium chloride as shown in fig 7c the morphological image the surface of pac s was smooth with small wrinkles which was consistent with the results in the literature guo et al 2022 the chemical composition of the solid pac s and the solid pac c was listed in table s2 the impurity metal ions were mainly consisted of na and mg but the contents of them were at 6 0 which could cause little impact on wastewater treatment furthermore these impurities could be purified in a further study by extracting cl from the brine 3 4 coagulation performance 3 4 1 fecl3 based coagulant the coagulation performance of the synthesized fecl3 fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 was compared with a commercial fecl3 fecl3 c in p removal a and turbidity b removal as shown in fig 8 in the dosing rage of 10 50 mg l fe p 1 11 5 54 the p removal efficiency increased from 16 1 to 95 4 fecl3 c 15 2 to 93 0 fecl3 s1 and 14 1 to 88 1 fecl3 s2 respectively demonstrating the almost same p removal ability of fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 as fecl3 c fig 8a similarly the turbidity removal of fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 had also the same ability as fecl3 c fig 8b from 48 1 to 99 2 fecl3 c 39 2 to 97 3 fecl3 s1 and 35 6 to 96 0 fecl3 s2 respectively the experiments revealed that fecl3 s2 with the brine as the stripping agent could be used as a potential coagulant at least in wastewater treatment 3 4 2 pac based coagulant both pac c and pac s were added to the solutions with the same mass concentration to compare their performances in p removal fig 9 a and turbidity removal fig 9b at the same time fecl3 s2 in the same performances were also put in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 pac s had more or less the same trend and magnitude on two removal efficiencies as pac c in the dosage range of 10 35 mg l at 35 mg l al p 4 25 dosed the p concentration after removal could reach down to 0 2 mg p l from initial 5 mg p l and the turbidity after removal could be decreased to 0 46 ntu from initial 30 ntu moreover the concentration of tds even in the dosage concentration of 50 mg l pac s was also low 473 mg l much less than 1500 mg l limited for non drinking use in china by contrast fecl3 s2 behaved weak in the same performances which implies that fecl3 based coagulant seems unnecessary to be produced from the point of practical view moreover synthesized coagulants could completely save the costs of buying raw materials and disposing wasted metals and brine so the production cost of synthesized coagulants can be expected to be much lower than commercial coagulants under the same process of coagulant production transportation should keep equal 3 4 3 outlook and prospect the synergy of was incinerated ash and desalinated brine could both recover phosphate and produce coagulants flocculants towards the circular blue economy p recovery from wastewater sludge has become a global activity and consumption on coagulants for water wastewater treatment is becoming more and more especially in china the largest consumer of coagulants in the world in the future we also could use the new absorbent for directly recovering p from the acid leachate which could further reduce the cost of p recovery kajjumba et al 2021 yu et al 2021 moreover incineration will gradually become a main stream approach to handling waste activated sludge domestically and globally hao et al 2020b and thus the best stie of p recovery can be expected from was incinerated ash hao et al 2013 it can be imagined that both p recovery from the ash and synergized coagulant production with the brine would enlarge the market of both blue phosphate and green coagulants 4 conclusions with a synergic concept phosphate recovery from was incinerated ash and coagulant production associated with desalinated brine were trialed mainly related to p al and fe in the ash and cl and so4 2 in the brine after the experiments some main conclusions can be drawn below with acid hcl leaching and metals removing approximately 88 0 wt of phosphorus p in the ash could be recovered as hydroxylapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh fe3 in the acidic leachate could be selectively removed recovered by the organic solvent tbp extraction and fecl3 based coagulant could be obtained simply by stripping the raffinate with the original brine a liquid pac based coagulant could be synthesized with al3 removed from the ash and the original brine which has a comparable chemical structure and coagulation performance with a commercial pac the liquid pac based coagulant had almost the same performances on both phosphate and turbidity removals as a commercial coagulant however the synergized fecl3 based coagulant behaved weak in the same performances both p recovery from the ash and synergized coagulant production with the brine would enlarge the market of both blue phosphate and green coagulants declaration of competing interest the

15116,wet chemical approach is widely applied for phosphate recovery from incinerated ash of waste activated sludge was along with metals removed recovered the high contents of both aluminum al and iron fe in was incinerated ash should be suitable for producing coagulants with some waste anions like cl and so4 2 with acid hcl leaching and metals removing approximately 88 wt of phosphorus p in the ash could be recovered as hydroxylapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh fe3 in the acidic leachate could be selectively removed recovered by extraction with an organic solvent of tributyl phosphate tbp and thus a fecl3 based coagulant could be synthesized by stripping the raffinate with the original brine containing abundant cl and so4 2 furthermore a liquid poly aluminum chloride pac based coagulant could also be synthesized with al3 removed from the ash and the brine which behaved almost the same in the coagulation performance as a commercial coagulant on both phosphate and turbidity removals both p recovery from the ash and coagulant production associated with the brine would enlarge the markets of both blue phosphate and green coagulants keywords waste activated sludge was incineration ash

from wastes wastewater it has been practiced to recover phosphorus from wastewater and or waste activated sludge was jupp et al 2021 liu et al 2021 ma and rosen 2021 ranging from struvite hao et al 2013 to vivianite hao et al 2022b wijdeveld et al 2022 however the proper environments suitable for formation of both struvite and vivianite are relatively strict hao et al 2022b 2013 prot et al 2021 and moreover p recovery efficiencies of struvite and vivianite are not very high at 15 30 and 40 70 respectively chrispim et al 2019 van der kooij et al 2020 wijdeveld et al 2022 wilfert et al 2015 in another approach to p recovery was incinerated ash 5 10 p or 11 23 p2o5 have a high potential in the p recovery efficiency up to 90 fang et al 2020 jupp et al 2021 liu et al 2021 furthermore incineration has been identified as an ultimate approach to disposing was galey et al 2022 hao et al 2020a ma and rosen 2021 as a result p recovery from was incinerated ash would become a mainstream approach to handling was especially under the current condition that european counties generally emphasize to cover at 80 influent p load from wastewater treatment jupp et al 2021 liu and qu 2016 in practice p recovery techniques from was incinerated ash have become relatively mature among others wet chemical approaches seem the most sustainable methods fahimi et al 2021 followed by thermochemical methods fang et al 2020 galey et al 2022 liu et al 2021 however each of these techniques involves metal removing processes indeed was incinerated ash contains both heavy metals copper cu zinc zn lead pb chromium cr cadmium cd mercury hg and nickel ni and ordinary metals calcium ca magnesium mg aluminum al iron fe sodium na and potassium k boniardi et al 2021 geng et al 2020 particularly the contents of al and fe are so high as 6 18 8 and 2 4 14 5 wt respectively liang et al 2019 petzet et al 2012 smol et al 2020 which could be utilized to produce coagulants flocculants in wastewater treatment thus recycling al and fe seems necessary associated with p recovery towards a circular blue economy hao et al 2022a there are some limited studies on reusing al as a precipitant morf et al 2019 petzet et al 2012 2011 and clearly some in depth researches need to be carried out especially for reusing fe cohen and enfÃ¤lt 2018 different from al fe cannot be extracted by alkaline dissolution but it can be extracted by some organic solvents including tributyl phosphate tbp wei et al 2016 yi et al 2020 methyl isobutyl ketone mibk saji and reddy 2001 di 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid d2ehpa azizitorghabeh et al 2016 primary amine n1923 deep et al 2007 etc potential reuse of al and fe should orient towards producing coagulants flocculants under the circumstance available anions like cl and so4 2 would play an important role in reusing al and fe on the other hand seawater desalination swd has become a trend of acquiring freshwater along near coastal areas jones et al 2019 pistocchi et al 2020 the brine from desalination contains a high salt concentration containing such anions as cl and so4 2 up to 41 829 and 6050 mg l respectively ortiz albo et al 2019 both cl and so4 2 can be extracted from the brine by some methods including adsorption qi et al 2020 nanofiltration nf pÃ©rez gonzÃ¡lez et al 2015 and electrodialysis ed zhang et al 2009 thus the cl and so4 2 rich brine could have a considerable potential in producing coagulants flocculants with al3 and fe3 from was incinerated ash which has been preliminarily testified in our recent work hao et al 2022a in principles a small stock of cations or anions should be transported to a large stock of anions or cations for producing coagulants flocculants like aluminum chloride alcl3 ferric chloride fecl3 poly aluminum chloride pac hao et al 2022a poly ferric chloride pfc poly ferric sulfate spfs poly aluminum ferric chloride pafc and polymeric aluminum ferric sulfate pafs with this study phosphate from was incinerated ash was recovered as a main product and both fe and al were removed to purify phosphate and then utilized to produce two coagulants as by products as shown in fig 1 there were three steps in the study i to remove fe3 and produce fecl3 based coagulant with the brine ii to recover phosphate in the form of ca p iii to remove al3 and produce pac coagulant with the brine 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of was incinerated ash and desalinated brine was incinerated ash was prepared by incinerating actual was from a wwtp in beijing for 6 h in a lab scale muffle furnace 850 c followed by drying at 105 c for 12 h then was incinerated ash was naturally cooled down in the furnace and ground in a mortar down to 500 Î¼m in particle size desalinated brine was prepared by evaporating seawater with 50 water content evaporated acid leaching of was incinerated ash was carried out in a batch mode with magnetic stirrers on the bottoms of beakers 500 ml at room temperature then mixed liquor leachate in beakers was separated by 0 22 Î¼m filter membrane to determine the concentrations of p and metals like al3 fe3 ca2 mg2 etc 2 2 phosphate recovery as a ca p product after extracting fe3 the raffinate were adjusted with 1 0 mol l naoh up to ph 3 4 to separate heavy metals poor phosphate in the form of al p an intermediate when al p was dissolved again in an alkaline solution up to ph 13 a part of high valent metals was generally insoluble in the alkaline solution petzet et al 2012 as a result dissolved po4 3 was precipitated with a low valent metal forming a ca p compound in the experiments cacl2 solution was added as a calcium source and the optimal molar ratio of ca to p was 1 5 petzet et al 2011 finally al3 remained in the relatively pure alkaline solution which could be utilized as a raw element to produce the second pac based coagulant with the brine 2 3 fe stripping to produce fecl3 based coagulant fe3 stripping from acidic leachate for extraction was conducted by an organic solvent tbp 99 all other reagents were of analytical grade extraction experiments were performed also in beakers 500 ml with magnetically stirring at 400 rpm for 15 min 25 c then mixed solution was transferred into a separatory funnel allowing to stand for 30 min until an oil water interface became clear finally the lower part raffinate was drawn off from the funnel bottom and the upper part organic solution was remained for fe3 stripping the concentrations of metals without fe and po4 3 in the raffinate were respectively detected and the concentration of fe in the organic solution could be calculated by a mass balance based on the original fe concentration in the leachate fe3 in the organic solution could be stripped by either hcl 0 1 0 5 or the brine 0 3 0 8 mol cl l in beakers as conducted above 400 rpm for 2 15 min at 25 50 c the lower part in the separatory funnel was mainly fecl3 solution to be used as a coagulant the performances of fecl3 based coagulants fecl3 s1 hcl stripping and fecl3 s2 brine stripping could be compared with a commercial fecl3 based coagulant fecl3 c and also another pac based coagulant to be produced with al3 associated with the brine based on both p removal and turbidity removal 2 4 production of the pac based coagulant with al3 associated with the brine in the experiments the brine was directly added to the remaining al3 solution as mentioned above polymerization of the pac based coagulant was tested under different working conditions after the polymerization was completed the solution stood for aging in a constant temperature oven 70 c and then the liquid pac based coagulant was obtained the liquid pac based coagulant could be concentrated and dried to form a solid pac based coagulant for the characterization by infrared spectroscopy the performance of the liquid pac based coagulant pac s was compared with a commercial pac based pac c al2o3 wt 27 0 basicity 45 96 on both p removal and turbidity removal based on the same al2o3 concentration the liquid pac based coagulant could be also compared with the fecl3 based coagulant synthetized in the first step 2 5 comparison of coagulation performance wastewater containing p was prepared with pure water as solute po4 3 5 mg p l ph 7 0 7 5 effluent having turbidity was simulated with a kaolin solution 10 g of kaolin in 1 l pure water by ultrasonic dispersion for 2 h vigorously magnetic mixing for 6 h and sedimentation for 1 h 800 ml then the supernatant of the kaolin solution was diluted to 30 ntu the coagulation experiments were conducted at 1 0 l water sample with t 25 c and ph 8 0 stirred at 500 r min for 30 s and stirred at 100 r min for 15 min finally the stirred solution was settled for 30 min and the turbidity of the supernatant was measured 2 6 analytical methods po4 3 and metals were measured by a spectrophotometer cary 5000 agilent co ltd and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes icap 7000 series thermo fisher co ltd respectively the recovered ca p product was dissolved by aqua regia and determined for the chemical composition via icp oes by mass balance the mineral phases of the ca p were identified by an x ray diffractometer xrd dx 2700b dandonghaoyuan co ltd china at 30 kv and 40 ma using mo kÎ± radiation Î» 1 54056 Ã¥ with 2Î¸ ranging between 5 and 90 at a scanning rate of 0 5 min the morphologies of the ca p were characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem su8020 hitachi japan the p bioavailability was an important parameter of fertilizers which was checked by dissolving 1 g of the ca p precipitate in 100 ml of 2 citric acid and stirred for 30 min braithwaite et al 1989 kratz et al 2019 wang et al 2012 the content of al2o3 and the basicity on oh al ratio simplified as b value were the two main indicators to evaluate the quality of pac based products which were measured according to the chinese national standards of water treatment chemical poly aluminum chloride gb 22627 2014 2014 the chemical compositions of coagulant products were also determined via icp oes the chemical functional groups were analyzed and evaluated by a thermo fisher fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir spectra of the solid pac products were measured at the wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 with kbr pellets 100 mg kbr 1 mg sample spectrum pure the spectra of commercial fecl3 and pac were also recorded as the standards to estimate of the quantitative similarity of chemical functional groups between the commercial coagulants and the synthesized coagulants the mineral phases and morphologies coagulant products were also determined by xrd and sem respectively the concentrations of cl and so4 2 were measured by an automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer aq1 seal analytical germany the metal elements of the desalinated brine also were measured by the icp oes the turbidity of water samples before and after flocculation was measured by a turbidimeter 2100 n hach america 3 results and discussion 3 1 phosphate recovery as a ca p product 3 1 1 chemical and mineral compositions of was incinerated ash as listed in table 1 macro elements in the ash were mainly al ca p fe and mg trace heavy metals were zn cu ni mn and pb and both cd and cr elements were not detected which is quite similar to literature liang et al 2019 the p element content in the ash was 10 1 wt 23 1 wt in p2o5 demonstrating that was incinerated ash would become a promising secondary phosphorus source meanwhile the contents of al and fe elements in the ash were 8 9 and 1 2 respectively which also reveals their value and potential on producing coagulants the sem images of the raw ash and leaching residue are shown in fig s1 particles of the ash were very rough and irregular with open pores fig s1a after leaching with hcl acid soluble compounds in the ash were leached out residual ash particles were broken to small granules still having porous morphology loosen structure and irregular surface fig s1b as described in literature li et al 2017 liang et al 2019 the xrd patterns and the main mineral phases of the raw ash and leaching residue are depicted in fig s1c after the acidic leaching the peak intensities of substances other than sio2 became weaker which corresponded to po4 3 al3 and fe3 obtained in the acidic leachate fig 2 a reveals that the higher the acid concentration the more p al fe ca and mg extracted from the ash when the molarity of hcl reached to 0 50 mol l the leaching rate of phosphorus became faster up to 0 03 mol p l however a higher acid concentration is not expected due to increased costs luyckx et al 2020 the experimental results shown in fig 2b confirm that the higher amounts of p al and fe could be extracted by increasing the l s ratio due to an enhanced contacting efficiency this case was especially suitable for fe3 recovery and the leaching efficiency increased significantly with increasing the l s ratio from 11 1 to 90 1 the leaching efficiency of al3 also reached to a higher ratio 94 6 when the l s ratio was increased to 100 ml g as a result a compromise on both recovery efficiency and costs were made 0 5 m hcl and 100 ml g of the l s ratio were selected as the working conditions for subsequent leaching experiments 3 1 2 synthesis of ca p product as shown in fig 1 phosphate recovery from the ash consists of three main steps i acidic leaching of the ash ii extraction of fe3 iii precipitation and separation of al p and heavy metals based on three chemical equations petzet et al 2012 semerci et al 2020 1 al3 h3po4 3oh alpo4 3h2o 2 alpo4 4naoh 4na al oh 4 po4 3 3 3ca2 2po4 3 ca3 po4 2 the mass balances on p al fe and ca during the recovery process are shown in table s1 after the organic solvent extraction process fe3 was extracted from the acidic leachate and finally recovered in the form of fecl3 solution the molar ratio of al to p was 1 06 in the raffinate just enough to precipitate po4 3 with al to form an al p compound in addition the remaining heavy metals were removed in the step of generating al p precipitation based on the sephos process petzet et al 2011 finally phosphate was recovered by adding cacl2 ca p 1 5 to form an alkaline leachate to generate the precipitation of ca p furthermore the leachate residual solution â² was rich in al3 0 28 mol l which was used as an al source for synthesizing a pac based product in the next step overall approximately 88 0 wt of p in the ash was precipitated and hydroxylapatite ca5 po4 3oh hap was identified as the main crystal phase in the ca p precipitation by xrd as depicted in fig s2a which is a more versatile phosphorus fertilizer than struvite the morphological image of the p product is presented in fig s2b indicating a relatively regular and smooth layered crystal structure based on the analysis on the chemical composition in fig 3 most of the common toxic heavy metals cd hg ni sn and mn in the p product were not detected the content of cu pb and zn was 13 2 11 3 and 35 5 mg kg respectively which were all below the limited values for fertilizer standards in most countries xu et al 2012 overall the recovered p compound had a high phosphorus content 37 1 wt in p2o5 and a good bioavailability 60 1 soluble phosphorus 3 2 production of fecl3 based coagulant 3 2 1 extraction of fe3 organic solvent extraction of fe3 from acidic leachate in hydrochloric acid medium by tbp includes the following steps i fe3 and cl diffuse from the main aqueous phase to the two phase interface respectively ii tbp molecule diffuses from the organic phase to the two phase interface iii a chemical reaction occurs at the interface to generate an extract that diffuses from the interface to the main body of the organic phase the liquid liquid extraction system is a complex extraction of neutral molecules composed of neutral organic phosphorus and high concentration hydrochloric acid the following two reaction eqs 4 and 5 represent the solvent extraction of fe3 from chloride solutions with tbp according to the different concentrations of h and cl yi et al 2020 4 fe3 a 3cl a mtbp o fecl3 mtbp o 5 fe3 a 4cl a h 2tbp o hfecl4 2tbp o the extraction efficiency e and distribution coefficient d are provided as eqs 6 and 7 respectively 6 e v org c org v f c f 100 7 d c org c r where vorg and vf the volume of organic phase and feed solution corg or cr the concentration of metal in organic phase or raffinate when reaction reaches equilibrium cf the concentration of metal in feed solution in order to study the selectivity of tbp extractant of fe3 the extraction experiments were carried out using the acidic leachate under the optimal acid leaching conditions hcl 0 5 mol l l s 100 ml g t 25 1 c and t 6 h the content of mainly involved elements in both the acidic leachate and raffinate is shown in fig 4 a one contacting stage extraction shows that tbp has a high selectivity and a good extraction ability 88 3 for fe3 moreover it has no extraction ability on al3 ca2 and mg2 yi et al 2020 although a high concentration tbp might also extract phosphorus based on some other researches zhang et al 2020 the phenomenon did not happen in this study anyway it is necessary to have a reasonable tbp volume fraction during fe3 extraction to avoid the loss of po4 3 in addition such factors as acidity of feed solution cl concentration initial h3po4 concentration and even the ratio of po4 3 and fe3 might also affect the loss rate of po4 3 during the organic solvent extraction process of fe3 by tbp jin et al 2015 the extraction effect of fe3 under different ratios of organic phase to aqueous phase o a are shown in fig 4b when o a 1 0 moreover the third phase and emulsification are easy to appear which made it difficult to separate due to the low solubility of the generated complex in the organic phase zhang et al 2015 at o a 1 0 the third phase could be avoided but the extraction rate of fe3 is not improved too much zhang et al 2015 the distribution coefficient has reached to its maximum value 5 2 at o a 1 0 an even higher o a would result in a larger equipment volume and increased operation costs which is not conducive to the subsequent stripping and enrichment of fe3 for coagulant production as a whole the o a ratio was selected at 1 1 the extraction performance of different tbp concentrations in kerosene is shown in fig 4c the extraction performance of fe3 increased along with increased tbp volume fraction however when the tbp volume fraction ranged from 80 to 100 the distribution coefficient merely varied between 7 4 to 7 7 moreover the density and viscosity of the organic phase increased with increasing the tbp volume fraction which resulted in a decrease in surface tension and a slower rate of phase disengagement zhang et al 2015 thus the extractant consisting of 80 vol tbp and 20 vol kerosene was an effective mixed system for fe3 extraction from the acidic leachate the performance of tbp in kerosene is shown in fig 4d the extraction performance of fe3 increased with increased stages the two extraction stages could have recovered more than 97 of fe3 therefore it was no necessary to further increase the extraction stages 3 2 2 fecl3 stripping 3 2 2 1 chemical composition of desalinated brine as listed in table 2 the concentrations of cl and so4 2 in the brine were so high as up to 33 0 g l and 4 1 g l respectively demonstrating their applicability to be recycled as anions for producing coagulants besides some main cations in the brine can also be referred in table 2 3 2 2 2 fecl3 stripping with hcl and the brine extraction is to extract extractable substances into the organic phase while stripping is to strip extracted substances from the loaded organic phase in the simple stripping process the dilution effect of the stripping agent can reverse the extraction equilibrium and then the extraction reaction proceeds in the reverse direction so as to achieve the purpose of stripping based on the existing researches cohen and enfÃ¤lt 2018 hcl has been identified as being the most effective stripping agent for the fe3 loaded tbp azizitorghabeh et al 2017 saji and reddy 2001 similarly desalinated brine could be used as a novel stripping agent for fe3 stripping which was trialed in this study as a comparison with hcl among others the stripping efficiency s is presented in eq 8 v aq and c aq are respectively the volume and the metal concentration of stripping aqueous phase 8 s v aq c aq v org c org 100 in order to obtain the optimal stripping conditions o a temperature cl hcl concentration and time the experiments were carried out using the loaded organic phase under optimal the one stage extraction condition 80 tbp and o a 1 1 and the results were showed in fig 5 according to fig 5a o a suitable for fe3 stripping was determined at 2 1 with increasing o a from 1 0 to 5 0 the fe3 stripping efficiency tended to quickly take off and then slowly descend between o a 1 0 2 0 the stripping efficiency of hcl and the brine both increased from 79 6 to 91 1 and 71 4 to 87 5 respectively at o a 2 0 5 0 conversely the stripping efficiency significantly decreased even though fe3 was further concentrated in a word the brine had almost the same stripping efficiency as hcl which could be used as a stripping agent to produce fecl3 coagulant according to fig 5b clearly the stripping could be carried out at 25 c or room temperature for saving operation cost the two striping agents were endothermic and had the same temperature dependent trend however the stripping efficiency did not further increase after 35 40 c as the organic phase might volatilize at high temperature according to fig 5c the optimal concentrations of hcl and cl were determined at 0 3 and 0 5 mol l respectively with increasing the concentration of hcl or cl the two stripping agents had a similar tendence on slightly improving the stripping efficiency based on eqs 4 and 5 the dilution of the stripping agent can make the reaction proceed in the reverse direction while increasing the concentration of hcl or cl is not conductive to the reverse progress of the reaction the lower the acidity the easier the stripping if the acidity of the stripping solution is too low however it is easy to cause fe3 to be hydrolyzed in the stripping solution which would make the stripping solution turbid and difficult for phase separation zhang et al 2015 in order to avoid introducing excessive salt in fecl3 s2 the lower cl concentration should be used finally the proper time for stripping was set up at 15 min according to fig 5d because the stripping efficiency of hcl and the brine became almost same and maximum in 12 min 3 2 3 characteristics of fecl3 product according to the representative ir spectrum of tbp and fe3 loaded organic phase shown in fig s3a the peak around 1280 cm 1 was assigned to the p o bands which was highly affected when the organic phase interacted with fe3 the p o band stretching vibration at 1280 cm 1 in tbp was shifted to 1270 cm 1 this was because of the high affinity of oxygen of the p o ligands of both organic solvent molecules for fe3 p o fe3 and the addition of fecl4 complex ions to p atom restricting the p o vibration azizitorghabeh et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 according to fig s3b the solid fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 product should be an analog of fecl3 6h2o as shown in figs s3c e the morphological images the irregular surfaces of fecl3 c fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 were similar although the latter had a larger surface particle moreover the eds analysis in fig s3f on fecl3 s2 confirmed its chemical composition consisting of fe cl na mg k ca and o which could be speculated as fecl3 3 3 al recovered for pac based coagulant pac contains different amounts of hydroxyl and the empirical molecular formula is alm oh n h2o x cl3m n 0 n 3 m li et al 2010 the chemical reaction during the formation of pac is presented in eq 9 guo et al 2022 a gradually increasing ph can promote the hydrolysis of al3 when ph increases to a certain value bridging polymerization occurs between the two adjacent oh zhao et al 2009 2012 along with the polymerization progress the concentration of the hydrolyzate decreases thereby prompting the hydrolysis to proceed li et al 2010 tang et al 2015 during the polymerization reaction the hydrolysis and polymerization of al3 are carried out alternately so that the reaction develops in the direction of forming a hydroxylated flocculant with a high al2o3 content a high b value and a high degree of polymerization by controlling the polymerization conditions well a pac solution with the qualified al2o3 content and b value could be obtained the leachate residual solution â² was used as the al3 source for pac based production and the anion of cl from the brine was added at a molar ratio of al cl at 1 3 and then the mixed solution was used to explore the optimal conditions for the polymerization including ph temperature and time 9 2 alc l 3 nnaoh Î´ a l 2 oh n c l 6 n nnacl 3 3 1 synthesis of pac based coagulant the polymerization ph of the mixed solution containing al3 from the ash and cl from the brine was a key factor to synthesize pac based coagulant at the polymerization temperature t of 70 c and the polymerization time t for 2 h the relationship of the polymerization ph and the pac content calculated by al2o3 w w as well as the b value of pac based coagulant were investigated as shown in fig 6 a at ph 3 0 there were too many free acids in the mixed solution which would inhibit the hydrolysis of hydrated aluminum ions and then the degree of polymerization and the b value was too low which could ultimately affect the coagulation effect of pac based coagulant at ph 3 the aluminum hydroxide colloid was easily generated in the mixed solution and pac based coagulant was difficult to exist stably resulting in a rapid decrease in the content of al2o3 clearly ph was significantly related to the degree of hydrolysis of al3 in the mixed solution and ph 3 0 should be appropriate for subsequent experiments the polymerization temperature also has an important influence on the formation of pac at ph 3 0 and t 2 h the results of temperature dependent polymerization are shown in fig 6b at t 70 c both al2o3 content and b value reached up to their maximal data at 3 7 and 69 4 respectively when t 70 c the reaction was not sufficient and the time to form the polymer had to be long resulting in a long reaction and a low degree of polymerization however the hydrolysis process of al3 is an endothermic process as a result a higher than 70 c would cause the structure and stability of the polymerized state destroyed resulting in the decomposition of a part of the polymer and the formation of al oh 3 precipitation for this reason 70 c was fixed for subsequent experiments at ph 3 0 and t 70 c the results of the polymerization time vs both al2o3 content and b value are shown in fig 6c there was the best polymerization time for the b value and also the al2o3 content at t 2 h as a result the optimal reaction conditions of the polymerization of pac based coagulant could be determined at ph 3 0 t 70 c and t 2 h 3 3 2 characteristics of pac based coagulant the commercial pac pac c was used as a counterpart to compare the characteristics of pac s the ft ir spectrum fig 7 a in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 reveals that two main absorption peaks were quite similar to each other among them the absorption peaks at 1093 and 1100 cm 1 were the stretching vibration peaks of al oh al indicating an aggregation state guo et al 2022 moreover the absorption peaks near 870 cm 1 were the in plane flexural vibration peak of al oh al which reflects the bonding between aluminum atoms through oxygen bridges in the process of reconversion of aluminum chloride to pac tzoupanos et al 2009 finally the strong absorption peaks at 700 400 cm 1 were the overall flexural vibration absorption peak of al oh superimposed on the absorption peaks of water molecules which also indicates that the pac s molecules contained hydroxyl and polymeric aluminum tzoupanos and zouboulis 2011 therefore the synthesized compound could be confirmed to be a pac based product based on fig 7b there was no diffraction peak of alcl3 in the xrd pattern of the pac s indicating that al3 cl and hydroxyl structure oh reacted to form an amorphous polymer compared with the powder diffraction file pdf card no 96 430 0181 the diffraction peaks at 31 6 and 45 5 were the characteristic peaks of sodium chloride tang et al 2015 the crystallinity of sodium chloride was good which masked the diffraction peaks of the amorphous polymer tzoupanos and zouboulis 2011 more sodium chloride was generated in pac s which was formed by the combination of na in naoh and cl in the brine in contrast the xrd pattern of pac c revealed an amorphous shape which was related to the fact that it is derived from a commercial synthetic process and contains less sodium chloride as shown in fig 7c the morphological image the surface of pac s was smooth with small wrinkles which was consistent with the results in the literature guo et al 2022 the chemical composition of the solid pac s and the solid pac c was listed in table s2 the impurity metal ions were mainly consisted of na and mg but the contents of them were at 6 0 which could cause little impact on wastewater treatment furthermore these impurities could be purified in a further study by extracting cl from the brine 3 4 coagulation performance 3 4 1 fecl3 based coagulant the coagulation performance of the synthesized fecl3 fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 was compared with a commercial fecl3 fecl3 c in p removal a and turbidity b removal as shown in fig 8 in the dosing rage of 10 50 mg l fe p 1 11 5 54 the p removal efficiency increased from 16 1 to 95 4 fecl3 c 15 2 to 93 0 fecl3 s1 and 14 1 to 88 1 fecl3 s2 respectively demonstrating the almost same p removal ability of fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 as fecl3 c fig 8a similarly the turbidity removal of fecl3 s1 and fecl3 s2 had also the same ability as fecl3 c fig 8b from 48 1 to 99 2 fecl3 c 39 2 to 97 3 fecl3 s1 and 35 6 to 96 0 fecl3 s2 respectively the experiments revealed that fecl3 s2 with the brine as the stripping agent could be used as a potential coagulant at least in wastewater treatment 3 4 2 pac based coagulant both pac c and pac s were added to the solutions with the same mass concentration to compare their performances in p removal fig 9 a and turbidity removal fig 9b at the same time fecl3 s2 in the same performances were also put in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 pac s had more or less the same trend and magnitude on two removal efficiencies as pac c in the dosage range of 10 35 mg l at 35 mg l al p 4 25 dosed the p concentration after removal could reach down to 0 2 mg p l from initial 5 mg p l and the turbidity after removal could be decreased to 0 46 ntu from initial 30 ntu moreover the concentration of tds even in the dosage concentration of 50 mg l pac s was also low 473 mg l much less than 1500 mg l limited for non drinking use in china by contrast fecl3 s2 behaved weak in the same performances which implies that fecl3 based coagulant seems unnecessary to be produced from the point of practical view moreover synthesized coagulants could completely save the costs of buying raw materials and disposing wasted metals and brine so the production cost of synthesized coagulants can be expected to be much lower than commercial coagulants under the same process of coagulant production transportation should keep equal 3 4 3 outlook and prospect the synergy of was incinerated ash and desalinated brine could both recover phosphate and produce coagulants flocculants towards the circular blue economy p recovery from wastewater sludge has become a global activity and consumption on coagulants for water wastewater treatment is becoming more and more especially in china the largest consumer of coagulants in the world in the future we also could use the new absorbent for directly recovering p from the acid leachate which could further reduce the cost of p recovery kajjumba et al 2021 yu et al 2021 moreover incineration will gradually become a main stream approach to handling waste activated sludge domestically and globally hao et al 2020b and thus the best stie of p recovery can be expected from was incinerated ash hao et al 2013 it can be imagined that both p recovery from the ash and synergized coagulant production with the brine would enlarge the market of both blue phosphate and green coagulants 4 conclusions with a synergic concept phosphate recovery from was incinerated ash and coagulant production associated with desalinated brine were trialed mainly related to p al and fe in the ash and cl and so4 2 in the brine after the experiments some main conclusions can be drawn below with acid hcl leaching and metals removing approximately 88 0 wt of phosphorus p in the ash could be recovered as hydroxylapatite hap ca5 po4 3oh fe3 in the acidic leachate could be selectively removed recovered by the organic solvent tbp extraction and fecl3 based coagulant could be obtained simply by stripping the raffinate with the original brine a liquid pac based coagulant could be synthesized with al3 removed from the ash and the original brine which has a comparable chemical structure and coagulation performance with a commercial pac the liquid pac based coagulant had almost the same performances on both phosphate and turbidity removals as a commercial coagulant however the synergized fecl3 based coagulant behaved weak in the same performances both p recovery from the ash and synergized coagulant production with the brine would enlarge the market of both blue phosphate and green coagulants declaration of competing interest the

15117,although castellaniella species are crucial for denitrification there is no report on their capacity to carry out denitrification and anode respiration simultaneously in a bioelectrochemical system bes herein the ability of a mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella species to perform simultaneous denitrification and anode respiration coupled with cathodic metals recovery was investigated in a bes results showed that 500 mg l no3 n significantly decreased power generation whereas 100 and 250 mg l no3 n had a lesser impact the single chamber mfcs scmfcs fed with 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations achieved a removal efficiency higher than 90 in all cycles in contrast the removal efficiency in the scmfcs declined dramatically at 500 mg l no3 n which might be attributable to decreased microbial viability as revealed by sem and clsm eps protein content and enzymatic activities of the biofilms decreased significantly at this concentration cyclic voltammetry results revealed that the 500 mg l no3 n concentration decreased the redox activities of anodic biofilms while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the internal resistance of the scmfcs at this concentration increased significantly in addition bes inoculated with the castellaniella species was able to simultaneously perform heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery from real wastewater the bes attained cu2 hg2 pb2 and zn2 removal efficiencies of 99 86 0 10 99 98 0 014 99 98 0 01 and 99 17 0 30 respectively from the real wastewater cu2 was bio electrochemically reduced to cu0 and cu2o whereas hg0 and hgo constituted the hg species recovered via bioelectrochemical reduction and chemical deposition respectively furthermore pb2 and zn2 were bio electrochemically reduced to pb0 and zn0 respectively over 89 of no3 n was removed from the bes anolyte during the recovery of the metals this research reveals promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhanced power generation no3 n removal and heavy metals recovery in bes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords castellaniella species nitrate bioelectrochemical system denitrifying exoelectrogens metals recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge of excess nitrate nitrogen no3 n into aquatic environments has emerged as a global issue in recent years in most areas the no3 n concentration in wastewater from industries can reach 1000 mg l which is significantly greater than the recommended guideline value of 10 mg l for human consumption uzun and debik 2019 prolonged exposure to excessive no3 n has been linked to blue baby disease in newborns stomach cancer methemoglobinemia spontaneous abortion and thyroid disease gao et al 2020 thus no3 n removal is critical in wastewater treatment to prevent no3 n diffusion into the environment and reduce the health risk it poses to humans and animals in addition to no3 n heavy metals are among the most prevalent pollutants found in wastewater particularly in the industrial wastewater from smelting sites the industrial wastewater from pb zn smelting is highly acidic and contains a variety of toxic heavy metals such as zinc zn lead pb mercury hg copper cu and others these heavy metals in wastewater exist in various oxidative states with varying degrees of toxicity among them pb2 zn2 cu2 and hg2 are more mobile soluble and toxic than pb0 zn0 cu0 and hg0 respectively ribeiro et al 2019 the majority of these heavy metals can accumulate and concentrate in organisms via the food chain causing liver and kidney damage cancer respiratory problems etc kan et al 2021 therefore effective remediation techniques are needed to decrease heavy metals concentration in the environment numerous techniques for eliminating heavy metals and no3 n from untreated wastewater have been reported including ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane separation etc an et al 2022 however these techniques are costly produce secondary contaminants that necessitate additional treatment and sometimes focus on the removal of value added products rather than recovery crini and lichtfouse 2019 by contrast the bioelectrochemical system bes is gaining traction as a low cost and eco friendly approach for treating wastewater kumar et al 2019 this technology distinguishes itself from other methods in several ways including the absence of secondary pollution and its capacity to treat a wide range of waste with high efficiency yang et al 2019a furthermore it is a viable technique for recovering precious metals that can be utilized in the production of industrial products currently microbial electrolysis cells mecs and microbial fuel cells mfcs are two bes types that have received considerable attention mfcs are used to produce electrical energy and reduce high redox potential metals because their anode and cathode potentials are typically negative and positive respectively in contrast the mec reaction requires an external power source because this device s anode and cathode potential differences is extremely small to move electrons from the anode region to the cathodic compartment despite all the benefits of bes its use in treating no3 n contaminated wastewater is still limited to laboratory scale applications primarily because high no3 n conditions inhibit the growth and metabolism of most electroactive and denitrifying bacteria for instance when 100 mg l no3 n was introduced into the anodic compartment of an mfc the proportion of geobacter decreased from 72 8 to 29 4 jin et al 2019 similarly it was also discovered that the percentage of geobacter in single chamber mfcs scmfcs drastically decreased from 71 at 0 mg l no3 n to 8 09 at 800 mg l no3 n huang et al 2018 kashima and regan 2015 found that the current generation and anodic denitrification of a bes inoculated with geobacter metallireducens were severely hindered when the concentration of no3 n exceeded 10 0 mm fu et al 2013 reported that the inclusion of 20 mm nano3 into the anodic compartment of an mfc containing calditerrivibrio nitroreducens reduced power output to date several strategies for resolving this problem have been proposed including the inoculation of denitrifying exoelectrogens which are highly resistant to no3 n as well as the reduction of no3 n in the cathode chamber of bes it should be noted that most of these studies involving cathodic no3 n reduction employed solutions with no3 n without organic matter in the cathode compartments jiang et al 2017 the fact is that most domestic and industrial wastewaters contain high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and no3 n therefore the usage of denitrifying exoelectrogens which are efficient and highly resistant to no3 n is promising for practical application in wastewater treatment while the denitrification ability of exoelectrogens from the genera geobacter thiobacillus pseudomonas calditerrivibrio etc have been demonstrated in a bes no research has attempted to investigate the denitrification ability of exoelectrogens from the genus castellaniella in a bes castellaniella is a genus of gram negative microbes that are facultative anaerobes with short motile rods and a denitrifying metabolism kÃ¤mpfer et al 2006 some castellaniella species have been discovered to perform denitrification under high no3 n and low ph conditions and are mostly detected in no3 n contaminated environments pang and liu 2007 spain anne et al 2007 for example spain and krumholz 2012 reported that castellaniella str 4 5a2 could effectively grow in a medium comprising high no3 n concentration 100 mm at ph 5 0 and resulted in rapid denitrification with less accumulation of nitrite nitrogen no2 n in previous research deng et al 2021 revealed that castellaniella sp pyr2 obtained from sludge could simultaneously remove pyrene 97 2 and no3 n from coking wastewater these encouraging findings revealed that castellaniella has significant advantages in the field of microbial denitrification of highly contaminated no3 n wastewater however it is unknown whether castellaniella species can simultaneously perform denitrification and power generation in a bes since the above mentioned studies were not conducted in a bes owing to this we report for the first time the ability of mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella sp a3 castellaniella sp b3 and castellaniella sp a5 to perform simultaneous denitrification and anode respiration coupled with cathodic metal recovery in a bes specifically the impacts of varied no3 n concentrations on the performance of the mixed castellaniella species in the bes in terms of electricity generation no3 n removal rate n intermediates removal cod removal biofilm morphology cell viability extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and enzymatic activities were evaluated with acetate and lactate as substrates additionally electrochemical methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv were adopted to examine the influence of the various no3 n concentrations on the internal resistance and redox activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species the feasibility of simultaneously achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes containing the mixed castellaniella species was also investigated finally the heavy metals removal mechanisms were explored in detail in a nutshell this study provides promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhanced no3 n removal and heavy metals recovery from secondary effluent with superior performance and less accumulation of n intermediates 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactors configuration scmfcs were adopted to evaluate the mixed castellaniella species ability to perform heterotrophic anodic denitrification with electricity generation simultaneously the feasibility of achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes was evaluated using double chamber mfcs dcmfcs and double chamber mecs dcmecs the materials as well as the configuration of the scmfcs dcmfcs and dcmecs were identical to those used in our earlier research amanze et al 2022b text s1 provides a detailed description of the components and construction of the bes reactors 2 2 microbial source inoculation and operation the biocatalyst used in this work was a mixed inoculum of castellaniella sp a3 castellaniella sp a5 and castellaniella sp b3 which were originally isolated from the anodic biofilm of scmfcs in our previous study amanze et al 2022b the pure cultures were initially cultured in luria bertani broth at 37 c for 24 h on a rotary shaker 150 rpm afterward the cells were harvested via centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min and 25 c and mixed together in a ratio of 1 1 1 finally 20 of the mixed inoculum was subsequently transferred into each scmfc comprising 22 4 ml of nutrient medium the electroactive biofilms of the mixed castellaniella species were initially enriched with a nutrient medium containing substrate 100 Âµl l trace element solution 0 5 ml l wolfe s vitamins and 50 mm pbs 2 45 g l nah2po4 4 58 g l na2hpo4 0 13 g l kcl and 0 02 g l cacl2 acetate and lactate which represented unfermentable and fermentable electron donors respectively were utilized as substrates due to their efficacy in enriching electroactive biofilms and boosting bes power generation flayac et al 2018 the energy substrates were respectively dissolved in the nutrient medium to attain a final cod concentration of 800 mg l after the electroactive biofilms of the mixed castellaniella species were fully acclimated kno3 was introduced into the nutrient medium to achieve no3 n concentrations of 0 mg l control group 100 mg l 250 mg l and 500 mg l most wastewaters contain high cod and no3 n concentrations that occur concurrently and vary from 140 4 5750 100 mg l and 72 7 3610 mg l respectively duan et al 2019 gao et al 2022 logroÃ±o et al 2017 nayak and ghosh 2019 the influent cod and no3 n concentrations will be much higher when this wastewater is received by treatment facilities thus the cod and no3 n concentrations in this study were within the range reported in real wastewater the initial ph of the anolyte was 7 which conforms to the ph of most secondary effluents zhang et al 2016 the anolyte medium was sparged with nitrogen gas n2 to eliminate dissolved oxygen the scmfcs were then kept in an incubator at 30 c and fed batch operated to ascertain the effects of varied no3 n concentrations on electricity generation no3 n removal rate n intermediates removal cod removal biofilm morphology cell viability extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and enzymatic activities the anolyte medium in each reactor was refilled whenever the scmfcs output voltage decreased below 20 mv as described in our previous study amanze et al 2022a the dcmfcs cathode compartments were fed pb zn smelting wastewater collected from a smelting site in china the composition of the smelting effluent is shown in table s2 to eliminate dissolved oxygen the catholyte as well as the dcmfcs anolyte were subsequently sparged with n2 prior to the tests following cu2 and hg2 recovery the growth medium in each dcmfc s anode compartments was refilled and the external resistor 10 Ï was detached the pb2 and zn2 were recovered in the mec mode by applying a steady voltage of 1 0 v and 2 0 v respectively to the circuit of each dcmec using a dc power supply scmfcs dcmecs and dcmfcs devoid of the biofilm enrichment served as abiotic controls to avert contamination all laboratory experiments were conducted in a laminar flow hood 2 3 characterization of anodic biofilms scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6490lv jeol tokyo japan was utilized to assess the morphologies of the anodic biofilms the sem sample preparation procedures were identical to those employed in our prior work ai et al 2020 the cell viability of the anodic biofilms was ascertained using cslm tcs sp8 leica germany prior to clsm analysis the samples were prepared as aptly described in earlier research wen et al 2022 three dimensional clsm photographs of the biofilms were reconstructed and evaluated with zen blue edition carl zeiss the proportion of viable cells was computed and evaluated utilizing the comstat 2 1 software eps was subsequently extracted from the anodic biofilms using a previously described approach with some minor modifications wen et al 2022 a detailed description of the eps extraction process as well as analytical approaches for the different eps components are available in text s2 commercial kits solarbio beijing china were used to measure the enzymatic activities such as nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir the electron transport enzymes such as nadh intracellular and cytochrome c extracellular were extracted and quantified using a previously described method he et al 2021 2 4 analysis and calculations a data acquisition device adam 4017 analog input model advantech co ltd china directly connected to a digital computer was employed to monitor and record the voltage mv of the scmfcs every 50 s following the development of the anodic biofilms and stabilization of the scmfcs maximum voltage polarization as well as power density were assessed by varying the external resistor as described earlier zheng et al 2022 a previously documented approach was used to calculate coulombic efficiency ce logan et al 2006 to ascertain the electrochemical performance of the electroactive anodes eis and cv were conducted using a potentiostat gamry reference 600 workstation philadelphia pennsylvania usa the eis and cv laboratory experiments were performed with a three electrode setup with the cathode anode and saturated ag agcl serving as counter working and reference electrodes respectively the eis was measured with a 5 mv ac amplitude in the frequency range of 1000 khz to 0 01 hz and the obtained data were subsequently analyzed with zview software the cv tests were carried out at a scan rate of 5 mv s from 1 0 v to 1 0 v the concentrations of cod no3 n and no2 n were measured using a spectrophotometer approach huang et al 2018 the n2o concentrations were determined with gas chromatography on a gc 2014 system shimadzu co ltd japan and the values were subsequently converted into mass the concentrations of cu2 pb2 and zn2 in the catholyte of the dcmfcs were measured using an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer model spectroblue fms386 ametek materials analysis division kleve germany an atomic fluorescence spectrometer afs 820 from jitian instrument co ltd beijing china was used to measure the concentration of hg2 the kinetics of the heavy metals removal were regressed by employing the first order equation as described in text s3 energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edxs elect super edax ametek kleve germany connected to sem x ray powder diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker corporation germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific waltham ma usa were used to attain in depth information regarding the morphologies as well as the elemental composition of the carbon cloths cathodes following the actual pb zn wastewater treatment all laboratory experiments were performed in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the castellaniella species under different nitrate concentrations scmfcs were operated with acetate and lactate as substrates under varied no3 n concentrations i e 0 100 250 and 500 mg l in order to ascertain the impact of no3 n on the performance of the castellaniella species in terms of power generation and cod and no3 n removal efficiencies the voltages in each cycle rapidly rise to a maximum value after refilling the nutrient solution in the anodic compartments then progressively decline owing to substrate exhaustion fig 1 a and b this immediate rise in voltages after substrate replenishment in each batch was attributed to castellaniella species cells adhered to the brush anodes instead of planktonic microorganisms otherwise the elimination of free floating castellaniella cells due to anolyte replacement ought to have reduced output voltage the acetate fed scmfcs had maximum output voltages of 510 mv 502 mv 484 mv and 240 mv when fed with 0 100 250 and 500 mg l no3 n respectively fig 1a meanwhile maximum output voltages of 509 mv 462 mv 367 mv and 264 mv were achieved by lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1b the results presented above indicate that 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations did not significantly affect the electricity generation of scmfcs inoculated with castellaniella species however the output voltage declined substantially in scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicating that this concentration was detrimental to the anodic biofilms of castellaniella species it should be mentioned that at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l acetate fed scmfcs outperformed lactate fed scmfcs signifying that the castellaniella species effectively utilize the acetate to generate much more electrons for electricity production in the scmfcs the voltages were produced from the substrate oxidation by the matured electroactive anodic biofilms wang et al 2022 in the case of scmfcs fed 100 and 250 mg l the no3 n might affect just a portion of mature electroactive biofilm which was insufficient to influence the current generation while in the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs a greater proportion of the biofilm may have been affected leading to a substantial decrease in output voltages the maximum power densities of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 315 34 16 14 282 16 9 85 277 08 6 23 and 112 13 1 14 mw m2 while their corresponding average current densities were 4 34 0 12 3 61 0 10 3 53 0 11 and 1 71 0 10 a m2 respectively fig 1c for the lactate fed scmfcs maximum power densities of 275 74 6 15 242 44 9 49 134 69 1 03 and 113 51 5 40 mw m2 and corresponding current densities of 3 50 0 13 2 64 0 05 2 28 0 14 and 1 86 0 13 a m2 were attained at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1d despite the fact that the maximum current density of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentration of 100 mg l was approximately 1 20 fold lesser than that of no3 n free scmfcs there was only a marginal decline in current generation from 3 61 0 10 to 3 53 0 11 a m2 for no3 n concentrations ranging from 100 to 250 mg l suggesting that no3 n concentrations less than 500 mg l had little impact on anodic electroactive biofilms from the above findings it also appears that the current and power densities produced decrease with increasing substrate carbon content this could be explained by the fact that the type of metabolic reactions occurring in the scmfcs is determined by the nature of the substrate acetate fed scmfcs achieved the best performance which could be attributed to the fact that acetate is a simple molecule with two carbons and can easily be oxidized by exoelectrogens d angelo et al 2017 similarly the output voltages of the acetate fed scmfcs at varying external resistors were quite similar at 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations suggesting that these concentrations had less impact on the power generation the electrode potential of the scmfcs was examined to determine the impact of the various no3 n concentrations on electrode performance fig 1e and f the cathode potential curves converged while the anode potential curves exhibited discernible differences thus the disparities between the scmfcs electricity production were primarily attributable to differences in anode electrochemical activity at the end of each cycle the cod removal efficiency of each scmfc was determined fig 2 a the average cod removal efficiencies of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 94 16 2 59 91 52 1 83 88 47 3 95 and 53 61 2 40 respectively however lactate fed scmfcs obtained average cod removal efficiencies of 89 11 1 06 83 86 1 06 72 1 77 and 62 76 1 47 at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively the observed cod removal efficiencies correlated with the activities of the electroactive biofilms which no3 n is likely to affect with an increment in no3 n concentration from 100 to 250 mg l for acetate and lactate fed scmfcs the cod removal efficiency of the scmfcs decreased slightly nonetheless 500 mg l no3 n significantly inhibited acetate and lactate oxidation implying that anodic biofilm activities were impeded and its acetate lactate metabolic process was greatly affected this phenomenon is in line with an earlier study that reported that 500 mg l no3 n could impede substrate utilization of anodic biofilms in mfcs huang et al 2018 compared with the lactate fed scmfcs the acetate fed scmfcs achieved higher cod removal efficiencies at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations indicating that acetate promoted the activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species resulting in extensive consumption of substrate to further evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the scmfcs the ce which denotes the percentage of electrons successfully recovered as electrical current from substrate oxidation was calculated as shown in fig 2b the ce of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 30 54 2 76 28 48 2 04 26 97 1 94 and 11 42 1 63 respectively for lactate fed scmfcs ce of 26 79 1 58 24 20 3 43 22 92 2 90 and 11 04 0 11 were attained at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively the higher ce of scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n indicated that more substrates were utilized by microbial metabolism associated with extracellular electron transfer eet in contrast scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n had the least ce suggesting that this no3 n concentration impeded biofilm activity which subsequently retarded the conversion of substrates to electricity moreover the duration of the voltage of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs significantly shortened at no3 n concentration of 500 mg l resulting in a substantial reduction in ce thus the decline in ce of scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicates that this concentration primarily affected mfc anode performance by inhibiting biofilms via toxicity in comparison to lactate the acetate fed scmfcs exhibited higher ce at the various no3 n concentrations indicating that the acetate enhanced the scmfcs electrogenic performance acetate has been reported in the literature to have the ability to directly stimulate microbes which results in superior electricity production yan and wang 2019 it is worth noting that the scmfcs fed without no3 n had higher ce than the reactors fed with no3 n implying that some electrons were consumed for denitrification leading to a drop in ce sukkasem et al 2008 the no3 n removal reflects the performance of the scmfcs as well as the viability of electroactive biofilms attached to the anode consequently the effluent no3 n concentration as well as the no3 n removal efficiency were monitored at the end of each cycle the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 achieved removal efficiencies of 97 43 1 06 97 13 0 67 and 60 99 1 24 respectively with effluent no3 n concentrations of 1 28 0 53 7 18 1 68 and 195 02 21 22 mg l in the first cycle respectively fig 3 a for lactate fed scmfc removal efficiencies of 94 42 1 06 92 68 1 0 and 73 73 1 24 were obtained at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively with effluent no3 n concentrations of 5 91 2 18 18 29 2 52 and 131 37 6 20 mg l in the first cycle respectively fig 3b the no3 n removal efficiency was still greater than 90 in the second third and fourth cycles for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 mg l however it dropped significantly to 52 16 5 34 and 64 66 2 04 in the second cycle and further decreased to 46 31 3 80 and 44 36 2 039 in the third cycle and finally to 35 35 5 58 and 36 70 1 15 in the fourth cycle for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs respectively at 500 mg l no3 n suggesting that this concentration inhibited the activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species it is likely that the population of the castellaniella species was relatively high in the initial stage first cycle at 500 mg l no3 n resulting in a removal efficiency of over 60 however the removal efficiency of the system decreased in subsequent cycles indicating that the microbes activities were gradually inhibited with time it should be mentioned that no2 n accumulated significantly in the various cycles for the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n fig 3c and d however the no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations were lower than the world health organization s maximum allowable level of 3 mg l in drinking water xu et al 2020 the accumulation of no2 n in the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n might be ascribed to the fact that this concentration drastically decreased the cod no3 n ratio thereby reducing the substrate required for the growth and denitrification process of the castellaniella species karanasios et al 2016 the inhibition caused by no3 n was not solely attributable to no3 n but also due to the reduced intermediates e g no2 n produced during denitrification banihani et al 2009 table s3 shows the intermediates produced during the denitrification process in each cycle bubbles were observed on the surface of the scmfcs anolytes but not in the control groups indicating that denitrification occurred in the system compared with acetate fed scmfcs no3 n removal efficiencies in lactate fed scmfcs were lower in all cycles at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 indicating that acetate was the best carbon source for castellaniella species to efficiently remove no3 n acetate is an organic acid that is commonly utilized as an electron donor by heterotrophic no3 n reducers in the reaction acetate is first converted into acetyl coa and then denitrifying bacteria can use acetyl coa directly by entering the tca cycle pang and wang 2021 the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent ph values of 6 06 0 24 6 56 0 32 7 08 0 04 and 6 78 0 46 respectively in the first cycle in the second cycle the effluent ph values were 6 41 0 37 6 77 0 55 7 11 0 19 and 7 05 0 62 respectively additionally the effluents of these reactors had ph values of 6 27 0 54 7 12 0 29 6 84 0 40 and 6 99 0 46 in the third cycle and 6 70 0 40 6 25 0 16 7 18 0 26 and 6 45 0 47 in the fourth cycle respectively similar ph trends were observed in effluent from lactate fed scmfcs overall most of the effluent ph values of the no3 n fed scmfcs were in the range of 6 5 7 2 indicating that denitrification played a significant role in maintaining ph balance fig 3e and f apparently the protons produced by substrate oxidation may have been utilized for no3 n reduction thus coupling anode respiration and denitrification could be an effective approach to control bes anolyte ph ren et al 2020 to better comprehend the no3 n removal process in the scmfcs no3 n concentrations were monitored as a function of time during a typical cycle with open circuit scmfcs serving as the control group the voltage of the lactate fed scmfc with 500 mg l no3 n concentration was first to decrease below the predefined voltage 20 mv for anolyte medium replenishment at 48 h as a result 48 h was chosen as the endpoint for comparing the no3 n removal process in the typical cycle the acetate fed scmfcs with no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent no3 n concentrations of 1 08 0 15 7 49 2 76 and 255 11 23 75 mg l with removal efficiencies of 98 92 0 16 97 1 10 and 48 98 4 75 respectively fig 4 a in addition the lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent no3 n concentrations of 4 85 2 74 22 49 4 31 and 253 83 27 61 mg l with removal efficiencies of 95 16 2 74 90 47 1 52 and 49 23 5 52 respectively at the end of the typical cycle fig 4b furthermore effluent no3 n concentrations in acetate fed reactors with no current flow control group were 7 41 0 60 17 49 1 34 and 315 11 38 067 mg l with mean no3 n removal efficiencies of 92 59 0 60 92 88 0 44 and 36 98 7 62 respectively fig s1a meanwhile lactate fed reactors with no current flow obtained mean no3 n removal efficiencies of 86 70 1 74 88 66 3 39 and 58 49 6 47 with effluent no3 n concentrations of 13 30 1 74 28 36 8 47 and 207 53 32 35 mg l respectively fig s1b from the above results it is obvious that 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs had the lowest performance further confirming that this concentration was deleterious to castellaniella species cells in addition to electrochemical reduction conventional heterotrophic denitrification might have accelerated no3 n removal since the no3 n removal efficiencies of the reactors with current were not significantly higher than the control reactors without current flow therefore it is possible to conclude that electrochemical no3 n reduction and heterotrophic denitrification coexisted in the scmfcs heterotrophic denitrification occurs when the carbon source is adequate for the majority of heterotrophic denitrifiers an organic carbon source is needed for cell growth and no3 n reduction lee and rittmann 2003 if the carbon source is inadequate autotrophic denitrification predominates over heterotrophic denitrification in electrochemical no3 n reduction exoelectrogens oxidize substrates to generate extracellular electrons which are subsequently transferred from the device s anode to its cathode via the external circuit on the cathode the no3 n accepts electrons and is reduced to nitrogen gas n2 or no2 n as an intermediate to n2 gas i e denitrification process eqs 1 3 liu and wu 2021 of note members of the genera castellaniella possess the four functional genes napa nirk narg and nosz that encode nr nir nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase which work together to complete the denitrification process ma et al 2022 besides several studies have also reported the participation of castellaniella species in the denitrification process deng et al 2021 pang and liu 2007 therefore the mixed castellaniella species were involved in the reduction of the no3 n to n2 the no2 n concentrations were low throughout the test cycle for the scmfcs fed with 100 and 250 mg l no3 n fig 4c and d in contrast significant no2 n accumulation was observed for the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n furthermore cod degradation efficiency was investigated over the typical cycle for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at the various no3 n concentrations fig 4e and f maximum cod removal efficiencies of 95 92 0 60 92 22 2 89 90 83 0 11 and 54 50 6 26 were obtained by the acetate fed scmfcs which were higher than the 90 38 2 52 85 58 2 82 71 94 2 07 and 57 16 1 74 obtained by the lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively over the 48 h the enhanced cod removal efficiency at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 was primarily ascribed to heterotrophic anodic denitrification it is imperative to note that the power generation and no3 n removal efficiency obtained by these mixed castellaniella species in the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 mg l were significantly greater than those of most existing inoculums table s4 further confirming that these castellaniella species are promising exoelectrogens for achieving simultaneous denitrification and anodic respiration 1 2 n o 3 6 h 5 e 0 5 n 2 3 h 2 o 2 no 3 2 h 2 e n o 2 h 2 o 3 no 2 3 h 3 e 0 5 n 2 o h h 2 o 3 2 morphological electrochemical eps components and enzymatic activities analyses of anodic biofilms sem was employed to analyze the morphology of the castellaniella species biofilm in the reactors as shown in fig 5 a f the castellaniella species were densely attached to the anode electrode of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l contrarily they were sparse and loose on the anode electrode of the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs fig 5g and h indicating that this concentration had a detrimental impact on the enrichment and proliferation of the castellaniella species the viability of the biofilms adhered to the electrode surface was evaluated using clsm fig 6 as depicted in fig 6a f a greater number of live castellaniella cells green were attached to the electrode of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l conversely biofilm viability was considerably reduced in 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs fig 6g and h to ascertain the proportion of dead red and living cells the ratio of green fluorescence to the sum total of red and green fluorescence was used to calculate the percentage of viable cells in the anodic biofilms the viability values of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l were 86 31 3 19 84 42 0 98 and 82 68 4 29 respectively fig 7 a for lactate fed scmfcs viability values of 82 98 5 47 78 08 5 29 and 59 77 4 25 were obtained at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations respectively fig 7b conversely acetate and lactate fed scmfcs had viability values of 43 68 4 41 and 45 79 2 72 respectively at 500 mg l no3 n these results indicate that 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations had less impact on the castellaniella species while 500 mg l no3 n was detrimental to the cells which is consistent with the sem results high no3 n concentrations and their intermediates are more detrimental to microbial activities because they disrupt bacterial development and cause cell malfunction zhang et al 2022 the existence of more dead cells could prevent viable cells from contacting the anode electrode thereby impeding the flow of electrons between the viable cells and the brush anodes causing a decline in ce sun et al 2015 it should be pointed out that at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l the cell viability of the acetate fed scmfcs was higher than that of the lactate fed anodes further confirming that acetate was the best substrate for castellaniella species the electrochemical behavior of the scmfcs comprising the varied no3 n concentrations were estimated with cv at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations oxidation peaks were detected at 0 18 v 44 91 ma 0 08 v 25 25 ma and 0 31 v 20 18 ma and reduction peaks were detected at 0 32 v 17 34 ma 0 68 v 27 25 ma and 0 57 v 2 48 ma for acetate fed scmfcs fig 2c in contrast neither oxidation nor reduction peaks were present in the cv curve of the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfc the presence of both oxidation and reduction peaks in scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n corresponds to a higher level of redox active proteins and electrochemical activity meanwhile the absence of both oxidation and reduction peaks in 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs corresponds to a decrease in redox activity similarly lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l had higher oxidation peak currents of 13 53 ma 11 73 ma and 9 56 ma respectively than that fed with 500 mg l no3 n 9 1 ma fig 2d the presence of 500 mg l no3 n obviously diminished the population of the castellaniella species which in turn reduced the biofilm s redox protein content thereby hindering electron transfer between the cells of the bacteria and anode electrodes it should be emphasized that several redox proteins found in the outer membranes of most electricigens play a crucial role in the transport of electrons from bacteria cells to electrodes which subsequently results in the emergence of oxidation and reduction peaks amanze et al 2022a nevertheless a decline in the microbial activities of the biofilms caused by this no3 n concentration 500 mg l could have impeded the functions of the redox proteins thus hindering the emergence of the oxidation and reduction peaks the peak currents of the acetate fed scmfcs at various no3 n concentrations were clearly higher than those of the lactate fed scmfcs which corresponds to the output voltage results the abiotic scmfcs were also studied to verify the involvement of the microbes in eet it was discovered that virtually no current was produced in these systems confirming that castellaniella species were accountable for power generation in all reactors the total internal resistance of the scmfcs was assessed with eis to gain further insight into the impact of the various no3 n concentrations on their performance the electron transport status of electroactive biofilm can be estimated using eis chen et al 2021 the impedance spectrum attained from each eis test was fitted to an equivalent circuit and the obtained results were subsequently evaluated using zview fig 2e and f depict the equivalent circuit as well as the nyquist plots the equivalent circuit is made up of charge transfer resistance r2 warburg impedance w2 parallel constant phase element cpe1 and ohmic resistance r1 internal resistance is comprised of ohmic resistance as well as charge transfer resistance umar et al 2021 the semicircle s diameter and the impedance at the high frequency limit can be used to ascertain the r2 and r1 quan et al 2015 according to the nyquist plots the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l had total internal resistance of 7 35 Ï r1 3 11 Ï and r2 4 24 Ï 11 53 Ï r1 4 38 Ï and r2 7 15 Ï 13 26 Ï r1 5 01 Ï and r2 8 25 Ï and 42 86 Ï r1 9 73 Ï and r2 33 13 Ï respectively fig 2e meanwhile the total internal resistance of lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 9 28 Ï r1 3 86 and r2 5 42 16 90 Ï r1 5 81 Ï and r2 11 09 Ï 18 27 Ï r1 8 92 Ï and r2 9 35 Ï and 27 72 Ï r1 8 03 Ï and r2 19 69 Ï respectively fig 2f from these results it is clear that the scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n had a lower internal resistance indicating good electrochemical activity of note the charge transfer resistance reflects the electron transfer capability at the electrode surface li et al 2022 the charge transfer resistance obviously contributed to the majority of the total internal resistance of the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicating a decrease in mass and electron transfer ability ren et al 2019 the 500 mg l no3 n concentration increased the number of dead bacterial cells on the carbon brush electrodes thereby increasing the electron transport distance as well as charge transfer resistance amanze et al 2022a similarly wang et al 2022 also reported that an increase in the charge transfer resistance of a bes was caused by an accumulation of dead microbial cells on electrodes thus the drastic decrease in electricity production of 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs might be ascribed to the decline in viability and activity of the castellaniella species which hindered the eet process fig 7c and d depict the eps constituents of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs it was evident that the protein content was significantly greater than that of carbohydrates as protein was the essential constituent of eps with the increase in no3 n concentrations from 0 to 250 mg l the amounts of protein in acetate fed scmfcs slightly decreased from 158 93 8 65 to 143 03 7 05 mg cm2 respectively in contrast the carbohydrate fraction in the acetate fed scmfcs increased from 28 35 6 09 mg cm2 at 0 mg l no3 n to 64 81 4 83 mg cm2 at 500 mg l no3 n concentration a similar trend was also observed in lactate fed scmfcs where protein contents slightly decreased from 121 43 6 18 to 93 73 9 68 mg cm2 at no3 n concentrations of 0 to 250 mg l however at 500 mg l no3 n concentration the protein content of both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs decreased dramatically to 78 54 3 82 and 72 96 7 61 mg cm2 respectively heme uronic acid and edna exhibited comparable trends in addition to its crucial role in biofilm development eps influences electron transfer between microbial cells and electrodes yang et al 2020 several studies have suggested that low eps protein contents in anodic biofilms result in lower eet efficiency tan et al 2019 zakaria et al 2022 an earlier study discovered that higher carbohydrate levels hampered eet in anode biofilms li et al 2020 yang et al 2019b documented the decrease in current production in anode biofilms with high carbohydrate to protein ratios therefore it is possible that a decrease in eps protein content hindered electron transport between bacterial cells and electrodes thereby affecting the performance of scmfcs particularly those fed 500 mg l no3 n the key enzymes involved in no3 n reduction and power generation were quantified fig 7e and f the nr activity were 124 82 12 23 142 42 8 83 137 31 16 19 and 43 36 11 17 Âµmol h mg protein while that of nir were 85 29 11 96 112 54 17 02 117 96 15 69 and 51 70 10 23 Âµmol h mg protein for acetate fed scmfcs at 0 100 250 and 500 mg l no3 n concentrations respectively the above results indicate that 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations improved the production of nr and nir enzymes in the scmfcs containing the biofilms of the castellaniella species resulting in a significant reduction of no3 n in these systems the same trends were also observed in the lactate fed scmfcs it has been reported in the literature that the presence of no3 n improved the production of nr and nir in denitrifying bacteria which is consistent with our findings iwamoto et al 2001 of note nr catalyzes the conversion of no3 n to no2 n whereas nir catalyzes the reduction of no2 n to nitric oxide cytochrome c and nadh which mediate electron between electron transporters he et al 2021 were significantly higher at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations than at 500 mg l no3 n concentrations for both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs implying that 500 mg l hindered the activities of these enzymes resulting in a decrease in power generation given that the electrochemical activity cell viability eps protein content and enzyme activities of both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs decreased drastically when no3 n concentrations exceeded 250 mg l a no3 n concentration of 250 mg l was chosen for subsequent experiments to minimize the negative effects of no3 n on the electroactive biofilms 3 3 cathodic metals recovery from on site smelting wastewater coupled with anodic denitrification the feasibility of simultaneously achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes containing the mixed castellaniella species was investigated consequently the scmfcs were disassembled to construct dcmfcs with the enriched electroactive carbon brushes of these scmfcs serving as anodes in the dcmfcs the initial cod no3 n ratio was maintained at 3 2 1 which is within the range of the cod n ratio of most domestic wastewater zhao et al 2022 acetate was adopted as a substrate since it was the best electron donor for the mixed castellaniella species fig 8 a shows the changes in the heavy metals concentration in the bes catholyte with time the cu2 and hg2 in the smelting effluent were effectively recovered by the dcmfcs via electrodeposition on the cathode surface as they could thermodynamically accept the electrons successfully transferred from the electroactive anodes following the initiation of treatment after 24 h the concentration of cu2 in the catholyte of the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive anodic biofilm declined substantially from 183 19 mg l to 35 73 6 47 mg l with a recovery rate of 6 15 0 28 mg l h nevertheless as the concentration of cu2 in the cathodic medium decreased the cu2 recovery rate declined a much lesser cu2 recovery rate 0 99 0 18 mg l h was attained during the 24th and 60th h of treatment this result is in accordance with earlier research that found the rate of cu2 recovery to be related to the cu2 concentration in the cathodic solution wu et al 2015 in addition the copper recovered on the carbon cloth might have also declined subsequent cu2 recovery ai et al 2020 after 60 h nearly all the cu2 99 86 0 10 in smelting effluent was recovered by the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive biofilm of the mixed castellaniella species with only a trace amount 0 26 0 18 mg l remaining in the catholyte conversely the cu2 concentration in the catholyte of the abiotic dcmfcs was nearly unchanged it is noteworthy to mention that the cu2 removal efficiency attained in this work was greater than the 84 8 and 79 9 obtained in shewanella putrefaciens inoculated dcmfcs with initial cu2 concentrations of 50 ppm and 30 ppm respectively sumisha et al 2020 a previously published work also obtained a lower removal efficiency of 98 3 with scmfc which had an initial cu2 concentration of 12 5 mg l and whose anodic electroactive biofilms were predominated by acinetobacter and geobacter wu et al 2018 nonetheless ai et al 2020 achieved a slightly higher removal efficiency of 99 95 0 09 from synthetic smelting wastewater containing 184 78 mg l cu2 concentration using dcmfcs inoculated with pseudomonas sp e8 which could be attributed to the less complexity and ease of treatment of synthetic wastewater lim et al 2021 the catholyte s hg2 concentration was also monitored and it decreased throughout the dcmfcs treatment phase within 17 h the hg2 concentration in the catholyte of the dcmfcs comprising electroactive anode decreased from 78 44 mg l to 4 47 1 76 mg l an additional decline in hg2 concentration to 0 01 0 005 mg l was noticed in these dcmfcs at the end of the treatment phase 60 h a high hg2 removal efficiency and removal rate of 99 98 0 014 and 31 37 0 0028 mg l d respectively were achieved during the entire mfcs treatment stage this removal efficiency was higher than the 98 22 99 54 obtained in dcmfcs of a previous study whose cathodic chamber had initial hg2 concentrations of 25 50 and 100 mg l wang et al 2011 in another published study lower removal efficiency of 98 was reported for dcmfcs with an initial hg2 concentration of 10 mg l kumar et al 2020 it should be mentioned that the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive biofilm of the mixed castellaniella species attained a cod removal efficiency of 57 54 0 57 during the processes of cu2 and hg2 recovery fig 8c a peak current of 1 54 ma was attained signifying the flow of electrons from the dcmfc s anode to its cathode fig 8d the current measured in this work was higher than that recorded in previous studies 1 0 and 1 21 0 29 ma during synthetic wastewater treatment amanze et al 2022b tao et al 2011 which can be attributed to the higher conductivity of smelting wastewater samples due to the presence of inorganic ions hansen et al 2007 metal ion behavior is crucial to the improvement or deterioration of bes performance lu et al 2015 in this work the presence of alkali e g na and alkaline earth metal ions e g ca2 and mg2 in the smelting wastewater could have influenced the performance of the dcmfcs lim et al 2021 the ce of the dcmfcs was 11 36 0 16 which is comparable to the 12 reported by li et al 2008 suggesting that there was significant cod removal unrelated to electricity production as shown in fig 8e the anolyte effluent no3 n concentration was also measured at the end of the dcmfcs treatment phase results showed that the dcmfcs containing the electroactive anodes could achieve no3 n removal efficiency of 89 58 1 13 with an effluent concentration of 26 05 2 83 mg l meanwhile the no3 n concentration in the abiotic control group remained unchanged the concentration of no2 n was below 1 mg l in the anolyte of the dcmfcs after the treatment fig 8e and table s5 since the only electron acceptors in these dcmfcs cathodes were the heavy metals it is thus supposed that heterotrophic denitrification was the main no3 n removal pathway the average no3 n removal rate was 3 73 0 05 mg l h which was faster than the 1 7 mg l h achieved by streptomyces mediolani em b2 in previous research he et al 2022 in another study achromobacter sp a14 achieved much lower no3 n removal rates of 0 301 0 174 and 0 138 mg l h under heterotrophic mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions respectively su et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 previously reported no3 n removal rates of 1 77 0 31 mg l h and 0 324 mg l h via aerobic heterotrophic denitrification and aerobic autotrophic no3 n removal respectively with pseudomonas sp y39 6 therefore these results demonstrated that the mixed castellaniella species could efficiently remove no3 n in the dcmfcs and degrade substrates to generate sufficient electrons for cu2 and hg2 recovery from actual smelting wastewater the dcmfcs anodic medium had an original ph of 7 whiles the ph of the smelting wastewater was 2 38 however after the cu2 and hg2 were recovered the ph of the anodic medium dropped to 6 42 0 33 fig 8b whereas the ph of the treated smelting wastewater rose to 8 28 0 34 in the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive bioanode fig 8c this finding is consistent with a prior study which discovered that oxidation reaction in the anodic compartment generates h which lowers ph while h is consumed during reduction reaction in the cathodic compartment which raises ph wang et al 2020 the ph of the anodic medium did not decrease significantly because heterotrophic denitrification can provide the possibility to maintain the ph within the optimum range since the process creates a proton balance qambrani et al 2013 the concentration of pb2 and zn2 in the catholyte remained unchanged during the dcmfcs treatment phase this could be attributed to the fact that pb2 and zn2 possess lower reduction potentials equations 4 5 hence they cannot be reduced by mfc modin et al 2012 therefore the pb2 and zn2 were sequentially recovered at the dcmecs treatment phase via the application of steady voltages to the circuits optimal voltages were applied to prevent electroactive biofilms from being damaged briefly h2so4 was added to reduce the catholyte s ph to its initial value 2 38 and the anolyte was refilled the concentration of pb2 in the catholyte of the dcmecs comprising electroactive anodic biofilms declined substantially from 206 94 mg l to 13 47 0 011 mg l in 36 h following the application of a constant voltage of 1 0 v to the dcmecs circuit by a dc power supply in contrast the pb2 concentration in the smelting wastewater of the abiotic dcmecs remained unchanged a significant proportion of the pb2 93 49 0 005 in the on site smelting wastewater was recovered via electrodeposition at a rate of 5 37 0 002 mg l h much higher than the 0 53 mg l h obtained in a previous study with an initial concentration of 39 21 mg l bo et al 2014 colantonio and kim 2016 also achieved a much lesser removal efficiency of 62 2 in the cathode chamber of a mec which had low initial pb2 concentrations 1 2 5 mg l it should be highlighted that the zn2 concentration in the catholyte of the dcmecs containing the electroactive anode remained unchanged following the application of 1 0 v to the circuit which can be attributed to its significantly lower reduction potential consequently the catholyte ph was adjusted to its original value then the zn2 and the remaining pb2 were recovered in 24 h following the application of a constant voltage of 2 0 v since 2 0 v yielded the desired result without damaging the biological anode in previous research modin et al 2012 saad et al 2020 at the end of the dcmecs treatment phase the concentration of pb2 and zn2 decreased drastically from 13 47 0 011 mg l and 126 92 mg l to 0 032 0 028 mg l and 1 05 0 38 mg l respectively however there was only a marginal decrease in zn2 and pb2 concentration in the catholyte of the abiotic dcmecs which could be ascribed to adsorption by the membrane the bes containing the bioanode attained a pb2 removal efficiency of 99 98 0 01 at the end of the wastewater treatment 120 h meanwhile the zn2 removal efficiency from the catholyte was 99 17 0 30 exceeding the 98 7 0 7 attained in a bes assisted electrodeposition system whose catholyte had an initial concentration of 150 mg l zhang et al 2020 moreover the removal efficiency of zn2 obtained in this current study was even greater than the 96 and 90 5 achieved in earlier research with initial zinc concentrations of 1 9 mm and 15 9 mg l respectively alismaeel et al 2022 lim et al 2021 in recent work a much lower zn2 removal efficiency of 67 7 1 3 was obtained in a photo assisted bes fed with real etching terminal effluent containing 5 1 0 4 mg l zinc concentration sun et al 2022 during the recovery of pb2 and zn2 91 60 2 26 and 77 38 4 25 of no3 n and cod in the anolyte of the dcmecs were simultaneously removed respectively the no2 n concentration in the bes was less than 1 mg l table s5 the final anolyte ph after pb2 and zn2 recovery was 5 50 0 32 which is conducive to the growth of castellaniella species as previously reported amanze et al 2022b the reduction kinetics of the four heavy metals in the bes was investigated and it was discovered that they followed pseudo first order kinetics with the majority of the coefficients of determination exceeding 0 9 see text s4 for more details taken together these findings show that the mixed culture inoculum of the castellaniella species is promising for achieving simultaneous anodic heterotrophic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery 4 pb 2 2 e pb e o 0 126 v vs she 5 zn 2 2 e zn e o 0 763 v vs she 3 4 analysis of the heavy metals removal mechanisms to better comprehend the metal s recovery mechanisms we employed sem edxs xrd and xps to examine the cathodes of the bes following the smelting wastewater treatment the usual reddish brown color of elemental cu was primarily visible on the cathode of the dcmfcs comprising the bioelectroactive anode after the treatment of the smelting effluent fig s3 conversely the abiotic control s cathode electrode maintained its usual black color sem photographs of the cathode of the bes with an electroactive anode revealed different structures and morphologies fig s4 the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs with the electroactive anode was extensively covered by spherule shaped agglomerates while the abiotic dcmfcs cathode appeared plain subsequent edxs examination of the agglomerate composition revealed c o p hg ca and cu signals in the cathode electrodes of the dcmfcs with the bioelectroactive anodes while the elemental mapping further depicts the precise distribution in a comprehensible manner however the cathode of the abiotic dcmfcs lacked any of the treated metals and was made up of only c o and p irregular crystals made up of c o f and pb were present on the cathode surface of the dcmecs with a 1 0 v applied voltage meanwhile the primary elements identified on the cathode surface of the dcmecs with a 2 0 v input voltage were c o p pb and zn the presence of the elements p and f on the cathode of the bes could likely be traced back to the pretreatment of the carbon cloths with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe jiang et al 2020 or they might have originated from the smelting effluent along with ca fig 9 a depicts the xrd patterns after the treatment of the smelting wastewater with the bes the identical diffraction peaks observed in all cathodes at 17 9 and 26 2 correspond to c and ptfe binder respectively cui et al 2020 cu0 2Î¸ 43 3 and 50 4 cu2o 2Î¸ 36 43 and 42 31 and hgo 2Î¸ 28 4 and 57 3 peaks were observed in the xrd spectra of the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs containing the bioelectroactive anodes abdelrahman and hegazey 2019 das et al 2015 sahai et al 2016 thus these findings demonstrated that copper was recovered via electrodeposition as cu0 and cu whiles mercury was recovered as hg2 in the dcmfcs elemental hg could not be observed most likely due to the difficulty of its detection by the xrd technique bussi et al 2010 peaks of pb0 2Î¸ 31 3 36 3 52 3 and 62 1 were only identified on the cathode surface of dcmecs with an applied voltage of 1 0 v indicating that lead ions in the catholyte were recovered as metallic lead at this stage watanabe et al 2002 meanwhile the presence of distinctive peaks of zn0 2Î¸ 38 9 43 2 54 3 and 70 1 and pb0 2Î¸ 31 3 and 36 3 in the xrd pattern of the cathode of the dcmecs with an applied voltage of 2 0 v indicates the successful recovery of zn2 and pb2 in their metallic state cingarapu et al 2015 watanabe et al 2002 it is worth noting that none of the treated metals were detected by xrd on the carbon cloth of the abiotic bes which was clearly identical to the cathode prior to treatment xps was performed to further confirm the valence state of the cathodic deposits following the treatment of the smelting wastewater as shown in fig 9b the deconvoluted spectra of cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 situated at 932 6 and 952 6 ev in the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs containing the castellaniella species could be assigned to cu0 or cu2o li et al 2019 sarwar et al 2021 consistent with the xrd result furthermore the absence of satellite peaks in the cu 2p spectra further confirms that copper was successfully recovered in a more reduced form as previously reported cu2 could undergo two chemical processes while accepting electrons from the cathode of mfc tao et al 2011 one such process involves the acceptance of electrons directly to convert them into metallic states eq 6 whilst the other process involves the reaction of cu2 with water molecules while accepting electrons to form cu2o eq 7 it should be added that the rise in the catholyte ph and the decrease in the current generation of the dcmfcs at the latter phase of the treatment could have also led to the deposition of cu2o song et al 2019 6 c u 2 2 e cu 7 2 c u 2 h 2 o 2 e c u 2 o 2 h fig 9c illustrates the xps spectra of the recovered hg species the hg 4f7 2 electron spectra were effectively resolved into two doublets with binding energies be of 99 8 and 100 7 ev the line with the lowest be is assigned to hg0 whereas the line with the highest be is ascribed to hg2 wu et al 2014 the existence of metallic hg0 validated the dcmfc s ability to reduce hg2 of note hg0 and hg2 accounted for 50 8 and 49 2 of the recovered hg species respectively the potential pathways for the electrochemical reduction of the hg2 are shown in eqs 8 10 briefly the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species in the anodic region of the dcmfcs efficiently oxidized the acetate to produce electrons under anaerobic conditions the electrons were subsequently transported to the anode and then to the cathodic region through the circuit a portion of the hg2 gets directly reduced to hg0 by the electrons and subsequently attaches to the cathodic surface whereas the other portion is first converted to hg 2 2 and then further reduced to hg0 the deposition of hg2 on the cathodic surface probably occurred chemically the mechanism is unclear however it is most likely caused by high local ph generated by side reactions including hydrogen

using xps the be of pb 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 orbitals of the cathodic surface of the dcmecs with an input voltage of 1 0 v were observed at 136 8 and 141 7 ev which corresponds to pb0 niu et al 2015 fig 9d similarly the pb 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 core levels of the cathode electrode of the dcmecs with an input voltage of 2 0 v likewise revealed the pb0 assigned be at 136 7 ev and 141 6 ev hong et al 2019 fig 9e meanwhile the zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 of the dcmecs with an applied voltage of 2 0 v had be of 1021 1 ev and 1044 2 ev respectively with a peak separation of 23 1 ev which is consistent with previously published values for zinc metal mai et al 2013 fig 9f therefore these results demonstrated that zn2 and pb2 in the catholyte of the dcmecs were successfully recovered via electrodeposition as zn0 and pb0 respectively which agrees with the xrd data 4 conclusion this study investigated the ability of a mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella species to simultaneously perform heterotrophic denitrification and anodic respiration coupled with cathodic metal recovery in a bes first the impacts of different no3 n concentrations on the performance of the mixed castellaniella species in scmfcs were evaluated results showed that the electrochemical activity no3 n and cod removal efficiencies cell viability eps protein content and enzymatic activities of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs were not substantially affected by 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations compared to 500 mg l no3 n acetate was the best electron donor for the castellaniella species to remove no3 n and generate electricity efficiently moreover bes inoculated with the mixed castellaniella species effectively performed heterotrophic anodic denitrification coupled with cathodic heavy metals recovery from on site smelting wastewater cu2 was effectively recovered as cu0 and cu2o via bioelectrochemical reduction on the cathodic surface whiles hg0 and hgo accounted for 50 8 and 49 2 of the hg species recovered via bioelectrochemical reduction and chemical deposition respectively furthermore pb2 and zn2 were bio electrochemically reduced to pb0 and zn0 respectively over 89 of no3 n was effectively removed from the bes anolyte during the recovery of the heavy metals overall these results demonstrate that castellaniella species are promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhancing power

15117,although castellaniella species are crucial for denitrification there is no report on their capacity to carry out denitrification and anode respiration simultaneously in a bioelectrochemical system bes herein the ability of a mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella species to perform simultaneous denitrification and anode respiration coupled with cathodic metals recovery was investigated in a bes results showed that 500 mg l no3 n significantly decreased power generation whereas 100 and 250 mg l no3 n had a lesser impact the single chamber mfcs scmfcs fed with 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations achieved a removal efficiency higher than 90 in all cycles in contrast the removal efficiency in the scmfcs declined dramatically at 500 mg l no3 n which might be attributable to decreased microbial viability as revealed by sem and clsm eps protein content and enzymatic activities of the biofilms decreased significantly at this concentration cyclic voltammetry results revealed that the 500 mg l no3 n concentration decreased the redox activities of anodic biofilms while electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that the internal resistance of the scmfcs at this concentration increased significantly in addition bes inoculated with the castellaniella species was able to simultaneously perform heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery from real wastewater the bes attained cu2 hg2 pb2 and zn2 removal efficiencies of 99 86 0 10 99 98 0 014 99 98 0 01 and 99 17 0 30 respectively from the real wastewater cu2 was bio electrochemically reduced to cu0 and cu2o whereas hg0 and hgo constituted the hg species recovered via bioelectrochemical reduction and chemical deposition respectively furthermore pb2 and zn2 were bio electrochemically reduced to pb0 and zn0 respectively over 89 of no3 n was removed from the bes anolyte during the recovery of the metals this research reveals promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhanced power generation no3 n removal and heavy metals recovery in bes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords castellaniella species nitrate bioelectrochemical system denitrifying exoelectrogens metals recovery data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the discharge of excess nitrate nitrogen no3 n into aquatic environments has emerged as a global issue in recent years in most areas the no3 n concentration in wastewater from industries can reach 1000 mg l which is significantly greater than the recommended guideline value of 10 mg l for human consumption uzun and debik 2019 prolonged exposure to excessive no3 n has been linked to blue baby disease in newborns stomach cancer methemoglobinemia spontaneous abortion and thyroid disease gao et al 2020 thus no3 n removal is critical in wastewater treatment to prevent no3 n diffusion into the environment and reduce the health risk it poses to humans and animals in addition to no3 n heavy metals are among the most prevalent pollutants found in wastewater particularly in the industrial wastewater from smelting sites the industrial wastewater from pb zn smelting is highly acidic and contains a variety of toxic heavy metals such as zinc zn lead pb mercury hg copper cu and others these heavy metals in wastewater exist in various oxidative states with varying degrees of toxicity among them pb2 zn2 cu2 and hg2 are more mobile soluble and toxic than pb0 zn0 cu0 and hg0 respectively ribeiro et al 2019 the majority of these heavy metals can accumulate and concentrate in organisms via the food chain causing liver and kidney damage cancer respiratory problems etc kan et al 2021 therefore effective remediation techniques are needed to decrease heavy metals concentration in the environment numerous techniques for eliminating heavy metals and no3 n from untreated wastewater have been reported including ion exchange reverse osmosis membrane separation etc an et al 2022 however these techniques are costly produce secondary contaminants that necessitate additional treatment and sometimes focus on the removal of value added products rather than recovery crini and lichtfouse 2019 by contrast the bioelectrochemical system bes is gaining traction as a low cost and eco friendly approach for treating wastewater kumar et al 2019 this technology distinguishes itself from other methods in several ways including the absence of secondary pollution and its capacity to treat a wide range of waste with high efficiency yang et al 2019a furthermore it is a viable technique for recovering precious metals that can be utilized in the production of industrial products currently microbial electrolysis cells mecs and microbial fuel cells mfcs are two bes types that have received considerable attention mfcs are used to produce electrical energy and reduce high redox potential metals because their anode and cathode potentials are typically negative and positive respectively in contrast the mec reaction requires an external power source because this device s anode and cathode potential differences is extremely small to move electrons from the anode region to the cathodic compartment despite all the benefits of bes its use in treating no3 n contaminated wastewater is still limited to laboratory scale applications primarily because high no3 n conditions inhibit the growth and metabolism of most electroactive and denitrifying bacteria for instance when 100 mg l no3 n was introduced into the anodic compartment of an mfc the proportion of geobacter decreased from 72 8 to 29 4 jin et al 2019 similarly it was also discovered that the percentage of geobacter in single chamber mfcs scmfcs drastically decreased from 71 at 0 mg l no3 n to 8 09 at 800 mg l no3 n huang et al 2018 kashima and regan 2015 found that the current generation and anodic denitrification of a bes inoculated with geobacter metallireducens were severely hindered when the concentration of no3 n exceeded 10 0 mm fu et al 2013 reported that the inclusion of 20 mm nano3 into the anodic compartment of an mfc containing calditerrivibrio nitroreducens reduced power output to date several strategies for resolving this problem have been proposed including the inoculation of denitrifying exoelectrogens which are highly resistant to no3 n as well as the reduction of no3 n in the cathode chamber of bes it should be noted that most of these studies involving cathodic no3 n reduction employed solutions with no3 n without organic matter in the cathode compartments jiang et al 2017 the fact is that most domestic and industrial wastewaters contain high concentrations of chemical oxygen demand cod and no3 n therefore the usage of denitrifying exoelectrogens which are efficient and highly resistant to no3 n is promising for practical application in wastewater treatment while the denitrification ability of exoelectrogens from the genera geobacter thiobacillus pseudomonas calditerrivibrio etc have been demonstrated in a bes no research has attempted to investigate the denitrification ability of exoelectrogens from the genus castellaniella in a bes castellaniella is a genus of gram negative microbes that are facultative anaerobes with short motile rods and a denitrifying metabolism kÃ¤mpfer et al 2006 some castellaniella species have been discovered to perform denitrification under high no3 n and low ph conditions and are mostly detected in no3 n contaminated environments pang and liu 2007 spain anne et al 2007 for example spain and krumholz 2012 reported that castellaniella str 4 5a2 could effectively grow in a medium comprising high no3 n concentration 100 mm at ph 5 0 and resulted in rapid denitrification with less accumulation of nitrite nitrogen no2 n in previous research deng et al 2021 revealed that castellaniella sp pyr2 obtained from sludge could simultaneously remove pyrene 97 2 and no3 n from coking wastewater these encouraging findings revealed that castellaniella has significant advantages in the field of microbial denitrification of highly contaminated no3 n wastewater however it is unknown whether castellaniella species can simultaneously perform denitrification and power generation in a bes since the above mentioned studies were not conducted in a bes owing to this we report for the first time the ability of mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella sp a3 castellaniella sp b3 and castellaniella sp a5 to perform simultaneous denitrification and anode respiration coupled with cathodic metal recovery in a bes specifically the impacts of varied no3 n concentrations on the performance of the mixed castellaniella species in the bes in terms of electricity generation no3 n removal rate n intermediates removal cod removal biofilm morphology cell viability extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and enzymatic activities were evaluated with acetate and lactate as substrates additionally electrochemical methods including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis and cyclic voltammetry cv were adopted to examine the influence of the various no3 n concentrations on the internal resistance and redox activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species the feasibility of simultaneously achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes containing the mixed castellaniella species was also investigated finally the heavy metals removal mechanisms were explored in detail in a nutshell this study provides promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhanced no3 n removal and heavy metals recovery from secondary effluent with superior performance and less accumulation of n intermediates 2 materials and methods 2 1 bes reactors configuration scmfcs were adopted to evaluate the mixed castellaniella species ability to perform heterotrophic anodic denitrification with electricity generation simultaneously the feasibility of achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes was evaluated using double chamber mfcs dcmfcs and double chamber mecs dcmecs the materials as well as the configuration of the scmfcs dcmfcs and dcmecs were identical to those used in our earlier research amanze et al 2022b text s1 provides a detailed description of the components and construction of the bes reactors 2 2 microbial source inoculation and operation the biocatalyst used in this work was a mixed inoculum of castellaniella sp a3 castellaniella sp a5 and castellaniella sp b3 which were originally isolated from the anodic biofilm of scmfcs in our previous study amanze et al 2022b the pure cultures were initially cultured in luria bertani broth at 37 c for 24 h on a rotary shaker 150 rpm afterward the cells were harvested via centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min and 25 c and mixed together in a ratio of 1 1 1 finally 20 of the mixed inoculum was subsequently transferred into each scmfc comprising 22 4 ml of nutrient medium the electroactive biofilms of the mixed castellaniella species were initially enriched with a nutrient medium containing substrate 100 Âµl l trace element solution 0 5 ml l wolfe s vitamins and 50 mm pbs 2 45 g l nah2po4 4 58 g l na2hpo4 0 13 g l kcl and 0 02 g l cacl2 acetate and lactate which represented unfermentable and fermentable electron donors respectively were utilized as substrates due to their efficacy in enriching electroactive biofilms and boosting bes power generation flayac et al 2018 the energy substrates were respectively dissolved in the nutrient medium to attain a final cod concentration of 800 mg l after the electroactive biofilms of the mixed castellaniella species were fully acclimated kno3 was introduced into the nutrient medium to achieve no3 n concentrations of 0 mg l control group 100 mg l 250 mg l and 500 mg l most wastewaters contain high cod and no3 n concentrations that occur concurrently and vary from 140 4 5750 100 mg l and 72 7 3610 mg l respectively duan et al 2019 gao et al 2022 logroÃ±o et al 2017 nayak and ghosh 2019 the influent cod and no3 n concentrations will be much higher when this wastewater is received by treatment facilities thus the cod and no3 n concentrations in this study were within the range reported in real wastewater the initial ph of the anolyte was 7 which conforms to the ph of most secondary effluents zhang et al 2016 the anolyte medium was sparged with nitrogen gas n2 to eliminate dissolved oxygen the scmfcs were then kept in an incubator at 30 c and fed batch operated to ascertain the effects of varied no3 n concentrations on electricity generation no3 n removal rate n intermediates removal cod removal biofilm morphology cell viability extracellular polymeric substance eps composition and enzymatic activities the anolyte medium in each reactor was refilled whenever the scmfcs output voltage decreased below 20 mv as described in our previous study amanze et al 2022a the dcmfcs cathode compartments were fed pb zn smelting wastewater collected from a smelting site in china the composition of the smelting effluent is shown in table s2 to eliminate dissolved oxygen the catholyte as well as the dcmfcs anolyte were subsequently sparged with n2 prior to the tests following cu2 and hg2 recovery the growth medium in each dcmfc s anode compartments was refilled and the external resistor 10 Ï was detached the pb2 and zn2 were recovered in the mec mode by applying a steady voltage of 1 0 v and 2 0 v respectively to the circuit of each dcmec using a dc power supply scmfcs dcmecs and dcmfcs devoid of the biofilm enrichment served as abiotic controls to avert contamination all laboratory experiments were conducted in a laminar flow hood 2 3 characterization of anodic biofilms scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6490lv jeol tokyo japan was utilized to assess the morphologies of the anodic biofilms the sem sample preparation procedures were identical to those employed in our prior work ai et al 2020 the cell viability of the anodic biofilms was ascertained using cslm tcs sp8 leica germany prior to clsm analysis the samples were prepared as aptly described in earlier research wen et al 2022 three dimensional clsm photographs of the biofilms were reconstructed and evaluated with zen blue edition carl zeiss the proportion of viable cells was computed and evaluated utilizing the comstat 2 1 software eps was subsequently extracted from the anodic biofilms using a previously described approach with some minor modifications wen et al 2022 a detailed description of the eps extraction process as well as analytical approaches for the different eps components are available in text s2 commercial kits solarbio beijing china were used to measure the enzymatic activities such as nitrate reductase nr and nitrite reductase nir the electron transport enzymes such as nadh intracellular and cytochrome c extracellular were extracted and quantified using a previously described method he et al 2021 2 4 analysis and calculations a data acquisition device adam 4017 analog input model advantech co ltd china directly connected to a digital computer was employed to monitor and record the voltage mv of the scmfcs every 50 s following the development of the anodic biofilms and stabilization of the scmfcs maximum voltage polarization as well as power density were assessed by varying the external resistor as described earlier zheng et al 2022 a previously documented approach was used to calculate coulombic efficiency ce logan et al 2006 to ascertain the electrochemical performance of the electroactive anodes eis and cv were conducted using a potentiostat gamry reference 600 workstation philadelphia pennsylvania usa the eis and cv laboratory experiments were performed with a three electrode setup with the cathode anode and saturated ag agcl serving as counter working and reference electrodes respectively the eis was measured with a 5 mv ac amplitude in the frequency range of 1000 khz to 0 01 hz and the obtained data were subsequently analyzed with zview software the cv tests were carried out at a scan rate of 5 mv s from 1 0 v to 1 0 v the concentrations of cod no3 n and no2 n were measured using a spectrophotometer approach huang et al 2018 the n2o concentrations were determined with gas chromatography on a gc 2014 system shimadzu co ltd japan and the values were subsequently converted into mass the concentrations of cu2 pb2 and zn2 in the catholyte of the dcmfcs were measured using an inductively coupled plasma icp spectrometer model spectroblue fms386 ametek materials analysis division kleve germany an atomic fluorescence spectrometer afs 820 from jitian instrument co ltd beijing china was used to measure the concentration of hg2 the kinetics of the heavy metals removal were regressed by employing the first order equation as described in text s3 energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edxs elect super edax ametek kleve germany connected to sem x ray powder diffraction xrd d8 advance bruker corporation germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo scientific waltham ma usa were used to attain in depth information regarding the morphologies as well as the elemental composition of the carbon cloths cathodes following the actual pb zn wastewater treatment all laboratory experiments were performed in triplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the castellaniella species under different nitrate concentrations scmfcs were operated with acetate and lactate as substrates under varied no3 n concentrations i e 0 100 250 and 500 mg l in order to ascertain the impact of no3 n on the performance of the castellaniella species in terms of power generation and cod and no3 n removal efficiencies the voltages in each cycle rapidly rise to a maximum value after refilling the nutrient solution in the anodic compartments then progressively decline owing to substrate exhaustion fig 1 a and b this immediate rise in voltages after substrate replenishment in each batch was attributed to castellaniella species cells adhered to the brush anodes instead of planktonic microorganisms otherwise the elimination of free floating castellaniella cells due to anolyte replacement ought to have reduced output voltage the acetate fed scmfcs had maximum output voltages of 510 mv 502 mv 484 mv and 240 mv when fed with 0 100 250 and 500 mg l no3 n respectively fig 1a meanwhile maximum output voltages of 509 mv 462 mv 367 mv and 264 mv were achieved by lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1b the results presented above indicate that 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations did not significantly affect the electricity generation of scmfcs inoculated with castellaniella species however the output voltage declined substantially in scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicating that this concentration was detrimental to the anodic biofilms of castellaniella species it should be mentioned that at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l acetate fed scmfcs outperformed lactate fed scmfcs signifying that the castellaniella species effectively utilize the acetate to generate much more electrons for electricity production in the scmfcs the voltages were produced from the substrate oxidation by the matured electroactive anodic biofilms wang et al 2022 in the case of scmfcs fed 100 and 250 mg l the no3 n might affect just a portion of mature electroactive biofilm which was insufficient to influence the current generation while in the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs a greater proportion of the biofilm may have been affected leading to a substantial decrease in output voltages the maximum power densities of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 315 34 16 14 282 16 9 85 277 08 6 23 and 112 13 1 14 mw m2 while their corresponding average current densities were 4 34 0 12 3 61 0 10 3 53 0 11 and 1 71 0 10 a m2 respectively fig 1c for the lactate fed scmfcs maximum power densities of 275 74 6 15 242 44 9 49 134 69 1 03 and 113 51 5 40 mw m2 and corresponding current densities of 3 50 0 13 2 64 0 05 2 28 0 14 and 1 86 0 13 a m2 were attained at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively fig 1d despite the fact that the maximum current density of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentration of 100 mg l was approximately 1 20 fold lesser than that of no3 n free scmfcs there was only a marginal decline in current generation from 3 61 0 10 to 3 53 0 11 a m2 for no3 n concentrations ranging from 100 to 250 mg l suggesting that no3 n concentrations less than 500 mg l had little impact on anodic electroactive biofilms from the above findings it also appears that the current and power densities produced decrease with increasing substrate carbon content this could be explained by the fact that the type of metabolic reactions occurring in the scmfcs is determined by the nature of the substrate acetate fed scmfcs achieved the best performance which could be attributed to the fact that acetate is a simple molecule with two carbons and can easily be oxidized by exoelectrogens d angelo et al 2017 similarly the output voltages of the acetate fed scmfcs at varying external resistors were quite similar at 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations suggesting that these concentrations had less impact on the power generation the electrode potential of the scmfcs was examined to determine the impact of the various no3 n concentrations on electrode performance fig 1e and f the cathode potential curves converged while the anode potential curves exhibited discernible differences thus the disparities between the scmfcs electricity production were primarily attributable to differences in anode electrochemical activity at the end of each cycle the cod removal efficiency of each scmfc was determined fig 2 a the average cod removal efficiencies of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 94 16 2 59 91 52 1 83 88 47 3 95 and 53 61 2 40 respectively however lactate fed scmfcs obtained average cod removal efficiencies of 89 11 1 06 83 86 1 06 72 1 77 and 62 76 1 47 at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively the observed cod removal efficiencies correlated with the activities of the electroactive biofilms which no3 n is likely to affect with an increment in no3 n concentration from 100 to 250 mg l for acetate and lactate fed scmfcs the cod removal efficiency of the scmfcs decreased slightly nonetheless 500 mg l no3 n significantly inhibited acetate and lactate oxidation implying that anodic biofilm activities were impeded and its acetate lactate metabolic process was greatly affected this phenomenon is in line with an earlier study that reported that 500 mg l no3 n could impede substrate utilization of anodic biofilms in mfcs huang et al 2018 compared with the lactate fed scmfcs the acetate fed scmfcs achieved higher cod removal efficiencies at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations indicating that acetate promoted the activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species resulting in extensive consumption of substrate to further evaluate the electrochemical behavior of the scmfcs the ce which denotes the percentage of electrons successfully recovered as electrical current from substrate oxidation was calculated as shown in fig 2b the ce of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 30 54 2 76 28 48 2 04 26 97 1 94 and 11 42 1 63 respectively for lactate fed scmfcs ce of 26 79 1 58 24 20 3 43 22 92 2 90 and 11 04 0 11 were attained at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively the higher ce of scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n indicated that more substrates were utilized by microbial metabolism associated with extracellular electron transfer eet in contrast scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n had the least ce suggesting that this no3 n concentration impeded biofilm activity which subsequently retarded the conversion of substrates to electricity moreover the duration of the voltage of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs significantly shortened at no3 n concentration of 500 mg l resulting in a substantial reduction in ce thus the decline in ce of scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicates that this concentration primarily affected mfc anode performance by inhibiting biofilms via toxicity in comparison to lactate the acetate fed scmfcs exhibited higher ce at the various no3 n concentrations indicating that the acetate enhanced the scmfcs electrogenic performance acetate has been reported in the literature to have the ability to directly stimulate microbes which results in superior electricity production yan and wang 2019 it is worth noting that the scmfcs fed without no3 n had higher ce than the reactors fed with no3 n implying that some electrons were consumed for denitrification leading to a drop in ce sukkasem et al 2008 the no3 n removal reflects the performance of the scmfcs as well as the viability of electroactive biofilms attached to the anode consequently the effluent no3 n concentration as well as the no3 n removal efficiency were monitored at the end of each cycle the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 achieved removal efficiencies of 97 43 1 06 97 13 0 67 and 60 99 1 24 respectively with effluent no3 n concentrations of 1 28 0 53 7 18 1 68 and 195 02 21 22 mg l in the first cycle respectively fig 3 a for lactate fed scmfc removal efficiencies of 94 42 1 06 92 68 1 0 and 73 73 1 24 were obtained at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively with effluent no3 n concentrations of 5 91 2 18 18 29 2 52 and 131 37 6 20 mg l in the first cycle respectively fig 3b the no3 n removal efficiency was still greater than 90 in the second third and fourth cycles for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 mg l however it dropped significantly to 52 16 5 34 and 64 66 2 04 in the second cycle and further decreased to 46 31 3 80 and 44 36 2 039 in the third cycle and finally to 35 35 5 58 and 36 70 1 15 in the fourth cycle for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs respectively at 500 mg l no3 n suggesting that this concentration inhibited the activities of the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species it is likely that the population of the castellaniella species was relatively high in the initial stage first cycle at 500 mg l no3 n resulting in a removal efficiency of over 60 however the removal efficiency of the system decreased in subsequent cycles indicating that the microbes activities were gradually inhibited with time it should be mentioned that no2 n accumulated significantly in the various cycles for the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n fig 3c and d however the no2 n concentrations in the effluent of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations were lower than the world health organization s maximum allowable level of 3 mg l in drinking water xu et al 2020 the accumulation of no2 n in the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n might be ascribed to the fact that this concentration drastically decreased the cod no3 n ratio thereby reducing the substrate required for the growth and denitrification process of the castellaniella species karanasios et al 2016 the inhibition caused by no3 n was not solely attributable to no3 n but also due to the reduced intermediates e g no2 n produced during denitrification banihani et al 2009 table s3 shows the intermediates produced during the denitrification process in each cycle bubbles were observed on the surface of the scmfcs anolytes but not in the control groups indicating that denitrification occurred in the system compared with acetate fed scmfcs no3 n removal efficiencies in lactate fed scmfcs were lower in all cycles at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 indicating that acetate was the best carbon source for castellaniella species to efficiently remove no3 n acetate is an organic acid that is commonly utilized as an electron donor by heterotrophic no3 n reducers in the reaction acetate is first converted into acetyl coa and then denitrifying bacteria can use acetyl coa directly by entering the tca cycle pang and wang 2021 the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent ph values of 6 06 0 24 6 56 0 32 7 08 0 04 and 6 78 0 46 respectively in the first cycle in the second cycle the effluent ph values were 6 41 0 37 6 77 0 55 7 11 0 19 and 7 05 0 62 respectively additionally the effluents of these reactors had ph values of 6 27 0 54 7 12 0 29 6 84 0 40 and 6 99 0 46 in the third cycle and 6 70 0 40 6 25 0 16 7 18 0 26 and 6 45 0 47 in the fourth cycle respectively similar ph trends were observed in effluent from lactate fed scmfcs overall most of the effluent ph values of the no3 n fed scmfcs were in the range of 6 5 7 2 indicating that denitrification played a significant role in maintaining ph balance fig 3e and f apparently the protons produced by substrate oxidation may have been utilized for no3 n reduction thus coupling anode respiration and denitrification could be an effective approach to control bes anolyte ph ren et al 2020 to better comprehend the no3 n removal process in the scmfcs no3 n concentrations were monitored as a function of time during a typical cycle with open circuit scmfcs serving as the control group the voltage of the lactate fed scmfc with 500 mg l no3 n concentration was first to decrease below the predefined voltage 20 mv for anolyte medium replenishment at 48 h as a result 48 h was chosen as the endpoint for comparing the no3 n removal process in the typical cycle the acetate fed scmfcs with no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent no3 n concentrations of 1 08 0 15 7 49 2 76 and 255 11 23 75 mg l with removal efficiencies of 98 92 0 16 97 1 10 and 48 98 4 75 respectively fig 4 a in addition the lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 250 and 500 mg l had effluent no3 n concentrations of 4 85 2 74 22 49 4 31 and 253 83 27 61 mg l with removal efficiencies of 95 16 2 74 90 47 1 52 and 49 23 5 52 respectively at the end of the typical cycle fig 4b furthermore effluent no3 n concentrations in acetate fed reactors with no current flow control group were 7 41 0 60 17 49 1 34 and 315 11 38 067 mg l with mean no3 n removal efficiencies of 92 59 0 60 92 88 0 44 and 36 98 7 62 respectively fig s1a meanwhile lactate fed reactors with no current flow obtained mean no3 n removal efficiencies of 86 70 1 74 88 66 3 39 and 58 49 6 47 with effluent no3 n concentrations of 13 30 1 74 28 36 8 47 and 207 53 32 35 mg l respectively fig s1b from the above results it is obvious that 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs had the lowest performance further confirming that this concentration was deleterious to castellaniella species cells in addition to electrochemical reduction conventional heterotrophic denitrification might have accelerated no3 n removal since the no3 n removal efficiencies of the reactors with current were not significantly higher than the control reactors without current flow therefore it is possible to conclude that electrochemical no3 n reduction and heterotrophic denitrification coexisted in the scmfcs heterotrophic denitrification occurs when the carbon source is adequate for the majority of heterotrophic denitrifiers an organic carbon source is needed for cell growth and no3 n reduction lee and rittmann 2003 if the carbon source is inadequate autotrophic denitrification predominates over heterotrophic denitrification in electrochemical no3 n reduction exoelectrogens oxidize substrates to generate extracellular electrons which are subsequently transferred from the device s anode to its cathode via the external circuit on the cathode the no3 n accepts electrons and is reduced to nitrogen gas n2 or no2 n as an intermediate to n2 gas i e denitrification process eqs 1 3 liu and wu 2021 of note members of the genera castellaniella possess the four functional genes napa nirk narg and nosz that encode nr nir nitric oxide reductase and nitrous oxide reductase which work together to complete the denitrification process ma et al 2022 besides several studies have also reported the participation of castellaniella species in the denitrification process deng et al 2021 pang and liu 2007 therefore the mixed castellaniella species were involved in the reduction of the no3 n to n2 the no2 n concentrations were low throughout the test cycle for the scmfcs fed with 100 and 250 mg l no3 n fig 4c and d in contrast significant no2 n accumulation was observed for the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n furthermore cod degradation efficiency was investigated over the typical cycle for the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at the various no3 n concentrations fig 4e and f maximum cod removal efficiencies of 95 92 0 60 92 22 2 89 90 83 0 11 and 54 50 6 26 were obtained by the acetate fed scmfcs which were higher than the 90 38 2 52 85 58 2 82 71 94 2 07 and 57 16 1 74 obtained by the lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l respectively over the 48 h the enhanced cod removal efficiency at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 was primarily ascribed to heterotrophic anodic denitrification it is imperative to note that the power generation and no3 n removal efficiency obtained by these mixed castellaniella species in the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 100 and 250 mg l were significantly greater than those of most existing inoculums table s4 further confirming that these castellaniella species are promising exoelectrogens for achieving simultaneous denitrification and anodic respiration 1 2 n o 3 6 h 5 e 0 5 n 2 3 h 2 o 2 no 3 2 h 2 e n o 2 h 2 o 3 no 2 3 h 3 e 0 5 n 2 o h h 2 o 3 2 morphological electrochemical eps components and enzymatic activities analyses of anodic biofilms sem was employed to analyze the morphology of the castellaniella species biofilm in the reactors as shown in fig 5 a f the castellaniella species were densely attached to the anode electrode of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l contrarily they were sparse and loose on the anode electrode of the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs fig 5g and h indicating that this concentration had a detrimental impact on the enrichment and proliferation of the castellaniella species the viability of the biofilms adhered to the electrode surface was evaluated using clsm fig 6 as depicted in fig 6a f a greater number of live castellaniella cells green were attached to the electrode of the acetate and lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l conversely biofilm viability was considerably reduced in 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs fig 6g and h to ascertain the proportion of dead red and living cells the ratio of green fluorescence to the sum total of red and green fluorescence was used to calculate the percentage of viable cells in the anodic biofilms the viability values of the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l were 86 31 3 19 84 42 0 98 and 82 68 4 29 respectively fig 7 a for lactate fed scmfcs viability values of 82 98 5 47 78 08 5 29 and 59 77 4 25 were obtained at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations respectively fig 7b conversely acetate and lactate fed scmfcs had viability values of 43 68 4 41 and 45 79 2 72 respectively at 500 mg l no3 n these results indicate that 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations had less impact on the castellaniella species while 500 mg l no3 n was detrimental to the cells which is consistent with the sem results high no3 n concentrations and their intermediates are more detrimental to microbial activities because they disrupt bacterial development and cause cell malfunction zhang et al 2022 the existence of more dead cells could prevent viable cells from contacting the anode electrode thereby impeding the flow of electrons between the viable cells and the brush anodes causing a decline in ce sun et al 2015 it should be pointed out that at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l the cell viability of the acetate fed scmfcs was higher than that of the lactate fed anodes further confirming that acetate was the best substrate for castellaniella species the electrochemical behavior of the scmfcs comprising the varied no3 n concentrations were estimated with cv at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations oxidation peaks were detected at 0 18 v 44 91 ma 0 08 v 25 25 ma and 0 31 v 20 18 ma and reduction peaks were detected at 0 32 v 17 34 ma 0 68 v 27 25 ma and 0 57 v 2 48 ma for acetate fed scmfcs fig 2c in contrast neither oxidation nor reduction peaks were present in the cv curve of the 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfc the presence of both oxidation and reduction peaks in scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n corresponds to a higher level of redox active proteins and electrochemical activity meanwhile the absence of both oxidation and reduction peaks in 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs corresponds to a decrease in redox activity similarly lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 and 250 mg l had higher oxidation peak currents of 13 53 ma 11 73 ma and 9 56 ma respectively than that fed with 500 mg l no3 n 9 1 ma fig 2d the presence of 500 mg l no3 n obviously diminished the population of the castellaniella species which in turn reduced the biofilm s redox protein content thereby hindering electron transfer between the cells of the bacteria and anode electrodes it should be emphasized that several redox proteins found in the outer membranes of most electricigens play a crucial role in the transport of electrons from bacteria cells to electrodes which subsequently results in the emergence of oxidation and reduction peaks amanze et al 2022a nevertheless a decline in the microbial activities of the biofilms caused by this no3 n concentration 500 mg l could have impeded the functions of the redox proteins thus hindering the emergence of the oxidation and reduction peaks the peak currents of the acetate fed scmfcs at various no3 n concentrations were clearly higher than those of the lactate fed scmfcs which corresponds to the output voltage results the abiotic scmfcs were also studied to verify the involvement of the microbes in eet it was discovered that virtually no current was produced in these systems confirming that castellaniella species were accountable for power generation in all reactors the total internal resistance of the scmfcs was assessed with eis to gain further insight into the impact of the various no3 n concentrations on their performance the electron transport status of electroactive biofilm can be estimated using eis chen et al 2021 the impedance spectrum attained from each eis test was fitted to an equivalent circuit and the obtained results were subsequently evaluated using zview fig 2e and f depict the equivalent circuit as well as the nyquist plots the equivalent circuit is made up of charge transfer resistance r2 warburg impedance w2 parallel constant phase element cpe1 and ohmic resistance r1 internal resistance is comprised of ohmic resistance as well as charge transfer resistance umar et al 2021 the semicircle s diameter and the impedance at the high frequency limit can be used to ascertain the r2 and r1 quan et al 2015 according to the nyquist plots the acetate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l had total internal resistance of 7 35 Ï r1 3 11 Ï and r2 4 24 Ï 11 53 Ï r1 4 38 Ï and r2 7 15 Ï 13 26 Ï r1 5 01 Ï and r2 8 25 Ï and 42 86 Ï r1 9 73 Ï and r2 33 13 Ï respectively fig 2e meanwhile the total internal resistance of lactate fed scmfcs at no3 n concentrations of 0 100 250 and 500 mg l were 9 28 Ï r1 3 86 and r2 5 42 16 90 Ï r1 5 81 Ï and r2 11 09 Ï 18 27 Ï r1 8 92 Ï and r2 9 35 Ï and 27 72 Ï r1 8 03 Ï and r2 19 69 Ï respectively fig 2f from these results it is clear that the scmfcs fed with 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n had a lower internal resistance indicating good electrochemical activity of note the charge transfer resistance reflects the electron transfer capability at the electrode surface li et al 2022 the charge transfer resistance obviously contributed to the majority of the total internal resistance of the scmfcs fed with 500 mg l no3 n indicating a decrease in mass and electron transfer ability ren et al 2019 the 500 mg l no3 n concentration increased the number of dead bacterial cells on the carbon brush electrodes thereby increasing the electron transport distance as well as charge transfer resistance amanze et al 2022a similarly wang et al 2022 also reported that an increase in the charge transfer resistance of a bes was caused by an accumulation of dead microbial cells on electrodes thus the drastic decrease in electricity production of 500 mg l no3 n fed scmfcs might be ascribed to the decline in viability and activity of the castellaniella species which hindered the eet process fig 7c and d depict the eps constituents of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs it was evident that the protein content was significantly greater than that of carbohydrates as protein was the essential constituent of eps with the increase in no3 n concentrations from 0 to 250 mg l the amounts of protein in acetate fed scmfcs slightly decreased from 158 93 8 65 to 143 03 7 05 mg cm2 respectively in contrast the carbohydrate fraction in the acetate fed scmfcs increased from 28 35 6 09 mg cm2 at 0 mg l no3 n to 64 81 4 83 mg cm2 at 500 mg l no3 n concentration a similar trend was also observed in lactate fed scmfcs where protein contents slightly decreased from 121 43 6 18 to 93 73 9 68 mg cm2 at no3 n concentrations of 0 to 250 mg l however at 500 mg l no3 n concentration the protein content of both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs decreased dramatically to 78 54 3 82 and 72 96 7 61 mg cm2 respectively heme uronic acid and edna exhibited comparable trends in addition to its crucial role in biofilm development eps influences electron transfer between microbial cells and electrodes yang et al 2020 several studies have suggested that low eps protein contents in anodic biofilms result in lower eet efficiency tan et al 2019 zakaria et al 2022 an earlier study discovered that higher carbohydrate levels hampered eet in anode biofilms li et al 2020 yang et al 2019b documented the decrease in current production in anode biofilms with high carbohydrate to protein ratios therefore it is possible that a decrease in eps protein content hindered electron transport between bacterial cells and electrodes thereby affecting the performance of scmfcs particularly those fed 500 mg l no3 n the key enzymes involved in no3 n reduction and power generation were quantified fig 7e and f the nr activity were 124 82 12 23 142 42 8 83 137 31 16 19 and 43 36 11 17 Âµmol h mg protein while that of nir were 85 29 11 96 112 54 17 02 117 96 15 69 and 51 70 10 23 Âµmol h mg protein for acetate fed scmfcs at 0 100 250 and 500 mg l no3 n concentrations respectively the above results indicate that 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations improved the production of nr and nir enzymes in the scmfcs containing the biofilms of the castellaniella species resulting in a significant reduction of no3 n in these systems the same trends were also observed in the lactate fed scmfcs it has been reported in the literature that the presence of no3 n improved the production of nr and nir in denitrifying bacteria which is consistent with our findings iwamoto et al 2001 of note nr catalyzes the conversion of no3 n to no2 n whereas nir catalyzes the reduction of no2 n to nitric oxide cytochrome c and nadh which mediate electron between electron transporters he et al 2021 were significantly higher at 0 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations than at 500 mg l no3 n concentrations for both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs implying that 500 mg l hindered the activities of these enzymes resulting in a decrease in power generation given that the electrochemical activity cell viability eps protein content and enzyme activities of both acetate and lactate fed scmfcs decreased drastically when no3 n concentrations exceeded 250 mg l a no3 n concentration of 250 mg l was chosen for subsequent experiments to minimize the negative effects of no3 n on the electroactive biofilms 3 3 cathodic metals recovery from on site smelting wastewater coupled with anodic denitrification the feasibility of simultaneously achieving heterotrophic anodic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery in a bes containing the mixed castellaniella species was investigated consequently the scmfcs were disassembled to construct dcmfcs with the enriched electroactive carbon brushes of these scmfcs serving as anodes in the dcmfcs the initial cod no3 n ratio was maintained at 3 2 1 which is within the range of the cod n ratio of most domestic wastewater zhao et al 2022 acetate was adopted as a substrate since it was the best electron donor for the mixed castellaniella species fig 8 a shows the changes in the heavy metals concentration in the bes catholyte with time the cu2 and hg2 in the smelting effluent were effectively recovered by the dcmfcs via electrodeposition on the cathode surface as they could thermodynamically accept the electrons successfully transferred from the electroactive anodes following the initiation of treatment after 24 h the concentration of cu2 in the catholyte of the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive anodic biofilm declined substantially from 183 19 mg l to 35 73 6 47 mg l with a recovery rate of 6 15 0 28 mg l h nevertheless as the concentration of cu2 in the cathodic medium decreased the cu2 recovery rate declined a much lesser cu2 recovery rate 0 99 0 18 mg l h was attained during the 24th and 60th h of treatment this result is in accordance with earlier research that found the rate of cu2 recovery to be related to the cu2 concentration in the cathodic solution wu et al 2015 in addition the copper recovered on the carbon cloth might have also declined subsequent cu2 recovery ai et al 2020 after 60 h nearly all the cu2 99 86 0 10 in smelting effluent was recovered by the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive biofilm of the mixed castellaniella species with only a trace amount 0 26 0 18 mg l remaining in the catholyte conversely the cu2 concentration in the catholyte of the abiotic dcmfcs was nearly unchanged it is noteworthy to mention that the cu2 removal efficiency attained in this work was greater than the 84 8 and 79 9 obtained in shewanella putrefaciens inoculated dcmfcs with initial cu2 concentrations of 50 ppm and 30 ppm respectively sumisha et al 2020 a previously published work also obtained a lower removal efficiency of 98 3 with scmfc which had an initial cu2 concentration of 12 5 mg l and whose anodic electroactive biofilms were predominated by acinetobacter and geobacter wu et al 2018 nonetheless ai et al 2020 achieved a slightly higher removal efficiency of 99 95 0 09 from synthetic smelting wastewater containing 184 78 mg l cu2 concentration using dcmfcs inoculated with pseudomonas sp e8 which could be attributed to the less complexity and ease of treatment of synthetic wastewater lim et al 2021 the catholyte s hg2 concentration was also monitored and it decreased throughout the dcmfcs treatment phase within 17 h the hg2 concentration in the catholyte of the dcmfcs comprising electroactive anode decreased from 78 44 mg l to 4 47 1 76 mg l an additional decline in hg2 concentration to 0 01 0 005 mg l was noticed in these dcmfcs at the end of the treatment phase 60 h a high hg2 removal efficiency and removal rate of 99 98 0 014 and 31 37 0 0028 mg l d respectively were achieved during the entire mfcs treatment stage this removal efficiency was higher than the 98 22 99 54 obtained in dcmfcs of a previous study whose cathodic chamber had initial hg2 concentrations of 25 50 and 100 mg l wang et al 2011 in another published study lower removal efficiency of 98 was reported for dcmfcs with an initial hg2 concentration of 10 mg l kumar et al 2020 it should be mentioned that the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive biofilm of the mixed castellaniella species attained a cod removal efficiency of 57 54 0 57 during the processes of cu2 and hg2 recovery fig 8c a peak current of 1 54 ma was attained signifying the flow of electrons from the dcmfc s anode to its cathode fig 8d the current measured in this work was higher than that recorded in previous studies 1 0 and 1 21 0 29 ma during synthetic wastewater treatment amanze et al 2022b tao et al 2011 which can be attributed to the higher conductivity of smelting wastewater samples due to the presence of inorganic ions hansen et al 2007 metal ion behavior is crucial to the improvement or deterioration of bes performance lu et al 2015 in this work the presence of alkali e g na and alkaline earth metal ions e g ca2 and mg2 in the smelting wastewater could have influenced the performance of the dcmfcs lim et al 2021 the ce of the dcmfcs was 11 36 0 16 which is comparable to the 12 reported by li et al 2008 suggesting that there was significant cod removal unrelated to electricity production as shown in fig 8e the anolyte effluent no3 n concentration was also measured at the end of the dcmfcs treatment phase results showed that the dcmfcs containing the electroactive anodes could achieve no3 n removal efficiency of 89 58 1 13 with an effluent concentration of 26 05 2 83 mg l meanwhile the no3 n concentration in the abiotic control group remained unchanged the concentration of no2 n was below 1 mg l in the anolyte of the dcmfcs after the treatment fig 8e and table s5 since the only electron acceptors in these dcmfcs cathodes were the heavy metals it is thus supposed that heterotrophic denitrification was the main no3 n removal pathway the average no3 n removal rate was 3 73 0 05 mg l h which was faster than the 1 7 mg l h achieved by streptomyces mediolani em b2 in previous research he et al 2022 in another study achromobacter sp a14 achieved much lower no3 n removal rates of 0 301 0 174 and 0 138 mg l h under heterotrophic mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions respectively su et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 previously reported no3 n removal rates of 1 77 0 31 mg l h and 0 324 mg l h via aerobic heterotrophic denitrification and aerobic autotrophic no3 n removal respectively with pseudomonas sp y39 6 therefore these results demonstrated that the mixed castellaniella species could efficiently remove no3 n in the dcmfcs and degrade substrates to generate sufficient electrons for cu2 and hg2 recovery from actual smelting wastewater the dcmfcs anodic medium had an original ph of 7 whiles the ph of the smelting wastewater was 2 38 however after the cu2 and hg2 were recovered the ph of the anodic medium dropped to 6 42 0 33 fig 8b whereas the ph of the treated smelting wastewater rose to 8 28 0 34 in the dcmfcs comprising the electroactive bioanode fig 8c this finding is consistent with a prior study which discovered that oxidation reaction in the anodic compartment generates h which lowers ph while h is consumed during reduction reaction in the cathodic compartment which raises ph wang et al 2020 the ph of the anodic medium did not decrease significantly because heterotrophic denitrification can provide the possibility to maintain the ph within the optimum range since the process creates a proton balance qambrani et al 2013 the concentration of pb2 and zn2 in the catholyte remained unchanged during the dcmfcs treatment phase this could be attributed to the fact that pb2 and zn2 possess lower reduction potentials equations 4 5 hence they cannot be reduced by mfc modin et al 2012 therefore the pb2 and zn2 were sequentially recovered at the dcmecs treatment phase via the application of steady voltages to the circuits optimal voltages were applied to prevent electroactive biofilms from being damaged briefly h2so4 was added to reduce the catholyte s ph to its initial value 2 38 and the anolyte was refilled the concentration of pb2 in the catholyte of the dcmecs comprising electroactive anodic biofilms declined substantially from 206 94 mg l to 13 47 0 011 mg l in 36 h following the application of a constant voltage of 1 0 v to the dcmecs circuit by a dc power supply in contrast the pb2 concentration in the smelting wastewater of the abiotic dcmecs remained unchanged a significant proportion of the pb2 93 49 0 005 in the on site smelting wastewater was recovered via electrodeposition at a rate of 5 37 0 002 mg l h much higher than the 0 53 mg l h obtained in a previous study with an initial concentration of 39 21 mg l bo et al 2014 colantonio and kim 2016 also achieved a much lesser removal efficiency of 62 2 in the cathode chamber of a mec which had low initial pb2 concentrations 1 2 5 mg l it should be highlighted that the zn2 concentration in the catholyte of the dcmecs containing the electroactive anode remained unchanged following the application of 1 0 v to the circuit which can be attributed to its significantly lower reduction potential consequently the catholyte ph was adjusted to its original value then the zn2 and the remaining pb2 were recovered in 24 h following the application of a constant voltage of 2 0 v since 2 0 v yielded the desired result without damaging the biological anode in previous research modin et al 2012 saad et al 2020 at the end of the dcmecs treatment phase the concentration of pb2 and zn2 decreased drastically from 13 47 0 011 mg l and 126 92 mg l to 0 032 0 028 mg l and 1 05 0 38 mg l respectively however there was only a marginal decrease in zn2 and pb2 concentration in the catholyte of the abiotic dcmecs which could be ascribed to adsorption by the membrane the bes containing the bioanode attained a pb2 removal efficiency of 99 98 0 01 at the end of the wastewater treatment 120 h meanwhile the zn2 removal efficiency from the catholyte was 99 17 0 30 exceeding the 98 7 0 7 attained in a bes assisted electrodeposition system whose catholyte had an initial concentration of 150 mg l zhang et al 2020 moreover the removal efficiency of zn2 obtained in this current study was even greater than the 96 and 90 5 achieved in earlier research with initial zinc concentrations of 1 9 mm and 15 9 mg l respectively alismaeel et al 2022 lim et al 2021 in recent work a much lower zn2 removal efficiency of 67 7 1 3 was obtained in a photo assisted bes fed with real etching terminal effluent containing 5 1 0 4 mg l zinc concentration sun et al 2022 during the recovery of pb2 and zn2 91 60 2 26 and 77 38 4 25 of no3 n and cod in the anolyte of the dcmecs were simultaneously removed respectively the no2 n concentration in the bes was less than 1 mg l table s5 the final anolyte ph after pb2 and zn2 recovery was 5 50 0 32 which is conducive to the growth of castellaniella species as previously reported amanze et al 2022b the reduction kinetics of the four heavy metals in the bes was investigated and it was discovered that they followed pseudo first order kinetics with the majority of the coefficients of determination exceeding 0 9 see text s4 for more details taken together these findings show that the mixed culture inoculum of the castellaniella species is promising for achieving simultaneous anodic heterotrophic denitrification and cathodic metals recovery 4 pb 2 2 e pb e o 0 126 v vs she 5 zn 2 2 e zn e o 0 763 v vs she 3 4 analysis of the heavy metals removal mechanisms to better comprehend the metal s recovery mechanisms we employed sem edxs xrd and xps to examine the cathodes of the bes following the smelting wastewater treatment the usual reddish brown color of elemental cu was primarily visible on the cathode of the dcmfcs comprising the bioelectroactive anode after the treatment of the smelting effluent fig s3 conversely the abiotic control s cathode electrode maintained its usual black color sem photographs of the cathode of the bes with an electroactive anode revealed different structures and morphologies fig s4 the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs with the electroactive anode was extensively covered by spherule shaped agglomerates while the abiotic dcmfcs cathode appeared plain subsequent edxs examination of the agglomerate composition revealed c o p hg ca and cu signals in the cathode electrodes of the dcmfcs with the bioelectroactive anodes while the elemental mapping further depicts the precise distribution in a comprehensible manner however the cathode of the abiotic dcmfcs lacked any of the treated metals and was made up of only c o and p irregular crystals made up of c o f and pb were present on the cathode surface of the dcmecs with a 1 0 v applied voltage meanwhile the primary elements identified on the cathode surface of the dcmecs with a 2 0 v input voltage were c o p pb and zn the presence of the elements p and f on the cathode of the bes could likely be traced back to the pretreatment of the carbon cloths with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe jiang et al 2020 or they might have originated from the smelting effluent along with ca fig 9 a depicts the xrd patterns after the treatment of the smelting wastewater with the bes the identical diffraction peaks observed in all cathodes at 17 9 and 26 2 correspond to c and ptfe binder respectively cui et al 2020 cu0 2Î¸ 43 3 and 50 4 cu2o 2Î¸ 36 43 and 42 31 and hgo 2Î¸ 28 4 and 57 3 peaks were observed in the xrd spectra of the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs containing the bioelectroactive anodes abdelrahman and hegazey 2019 das et al 2015 sahai et al 2016 thus these findings demonstrated that copper was recovered via electrodeposition as cu0 and cu whiles mercury was recovered as hg2 in the dcmfcs elemental hg could not be observed most likely due to the difficulty of its detection by the xrd technique bussi et al 2010 peaks of pb0 2Î¸ 31 3 36 3 52 3 and 62 1 were only identified on the cathode surface of dcmecs with an applied voltage of 1 0 v indicating that lead ions in the catholyte were recovered as metallic lead at this stage watanabe et al 2002 meanwhile the presence of distinctive peaks of zn0 2Î¸ 38 9 43 2 54 3 and 70 1 and pb0 2Î¸ 31 3 and 36 3 in the xrd pattern of the cathode of the dcmecs with an applied voltage of 2 0 v indicates the successful recovery of zn2 and pb2 in their metallic state cingarapu et al 2015 watanabe et al 2002 it is worth noting that none of the treated metals were detected by xrd on the carbon cloth of the abiotic bes which was clearly identical to the cathode prior to treatment xps was performed to further confirm the valence state of the cathodic deposits following the treatment of the smelting wastewater as shown in fig 9b the deconvoluted spectra of cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 situated at 932 6 and 952 6 ev in the cathodic surface of the dcmfcs containing the castellaniella species could be assigned to cu0 or cu2o li et al 2019 sarwar et al 2021 consistent with the xrd result furthermore the absence of satellite peaks in the cu 2p spectra further confirms that copper was successfully recovered in a more reduced form as previously reported cu2 could undergo two chemical processes while accepting electrons from the cathode of mfc tao et al 2011 one such process involves the acceptance of electrons directly to convert them into metallic states eq 6 whilst the other process involves the reaction of cu2 with water molecules while accepting electrons to form cu2o eq 7 it should be added that the rise in the catholyte ph and the decrease in the current generation of the dcmfcs at the latter phase of the treatment could have also led to the deposition of cu2o song et al 2019 6 c u 2 2 e cu 7 2 c u 2 h 2 o 2 e c u 2 o 2 h fig 9c illustrates the xps spectra of the recovered hg species the hg 4f7 2 electron spectra were effectively resolved into two doublets with binding energies be of 99 8 and 100 7 ev the line with the lowest be is assigned to hg0 whereas the line with the highest be is ascribed to hg2 wu et al 2014 the existence of metallic hg0 validated the dcmfc s ability to reduce hg2 of note hg0 and hg2 accounted for 50 8 and 49 2 of the recovered hg species respectively the potential pathways for the electrochemical reduction of the hg2 are shown in eqs 8 10 briefly the electroactive biofilms of the castellaniella species in the anodic region of the dcmfcs efficiently oxidized the acetate to produce electrons under anaerobic conditions the electrons were subsequently transported to the anode and then to the cathodic region through the circuit a portion of the hg2 gets directly reduced to hg0 by the electrons and subsequently attaches to the cathodic surface whereas the other portion is first converted to hg 2 2 and then further reduced to hg0 the deposition of hg2 on the cathodic surface probably occurred chemically the mechanism is unclear however it is most likely caused by high local ph generated by side reactions including hydrogen evolution eq 11 8 h g 2 2 e hg 9 2 h g 2 2 e hg 2 2 10 hg 2 2 2 e 2 hg 11 2 h 2 e h 2 the valence states of the pb and zn species recovered at the various dcmec treatment stages were also analyzed using xps the be of pb 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 orbitals of the cathodic surface of the dcmecs with an input voltage of 1 0 v were observed at 136 8 and 141 7 ev which corresponds to pb0 niu et al 2015 fig 9d similarly the pb 4f7 2 and 4f5 2 core levels of the cathode electrode of the dcmecs with an input voltage of 2 0 v likewise revealed the pb0 assigned be at 136 7 ev and 141 6 ev hong et al 2019 fig 9e meanwhile the zn 2p3 2 and zn 2p1 2 of the dcmecs with an applied voltage of 2 0 v had be of 1021 1 ev and 1044 2 ev respectively with a peak separation of 23 1 ev which is consistent with previously published values for zinc metal mai et al 2013 fig 9f therefore these results demonstrated that zn2 and pb2 in the catholyte of the dcmecs were successfully recovered via electrodeposition as zn0 and pb0 respectively which agrees with the xrd data 4 conclusion this study investigated the ability of a mixed inoculum of electricigenic castellaniella species to simultaneously perform heterotrophic denitrification and anodic respiration coupled with cathodic metal recovery in a bes first the impacts of different no3 n concentrations on the performance of the mixed castellaniella species in scmfcs were evaluated results showed that the electrochemical activity no3 n and cod removal efficiencies cell viability eps protein content and enzymatic activities of acetate and lactate fed scmfcs were not substantially affected by 100 and 250 mg l no3 n concentrations compared to 500 mg l no3 n acetate was the best electron donor for the castellaniella species to remove no3 n and generate electricity efficiently moreover bes inoculated with the mixed castellaniella species effectively performed heterotrophic anodic denitrification coupled with cathodic heavy metals recovery from on site smelting wastewater cu2 was effectively recovered as cu0 and cu2o via bioelectrochemical reduction on the cathodic surface whiles hg0 and hgo accounted for 50 8 and 49 2 of the hg species recovered via bioelectrochemical reduction and chemical deposition respectively furthermore pb2 and zn2 were bio electrochemically reduced to pb0 and zn0 respectively over 89 of no3 n was effectively removed from the bes anolyte during the recovery of the heavy metals overall these results demonstrate that castellaniella species are promising denitrifying exoelectrogens for enhancing power generation no3 n removal and heavy metals recovery efficiency of bes this study was carried out with lab scale bes thus its applicability on a larger scale is required declaration of competing

15118,flagella and their property would influence the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics yet their impacts have not been investigated in present study four types of e coli with or without flagella as well as with normal or sticky flagella were utilized to investigate the effects of flagella and their property on the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto six types of plastics in freshwater systems we found that e coli with flagella exhibited better initial attachment performance onto all six types of plastics than strain without flagella flagella could help bacteria swim near to plastics pierce the energy barrier and subsequently attach onto plastics with stronger adhesive force sticky flagella could further facilitate bacterial attachment onto plastics moreover flagella especially sticky flagella could help bacteria form more rigid attachment layer on plastics even with humic acid in suspensions or in river water flagellar e coli showed greater attachment onto plastics than e coli without flagella humic acid might adsorb onto sticky flagella and thus decreased the attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto plastics obviously flagella as well as their property would impact the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics and the subsequent formation of plastisphere in freshwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flagella flagellar property bacterial attachment plastic qcm d data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic products have been produced at a rapidly increasing rate in past decades duis et al 2021 sunantha et al 2022 however the recovery rate of plastics after their use was low which thus led to the ubiquitous presence of plastics in natural environments such as river lake ocean sediment as well as soil wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 plastics present in nature enviroments have been shown to be able to enrich inorganic organic contaminations which would enhance the potential toxicity of plastics and increase their potential ecological risks mato et al 2001 richard et al 2019 rochman et al 2013 in addition to enriching pollutants previous studies found that plastics could also enrich bacteria via serving as ideal habitats for their colonization and growth grogan et al 2021 kirstein et al 2019 qiang et al 2021a wu et al 2019 zettler et al 2013 for instance kirstein et al 2019 found that plastics with particular properties in marine environment could enrich specific microorganisms such as those can grow under limited carbon resources qiang et al 2021a reported that bacteria could also attach onto plastics and form biofilm in freshwater environment previous study wu et al 2019 showed that comparing with other natural substrates such as leaf and rock plastics exhibited greater enrichment capacity for potential pathogens which would enhance the potential risks of plastics to human health and ecosystem it is thus crucial to understand the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics regardless that many studies have focused on understanding the microbial colonization biofilm formation behaviors onto plastics in marine environment grogan et al 2021 kirstein et al 2019 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 zettler et al 2013 studies of microbial colonization on microplastics in freshwater system yet were limited miao et al 2019 qiang et al 2021a note that freshwater ecosystems have become the susceptible sinks of plastics koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 qiang et al 2021b therefore it is necessary to fully understand the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in freshwater system moreover previous studies mostly investigated the long term interaction at least more than 2 weeks between bacteria and plastics either in marine or in freshwater systems however the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics within a few hours that greatly influence the following formation of biofilm yet was rarely reported many previous studies have shown that bacterial surface properties such as surface charge and surface hydrophobicity being affected by the extracellular biopolymer component greatly influence the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto solid surfaces such as quartz sand silica surfaces as well as polydimethylsiloxane surfaces berne et al 2018 tong et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 flagella important organelles of bacteria controlling the motility of bacteria have also previously been shown to greatly affect the attachment of bacteria onto quartz sand haznedaroglu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 in addition flagellar property recently has also been found to significantly influence the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto sand surfaces zhang et al 2021 flagella and their property definitely would also affect the attachment of bacteria onto plastics however to the best of our knowledge the influence of flagella as well as their property on the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in aqueous systems i e freshwater systems yet has not been previously explored to fill this knowledge gap e coli mg1655 with flagella and its homologous genic modified strain e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella were utilized to unravel the impact of flagella on initial bacterial attachment behaviors onto plastics while e coli rp437 with normal flagella and its homologous genic mutant e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella which can express stickier fiber were utilized to evaluate the significance of flagellar property on bacterial attachment behaviors six types of plastics including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps were used as representative plastics commonly present in natural environments plastics europe 2022 attachment batch experiments within 4 h were conducted in simulated sterile electrolyte solutions at 5 and 25 mm nacl conditions representing relatively low and high ionic strength in actual freshwater respectively wu et al 2018 he et al 2020 moreover quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d system was employed to investigate the attachment mechanism of e coli impacted by the presence absence of flagella and the property of flagella in addition attachment behaviors of four e coli strains onto plastics in simulated aqueous solutions with coexisted humic acid ha 0 1 and 1 mg l as representative natural organic matter common present in actual water samples as well as in actual river water samples were also conducted the results showed that flagella and their property significantly influenced the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto all six types of plastics in freshwater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 plastics in present study six types of plastics including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps were used as representative plastics commonly present in natural environment due to their broad production and high volume usage andrady 2011 plastics europe 2022 among them pp pe pvc and ps were purchased from yesheng plastic factory guangdong china pet and pu were provided by yelong plastic factory guangdong china and oupli factory jiangsu china respectively each type of plastics was cut into 2 cm 2 cm squares with 0 5 cm thickness before experiments these plastics were washed with 75 ethanol and sterilized ultrapure water more than 5 times to ensure no additional impurities or microorganisms on their surfaces and then air dried for the subsequent use the ftir spectra of all these six types of plastics can be found in fig s1 2 2 cell preparation due to its easy cultivation and mature genetic modification technology as well as its ubiquitous presence in natural environment e coli was employed as model bacterial strain in present study to explore the influence of flagella and their property on bacterial attachment behaviors onto plastics to eliminate the impact from other factors such as bacterial zeta potentials size and extracellular polymeric substance e coli with flagella and its isogenic mutant without flagella without chromosomal gene flic named as e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic respectively as well as e coli with normal flagella and its isogenic mutant with sticky flagella that can express the sticky filament flicst named as e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst respectively were employed in present study detailed information about all four e coli as well as the bacterial culture and collection protocol has been reported previously zhang et al 2021 and also provided in the supplementary materials the bacterial stock suspension 109 1010 cells ml was diluted to the target concentration of 1 0 108 10 cells ml or 1 5 108 10 for the following attachment experiments the detailed information regarding why we chose this bacterial concentration was provided in supplementary materials 2 3 bacterial attachment experiments the attachment performance of four types of e coli strains onto plastics was tested via batch experiments in nacl solutions specifically 20 ml bacterial suspension 1 0 108 10 cells ml with given ionic strength and one plastic slide was put into a 50 ml sterile glass conical flask due to the presence of different types of cations with relative high concentration of monovalent cations and the variation of solution ionic strengths in different natural aqueous environment vengosh et al 2005 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions ph 6 were utilized to simulate the background electrolyte solutions to represent low and high ionic strength conditions respectively after interaction in a constant temperature shaker at 200 rpm and room temperature for 4 h the plastic with attached bacteria was gently taken out of the flask by a sterilized tweezer prior to air dried in the super clean worktable the plastic was rinsed with sterilized phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 2 7 4 solution for 3 times to remove the unattached bacteria the crystal violet staining assay which has previously been employed to analyze the biomass attached onto collectors zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 was used to determine the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics specifically after attachment experiment the plastic was transferred into a 50 ml sterilized centrifuge tube with 15 ml 0 1 w w crystal violet to dye the e coli adhered onto plastic surface for 20 min at room temperature after that the sterilized pbs solution was used to remove the extra crystal violet on stained plastic which was then air dried in the super clean worktable following that the stained bacteria attached onto plastic were completely eluted into 5 ml absolute ethanol the absorbance of the solution was finally measured at 595 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd which represented the amount of bacteria attached onto plastics each attachment experiment was performed in triplicate the linear correlation between the absorbance of the ultimate solution and the amount of adherent bacteria counted by using a counting chamber buerker tuerk chamber marienfeld laboratory glassware germany with an inverted fluorescent ti e microscope nikon japan under a bright field in 5 mm nacl solutions can be found in figs s2 and s3 to further investigate the roles of flagella and their property on attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics the attachment experiments of mixed bacteria e coli mg1655 with flagella with e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella and e coli rp437 with normal flagella with e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto different types of plastics in 5 mm nacl solutions representative solution condition were also performed moreover to figure out the relative contribution of two strains in the mixed bacteria to the attachment onto plastics e coli mg1655 or e coli rp437 flicst were firstly stained using fluorescent stains syto 9 baclight cell viability kit invitrogen before the attachment experiments of mixed bacteria onto pp representative plastic details about the attachment experiments of mixed cells were presented in the supplementary materials to determine the influence of coexisting ha representative natural organic matter nom 0 1 and 1 mg l ha was added into salt solution note that the concentration of ha in natural waters is in a wide range from dozens of Î¼g l to dozens of mg l yamada et al 2000 0 1 and 1 mg l ha was respectively utilized as representative low and high nom concentration to explore the influence of nom on the attachment of bacteria onto plastics in present study plastics placed in background solutions with or without ha were used as control to further investigate the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in real water samples the attachment experiments of four types of e coli strains in river water samples were also examined the detailed information of river water was provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 qcm d experiments the deposition kinetics of four e coli strains were evaluated via utilization of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation system qcm d q sense ab gothenburg sweden with pp as representative coated sensor batch 20l171 purchased from q sense ab company the qcm d system was pre equilibrated with desired salt solution 5 mm nacl and ph 6 for a minimum of 30 min to establish a stable baseline the shift of average normalized frequency was less than 0 2 hz within 30 min after pre equilibration prepared bacterial suspensions 1 5 108 10 cells ml ph 6 at ionic strength of 5 mm nacl were pumped into the crystal sensor chamber at 0 1 ml min by using a peristaltic pump ismatec switzerland the duration of injection lasted for at least 4 h the detailed information of qcm d experiments was shown in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of flagella on initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics regardless the presence or absence of flagella both e coli strains exhibited better attachment performance onto plastics at higher ionic strength is than low is as shown by the higher bacterial absorbance onto all six types of plastics pp pe pvc pu pet and ps in 25 mm nacl solution than in 5 mm nacl solution fig 1 the higher bacterial attachment at high is could be explained by the results of zeta potentials table s1 and dlvo interaction force fig s4 previous studies also found that increasing is could lead to greater attachment deposition of bacteria onto quartz sand plastics he et al 2020 janjaroen et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 although previous study has shown that the intrinsic surface properties of plastics particular the hardness of plastics could affect bacterial attachment performance onto plastics cai et al 2019 e coli mg1655 absorbances onto all six types of plastics employed in present study were higher than those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic at same is in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions fig 1 the observation indicated that regardless of the plastics type e coli mg1655 with flagella could attach onto plastic surfaces more easily than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella clearly the presence of flagella promoted the attachment of e coli onto plastics as expected the absorbances of mixed cells half e coli mg1655 with flagella and half e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella onto all six plastics were higher than those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella yet were lower than those of e coli mg1655 with flagella fig s5 further analysis of the mixed bacteria attached onto representative plastics pp via inverted fluorescence microscope showed that both types of bacterial strains could attach onto plastics yet the percentage of attached e coli mg1655 with flagella 61 2 6 7 stained by green fluorescent dye was higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella figs s6a and s6b the observations further confirmed that flagella present on bacteria surfaces could promote the attachment of e coli onto plastics previous studies also showed that motile bacteria with flagella could more easily attach onto quartz sand than nonmotile strain without flagella haznedaroglu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 3 2 mechanisms for the altered attachment of e coli by flagella the viability of bacteria might affect their attachment onto collector asadishad et al 2014 ngwenya et al 2015 we found that at both is more than 95 of both strains were viable table s1 the cell viability thus could not cause the higher attachment of bacteria with flagella onto plastic surfaces both sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria have previously been shown to affect bacteria attachment onto collectors bai et al 2016 bartley et al 2013 janjaroen et al 2013 li et al 2019 wu et al 2018 however at same solution condition the hydrodynamic diameter as well as zeta potentials of e coli mg1655 with flagella were comparable to those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella table s1 the interaction forces between plastics and bacteria thus were comparable for two strains fig s4 the higher attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto all six plastics than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella thus could not be theoretically explained by the dlvo or extended dlvo interaction forces interestingly we found that e coli mg1655 with flagella exhibited more hydrophobic than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella as indicated by the higher contact angle with water for e coli mg1655 than e coli mg1655 Î´flic table s3 zhang et al 2021 previous studies showed that comparing with hydrophilic bacteria hydrophobic bacteria could attach onto collectors more easily bartley et al 2013 marcus et al 2012 vanloosdrecht et al 1987 thus for all six plastics the attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto plastic surfaces was greater than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions e coli mg1655 with flagella could swim faster than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella fig 2 the representative trajectory of both strains movie s1 showed that e coli mg1655 with flagella were able to swim with relatively fast speed in the liquid phase 8 41 4 25 Î¼m s while e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella could only follow brownian motion in situ 0 51 0 32 Î¼m s the faster moving speed of e coli with flagella could increase the moving radius of cell thus enhance the collision chance of bacteria with plastics flagella presented on the surfaces of e coli mg1655 could help the cell move near to plastics leading to the greater attachment of e coli mg1655 onto all six plastics than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella the higher attachment of bacteria with higer motility onto collectors has also been reported previously de kerchove and elimelech 2008 gutman et al 2013 hori and matsumoto 2010 zhang et al 2021 moreover previous study has shown that flagella could pierce the energy barrier present between bacteria and collector leading to the attachment of bacteria onto collector surface hori and matsumoto 2010 note that flagella presented on the surfaces of e coli mg1655 was around 6 15 Î¼m long while energy barrier between cells and plastics located at 0 2 2 nm from plastics based on the calculation results of dlvo and xdlvo theories fig s4 clearly flagella might also help e coli mg1655 pierce the energy barrier between bacteria and plastics leading to the attachment of bacteria onto plastics the greater attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto plastics relative to e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella thus was achieved qcm d system was also used to compare the attachment behaviors of both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic onto plastics pp one of the most widely used plastics was utilized as representative plastic in the qcm d system we found that during the 4 h attachment experiments for e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic Î´f of pp coated sensor decreased to 43 31 hz and 29 54 hz respectively figs 3 a and b the observation indicated that attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto pp surface was higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella similar to the observations in batch experiments flagella could promote bacteria attach onto flat plastic surfaces in qcm d system comparison of Î´d an indicator to present the viscoelasticity of the deposited bacterial layer of two strains showed that Î´d for e coli mg1655 with flagella 1 4 10 6 was notably lower than that for e coli mg1655 Î´flic 4 1 10 6 figs 3a and 3b the observation indicated that bacteria with flagella could form more rigid layer on the flat pp surface than the strain without flagella for both two strains the ratio of dissipation vs frequency shifts Î´d Î´f that has been previously employed to further assess the viscoelasticity of the adhesive bacterial layer on the qcm d sensor was also determined previous studies pointed out that the low Î´d Î´f represented rigid and compact deposition whereas relatively high Î´d Î´f meant the deposited layer was soft and swollen gutman et al 2013 jin et al 2021 it is worth noting that the slope of Î´d Î´f for both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic did not remain constant yet changed during the overall deposition process figs 3c and d specifically the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 with flagella decreased from 0 071 10 6 hz for the first 0 5 h of attachment duration to 0 018 10 6 hz for the following 3 5 h attachment experimental duration fig 3c the observation indicated that bacterial layer of e coli mg1655 formed on the pp coated sensor became more and more rigid during the whole attachment process the attached flagellar cell layer onto plastics might compress over time via the gradual removal of water present between attached bacteria and pp coated sensor and then tightly bounded with plastic surfaces due to the increase of interaction force between flagella and plastic friedlander et al 2015 gutman et al 2013 in contrast the corresponding slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella increased from 0 095 10 6 hz for the first 0 5 h of attachment duration to 0 183 10 6 hz for the following 3 5 h attachment process fig 3d this indicated that the bacterial layer of e coli mg1655 Î´flic with flagella became looser with increasing attachment duration we speculate that due to the continuous collision of moving bacteria in suspension with bacteria attached on pp coated sensor the deposition layer of bacteria without flagella could become softer over time moreover comparison the slope of Î´d Î´f for both strains showed that at the early attachment stage the first 0 5 h of attachment duration the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 0 071 10 6 hz was lower than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 095 10 6 hz the observation indicated that flagella present on bacteria could promote the formation of more rigid bacterial layer on the pp coated sensor during the initial deposition process with further increasing attachment duration the following 3 5 h attachment experimental duration the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 0 018 10 6 hz was significantly lower than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 183 10 6 hz clearly bacteria with flagella could form more rigid layer on the pp coated sensor relative to bacteria without flagella and the bacterial layer became more and more rigid with increasing attachment duration the above observations showed that flagella not only could favor e coli attachment onto the pp flat surface but also could facilitate the formation of more rigid bacterial layer onto plastic surfaces 3 3 effect of flagellar property on attachment behaviors of bacteria on plastics zeta potentials of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella at high is were less negative than those at low is table s1 accordingly the repulsive interaction force between bacteria and plastics decreased with increasing is fig s8 the amounts of both strains attached onto all six plastics at high is thus were greater than those at low is as indicated by the higher absorbances for two types of cells onto all six plastic surfaces in 25 mm salt solutions than those in 5 mm nacl solutions fig 4 at the same solution condition the absorbances of e coli rp437 flicst adhered onto all six types of plastics were significantly higher relative to those of e coli rp437 indicating that e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella could attach onto all six plastics more easily than e coli rp437 with normal flagella clearly sticky flagella favored bacterial attachment onto plastics as expected the absorbances of mixed e coli rp437 with normal flagella with e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics were higher than those of e coli rp437 yet were lower than those of e coli rp437 flicst fig s7 moreover analysis of the mixed bacteria attached onto representative plastics pp via inverted fluorescence microscope showed that both types of bacteria strains could attach onto plastics with higher percentage 78 8 9 5 of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto pp surfaces relative to e coli rp437 with normal flagella figs s6c and s6d the results further confirmed that comparing with bacteria with normal flagella it was easier for bacteria with sticky flagella to attach onto plastics the greater attachment of bacteria with more sticky flagella than that with normal flagella onto quartz sand has also been observed previously which was attributed to the great adhesive force of sticky flagella onto quartz sand zhang et al 2021 3 4 mechanisms driving to the altered attachment by flagellar property the high viabilities of both e coli rp437 flicst and e coli rp437 95 table s1 could not explain the different attachment behaviors observed for these two strains at the same solution condition zeta potentials were comparable between two strains while the average sizes of bacteria with sticky flagella were slightly smaller than those with normal flagella table s1 the energy barrier between e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella and plastics thus was slightly higher than that between e coli rp437 with normal flagella and plastics at the same solution condition figs s8a and b which could not explain the higher attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella similarly the different attachment performance of two strains onto plastics could not be explained by their hydrophobic hydrophilic property since e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella were more hydrophilic than e coli rp437 with normal flagella zhang et al 2021 at the same solution condition the swimming speeds and movement trajectories of two strains were comparable fig 2b and movie s2 which could not support the higher attachment of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto plastics than that of e coli rp437 with normal flagella nevertheless xdlvo theory with consideration of lewis acid base force showed that the presence of sticky flagella decreased energy barrier between bacteria and plastics figs s8c and d which theoretically supported the higher attachment of e coli rp437 flicst onto plastic surfaces relative to e coli rp437 the attachment behaviors of these two strains with different flagellar properties were further examined via qcm d system with pp coated sensors during the 4 h attachment duration Î´f of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella and e coli rp437 with normal flagella decreased to 57 8 hz and 34 4 hz respectively figs 5 a and b the observation indicated that during the same attachment duration the amount of e coli with sticky flagella attached onto flat pp surfaces was larger than that of e coli with normal flagella consistent with the results of batch attachment experiments sticky flagella also promoted bacterial attachment onto plastic surfaces in qcm d system the greater attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto silica coated sensors than bacteria with normal flagella in qcm d system has also been reported previously zhang et al 2021 for both strains the slope of Î´d Î´f decreased with increasing attachment duration figs 5c and d specifically the slope of Î´d Î´f for bacteria with normal flagella decreased from 0 118 10 6 hz for the first 15 min of attachment duration to 0 034 10 6 hz for the following 3 h attachment experimental duration fig 5c meanwhile the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella decreased from 0 030 10 6 hz during the first 25 min to 0 024 10 6 hz during the following 3 h attachment duration fig 5d the observations indicated that for both strains their bacterial layer attached onto flat pp surfaces became more rigid with increasing experimental process the attachment patterns were consistent with that of another bacteria strain with flagella e coli mg1655 observed in qmc d system figs 3c and d although Î´d for e coli rp437 1 3 10 6 hz and e coli rp437 flicst 1 4 10 6 hz was similar figs 5a and b the overall slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst was lower than that of e coli rp437 figs 5c and d the observation suggested that comparing with bacteria containing normal flagella bacteria with sticky flagella attached onto flat pp surfaces could form more rigid bacterial layer it should be noted that comparing with that of e coli rp437 with normal flagella the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella showed only slight decrease during the whole attachment experimental duration due to the stronger adhesive force sticky flagella could form stronger bonds with plastics and form more rigid layer onto pp surfaces even during the initial attachment duration the first 15 min via more efficiently release of water between cell plastic interfaces than bacteria with normal flagella during experimental process the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst therefore only slightly decreased with increasing attachment duration clearly sticky flagella not only could promote bacteria attachment onto plastics but also would lead to the formation of more rigid bacterial layer onto plastic surfaces 3 5 bacterial attachment performance in the presence of humic acid similar to those observed without ha the amounts of e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella attached onto all six plastics at high is were higher than those at low is when 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspensions indicated by the higher absorbances of bacteria attached onto plastics with ha in 25 mm nacl solutions than those in 5 mm nacl solutions fig 6 versus fig s9 for both e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella absorbances of bacteria onto all six plastics with either 0 1 or 1 mg l ha in suspensions figs 6 and s9 were relatively lower than those without ha fig 1 for instance the absorbance of e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic attached onto pp surfaces in 5 mm nacl solutions without the copresence of ha was 0 171 0 028 and 0 059 0 029 respectively fig 1 whereas the corresponding absorbance of two strains with 0 1 mg l ha was 0 103 0 003 and 0 039 0 001 respectively fig 6 when the concentration of ha increased to 1 mg l the corresponding absorbances of e coli with and without flagella further decreased to 0 046 0 005 and 0 033 0 001 respectively fig 6 clearly ha inhibited the attachment of both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic onto plastics previous studies found that ha coexisting in suspension would compete attachment sites with bacteria via attaching onto collectors inhibiting the attachment of bacteria onto quartz sand foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012 ha coexisting in suspensions might adsorb onto plastic surfaces reducing the attachment of bacteria onto plastics to verify adsorption batch experiments of 1 mg l ha by pp as representative plastic in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions were conducted comparing with that of initial ha prior to the adsorption experiments the fluorescent intensity of suspended ha in solutions after 4 h adsorption experiments by plastics at both solution conditions was obviously reduced fig s10 the observation indicated that partial ha adsorbed onto the surfaces of plastics during the adsorption experiments which thus would reduce the sites for bacteria attachment ha might also adsorb onto bacterial surfaces changing the sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria and thus affecting attachment of bacteria onto plastics the reduced fluorescent intensity of suspended ha after 4 h adsorption experiment by bacteria relative to that without adsorption by bacteria confirmed the adsorption of ha onto bacteria surfaces fig s10 for both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic their sizes and zeta potentials were affected by ha specifically ha either 0 1 mg l or 1 mg l decreased the average sizes of two bacterial strains and negatively increased the zeta potentials of two strains table s1 the energy barrier between bacteria and plastics when 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspensions thus was higher than that without ha figs s11 and s12 which theoretically supported the observation that decreased bacteria attachment onto plastics was obtained with ha in suspensions previous studies found that steric repulsion induced by portion of ha suspended in solutions contributed to the decreased attachment of bacteria onto sand surfaces yang et al 2016 2012 since partial ha also suspended in salt solutions the steric repulsion induced by this portion of ha would also cause the reduced bacteria attachment onto plastics the results of moving speeds of both strains without ha fig 2a versus the corresponding ones with ha in suspension fig s13 showed that the presence of ha also decreased the moving speed of both strains however even with coexisting 1 mg l ha in cell suspensions the movement speed of e coli mg1655 2 50 1 21 Î¼m s was still higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 35 0 25 Î¼m s in 25 mm nacl solutions fig s13 as stated above the faster moving speed of e coli mg1655 with flagella could help the cell move faster near to plastics and enhance the collision chance of bacteria with plastics leading to the greater attachment onto plastics thus the amounts of e coli mg1655 with flagella attached onto all six types of plastics in both low and high is solutions with ha in suspensions were still greater than those of bacteria without flagella as indicated by the higher absorbances of e coli mg1655 with flagella attached onto plastics relative to those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic with ha in cell solutions figs 6 and s9 the observations indicated that regardless of the presence or absence of ha in suspensions flagella still favor bacteria moving near to plastics and the subsequent attaching onto plastics the attachment performance of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics with coexisting either 0 1 or 1 mg l ha was also examined in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions similar to the observations for e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella attachment of both e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics when ha coexisted in suspensions figs 7 and s14 was lower than that without ha coexisting in suspensions fig 4 this was true in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions clearly ha also decreased attachment of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics the decreased attachment of bacteria onto plastics with ha was consistent with the decreased moving speeds of e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst with ha in suspensions fig s13 versus fig 2b like those of e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella the competition attachment sites via ha attachment onto plastic surfaces fig s10 the increased energy barrier resulted from decreasing sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria via attachment of ha onto cell surfaces figs s11 and s12 table s1 as well as steric repulsion induced by suspended ha all would contribute to the decreased bacteria attachment for bacteria with normal sticky flagella onto plastics with ha coexisting in solutions with 0 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspension the amounts of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto all six types of plastics in both low and high is solutions were still greater than those of e coli rp437 with normal flagella as indicated by the higher absorbances of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto plastics relative to those of e coli rp437 even in the presence of 0 1 mg l ha figs 7 and s14 however unlike the greater attachment of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella than e coli rp437 with normal flagella in salt solution without ha and with 0 1 mg l ha attachment behaviors of these two strains onto plastics with coexisting 1 mg l ha were similar at the same is condition this was true for all six types of plastics the observation showed that ha of 1 mg l concentration could diminish the effects of flagellar property on bacterial attachment onto plastics the results of adhesive force tests showed that without ha in suspension e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella contained greater adhesive force than e coli rp437 with normal flagella fig s15 although 0 1 mg l ha slightly reduced the adhesive forces of these two strains bacteria with sticky flagella still exhibited stronger adhesive force than those with normal flagella fig s15 which was consistent with the relatively higher attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto plastics relative to bacteria with normal flagella even with the presence of 0 1 mg l ha interestingly adhesive forces of these two strains were similar when the concentration of coexisting ha increased to 1 mg l fig s15 agreed with the similar attachment behaviors of e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst onto plastics with 1 mg l ha in suspensions clearly the change of bacterial adhesive forces induced by the presence of ha could explain the attachment behaviors of two strains onto plastics the results suggested that ha could adsorb onto flagella reducing the adhesive force of sticky flagella onto plastics as a result comparable attachment onto plastics was obtained for two strains with different flagellar properties with 1 mg l ha in suspensions 3 6 bacterial attachment performance in river water samples the attachment behaviors of all four tested e coli strains with without flagella as well as with normal sticky flagella onto six types of plastics in actual river water samples from xiaojiahe river beijing china were also investigated similar to the results observed with ha coexisting in salt solutions e coli mg1655 with flagella still exhibited better attachment performance onto all plastics relative to e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella in actual river water fig 8 specifically the absorbance of e coli with flagella attached onto pp pe pvc pu pet and ps in river water was 0 051 0 002 0 044 0 003 0 034 0 001 0 033 0 002 0 031 0 002 and 0 045 0 004 respectively whereas that of e coli without flagella was 0 036 0 002 0 029 0 004 0 018 0 004 0 024 0 001 0 022 0 002 and 0 024 0 004 respectively apparently flagella could also promote bacteria attachment onto plastics in actual river water nevertheless the attachment performance of two strains with different flagellar properties onto plastics was comparable in river water the observation indicated that flagellar property did not have great influence on the attachment of bacteria onto plastics in actual river water table s2 showed that river water contained 5 67 mg c l toc which indicated the presence of organic matter in actual river water we speculate that similar to ha organic matter present in river water might also adsorb onto sticky flagella of cells and thus reduced their adhesive interaction with plastics the results clearly showed that the role of flagellar property on bacterial attachment onto plastics would be diminished by the organic matter coexisting in water 4 conclusion in present study the effects of flagella and their property onto six types of plastics were systematically examined we found that flagella and their property had great influence on the adhesive behaviors of e coli onto plastics in 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions e coli with flagella exhibited better attachment performance onto plastics relative to e coli without flagella in salt solutions moreover comparing with e coli without flagella e coli with flagella tended to form more rigid bacterial layer on pp coated surfaces via increasing the moving radius of bacteria piercing the energy barrier between cells and plastics flagella would favor bacteria moving faster near to plastic surfaces and help their attachment onto plastics moreover sticky flagella with stronger adhesive force could further promote e coli attach onto plastics in salt solutions bacteria with sticky flagella could form more rigid bacterial adhesive layer on plastic surfaces relative to normal flagella the attachment of bacteria regardless the presence absence of flagella or flagellar property onto all six types of plastics greatly reduced when ha coexisted in salt solutions the competition attachment sites via ha adsorption onto plastic surfaces the increased energy barrier resulted from decreasing sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria via attachment of ha onto cell surfaces as well as steric repulsion induced by suspended ha contributed to the decreased bacteria attachment onto plastics with ha coexisting in solutions however even with 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisting in salt solutions e coli with flagella showed better attachment performance onto plastics comparing with e coli without flagella although e coli with sticky flagella exhibited greater attachment onto plastics than e coli with normal flagella with 0 1 mg l ha coexisting in solutions the influence of flagellar property stickiness on bacterial attachment onto plastics yet was eliminated by 1 mg l ha co present in suspensions the reduced adhesive force of sticky flagella due to the adsorption of ha might drive to the reduced attachment of bacteria onto plastics with ha in suspensions the attachment performance of flagellar e coli onto plastics was still greater than that of e coli without flagella in actual river water whereas organic matter present in actual river water also diminished the effects of flagellar property onto bacteria attachment onto plastics clearly bacterial flagella could favor the colonization of bacteria onto plastics in natural environment in contrast contribution of bacteria with sticky flagella to the formation of biofilm onto plastics might be similar to those with normal flagella as natural organic

15118,flagella and their property would influence the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics yet their impacts have not been investigated in present study four types of e coli with or without flagella as well as with normal or sticky flagella were utilized to investigate the effects of flagella and their property on the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto six types of plastics in freshwater systems we found that e coli with flagella exhibited better initial attachment performance onto all six types of plastics than strain without flagella flagella could help bacteria swim near to plastics pierce the energy barrier and subsequently attach onto plastics with stronger adhesive force sticky flagella could further facilitate bacterial attachment onto plastics moreover flagella especially sticky flagella could help bacteria form more rigid attachment layer on plastics even with humic acid in suspensions or in river water flagellar e coli showed greater attachment onto plastics than e coli without flagella humic acid might adsorb onto sticky flagella and thus decreased the attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto plastics obviously flagella as well as their property would impact the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics and the subsequent formation of plastisphere in freshwater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords flagella flagellar property bacterial attachment plastic qcm d data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic products have been produced at a rapidly increasing rate in past decades duis et al 2021 sunantha et al 2022 however the recovery rate of plastics after their use was low which thus led to the ubiquitous presence of plastics in natural environments such as river lake ocean sediment as well as soil wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 xiong et al 2018 plastics present in nature enviroments have been shown to be able to enrich inorganic organic contaminations which would enhance the potential toxicity of plastics and increase their potential ecological risks mato et al 2001 richard et al 2019 rochman et al 2013 in addition to enriching pollutants previous studies found that plastics could also enrich bacteria via serving as ideal habitats for their colonization and growth grogan et al 2021 kirstein et al 2019 qiang et al 2021a wu et al 2019 zettler et al 2013 for instance kirstein et al 2019 found that plastics with particular properties in marine environment could enrich specific microorganisms such as those can grow under limited carbon resources qiang et al 2021a reported that bacteria could also attach onto plastics and form biofilm in freshwater environment previous study wu et al 2019 showed that comparing with other natural substrates such as leaf and rock plastics exhibited greater enrichment capacity for potential pathogens which would enhance the potential risks of plastics to human health and ecosystem it is thus crucial to understand the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics regardless that many studies have focused on understanding the microbial colonization biofilm formation behaviors onto plastics in marine environment grogan et al 2021 kirstein et al 2019 lobelle and cunliffe 2011 zettler et al 2013 studies of microbial colonization on microplastics in freshwater system yet were limited miao et al 2019 qiang et al 2021a note that freshwater ecosystems have become the susceptible sinks of plastics koelmans et al 2019 li et al 2020 qiang et al 2021b therefore it is necessary to fully understand the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in freshwater system moreover previous studies mostly investigated the long term interaction at least more than 2 weeks between bacteria and plastics either in marine or in freshwater systems however the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics within a few hours that greatly influence the following formation of biofilm yet was rarely reported many previous studies have shown that bacterial surface properties such as surface charge and surface hydrophobicity being affected by the extracellular biopolymer component greatly influence the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto solid surfaces such as quartz sand silica surfaces as well as polydimethylsiloxane surfaces berne et al 2018 tong et al 2010 zhu et al 2020 flagella important organelles of bacteria controlling the motility of bacteria have also previously been shown to greatly affect the attachment of bacteria onto quartz sand haznedaroglu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 in addition flagellar property recently has also been found to significantly influence the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto sand surfaces zhang et al 2021 flagella and their property definitely would also affect the attachment of bacteria onto plastics however to the best of our knowledge the influence of flagella as well as their property on the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in aqueous systems i e freshwater systems yet has not been previously explored to fill this knowledge gap e coli mg1655 with flagella and its homologous genic modified strain e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella were utilized to unravel the impact of flagella on initial bacterial attachment behaviors onto plastics while e coli rp437 with normal flagella and its homologous genic mutant e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella which can express stickier fiber were utilized to evaluate the significance of flagellar property on bacterial attachment behaviors six types of plastics including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps were used as representative plastics commonly present in natural environments plastics europe 2022 attachment batch experiments within 4 h were conducted in simulated sterile electrolyte solutions at 5 and 25 mm nacl conditions representing relatively low and high ionic strength in actual freshwater respectively wu et al 2018 he et al 2020 moreover quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d system was employed to investigate the attachment mechanism of e coli impacted by the presence absence of flagella and the property of flagella in addition attachment behaviors of four e coli strains onto plastics in simulated aqueous solutions with coexisted humic acid ha 0 1 and 1 mg l as representative natural organic matter common present in actual water samples as well as in actual river water samples were also conducted the results showed that flagella and their property significantly influenced the initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto all six types of plastics in freshwater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 plastics in present study six types of plastics including polypropylene pp polyethylene pe polyvinyl chloride pvc polyurethane pu polyethylene terephthalate pet and polystyrene ps were used as representative plastics commonly present in natural environment due to their broad production and high volume usage andrady 2011 plastics europe 2022 among them pp pe pvc and ps were purchased from yesheng plastic factory guangdong china pet and pu were provided by yelong plastic factory guangdong china and oupli factory jiangsu china respectively each type of plastics was cut into 2 cm 2 cm squares with 0 5 cm thickness before experiments these plastics were washed with 75 ethanol and sterilized ultrapure water more than 5 times to ensure no additional impurities or microorganisms on their surfaces and then air dried for the subsequent use the ftir spectra of all these six types of plastics can be found in fig s1 2 2 cell preparation due to its easy cultivation and mature genetic modification technology as well as its ubiquitous presence in natural environment e coli was employed as model bacterial strain in present study to explore the influence of flagella and their property on bacterial attachment behaviors onto plastics to eliminate the impact from other factors such as bacterial zeta potentials size and extracellular polymeric substance e coli with flagella and its isogenic mutant without flagella without chromosomal gene flic named as e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic respectively as well as e coli with normal flagella and its isogenic mutant with sticky flagella that can express the sticky filament flicst named as e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst respectively were employed in present study detailed information about all four e coli as well as the bacterial culture and collection protocol has been reported previously zhang et al 2021 and also provided in the supplementary materials the bacterial stock suspension 109 1010 cells ml was diluted to the target concentration of 1 0 108 10 cells ml or 1 5 108 10 for the following attachment experiments the detailed information regarding why we chose this bacterial concentration was provided in supplementary materials 2 3 bacterial attachment experiments the attachment performance of four types of e coli strains onto plastics was tested via batch experiments in nacl solutions specifically 20 ml bacterial suspension 1 0 108 10 cells ml with given ionic strength and one plastic slide was put into a 50 ml sterile glass conical flask due to the presence of different types of cations with relative high concentration of monovalent cations and the variation of solution ionic strengths in different natural aqueous environment vengosh et al 2005 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions ph 6 were utilized to simulate the background electrolyte solutions to represent low and high ionic strength conditions respectively after interaction in a constant temperature shaker at 200 rpm and room temperature for 4 h the plastic with attached bacteria was gently taken out of the flask by a sterilized tweezer prior to air dried in the super clean worktable the plastic was rinsed with sterilized phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 2 7 4 solution for 3 times to remove the unattached bacteria the crystal violet staining assay which has previously been employed to analyze the biomass attached onto collectors zhang et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 was used to determine the initial attachment of bacteria onto plastics specifically after attachment experiment the plastic was transferred into a 50 ml sterilized centrifuge tube with 15 ml 0 1 w w crystal violet to dye the e coli adhered onto plastic surface for 20 min at room temperature after that the sterilized pbs solution was used to remove the extra crystal violet on stained plastic which was then air dried in the super clean worktable following that the stained bacteria attached onto plastic were completely eluted into 5 ml absolute ethanol the absorbance of the solution was finally measured at 595 nm with a uv vis spectrophotometer shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd which represented the amount of bacteria attached onto plastics each attachment experiment was performed in triplicate the linear correlation between the absorbance of the ultimate solution and the amount of adherent bacteria counted by using a counting chamber buerker tuerk chamber marienfeld laboratory glassware germany with an inverted fluorescent ti e microscope nikon japan under a bright field in 5 mm nacl solutions can be found in figs s2 and s3 to further investigate the roles of flagella and their property on attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics the attachment experiments of mixed bacteria e coli mg1655 with flagella with e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella and e coli rp437 with normal flagella with e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto different types of plastics in 5 mm nacl solutions representative solution condition were also performed moreover to figure out the relative contribution of two strains in the mixed bacteria to the attachment onto plastics e coli mg1655 or e coli rp437 flicst were firstly stained using fluorescent stains syto 9 baclight cell viability kit invitrogen before the attachment experiments of mixed bacteria onto pp representative plastic details about the attachment experiments of mixed cells were presented in the supplementary materials to determine the influence of coexisting ha representative natural organic matter nom 0 1 and 1 mg l ha was added into salt solution note that the concentration of ha in natural waters is in a wide range from dozens of Î¼g l to dozens of mg l yamada et al 2000 0 1 and 1 mg l ha was respectively utilized as representative low and high nom concentration to explore the influence of nom on the attachment of bacteria onto plastics in present study plastics placed in background solutions with or without ha were used as control to further investigate the attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics in real water samples the attachment experiments of four types of e coli strains in river water samples were also examined the detailed information of river water was provided in the supplementary materials 2 4 qcm d experiments the deposition kinetics of four e coli strains were evaluated via utilization of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation system qcm d q sense ab gothenburg sweden with pp as representative coated sensor batch 20l171 purchased from q sense ab company the qcm d system was pre equilibrated with desired salt solution 5 mm nacl and ph 6 for a minimum of 30 min to establish a stable baseline the shift of average normalized frequency was less than 0 2 hz within 30 min after pre equilibration prepared bacterial suspensions 1 5 108 10 cells ml ph 6 at ionic strength of 5 mm nacl were pumped into the crystal sensor chamber at 0 1 ml min by using a peristaltic pump ismatec switzerland the duration of injection lasted for at least 4 h the detailed information of qcm d experiments was shown in the supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of flagella on initial attachment behaviors of bacteria onto plastics regardless the presence or absence of flagella both e coli strains exhibited better attachment performance onto plastics at higher ionic strength is than low is as shown by the higher bacterial absorbance onto all six types of plastics pp pe pvc pu pet and ps in 25 mm nacl solution than in 5 mm nacl solution fig 1 the higher bacterial attachment at high is could be explained by the results of zeta potentials table s1 and dlvo interaction force fig s4 previous studies also found that increasing is could lead to greater attachment deposition of bacteria onto quartz sand plastics he et al 2020 janjaroen et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 although previous study has shown that the intrinsic surface properties of plastics particular the hardness of plastics could affect bacterial attachment performance onto plastics cai et al 2019 e coli mg1655 absorbances onto all six types of plastics employed in present study were higher than those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic at same is in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions fig 1 the observation indicated that regardless of the plastics type e coli mg1655 with flagella could attach onto plastic surfaces more easily than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella clearly the presence of flagella promoted the attachment of e coli onto plastics as expected the absorbances of mixed cells half e coli mg1655 with flagella and half e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella onto all six plastics were higher than those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella yet were lower than those of e coli mg1655 with flagella fig s5 further analysis of the mixed bacteria attached onto representative plastics pp via inverted fluorescence microscope showed that both types of bacterial strains could attach onto plastics yet the percentage of attached e coli mg1655 with flagella 61 2 6 7 stained by green fluorescent dye was higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella figs s6a and s6b the observations further confirmed that flagella present on bacteria surfaces could promote the attachment of e coli onto plastics previous studies also showed that motile bacteria with flagella could more easily attach onto quartz sand than nonmotile strain without flagella haznedaroglu et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 3 2 mechanisms for the altered attachment of e coli by flagella the viability of bacteria might affect their attachment onto collector asadishad et al 2014 ngwenya et al 2015 we found that at both is more than 95 of both strains were viable table s1 the cell viability thus could not cause the higher attachment of bacteria with flagella onto plastic surfaces both sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria have previously been shown to affect bacteria attachment onto collectors bai et al 2016 bartley et al 2013 janjaroen et al 2013 li et al 2019 wu et al 2018 however at same solution condition the hydrodynamic diameter as well as zeta potentials of e coli mg1655 with flagella were comparable to those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella table s1 the interaction forces between plastics and bacteria thus were comparable for two strains fig s4 the higher attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto all six plastics than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella thus could not be theoretically explained by the dlvo or extended dlvo interaction forces interestingly we found that e coli mg1655 with flagella exhibited more hydrophobic than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella as indicated by the higher contact angle with water for e coli mg1655 than e coli mg1655 Î´flic table s3 zhang et al 2021 previous studies showed that comparing with hydrophilic bacteria hydrophobic bacteria could attach onto collectors more easily bartley et al 2013 marcus et al 2012 vanloosdrecht et al 1987 thus for all six plastics the attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto plastic surfaces was greater than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions e coli mg1655 with flagella could swim faster than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella fig 2 the representative trajectory of both strains movie s1 showed that e coli mg1655 with flagella were able to swim with relatively fast speed in the liquid phase 8 41 4 25 Î¼m s while e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella could only follow brownian motion in situ 0 51 0 32 Î¼m s the faster moving speed of e coli with flagella could increase the moving radius of cell thus enhance the collision chance of bacteria with plastics flagella presented on the surfaces of e coli mg1655 could help the cell move near to plastics leading to the greater attachment of e coli mg1655 onto all six plastics than e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella the higher attachment of bacteria with higer motility onto collectors has also been reported previously de kerchove and elimelech 2008 gutman et al 2013 hori and matsumoto 2010 zhang et al 2021 moreover previous study has shown that flagella could pierce the energy barrier present between bacteria and collector leading to the attachment of bacteria onto collector surface hori and matsumoto 2010 note that flagella presented on the surfaces of e coli mg1655 was around 6 15 Î¼m long while energy barrier between cells and plastics located at 0 2 2 nm from plastics based on the calculation results of dlvo and xdlvo theories fig s4 clearly flagella might also help e coli mg1655 pierce the energy barrier between bacteria and plastics leading to the attachment of bacteria onto plastics the greater attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto plastics relative to e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella thus was achieved qcm d system was also used to compare the attachment behaviors of both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic onto plastics pp one of the most widely used plastics was utilized as representative plastic in the qcm d system we found that during the 4 h attachment experiments for e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic Î´f of pp coated sensor decreased to 43 31 hz and 29 54 hz respectively figs 3 a and b the observation indicated that attachment of e coli mg1655 with flagella onto pp surface was higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella similar to the observations in batch experiments flagella could promote bacteria attach onto flat plastic surfaces in qcm d system comparison of Î´d an indicator to present the viscoelasticity of the deposited bacterial layer of two strains showed that Î´d for e coli mg1655 with flagella 1 4 10 6 was notably lower than that for e coli mg1655 Î´flic 4 1 10 6 figs 3a and 3b the observation indicated that bacteria with flagella could form more rigid layer on the flat pp surface than the strain without flagella for both two strains the ratio of dissipation vs frequency shifts Î´d Î´f that has been previously employed to further assess the viscoelasticity of the adhesive bacterial layer on the qcm d sensor was also determined previous studies pointed out that the low Î´d Î´f represented rigid and compact deposition whereas relatively high Î´d Î´f meant the deposited layer was soft and swollen gutman et al 2013 jin et al 2021 it is worth noting that the slope of Î´d Î´f for both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic did not remain constant yet changed during the overall deposition process figs 3c and d specifically the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 with flagella decreased from 0 071 10 6 hz for the first 0 5 h of attachment duration to 0 018 10 6 hz for the following 3 5 h attachment experimental duration fig 3c the observation indicated that bacterial layer of e coli mg1655 formed on the pp coated sensor became more and more rigid during the whole attachment process the attached flagellar cell layer onto plastics might compress over time via the gradual removal of water present between attached bacteria and pp coated sensor and then tightly bounded with plastic surfaces due to the increase of interaction force between flagella and plastic friedlander et al 2015 gutman et al 2013 in contrast the corresponding slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella increased from 0 095 10 6 hz for the first 0 5 h of attachment duration to 0 183 10 6 hz for the following 3 5 h attachment process fig 3d this indicated that the bacterial layer of e coli mg1655 Î´flic with flagella became looser with increasing attachment duration we speculate that due to the continuous collision of moving bacteria in suspension with bacteria attached on pp coated sensor the deposition layer of bacteria without flagella could become softer over time moreover comparison the slope of Î´d Î´f for both strains showed that at the early attachment stage the first 0 5 h of attachment duration the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 0 071 10 6 hz was lower than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 095 10 6 hz the observation indicated that flagella present on bacteria could promote the formation of more rigid bacterial layer on the pp coated sensor during the initial deposition process with further increasing attachment duration the following 3 5 h attachment experimental duration the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli mg1655 0 018 10 6 hz was significantly lower than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 183 10 6 hz clearly bacteria with flagella could form more rigid layer on the pp coated sensor relative to bacteria without flagella and the bacterial layer became more and more rigid with increasing attachment duration the above observations showed that flagella not only could favor e coli attachment onto the pp flat surface but also could facilitate the formation of more rigid bacterial layer onto plastic surfaces 3 3 effect of flagellar property on attachment behaviors of bacteria on plastics zeta potentials of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella at high is were less negative than those at low is table s1 accordingly the repulsive interaction force between bacteria and plastics decreased with increasing is fig s8 the amounts of both strains attached onto all six plastics at high is thus were greater than those at low is as indicated by the higher absorbances for two types of cells onto all six plastic surfaces in 25 mm salt solutions than those in 5 mm nacl solutions fig 4 at the same solution condition the absorbances of e coli rp437 flicst adhered onto all six types of plastics were significantly higher relative to those of e coli rp437 indicating that e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella could attach onto all six plastics more easily than e coli rp437 with normal flagella clearly sticky flagella favored bacterial attachment onto plastics as expected the absorbances of mixed e coli rp437 with normal flagella with e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics were higher than those of e coli rp437 yet were lower than those of e coli rp437 flicst fig s7 moreover analysis of the mixed bacteria attached onto representative plastics pp via inverted fluorescence microscope showed that both types of bacteria strains could attach onto plastics with higher percentage 78 8 9 5 of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto pp surfaces relative to e coli rp437 with normal flagella figs s6c and s6d the results further confirmed that comparing with bacteria with normal flagella it was easier for bacteria with sticky flagella to attach onto plastics the greater attachment of bacteria with more sticky flagella than that with normal flagella onto quartz sand has also been observed previously which was attributed to the great adhesive force of sticky flagella onto quartz sand zhang et al 2021 3 4 mechanisms driving to the altered attachment by flagellar property the high viabilities of both e coli rp437 flicst and e coli rp437 95 table s1 could not explain the different attachment behaviors observed for these two strains at the same solution condition zeta potentials were comparable between two strains while the average sizes of bacteria with sticky flagella were slightly smaller than those with normal flagella table s1 the energy barrier between e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella and plastics thus was slightly higher than that between e coli rp437 with normal flagella and plastics at the same solution condition figs s8a and b which could not explain the higher attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella similarly the different attachment performance of two strains onto plastics could not be explained by their hydrophobic hydrophilic property since e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella were more hydrophilic than e coli rp437 with normal flagella zhang et al 2021 at the same solution condition the swimming speeds and movement trajectories of two strains were comparable fig 2b and movie s2 which could not support the higher attachment of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto plastics than that of e coli rp437 with normal flagella nevertheless xdlvo theory with consideration of lewis acid base force showed that the presence of sticky flagella decreased energy barrier between bacteria and plastics figs s8c and d which theoretically supported the higher attachment of e coli rp437 flicst onto plastic surfaces relative to e coli rp437 the attachment behaviors of these two strains with different flagellar properties were further examined via qcm d system with pp coated sensors during the 4 h attachment duration Î´f of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella and e coli rp437 with normal flagella decreased to 57 8 hz and 34 4 hz respectively figs 5 a and b the observation indicated that during the same attachment duration the amount of e coli with sticky flagella attached onto flat pp surfaces was larger than that of e coli with normal flagella consistent with the results of batch attachment experiments sticky flagella also promoted bacterial attachment onto plastic surfaces in qcm d system the greater attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto silica coated sensors than bacteria with normal flagella in qcm d system has also been reported previously zhang et al 2021 for both strains the slope of Î´d Î´f decreased with increasing attachment duration figs 5c and d specifically the slope of Î´d Î´f for bacteria with normal flagella decreased from 0 118 10 6 hz for the first 15 min of attachment duration to 0 034 10 6 hz for the following 3 h attachment experimental duration fig 5c meanwhile the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella decreased from 0 030 10 6 hz during the first 25 min to 0 024 10 6 hz during the following 3 h attachment duration fig 5d the observations indicated that for both strains their bacterial layer attached onto flat pp surfaces became more rigid with increasing experimental process the attachment patterns were consistent with that of another bacteria strain with flagella e coli mg1655 observed in qmc d system figs 3c and d although Î´d for e coli rp437 1 3 10 6 hz and e coli rp437 flicst 1 4 10 6 hz was similar figs 5a and b the overall slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst was lower than that of e coli rp437 figs 5c and d the observation suggested that comparing with bacteria containing normal flagella bacteria with sticky flagella attached onto flat pp surfaces could form more rigid bacterial layer it should be noted that comparing with that of e coli rp437 with normal flagella the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella showed only slight decrease during the whole attachment experimental duration due to the stronger adhesive force sticky flagella could form stronger bonds with plastics and form more rigid layer onto pp surfaces even during the initial attachment duration the first 15 min via more efficiently release of water between cell plastic interfaces than bacteria with normal flagella during experimental process the slope of Î´d Î´f for e coli rp437 flicst therefore only slightly decreased with increasing attachment duration clearly sticky flagella not only could promote bacteria attachment onto plastics but also would lead to the formation of more rigid bacterial layer onto plastic surfaces 3 5 bacterial attachment performance in the presence of humic acid similar to those observed without ha the amounts of e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella attached onto all six plastics at high is were higher than those at low is when 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspensions indicated by the higher absorbances of bacteria attached onto plastics with ha in 25 mm nacl solutions than those in 5 mm nacl solutions fig 6 versus fig s9 for both e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella absorbances of bacteria onto all six plastics with either 0 1 or 1 mg l ha in suspensions figs 6 and s9 were relatively lower than those without ha fig 1 for instance the absorbance of e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic attached onto pp surfaces in 5 mm nacl solutions without the copresence of ha was 0 171 0 028 and 0 059 0 029 respectively fig 1 whereas the corresponding absorbance of two strains with 0 1 mg l ha was 0 103 0 003 and 0 039 0 001 respectively fig 6 when the concentration of ha increased to 1 mg l the corresponding absorbances of e coli with and without flagella further decreased to 0 046 0 005 and 0 033 0 001 respectively fig 6 clearly ha inhibited the attachment of both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic onto plastics previous studies found that ha coexisting in suspension would compete attachment sites with bacteria via attaching onto collectors inhibiting the attachment of bacteria onto quartz sand foppen et al 2008 yang et al 2012 ha coexisting in suspensions might adsorb onto plastic surfaces reducing the attachment of bacteria onto plastics to verify adsorption batch experiments of 1 mg l ha by pp as representative plastic in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions were conducted comparing with that of initial ha prior to the adsorption experiments the fluorescent intensity of suspended ha in solutions after 4 h adsorption experiments by plastics at both solution conditions was obviously reduced fig s10 the observation indicated that partial ha adsorbed onto the surfaces of plastics during the adsorption experiments which thus would reduce the sites for bacteria attachment ha might also adsorb onto bacterial surfaces changing the sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria and thus affecting attachment of bacteria onto plastics the reduced fluorescent intensity of suspended ha after 4 h adsorption experiment by bacteria relative to that without adsorption by bacteria confirmed the adsorption of ha onto bacteria surfaces fig s10 for both e coli mg1655 and e coli mg1655 Î´flic their sizes and zeta potentials were affected by ha specifically ha either 0 1 mg l or 1 mg l decreased the average sizes of two bacterial strains and negatively increased the zeta potentials of two strains table s1 the energy barrier between bacteria and plastics when 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspensions thus was higher than that without ha figs s11 and s12 which theoretically supported the observation that decreased bacteria attachment onto plastics was obtained with ha in suspensions previous studies found that steric repulsion induced by portion of ha suspended in solutions contributed to the decreased attachment of bacteria onto sand surfaces yang et al 2016 2012 since partial ha also suspended in salt solutions the steric repulsion induced by this portion of ha would also cause the reduced bacteria attachment onto plastics the results of moving speeds of both strains without ha fig 2a versus the corresponding ones with ha in suspension fig s13 showed that the presence of ha also decreased the moving speed of both strains however even with coexisting 1 mg l ha in cell suspensions the movement speed of e coli mg1655 2 50 1 21 Î¼m s was still higher than that of e coli mg1655 Î´flic 0 35 0 25 Î¼m s in 25 mm nacl solutions fig s13 as stated above the faster moving speed of e coli mg1655 with flagella could help the cell move faster near to plastics and enhance the collision chance of bacteria with plastics leading to the greater attachment onto plastics thus the amounts of e coli mg1655 with flagella attached onto all six types of plastics in both low and high is solutions with ha in suspensions were still greater than those of bacteria without flagella as indicated by the higher absorbances of e coli mg1655 with flagella attached onto plastics relative to those of e coli mg1655 Î´flic with ha in cell solutions figs 6 and s9 the observations indicated that regardless of the presence or absence of ha in suspensions flagella still favor bacteria moving near to plastics and the subsequent attaching onto plastics the attachment performance of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics with coexisting either 0 1 or 1 mg l ha was also examined in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions similar to the observations for e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella attachment of both e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics when ha coexisted in suspensions figs 7 and s14 was lower than that without ha coexisting in suspensions fig 4 this was true in both 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions clearly ha also decreased attachment of e coli rp437 with normal flagella and e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella onto all six plastics the decreased attachment of bacteria onto plastics with ha was consistent with the decreased moving speeds of e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst with ha in suspensions fig s13 versus fig 2b like those of e coli mg1655 with flagella and e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella the competition attachment sites via ha attachment onto plastic surfaces fig s10 the increased energy barrier resulted from decreasing sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria via attachment of ha onto cell surfaces figs s11 and s12 table s1 as well as steric repulsion induced by suspended ha all would contribute to the decreased bacteria attachment for bacteria with normal sticky flagella onto plastics with ha coexisting in solutions with 0 1 mg l ha coexisted in suspension the amounts of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto all six types of plastics in both low and high is solutions were still greater than those of e coli rp437 with normal flagella as indicated by the higher absorbances of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella attached onto plastics relative to those of e coli rp437 even in the presence of 0 1 mg l ha figs 7 and s14 however unlike the greater attachment of e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella than e coli rp437 with normal flagella in salt solution without ha and with 0 1 mg l ha attachment behaviors of these two strains onto plastics with coexisting 1 mg l ha were similar at the same is condition this was true for all six types of plastics the observation showed that ha of 1 mg l concentration could diminish the effects of flagellar property on bacterial attachment onto plastics the results of adhesive force tests showed that without ha in suspension e coli rp437 flicst with sticky flagella contained greater adhesive force than e coli rp437 with normal flagella fig s15 although 0 1 mg l ha slightly reduced the adhesive forces of these two strains bacteria with sticky flagella still exhibited stronger adhesive force than those with normal flagella fig s15 which was consistent with the relatively higher attachment of bacteria with sticky flagella onto plastics relative to bacteria with normal flagella even with the presence of 0 1 mg l ha interestingly adhesive forces of these two strains were similar when the concentration of coexisting ha increased to 1 mg l fig s15 agreed with the similar attachment behaviors of e coli rp437 and e coli rp437 flicst onto plastics with 1 mg l ha in suspensions clearly the change of bacterial adhesive forces induced by the presence of ha could explain the attachment behaviors of two strains onto plastics the results suggested that ha could adsorb onto flagella reducing the adhesive force of sticky flagella onto plastics as a result comparable attachment onto plastics was obtained for two strains with different flagellar properties with 1 mg l ha in suspensions 3 6 bacterial attachment performance in river water samples the attachment behaviors of all four tested e coli strains with without flagella as well as with normal sticky flagella onto six types of plastics in actual river water samples from xiaojiahe river beijing china were also investigated similar to the results observed with ha coexisting in salt solutions e coli mg1655 with flagella still exhibited better attachment performance onto all plastics relative to e coli mg1655 Î´flic without flagella in actual river water fig 8 specifically the absorbance of e coli with flagella attached onto pp pe pvc pu pet and ps in river water was 0 051 0 002 0 044 0 003 0 034 0 001 0 033 0 002 0 031 0 002 and 0 045 0 004 respectively whereas that of e coli without flagella was 0 036 0 002 0 029 0 004 0 018 0 004 0 024 0 001 0 022 0 002 and 0 024 0 004 respectively apparently flagella could also promote bacteria attachment onto plastics in actual river water nevertheless the attachment performance of two strains with different flagellar properties onto plastics was comparable in river water the observation indicated that flagellar property did not have great influence on the attachment of bacteria onto plastics in actual river water table s2 showed that river water contained 5 67 mg c l toc which indicated the presence of organic matter in actual river water we speculate that similar to ha organic matter present in river water might also adsorb onto sticky flagella of cells and thus reduced their adhesive interaction with plastics the results clearly showed that the role of flagellar property on bacterial attachment onto plastics would be diminished by the organic matter coexisting in water 4 conclusion in present study the effects of flagella and their property onto six types of plastics were systematically examined we found that flagella and their property had great influence on the adhesive behaviors of e coli onto plastics in 5 and 25 mm nacl solutions e coli with flagella exhibited better attachment performance onto plastics relative to e coli without flagella in salt solutions moreover comparing with e coli without flagella e coli with flagella tended to form more rigid bacterial layer on pp coated surfaces via increasing the moving radius of bacteria piercing the energy barrier between cells and plastics flagella would favor bacteria moving faster near to plastic surfaces and help their attachment onto plastics moreover sticky flagella with stronger adhesive force could further promote e coli attach onto plastics in salt solutions bacteria with sticky flagella could form more rigid bacterial adhesive layer on plastic surfaces relative to normal flagella the attachment of bacteria regardless the presence absence of flagella or flagellar property onto all six types of plastics greatly reduced when ha coexisted in salt solutions the competition attachment sites via ha adsorption onto plastic surfaces the increased energy barrier resulted from decreasing sizes and zeta potentials of bacteria via attachment of ha onto cell surfaces as well as steric repulsion induced by suspended ha contributed to the decreased bacteria attachment onto plastics with ha coexisting in solutions however even with 0 1 or 1 mg l ha coexisting in salt solutions e coli with flagella showed better attachment performance onto plastics comparing with e coli without flagella although e coli with sticky flagella exhibited greater attachment onto plastics than e coli with normal flagella with 0 1 mg l ha coexisting in solutions the influence of flagellar property stickiness on bacterial attachment onto plastics yet was eliminated by 1 mg l ha co present in suspensions the reduced adhesive force of sticky flagella due to the adsorption of ha might drive to the reduced attachment of bacteria onto plastics with ha in suspensions the attachment performance of flagellar e coli onto plastics was still greater than that of e coli without flagella in actual river water whereas organic matter present in actual river water also diminished the effects of flagellar property onto bacteria attachment onto plastics clearly bacterial flagella could favor the colonization of bacteria onto plastics in natural environment in contrast contribution of bacteria with sticky flagella to the formation of biofilm onto plastics might be similar to those with normal flagella as natural organic matter was ubiquitous present in natural environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

15119,uv chlorine process is a promising advanced treatment to eliminate pathogen and remove refractory micropollutants for reclamation of municipal secondary effluent however effluent organic matter efom featuring high organic nitrogen content serves as a potential precursor for nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps of health concern the molecular level alteration of a hydrophobic hpo efom fraction and a transphilic tpi efom fraction isolated from the same municipal effluent and the formation of n dbps in the uv chlorine were tracked by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry compared with chlorination uv chlorine induced a significantly greater modification on the molecular composition of efom and resulted in formation of unique formulae and chlorinated molecules with higher degree of oxidation lower aromaticity and less carbon number due to the involvement of reactive radical species for both efom fractions uv chlorine formed more diverse dbps with higher intensity and cl incorporation than chlorination the tpi fraction of efom characterized by higher o c and n c ratios generated more n dbps with higher intensity clustered in the high o c region than the hpo fraction of efom by both uv chlorine and chlorination totally 207 and 117 nitrogen containing chlorinated formulae were recorded after uv chlorine treatment of tpi and hpo respectively precursor tracking found a greater number of dbps were originated from raw efom through electrophilic substitution pathway rather than chlorine addition toxicity bioassays demonstrated that dbps can trigger oxidative stress induced dna damage while hpo fraction of efom dominated the induction of cytotoxicity however no correlation could be established between the diversity abundance of n dbps and the level of dna damage a total of 22 dbps with a significant rank correlation with dna damage were identified while c8h6o5ncl was found as the n dbp with the strongest correlation the potential toxic chlorine containing formula with the most abundant intensity was assigned to c5ho3cl3 this study suggests that the character and transformation of efom and associated toxicity is critical to evaluate the uv chlorine process toward practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine chlorination effluent organic matter nitrogenous disinfection byproducts data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction wastewater reclamation utilizing secondary effluent from municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp is considered as an effective approach to alleviate the global water scarcity zhang et al 2021 wwtp effluent has been widely reclaimed for agricultural irrigation ecological water compensation and other non potable purposes with the population growth and climate change increasing numbers of surface water derived drinking water supplies are impacted at varying levels by upstream wwtp discharges leading to unplanned potable reuse i e de facto reuse rice and westerhoff 2015 wwtp effluent is one of the major vectors of pathogenic microorganisms and contaminants of emerging concern cecs released into the aquatic environment thereby posing risks to ecosystems and human health and raising concerns over their presence in receiving waters nasuhoglu et al 2018 recently uv irradiation combined with chlorination i e uv chlorine has emerged as a promising wwtp effluent polishing technology the simultaneous generation of non selective hydroxyl radical oh and selective reactive chlorine species rcs e g cl cl2 and clo in the uv chlorine process ensures a broad screen chemical barrier for both microbial inactivation and control of refractory cecs yeom et al 2021 chen et al 2022 guo et al 2022 however concerns arise over the formation of toxic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps resulting from the undesirable reaction of chlorine based oxidants with dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitously present in water compared to chlorination alone the synergistic effects of uv irradiation chlorine and specifically reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process could significantly modify the molecular composition of dom and thereby its characteristics e g hydrophobicity aromaticity and reactivity which in turn change the subsequent dbps formation speciation and toxicity dom transformation by direct photolysis and oh oxidation makes it more susceptible to chlorination bulman and remucal 2020 increased oxygen content and decreased aromaticity of dom upon attack by oh were observed leading to a shift from aromatic dbps toward more aliphatic ones following subsequent chlorination xiang et al 2020 cl and cl2 contribute to the formation of chlorinated dom via direct chlorine addition at the aromatic moieties of dom lei et al 2021 both oh and rcs exhibit high reactivity toward molecules bearing nitrogen containing groups inducing significant change in chon components i e molecules containing c h o and n ruan et al 2021 rcs were reported to facilitate the formation of high molecular weight nitrogenous dbps n dbps bulman and remucal 2020 meanwhile some n dbps may be vulnerable to photolysis song et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the impact of uv chlorine treatment on dom alteration and dbps formation at the molecular level is needed to provide a more in depth perception in dbps control strategies a number of studies have evaluated dbps formation following uv chlorine treatment mainly focusing on the regulated or commonly known dbps yeom et al 2021 wwtp effluent organic matter efom features higher dissolved organic nitrogen don content than surface water dom which serves as a potential precursor for n dbps of more significant health risks le roux et al 2017 peng et al 2022 numerous in vitro toxicological assays have demonstrated that n dbps are significantly more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their carbonaceous analogues shah and mitch 2012 richardson and plewa 2020 efom enriched in high don level has been shown to generate higher concentrations of n dbps and cause higher toxicity upon chlorination compared with surface water dom dotson et al 2009 du et al 2020 however there is no available study dedicated to the formation of n dbps from efom in the uv chlorine process although more than 700 individual dbps have been reported the majority of halogenated byproducts e g being mainly incorporated into larger molecules of dom as indicated by analysis of total organic halogen tox remains chemically unassigned and only approximately 100 of the known dbps have been evaluated for their occurrence formation and toxicological effects kristiana et al 2015 richardson and plewa 2020 it is rational that a high portion of n dbps presumably remains unidentified and their toxic importance remains unknown recent advances in high resolution mass spectrometry hrms have enabled a comprehensive characterization of elemental compositions of the complex organic matter and identification of unknown components owing to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy 1 ppm fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms allows the unambiguous assignment of unique molecular formulae to thousands of spectrum peaks in complex organic mixtures chen et al 2021 ft icr ms was firstly employed for the identification of carbonaceous chlorinated byproducts i e c dbps from chlorination of dom in source waters by zhang et al 2012 and successfully unveiled the existence of 1000 previously unknown c dbps while no n dbps could be detected probably due to the relatively low abundance of nitrogenous precursor molecules a few recent studies compared the fate of surface water dom or efom with a focus mainly on c dbps formation in the uv chlorine and chlorination processes based on ft icr ms analysis demonstrating that more diverse novel c dbps were formed by uv chlorine treatment bulman and remucal 2020 ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 among them only bulman and remucal 2020 reported the formation of limited numbers i e 15 of high molecular weight n dbps during chlorine photolysis or rcs induced oxidation of a treated surface water dom orbitrap hrms has also been recently applied to interpret the molecular level transformation of a surface water dom with the corresponding c dbps and n dbps formation during uv chlorine and chlorination processes song et al 2021 limited by its much higher mass tolerance 5 ppm no solid compositional analysis of n dbps was provided to the best of our knowledge comprehensive non target screening of n dbps derived from uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of nitrogen enriched efom by ft icr ms analysis has not yet been investigated therefore the transformation of efom in the uv chlorine process and dark chlorination was analyzed by ft icr ms the detailed change in elemental compositions of the hydrophobic hpo and transphilic tpi efom fractions isolated from an authentic wwtp effluent in xi an china and featuring distinct properties was revealed the molecular composition of formed chlorine containing formulae with a particular focus on unknown n dbps was unveiled an attempt was made to illustrate the role of efom character and identify the important n dbps precursors moreover the toxicity variation of the complex efom before and after the uv chlorine treatment was assessed by using multiple in vitro bioassays on hepg2 cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 efom isolation secondary wastewater effluent sample was collected at the outlet of the final sedimentation tank from a municipal wwtp xi an china where the orbal oxidation ditch process is applied to reduce organic load general water quality characteristics can be found elsewhere wang et al 2021 the sample was filtered through 0 45 Î¼m cellulose membrane and used for efom isolation the hpo and tpi efom fractions were

vertically placed under the center of uv lamps the average uv fluence rate entering the solution was determined as 1 04 mw cm 2 using the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 for uv chlorine experiments a 200 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 7 0 spiked with 5 mg c l 1 efom isolate don content was 0 25 and 0 37 mg n l 1 for hpo and tpi respectively based on table s1

conducted in amber bottles with headspace free following a similar approach identical experiments were conducted in a row according to the above procedures thereby 1200 ml and 800 ml samples were obtained for ft icr ms analysis and toxicity assay respectively the samples were acidified to ph 2 0 with hydrochloric acid and then subjected to solid phase extraction spe using bond elut ppl

mass scan and 384 scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum spectra were externally calibrated with 10 mm sodium formate solution and then internally recalibrated using dom reference mass list 2 4 ft icr ms data analysis molecular formula assignment was processed using an in house developed software xiang et al 2020 where only the peaks with a signal to noise ratio of 10 relative intensity of 0 001 and absolute intensity of 106 in ft icr ms spectrum were taken into account for a given formula the mass error between the measured and the theoretical one was set at 0 5 ppm and only the formulae present in duplicated analyses were retained to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the detection the accuracy of the assigned chlorine containing formulae was carefully checked with isotope simulation based on the isotopic abundance ratio of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 besides each nitrogen containing chlorinated formula was checked manually schemes s1and s2 to prevent ambiguous or false molecular

under different modulators of the electron transport chain etc following the manufacturer instructions detailed assay procedures were described in our previous study wang et al 2021 all experiments were done in five replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of efom fractions 3 1 1 bulk chemical and structural properties of efom fractions the hpo fraction of efom exhibits a higher suva 3 10 l mg 1 m 1 compared to that of tpi 1 96 l mg 1 m 1 indicating a higher degree of aromaticity the elemental composition table s1 of the two fractions emphasized their structural difference the hpo fraction features lower h c o c and n c atomic ratios than tpi fraction in accordance with its higher aromatic character and more hydrophobic nature the higher o c and n c values recorded for tpi refer to an organic matrix that is more enriched in oxygenated and nitrogenous functional groups i e more hydrophilic dom previous studies indicated that the majority of don in efom was present in more hydrophilic forms chang et al 2013 qin et al 2015 our results are in agreement with this observation with tpi incorporating 4 30 of nitrogen compared to 3 17 for hpo higher nitrogen content dom refers to organic material with higher amino acids and protein contents leenheer et al 2007 compared to surface water dom isolates e g n c mass ratio of 0 015 0 028 table s2 efom fractions e g n c mass ratio of 0 051 0 12 are more enriched in nitrogenous substances mainly resulting from the release of soluble microbial products during microbial growth decay cycles michael kordatou et al 2015 bio refractory micropollutants as a result of human activities also contribute to the n rich characteristic of efom as justified by the occurrence of some n bearing cecs e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides see table s3 in both hpo and tpi fractions due to the introduction of sulfur containing compounds e g detergents and surfactants from anthropogenic sources the two efom fractions showed a relative abundance of elemental s as observed by previous studies drewes and crouÃ© 2002 gonsior et al 2011 niu et al 2018 3 1 2 characteristics of efom fractions by ft icr ms the molecular compositions of hpo and tpi were characterized by ft icr ms compared to the international reference natural organic matter isolated from the suwannee river srnom that was mainly represented by cho formulae 80 cho yuan et al 2017 only approximately 28 and 31 of the assigned formulae in the hpo and tpi fractions tables s4 and s5 respectively were cho formulae indicating the importance of nitrogen and sulfur containing molecules in efom the formulae assigned in the two fractions are visualized by the van krevelen diagrams fig 1 which show the h c ratios versus the o c ratios of each assigned formula and enable the comparison of the elemental composition between the two efom fractions as shown in fig 1a d 39 n 425 17 n 155 35 n 361 and 10 n 47 of the cho chon chos and chons formulae respectively assigned in the hpo fraction were not detected in the tpi fraction indicating that the two fractions exhibit differing elemental compositions although hundreds of shared formulae were found in the two fractions the intensities of these shared formulae and the five most abundant formulae in each category are significantly different fig 1e l and table s6 in addition a larger number of unique chon n 360 and chons n 371 formulae were found in the tpi fraction compared to the hpo fraction this finding confirmed that the tpi fraction was more enriched in n containing moieties which is well correlated with the elemental composition presented above besides the structural features of the unique formulae assigned in the hpo and tpi fractions were also significantly different the 425 unique cho formulae in the hpo fraction fig 1a are located in the region with relatively lower o c ratios than those of the 387 cho formulae unique in the tpi fraction fig 1m similar observations were obtained from fig 1 for the unique chon chos and chons formulae in the two fractions the intensity weighted average o cw of the unique and shared formulae assigned in hpo and tpi fractions were calculated to quantitatively evaluate the differences in their structural features tables s4 and s5 in the hpo fraction the o cw of the unique cho chon chos and chons formulae were 0 32 0 49 0 26 and 0 37 respectively while those of the unique formulae in the tpi fraction were 0 60 0 51 0 48 and 0 60 respectively such differences indicate that the unique formulae in the tpi fraction exhibited a higher level of oxidation than those in the hpo fraction in agreement with the higher o c ratio determined for the tpi fraction table s1 in addition cl containing formulae including 70 chocl 12 choscl 24 choncl and 4 chonscl formulae were detected in the hpo fraction and 44 chocl 11 choscl 15 choncl 3 chonscl formulae were detected in the tpi fraction tables s7 and s8 the occurrence of these chlorine containing formulae in efom is likely due to the presence of dbps originating from drinking water and chlorine containing micropollutants table s3 the most abundant cl containing formula assigned in the hpo fraction was c7h6o6nscl possibly a chloro hydroxy sulfobenzoic acid with 6 isotope peaks i e 13c 37cl and 34s detected by ft icr ms while c13h21o10cl3 was found as the most abundant cl containing formula in tpi fraction tables s9 interestingly 45 cl containing formulae were both detected in the two fractions besides the frequently detected chocl formulae e g c5h3o4cl3 c4h4o3cl4 and c6h3o5cl3 in water samples treated by chlorination xiang et al 2020 9 nitrogenous cl containing formulae were also found in both fractions it should be pointed out that commonly known n dbps e g haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and n nitrosodimethylamine were not detected due to the limitation of the detectable mass range in ft icr ms the elemental compositions of the two efom fractions were further compared with those isolated from another wwtp effluent jeddah saudi arabia niu et al 2018 as shown in figs s2 and s3 66 and 72 of the formulae assigned in the hpo and tpi fractions respectively were also detected in the corresponding jeddah wwtp efom fractions the high similarity of the chemical formulae assigned in the efom fractions isolated from different wwtps indicated that the findings in this study could be partially applied to other typical efom 3 2 alteration of efom molecular composition the alteration of formulae incorporating cho ns atoms in the efom fractions by the uv chlorine and chlorination processes was evaluated by comparing the removed recalcitrant and newly formed formulae after the treatment processes figs s4 s7 as shown in fig s4 246 out of the 1076 23 cho formulae in the hpo fraction were removed after the uv chlorine process while 69 new formulae were detected the removed formulae exhibited a lower o cw 0 39 compared to the 830 recalcitrant formulae 0 45 indicating that the reactive species generated in the uv chlorine process preferentially attacked the moieties featuring a lower level of oxygen content besides a higher fraction of chon formulae in the hpo isolate i e 42 434 formulae among 1040 were eliminated after the uv chlorine process compared to the cho formulae this can be explained by the high reactivity of the compounds with nitrogen containing functional groups toward chlorine and rcs deborde and von gunten 2008 lei et al 2021 similarly a higher portion of chon formulae 32 was removed in the tpi fraction compared to the cho formulae 14 after the uv chlorine process further supporting the importance of evaluating the consequential formation of nitrogenous byproducts in addition although the uv chlorine process altered the cho and chos formulae in the efom fractions to a greater extent than chlorination the differences in the alterations of chon and chons formulae between the two processes were less significant 5 7 2 3 difference in the number of removed formulae indicating the important role of chlorine in the transformation of organic nitrogen moieties in efom to further evaluate the differences in the elemental compositions of the efom fractions treated by the two processes the specific formulae detected after each treatment process were compared as shown in the van krevelen diagram fig 2 a the 86 specific cho formulae detected in the hpo fraction treated by chlorination fall within the relatively lower o c and h c region compared to the 79 specific cho formulae detected in the uv chlorine treated hpo fraction moreover these 79 specific cho formulae clustered in the region with a lower modified aromaticity index aimod and less carbon number fig 2b aimod which can be calculated from the formula of each individual compound text s3 reflects the density of c c double bond and aromatic rings e g aimod resorcinol 0 6 koch and dittmar 2006 xiang et al 2020 the lower aimod of the 79 specific cho formulae suggests the destruction of carbon skeletons and cleavage of aromatic rings in the moieties of efom fig 3 a shows the differences in the weighted mean values of molecular indices of the specific formulae assigned in the hpo fraction treated by the two processes considerably higher o cw h cw lower double bond equivalent dbew see text s3 and aimod w of the specific formulae assigned in the hpo fraction treated by the uv chlorine process compared to that by chlorination were observed in all four types of formulae i e cho chon chos and chons besides as depicted by the van krevelen diagrams fig 2c and d and the weighted mean values of molecular indices fig 3b a similar trend was observed for the tpi fraction this indicated that the uv chlorine process increased the level of oxygen content enhanced the level of saturation and decreased the aromaticity of the efom fraction which is likely due to the highly reactive radical species such as oh and rcs generated by the uv photolysis of chlorine wang et al 2021 guo et al 2022 oh has been reported to react with dom model compounds through oh addition leading to the generation of hydroxylated and ring cleavaged products with increased degree of oxidation and decreased aromaticity xiang et al 2020 in addition the activation of dom moieties by oh is anticipated to further promote the alterations by rcs and chlorine species ruan et al 2021 3 3 impact on chlorinated contaminants detected in raw efom fractions in the raw hpo and tpi fractions 82 and 55 carbonaceous chlorine containing molecules were detected respectively while 71 and 85 of these compounds showed a remarkable increase in intensities the statistical analysis is detailed in text s4 after 10 min of uv chlorine exposure meanwhile intensities of 11 of the formulae in hpo and 4 in tpi were significantly decreased or became undetectable tables s7 and s8 similar trends were also observed following chlorination where the intensities of 66 and 85 of carbonaceous chlorine containing molecules in hpo and tpi fractions respectively were significantly increased in addition 18 one sulfur containing chlorinated molecules were detected in the two raw efom fractions with 55 of them exhibiting a significant increase in intensity which is in line with the expectation that sulfur bonds characterized by electron enrichment are prone to attack by cl and oh radicals wang et al 2020 the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine detected in the raw hpo fraction increased by 80 and 120 respectively after chlorination and the uv chlorine process for the tpi fraction the intensities increased by 2 5 times after both treatment processes experimental results demonstrated that uv chlorine and chlorination significantly modified the molecular compositions within efom causing formation and dehalogenation of chlorinated molecules although radical species were generated in the uv chlorine process the prolonged chlorine contact time i e 10 min makes the difference between the two processes insignificant among the intensity increased formulae an aliphatic formula c5h3o4cl3 m z of 230 9024 was detected in both raw efom fractions and both uv chlorine and chlorine treated samples the uv chlorine process significantly increased the yield of c5h3o4cl3 up to 70 folds in hpo and 45 folds in tpi making it the most abundant formula in contrast fold increase by chlorination was 6 and 4 for hpo and tpi respectively the radical induced cleavage of aromatic ring was claimed as the reason for the significantly enhanced formation of aliphatic dbps e g c5h3o4cl3 xiang et al 2020 occurrence of c5h3o4cl3 as a highly abundant molecule was reported from the finished water of a drinking water treatment plant derived from surface water gonsior et al 2014 and chlorination of srnom xiang et al 2020 it is likely that the precursor of c5h3o4cl3 is common to efom and surface water dom approximately 65 of the nitrogenous halogenated compounds detected in the raw efom fractions had a significant intensity increase after both uv chlorine and chlorination processes no obvious difference was observed between the two processes however among the 9 n halogenated compounds both present in raw hpo and tpi fractions 8 of them in tpi exhibited a much higher fold increase after treatment compared to those in hpo table s10 suggesting that nitrogenous enrichment character plays an important role in the formation of this group of molecules 3 4 formation of chlorinated byproducts in this section only the formed halogenated compounds were considered while molecules detected in the raw efom fractions section 3 3 were not taken into account compounds are classified into three groups shared compounds specific compounds and unique compounds shared compounds refer to formulae that were observed in both uv chlorine and chlorine treated samples i e shared by treatment for a given fraction or in both hpo and tpi fractions i e shared by fraction for a given treatment process specific compounds correspond to formulae that were only observed in uv chlorine or chlorine treated samples i e specific by treatment for a given fraction or in treated hpo or tpi fraction i e specific by fraction for a given treatment process molecules that were detected in only one of the four treated samples were classified as unique formulae a total of 212 cho s cl and 260 chon s cl formulae were detected among them 141 cho s cl and 66 chon s cl formulae table s11 were present in all four samples only few formulae were detected in only one sample i e unique formulae while the majority of the identified compounds could be classified as specific or shared formulae by treatment or by fraction 3 4 1 shared formulae more than 74 and 56 of the cho s cl and chon s cl formulae respectively are shared in chlorinated and uv chlorine treated samples table s12 which could be partly due to the prolonged contact time between free chlorine and organic matter in real practice the contact time is within seconds which may lead to a greater difference between the formulae detected in the two processes due to the more prominent role of reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process similarly many identical formulae were detected in both treated hpo and tpi 84 94 for cho s cl and 53 89 for chon s cl respectively table s13 suggesting that the two fractions incorporate a large part of similar dbp precursors as shown in figs 4 a b and 5 a b the uv chlorine process led to a more significant generation of both c dbps and n dbps with higher intensities compared to chlorination these results suggest that under our experimental conditions the uv chlorine process enhanced to a more significant extent the production of halogenated compounds from a larger pool of c dbps and n dbps precursors than chlorination for both treatment processes more chlorinated compounds with higher intensity were formed with tpi compared to hpo and the difference is more significant for n dbps than c dbps figs 4c d and 5c d the much higher production of n dbps with tpi than hpo can be explained by the higher nitrogen content in tpi fig 4a and b plots the shared cho s cl formulae by both treatment processes results clearly indicate that the molecules showing higher intensity after uv chlorine with total absolute intensities of 1 25 0 04 109 hpo and 1 94 0 05 109 tpi are more clustered at higher h c and o c regions compared to the molecules that are more abundant after chlorination with total absolute intensities of 3 83 0 15 108 hpo and 5 41 0 004 108 tpi this finding is not so pronounced for n dbps fig 5a and b fig 4c d indicates that the chlorinated compounds generated with higher intensities from tpi are positioned in the region of higher o c ratio compared to those from hpo which can be partially explained by the more enriched oxygen content of tpi further quantitative analysis table s14 indicated for the two fractions that the cho s cl formulae showing higher intensity after uv chlorine treatment exhibited higher h cw higher o cw lower dbew and lower aimod w compared to those showing higher intensity after chlorination however differences recorded between the two treatments were more significant for hpo compared to tpi a similar trend of the differences in molecular indices is evidenced from the data provided in table s14 for chon s cl formulae while more significant differences exist between c dbps and n dbps overall the h cw o cw values were lower and dbew and aimod w values were higher for c dbps generated from hpo than those from tpi when comparing the two treatment processes table s15 note that this is in agreement with the different structural characteristics between the two efom fractions furthermore the intensity weighted average carbon numbers of the dbps with a higher intensity after uv chlorine treatment were 6 5 and 5 7 for hpo and tpi fractions respectively which were lower than the respective numbers calculated after chlorination 8 4 and 8 7 likely due to the radical attack of dbps precursors in the uv chlorine process some regulated dbps including dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were also detected as shared formulae the intensities of dcaa detected in the sample treated by the uv chlorine process were 81 and 79 higher than those by chlorination in the hpo and tpi fractions respectively a homolog of dcaa c2h2o2cl2 c3h4o2cl2 was also generated and the intensities in the uv chlorine treated fractions were 39 hpo and 146 tpi higher compared to the chlorine treated ones interestingly the intensity of tcaa was not affected by the treatment processes in the tpi fraction 3 4 2 specific formulae the uv chlorine process enhanced the number of specific c dbps specific by treatment generated from efom fractions compared to chlorination i e 41 and 4 for hpo 28 and 12 for tpi respectively fig 4a b the specific c dbps in uv chlorine treated hpo fraction are characterized with higher h cw and o cw but lower dbew and aimod w compared to those in chlorine treated hpo fraction table s16 partially due to the involvement of rcs favoring the formation of chlorinated formulae located in the high o c region bulman and remucal 2020 the difference of dbew and aimod w values between the two hpo fractions treated by uv chlorine and chlorination is more pronounced than for tpi which is likely attributed to more abundant aromatic moieties within hpo preferentially vulnerable to oh and rcs attack in the uv chlorine process radical induced reactions during the uv chlorine process led to more hydrophilic less unsaturated aromatic type c dbps than chlorination ruan et al 2021 fig 4c d displays the comparison of the elemental compositions of specific formulae detected in the two fractions the o cw of the specific formulae detected in the tpi fraction was found to be 67 70 higher than that of the specific formulae in hpo fraction while the h cw dbew and aimod w were 14 24 15 44 and 16 54 lower after chlorination and uv chlorine treatment respectively table s17 for the two fractions although a significant amount of shared n dbp formulae were detected after both treatments a greater number of specific compounds were produced after uv chlorine exposure 52 for hpo 73 for tpi compared to chlorination 22 for hpo 33 for tpi fig 5a b in addition the tpi fraction generated much more specific formulae with higher intensity than the hpo fraction for both treatments fig 5c d the largest amount of specific n dbps was observed with the uv chlorine treated tpi fraction n 99 similar to c dbps for both efom fractions specific n dbps produced from the uv chlorine treatment are characterized by higher h cw and o cw but lower dbew and aimod w compared to those from chlorination table s16 interestingly significantly higher dbew and aimod w were calculated for n dbps compared to c dbps for both efom and for the two treatments tables s16 and 17 additionally some n dbps with a shorter carbon skeleton n 5 were only observed in the sample treated by the uv chlorine process the average carbon number of the specific n dbps generated during the uv chlorine process was smaller than that during chlorination 8 2 vs 9 3 for hpo 7 9 vs 8 9 for tpi likely due to the breakdown of the precursors or dbps by the radical attack in the uv chlorine process the number of chlorine atoms in dbps generated from the two processes were compared the uv chlorine process favored the production of higher chlorine containing molecules compared to chlorination fig s8 formulae incorporating 3 cl atoms were the most abundant after uv chlorine application representing 61 and 50 of all specific c dbps by treatment for tpi and hpo respectively formulae containing 2 cl atoms tend to be the most abundant following chlorination compared to c dbps the formed n dbps incorporate less chlorine atoms in their structure fig s9 mainly 1 cl the most abundant and 2 cl formulae were detected overall more compounds with higher cl incorporation were found with tpi for the two treatments however similar to c dbps higher halogen incorporation was observed for the two fractions after the uv chlorine treatment compared to chlorination 3 4 3 unique formulae only few unique c dbps fig s10a were observed and the uv chlorine treated tpi generated more unique c dbps than the hpo fraction these unique formulae are listed in table s18 and the possible structures of formulae with low carbon numbers i e 6 are proposed according to previous publications and the chemspider database notably c6ho3cl3 a unique formula only detected in the uv chlorine treated hpo is possibly a halo hydroxyl benzoquinone 2 3 5 trichloro 6 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone that has been detected in finished drinking water and was substantially more toxic than the regulated dbps wang et al 2014 the tpi fraction generated more unique n dbps compared to the hpo fraction fig s10b as expected the uv chlorine process was more prone to produce unique n dbps than chlorination with the tpi fraction dbps unique in uv chlorine treated fractions have higher o cw and lower aimod w compared to those unique after chlorination table s19 two unique n dbps c8h6no4cl3 in tpi chlorination and c8h6no5cl3 in tpi uv chlorine shared the same formulae with the chlorination products of tryptophan lu et al 2021 suggesting that aromatic amino acids could be the precursors of these n dbps 3 5 precursor tracking the possible precursors of n dbps were tracked in the raw hpo and tpi fractions by considering electrophilic substitution and hocl addition as the possible chlorination pathways the precursor tracking method is described in detail in text s5 compared to the hocl addition pathway a greater number of precursors were found through the electrophilic substitution pathway interestingly most of the n dbps detected in chlorinated or uv chlorine treated tpi fraction can find their precursors 81 85 in raw tpi when considering chlorine substitution as the formation pathway while the ratio decreased to 25 30 for those generated from the hpo fraction tables s20 21 besides for both the uv chlorine and chlorination processes more n dbp precursors were found in treated hpo compared to the raw hpo while an opposite trend was observed for the tpi fraction as shown in table s20 51 n dbps in uv chlorine treated hpo can find their precursors in the treated sample through chlorine substitution pathway in which 34 of the precursors were also detected in raw hpo and 17 were newly produced in the treated hpo table s20 indicating that the formation of dbps from hpo could involve multiple transformation steps and new precursors can be generated after the treatment processes as for the tpi fraction 167 out of the 207 n dbps detected after the uv chlorine process can match with the corresponding precursors in raw tpi while the number decreased to 152 when matching the precursors in the uv chlorine treated tpi this suggests that some of the possible precursors detected in raw efom fractions became undetectable after the chlorination or the uv chlorine process possibly due to the conversion toward dbps or other transformation products 3 6 toxicity evaluation it has been previously reported that water treatment processes can increase oxidative stress responses and genotoxicity farrÃ© et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 neale et al 2020 dbp formation accounted for up to 58 of oxidative stress response after water chlorination while volatile dbps only have a minor contribution hebert et al 2018 in our study the presence of hpo versus tpi efom significantly affected the levels of intracellular ros either by the uv chlorine or chlorine treatments fig 6 while the hpo fraction alone is responsible for increased toxicity in hepg2 cells as measured by cytotoxicity ros levels and other bioenergetic parameters figs 6 and s11 after treatment its presence also induced a significant increase in dna damage as shown by the levels of ph2ax fig 6 phosphorylation of h2ax is one of the widely used biomarkers of double strand breaks dsbs kuo and yang 2008 and dsbs refer to a dna damage mechanism that if left unrepaired can lead to chromosome rearrangements chromosomal deletions or other damaging mutations scully and xie 2013 collins et al 2020 among other causes oxidative stress is one of the most common inducing mechanisms for genotoxicity ma 2013 for halogenated dbps oxidative stress induced dna damage is one of the major mechanisms responsible for increased genotoxicity pals et al 2011 lan et al 2018 noteworthy is also the fact that nitrogen containing dbps are generally more genotoxic than the dbps that do not contain nitrogen plewa et al 2008 however although the tpi fraction generated a greater number of n dbps compared to the hpo fraction the levels of dna damage induced by the treated tpi samples were less than those by the hpo samples indicating that higher n dbps diversity does not always mean higher toxicity inter sample ranking analysis was performed using spearman rank correlation to link the levels of dna damage with the corresponding peak intensity of individual compounds including chlorine containing and non chlorine containing compounds detected by ft icr ms to identify the potential toxicity contributors it should be noted that only formulae detected in at least 5 out of the 6 samples were used during the calculation to avoid weak correlations the distribution of the significance levels of the chlorinated byproducts with the levels of dna damage is shown in fig s12 a total of 97 formulae were found to be positively correlated with dna damage with a high significance level p 0 05 implying that these formulae could be possible contributors to dna damage 22 out of the 97 formulae were chlorinated byproducts and 6 of them have been previously detected by zhang et al 2021 the elemental compositions and the significance levels of these 22 formulae are shown in table s22 c6h5o4scl possibly a chloro hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid was found to be the dbp with the strongest correlation p 0 001 with dna damage c5ho3cl3 was the most abundant one among these 22 dbps in our study c5ho3cl3 has also been detected in a drinking water plant in sweden as the most abundant peak and its structure was proposed as trichloro hydroxy cyclopentene dione gonsior et al 2014 the chemical formula of the n dbp with the highest significance level was c8h6o5ncl p 0 01 attention should be paid to these formulae for further toxicological evaluation 4 conclusion the study investigated uv chlorine induced transformation of efom and the resultant formation of chlorinated formulae with a focus on unknown n dbps by ft icr ms the multiple reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process facilitated the alteration of efom into formulae e g dbps featuring higher degree of oxygen content lower aromaticity and less carbon number compared with chlorination moreover uv chlorine enhanced the diversity and abundance of the formed c dbps and n dbps and favored the formation of higher cl incorporating compounds where formulae bearing 3 cl and 1 cl atoms were the dominant c dbps and n dbps respectively the tpi fraction of efom containing more nitrogenous functional groups generated a larger number of n dbps i e 207 than the hpo fraction i e 117 after the uv chlorine treatment meanwhile the tpi fraction led to more specific and unique n dbps with high intensity positioned in higher o c region compared to hpo precursor tracking suggested that formation of dbps from efom could involve multiple transformation steps nevertheless a large number of dbps could find their precursor from the raw efom through electrophilic substitution pathway the presence of hpo efom alone substantially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity the level of cytotoxicity was reduced after the uv chlorine treatment while oxidative stress induced dna damage was observed due to the formation of dbps bioassay assessment found no strong relationship between the overall toxicity and the diversity abundance of the formed n dbps totally 75 non dbps and 22 identified dbps formulae show a significant rank correlation with dna damage our study suggests that the character of efom and the transformation byproducts are both critical in comprehensively evaluating the uv chlorine process toward application further research is needed to determine the structure of dbps corresponding to the newly detected molecular formulae results that will help improving our knowledge on dbps formation mechanism and precursor origin particular effort should be deployed to identify the toxicity contributors detected in the current study and conduct a toxicological evaluation of the formed n dbps

15119,uv chlorine process is a promising advanced treatment to eliminate pathogen and remove refractory micropollutants for reclamation of municipal secondary effluent however effluent organic matter efom featuring high organic nitrogen content serves as a potential precursor for nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps of health concern the molecular level alteration of a hydrophobic hpo efom fraction and a transphilic tpi efom fraction isolated from the same municipal effluent and the formation of n dbps in the uv chlorine were tracked by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry compared with chlorination uv chlorine induced a significantly greater modification on the molecular composition of efom and resulted in formation of unique formulae and chlorinated molecules with higher degree of oxidation lower aromaticity and less carbon number due to the involvement of reactive radical species for both efom fractions uv chlorine formed more diverse dbps with higher intensity and cl incorporation than chlorination the tpi fraction of efom characterized by higher o c and n c ratios generated more n dbps with higher intensity clustered in the high o c region than the hpo fraction of efom by both uv chlorine and chlorination totally 207 and 117 nitrogen containing chlorinated formulae were recorded after uv chlorine treatment of tpi and hpo respectively precursor tracking found a greater number of dbps were originated from raw efom through electrophilic substitution pathway rather than chlorine addition toxicity bioassays demonstrated that dbps can trigger oxidative stress induced dna damage while hpo fraction of efom dominated the induction of cytotoxicity however no correlation could be established between the diversity abundance of n dbps and the level of dna damage a total of 22 dbps with a significant rank correlation with dna damage were identified while c8h6o5ncl was found as the n dbp with the strongest correlation the potential toxic chlorine containing formula with the most abundant intensity was assigned to c5ho3cl3 this study suggests that the character and transformation of efom and associated toxicity is critical to evaluate the uv chlorine process toward practical application graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine chlorination effluent organic matter nitrogenous disinfection byproducts data

as an effective approach to alleviate the global water scarcity zhang et al 2021 wwtp effluent has been widely reclaimed for agricultural irrigation ecological water compensation and other non potable purposes with the population growth and climate change increasing numbers of surface water derived drinking water supplies are impacted at varying levels by upstream wwtp discharges leading to

however concerns arise over the formation of toxic halogenated disinfection byproducts dbps resulting from the undesirable reaction of chlorine based oxidants with dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitously present in water compared to chlorination alone the synergistic effects of uv irradiation chlorine and specifically reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process could significantly modify the molecular composition of dom and thereby its characteristics e g hydrophobicity aromaticity and reactivity which in turn change the subsequent dbps formation speciation and toxicity dom transformation by direct photolysis and oh oxidation makes it more susceptible to chlorination bulman and remucal 2020 increased oxygen content and decreased aromaticity of dom upon attack by oh were observed leading to a shift from aromatic dbps toward more aliphatic ones following subsequent chlorination xiang et al 2020 cl and cl2 contribute to the formation of chlorinated dom via direct chlorine addition at the aromatic moieties of dom lei et al 2021 both oh and rcs exhibit high reactivity toward molecules bearing nitrogen containing groups inducing significant change in chon

dbps may be vulnerable to photolysis song et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 therefore a comprehensive understanding of the impact of uv chlorine treatment on dom alteration and dbps formation at the molecular level is needed to provide a more in depth perception in dbps control strategies a number of studies have evaluated dbps formation following uv chlorine treatment mainly focusing on the regulated or commonly known dbps yeom et al 2021 wwtp effluent organic matter efom features higher dissolved organic nitrogen don content than surface water dom which serves as a potential precursor for n dbps of more significant health risks le roux et al 2017 peng et al 2022 numerous in vitro toxicological assays have demonstrated that n dbps are significantly more genotoxic and cytotoxic than their carbonaceous analogues shah and mitch 2012 richardson and plewa 2020 efom enriched in high don level has been shown to generate higher concentrations of n dbps and cause higher toxicity upon chlorination compared with surface water dom dotson et al 2009 du et al 2020 however there is no available study dedicated to the formation of n dbps from efom in the uv chlorine process although more than 700 individual dbps have been reported the majority of halogenated byproducts e g being mainly incorporated into larger molecules of dom as indicated by analysis of total organic halogen tox

it is rational that a high portion of n dbps presumably remains unidentified and their toxic importance remains unknown recent advances in high resolution mass spectrometry hrms have enabled a comprehensive characterization of elemental compositions of the complex organic matter and identification of unknown components owing to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy 1 ppm fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms allows the unambiguous assignment of unique molecular formulae to thousands of spectrum peaks in complex organic mixtures chen et al 2021 ft icr ms was firstly employed for the identification of carbonaceous chlorinated byproducts i e c dbps from chlorination of dom in source waters by zhang et al 2012 and successfully unveiled the existence of 1000 previously unknown c dbps while no n dbps could be detected probably due to the relatively low abundance of nitrogenous precursor molecules a few recent studies compared the fate of surface water dom or efom with a focus mainly on c dbps formation in the uv chlorine and chlorination processes based on ft icr ms analysis demonstrating that more diverse novel c dbps were formed by uv chlorine treatment bulman and remucal 2020 ruan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 among them only bulman and remucal 2020 reported the formation of limited numbers i e 15 of high molecular weight n dbps during chlorine photolysis or rcs induced oxidation of a treated surface water dom orbitrap hrms has also been recently applied to interpret the molecular level transformation of a surface water dom with the corresponding c dbps and n dbps formation during uv chlorine and chlorination processes song et al 2021 limited by its much higher mass tolerance 5 ppm no solid compositional analysis of n dbps was provided to the best of our knowledge comprehensive non target screening of n dbps derived from uv chlorine and chlorination treatment of nitrogen enriched efom by ft icr ms analysis has not yet been investigated therefore the transformation of efom in the uv chlorine process and dark chlorination was analyzed by ft icr ms the detailed change in elemental compositions of the hydrophobic hpo and transphilic tpi efom fractions isolated from an authentic wwtp effluent in xi an china and featuring distinct properties was revealed the molecular composition of formed chlorine containing formulae with a particular focus on unknown n dbps was unveiled an attempt was made to illustrate the role of efom character and identify the important n dbps precursors moreover the toxicity variation of the complex efom before and after the uv chlorine treatment was assessed by using multiple in vitro bioassays on hepg2 cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 efom isolation secondary wastewater effluent sample was collected at the outlet of the final sedimentation tank from a municipal wwtp xi an china where the orbal oxidation ditch process is applied to reduce organic load general water quality characteristics can be found elsewhere wang et al 2021 the sample was filtered through 0 45 Î¼m cellulose membrane and used for efom isolation the hpo and tpi efom fractions were accordingly obtained following the xad 8 xad 4 resin chromatography protocol drewes and crouÃ© 2002 a detailed description of efom fractionation protocol other chemicals and reagents is provided in

vertically placed under the center of uv lamps the average uv fluence rate entering the solution was determined as 1 04 mw cm 2 using the iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2011 for uv chlorine experiments a 200 ml of 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 7 0 spiked with 5 mg c l 1 efom isolate don content was 0 25 and 0 37 mg n l 1 for hpo and tpi respectively based on table s1

conducted in amber bottles with headspace free following a similar approach identical experiments were conducted in a row according to the above procedures thereby 1200 ml and 800 ml samples were obtained for ft icr ms analysis and toxicity assay respectively the samples were acidified to ph 2 0 with hydrochloric acid and then subjected to solid phase extraction spe using bond elut ppl

mass scan and 384 scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum spectra were externally calibrated with 10 mm sodium formate solution and then internally recalibrated using dom reference mass list 2 4 ft icr ms data analysis molecular formula assignment was processed using an in house developed software xiang et al 2020 where only the peaks with a signal to noise ratio of 10 relative intensity of 0 001 and absolute intensity of 106 in ft icr ms spectrum were taken into account for a given formula the mass error between the measured and the theoretical one was set at 0 5 ppm and only the formulae present in duplicated analyses were retained to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the detection the accuracy of the assigned chlorine containing formulae was carefully checked with isotope simulation based on the isotopic abundance ratio of cl 35cl 37cl 3 1 besides each nitrogen containing chlorinated formula was checked manually schemes s1and s2 to prevent ambiguous or false molecular

under different modulators of the electron transport chain etc following the manufacturer instructions detailed assay procedures were described in our previous study wang et al 2021 all experiments were done in five replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of efom fractions 3 1 1 bulk chemical and structural properties of efom fractions the hpo fraction of efom exhibits a higher suva 3 10 l mg 1 m 1 compared to that of tpi 1 96 l mg 1 m 1 indicating a higher degree of aromaticity the elemental composition table s1 of the two fractions emphasized their structural difference the hpo fraction features lower h c o c and n c atomic ratios than tpi fraction in accordance with its higher aromatic character and more hydrophobic nature the higher o c and n c values recorded for tpi refer to an organic matrix that is more enriched in oxygenated and nitrogenous functional groups i e more hydrophilic dom previous studies indicated that the majority of don in efom was present in more hydrophilic forms chang et al 2013 qin et al 2015 our results are in agreement with this observation with tpi incorporating 4 30 of nitrogen compared to 3 17 for hpo higher nitrogen content dom refers to organic material with higher amino acids and protein contents leenheer et al 2007 compared to surface water dom isolates e g n c mass ratio of 0 015 0 028 table s2 efom fractions e g n c mass ratio of 0 051 0 12 are more enriched in nitrogenous substances mainly resulting from the release of soluble microbial products during microbial growth decay cycles michael kordatou et al 2015 bio refractory micropollutants as a result of human activities also contribute to the n rich characteristic of efom as justified by the occurrence of some n bearing cecs e g pharmaceuticals and pesticides see table s3 in both hpo and tpi fractions due to the introduction of sulfur containing compounds e g detergents and surfactants from anthropogenic sources the two efom fractions showed a relative abundance of elemental s as observed by previous studies drewes and crouÃ© 2002 gonsior et al 2011 niu et al 2018 3 1 2 characteristics of efom fractions by ft icr ms the molecular compositions of hpo and tpi were characterized by ft icr ms compared to the international reference natural organic matter isolated from the suwannee river srnom that was mainly represented by cho formulae 80 cho yuan et al 2017 only approximately 28 and 31 of the assigned formulae in the hpo and tpi fractions tables s4 and s5 respectively were cho formulae indicating the importance of nitrogen and sulfur containing molecules in efom the formulae assigned in the two fractions are visualized by the van krevelen diagrams fig 1 which show the h c ratios versus the o c ratios of each assigned formula and enable the comparison of the elemental composition between the two efom fractions as shown in fig 1a d 39 n 425 17 n 155 35 n 361 and 10 n 47 of the cho chon chos and chons formulae respectively assigned in the hpo fraction were not detected in the tpi fraction indicating that the two fractions exhibit differing elemental compositions although hundreds of shared formulae were found in the two fractions the intensities of these shared formulae and the five most abundant formulae in each category are significantly different fig 1e l and table s6 in addition a larger number of unique chon n 360 and chons n 371 formulae were found in the tpi fraction compared to the hpo fraction this finding confirmed that the tpi fraction was more enriched in n containing moieties which is well correlated with the elemental composition presented above besides the structural features of the unique formulae assigned in the hpo and tpi fractions were also significantly different the 425 unique cho formulae in the hpo fraction fig 1a are located in the region with relatively lower o c ratios than those of the 387 cho formulae unique in the tpi fraction fig 1m similar observations were obtained from fig 1 for the unique chon chos and chons formulae in the two fractions the intensity weighted average o cw of the unique and shared formulae assigned in hpo and tpi fractions were calculated to quantitatively evaluate the differences in their structural features tables s4 and s5 in the hpo fraction the o cw of the unique cho chon chos and chons formulae were 0 32 0 49 0 26 and 0 37 respectively while those of the unique formulae in the tpi fraction were 0 60 0 51 0 48 and 0 60 respectively such differences indicate that the unique formulae in the tpi fraction exhibited a higher level of oxidation than those in the hpo fraction in agreement with the higher o c ratio determined for the tpi fraction table s1 in addition cl containing formulae including 70 chocl 12 choscl 24 choncl and 4 chonscl formulae were detected in the hpo fraction and 44 chocl 11 choscl 15 choncl 3 chonscl formulae were detected in the tpi fraction tables s7 and s8 the occurrence of these chlorine containing formulae in efom is likely due to the presence of dbps originating from drinking water and chlorine containing micropollutants table s3 the most abundant cl containing formula assigned in the hpo fraction was c7h6o6nscl possibly a chloro hydroxy sulfobenzoic acid with 6 isotope peaks i e 13c 37cl and 34s detected by ft icr ms while c13h21o10cl3 was found as the most abundant cl containing formula in tpi fraction tables s9 interestingly 45 cl containing formulae were both detected in the two fractions besides the frequently detected chocl formulae e g c5h3o4cl3 c4h4o3cl4 and c6h3o5cl3 in water samples treated by chlorination xiang et al 2020 9 nitrogenous cl containing formulae were also found in both fractions it should be pointed out that commonly known n dbps e g haloacetonitriles halonitromethanes and n nitrosodimethylamine were not detected due to the limitation of the detectable mass range in ft icr ms the elemental compositions of the two efom fractions were further compared with those isolated from another wwtp effluent jeddah saudi arabia niu et al 2018 as shown in figs s2 and s3 66 and 72 of the formulae assigned in the hpo and tpi fractions respectively were also detected in the corresponding jeddah wwtp efom fractions the high similarity of the chemical formulae assigned in the efom fractions isolated from different wwtps indicated that the findings in this study could be partially applied to other typical efom 3 2 alteration of efom molecular composition the alteration of formulae incorporating cho ns atoms in the efom fractions by the uv chlorine and chlorination processes was evaluated by comparing the removed recalcitrant and newly formed formulae after the treatment processes figs s4 s7 as shown in fig s4 246 out of the 1076 23 cho formulae in the hpo fraction were removed after the uv chlorine process while 69 new formulae were detected the removed formulae exhibited a lower o cw 0 39 compared to the 830 recalcitrant formulae 0 45 indicating that the reactive species generated in the uv chlorine process preferentially attacked the moieties featuring a lower level of oxygen content besides a higher fraction of chon formulae in the hpo isolate i e 42 434 formulae among 1040 were eliminated after the uv chlorine process compared to the cho formulae this can be explained by the high reactivity of the compounds with nitrogen containing functional groups toward chlorine and rcs deborde and von gunten 2008 lei et al 2021 similarly a higher portion of chon formulae 32 was removed in the tpi fraction compared to the cho formulae 14 after the uv chlorine process further supporting the importance of evaluating the consequential formation of nitrogenous byproducts in addition although the uv chlorine process altered the cho and chos formulae in the efom fractions to a greater extent than chlorination the differences in the alterations of chon and chons formulae between the two processes were less significant 5 7 2 3 difference in the number of removed formulae indicating the important role of chlorine in the transformation of organic nitrogen moieties in efom to further evaluate the differences in the elemental compositions of the efom fractions treated by the two processes the specific formulae detected after each treatment process were compared as shown in the van krevelen diagram fig 2 a the 86 specific cho formulae detected in the hpo fraction treated by chlorination fall within the relatively lower o c and h c region compared to the 79 specific cho formulae detected in the uv chlorine treated hpo fraction moreover these 79 specific cho formulae clustered in the region with a lower modified aromaticity index aimod and less carbon number fig 2b aimod which can be calculated from the formula of each individual compound text s3 reflects the density of c c double bond and aromatic rings e g aimod resorcinol 0 6 koch and dittmar 2006 xiang et al 2020 the lower aimod of the 79 specific cho formulae suggests the destruction of carbon skeletons and cleavage of aromatic rings in the moieties of efom fig 3 a shows the differences in the weighted mean values of molecular indices of the specific formulae assigned in the hpo fraction treated by the two processes considerably higher o cw h cw lower double bond equivalent dbew see text s3 and aimod w of the specific formulae assigned in the hpo fraction treated by the uv chlorine process compared to that by chlorination were observed in all four types of formulae i e cho chon chos and chons besides as depicted by the van krevelen diagrams fig 2c and d and the weighted mean values of molecular indices fig 3b a similar trend was observed for the tpi fraction this indicated that the uv chlorine process increased the level of oxygen content enhanced the level of saturation and decreased the aromaticity of the efom fraction which is likely due to the highly reactive radical species such as oh and rcs generated by the uv photolysis of chlorine wang et al 2021 guo et al 2022 oh has been reported to react with dom model compounds through oh addition leading to the generation of hydroxylated and ring cleavaged products with increased degree of oxidation and decreased aromaticity xiang et al 2020 in addition the activation of dom moieties by oh is anticipated to further promote the alterations by rcs and chlorine species ruan et al 2021 3 3 impact on chlorinated contaminants detected in raw efom fractions in the raw hpo and tpi fractions 82 and 55 carbonaceous chlorine containing molecules were detected respectively while 71 and 85 of these compounds showed a remarkable increase in intensities the statistical analysis is detailed in text s4 after 10 min of uv chlorine exposure meanwhile intensities of 11 of the formulae in hpo and 4 in tpi were significantly decreased or became undetectable tables s7 and s8 similar trends were also observed following chlorination where the intensities of 66 and 85 of carbonaceous chlorine containing molecules in hpo and tpi fractions respectively were significantly increased in addition 18 one sulfur containing chlorinated molecules were detected in the two raw efom fractions with 55 of them exhibiting a significant increase in intensity which is in line with the expectation that sulfur bonds characterized by electron enrichment are prone to attack by cl and oh radicals wang et al 2020 the total absolute intensity of organic chlorine detected in the raw hpo fraction increased by 80 and 120 respectively after chlorination and the uv chlorine process for the tpi fraction the intensities increased by 2 5 times after both treatment processes experimental results demonstrated that uv chlorine and chlorination significantly modified the molecular compositions within efom causing formation and dehalogenation of chlorinated molecules although radical species were generated in the uv chlorine process the prolonged chlorine contact time i e 10 min makes the difference between the two processes insignificant among the intensity increased formulae an aliphatic formula c5h3o4cl3 m z of 230 9024 was detected in both raw efom fractions and both uv chlorine and chlorine treated samples the uv chlorine process significantly increased the yield of c5h3o4cl3 up to 70 folds in hpo and 45 folds in tpi making it the most abundant formula in contrast fold increase by chlorination was 6 and 4 for hpo and tpi respectively the radical induced cleavage of aromatic ring was claimed as the reason for the significantly enhanced formation of aliphatic dbps e g c5h3o4cl3 xiang et al 2020 occurrence of c5h3o4cl3 as a highly abundant molecule was reported from the finished water of a drinking water treatment plant derived from surface water gonsior et al 2014 and chlorination of srnom xiang et al 2020 it is likely that the precursor of c5h3o4cl3 is common to efom and surface water dom approximately 65 of the nitrogenous halogenated compounds detected in the raw efom fractions had a significant intensity increase after both uv chlorine and chlorination processes no obvious difference was observed between the two processes however among the 9 n halogenated compounds both present in raw hpo and tpi fractions 8 of them in tpi exhibited a much higher fold increase after treatment compared to those in hpo table s10 suggesting that nitrogenous enrichment character plays an important role in the formation of this group of molecules 3 4 formation of chlorinated byproducts in this section only the formed halogenated compounds were considered while molecules detected in the raw efom fractions section 3 3 were not taken into account compounds are classified into three groups shared compounds specific compounds and unique compounds shared compounds refer to formulae that were observed in both uv chlorine and chlorine treated samples i e shared by treatment for a given fraction or in both hpo and tpi fractions i e shared by fraction for a given treatment process specific compounds correspond to formulae that were only observed in uv chlorine or chlorine treated samples i e specific by treatment for a given fraction or in treated hpo or tpi fraction i e specific by fraction for a given treatment process molecules that were detected in only one of the four treated samples were classified as unique formulae a total of 212 cho s cl and 260 chon s cl formulae were detected among them 141 cho s cl and 66 chon s cl formulae table s11 were present in all four samples only few formulae were detected in only one sample i e unique formulae while the majority of the identified compounds could be classified as specific or shared formulae by treatment or by fraction 3 4 1 shared formulae more than 74 and 56 of the cho s cl and chon s cl formulae respectively are shared in chlorinated and uv chlorine treated samples table s12 which could be partly due to the prolonged contact time between free chlorine and organic matter in real practice the contact time is within seconds which may lead to a greater difference between the formulae detected in the two processes due to the more prominent role of reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process similarly many identical formulae were detected in both treated hpo and tpi 84 94 for cho s cl and 53 89 for chon s cl respectively table s13 suggesting that the two fractions incorporate a large part of similar dbp precursors as shown in figs 4 a b and 5 a b the uv chlorine process led to a more significant generation of both c dbps and n dbps with higher intensities compared to chlorination these results suggest that under our experimental conditions the uv chlorine process enhanced to a more significant extent the production of halogenated compounds from a larger pool of c dbps and n dbps precursors than chlorination for both treatment processes more chlorinated compounds with higher intensity were formed with tpi compared to hpo and the difference is more significant for n dbps than c dbps figs 4c d and 5c d the much higher production of n dbps with tpi than hpo can be explained by the higher nitrogen content in tpi fig 4a and b plots the shared cho s cl formulae by both treatment processes results clearly indicate that the molecules showing higher intensity after uv chlorine with total absolute intensities of 1 25 0 04 109 hpo and 1 94 0 05 109 tpi are more clustered at higher h c and o c regions compared to the molecules that are more abundant after chlorination with total absolute intensities of 3 83 0 15 108 hpo and 5 41 0 004 108 tpi this finding is not so pronounced for n dbps fig 5a and b fig 4c d indicates that the chlorinated compounds generated with higher intensities from tpi are positioned in the region of higher o c ratio compared to those from hpo which can be partially explained by the more enriched oxygen content of tpi further quantitative analysis table s14 indicated for the two fractions that the cho s cl formulae showing higher intensity after uv chlorine treatment exhibited higher h cw higher o cw lower dbew and lower aimod w compared to those showing higher intensity after chlorination however differences recorded between the two treatments were more significant for hpo compared to tpi a similar trend of the differences in molecular indices is evidenced from the data provided in table s14 for chon s cl formulae while more significant differences exist between c dbps and n dbps overall the h cw o cw values were lower and dbew and aimod w values were higher for c dbps generated from hpo than those from tpi when comparing the two treatment processes table s15 note that this is in agreement with the different structural characteristics between the two efom fractions furthermore the intensity weighted average carbon numbers of the dbps with a higher intensity after uv chlorine treatment were 6 5 and 5 7 for hpo and tpi fractions respectively which were lower than the respective numbers calculated after chlorination 8 4 and 8 7 likely due to the radical attack of dbps precursors in the uv chlorine process some regulated dbps including dichloroacetic acid dcaa and trichloroacetic acid tcaa were also detected as shared formulae the intensities of dcaa detected in the sample treated by the uv chlorine process were 81 and 79 higher than those by chlorination in the hpo and tpi fractions respectively a homolog of dcaa c2h2o2cl2 c3h4o2cl2 was also generated and the intensities in the uv chlorine treated fractions were 39 hpo and 146 tpi higher compared to the chlorine treated ones interestingly the intensity of tcaa was not affected by the treatment processes in the tpi fraction 3 4 2 specific formulae the uv chlorine process enhanced the number of specific c dbps specific by treatment generated from efom fractions compared to chlorination i e 41 and 4 for hpo 28 and 12 for tpi respectively fig 4a b the specific c dbps in uv chlorine treated hpo fraction are characterized with higher h cw and o cw but lower dbew and aimod w compared to those in chlorine treated hpo fraction table s16 partially due to the involvement of rcs favoring the formation of chlorinated formulae located in the high o c region bulman and remucal 2020 the difference of dbew and aimod w values between the two hpo fractions treated by uv chlorine and chlorination is more pronounced than for tpi which is likely attributed to more abundant aromatic moieties within hpo preferentially vulnerable to oh and rcs attack in the uv chlorine process radical induced reactions during the uv chlorine process led to more hydrophilic less unsaturated aromatic type c dbps than chlorination ruan et al 2021 fig 4c d displays the comparison of the elemental compositions of specific formulae detected in the two fractions the o cw of the specific formulae detected in the tpi fraction was found to be 67 70 higher than that of the specific formulae in hpo fraction while the h cw dbew and aimod w were 14 24 15 44 and 16 54 lower after chlorination and uv chlorine treatment respectively table s17 for the two fractions although a significant amount of shared n dbp formulae were detected after both treatments a greater number of specific compounds were produced after uv chlorine exposure 52 for hpo 73 for tpi compared to chlorination 22 for hpo 33 for tpi fig 5a b in addition the tpi fraction generated much more specific formulae with higher intensity than the hpo fraction for both treatments fig 5c d the largest amount of specific n dbps was observed with the uv chlorine treated tpi fraction n 99 similar to c dbps for both efom fractions specific n dbps produced from the uv chlorine treatment are characterized by higher h cw and o cw but lower dbew and aimod w compared to those from chlorination table s16 interestingly significantly higher dbew and aimod w were calculated for n dbps compared to c dbps for both efom and for the two treatments tables s16 and 17 additionally some n dbps with a shorter carbon skeleton n 5 were only observed in the sample treated by the uv chlorine process the average carbon number of the specific n dbps generated during the uv chlorine process was smaller than that during chlorination 8 2 vs 9 3 for hpo 7 9 vs 8 9 for tpi likely due to the breakdown of the precursors or dbps by the radical attack in the uv chlorine process the number of chlorine atoms in dbps generated from the two processes were compared the uv chlorine process favored the production of higher chlorine containing molecules compared to chlorination fig s8 formulae incorporating 3 cl atoms were the most abundant after uv chlorine application representing 61 and 50 of all specific c dbps by treatment for tpi and hpo respectively formulae containing 2 cl atoms tend to be the most abundant following chlorination compared to c dbps the formed n dbps incorporate less chlorine atoms in their structure fig s9 mainly 1 cl the most abundant and 2 cl formulae were detected overall more compounds with higher cl incorporation were found with tpi for the two treatments however similar to c dbps higher halogen incorporation was observed for the two fractions after the uv chlorine treatment compared to chlorination 3 4 3 unique formulae only few unique c dbps fig s10a were observed and the uv chlorine treated tpi generated more unique c dbps than the hpo fraction these unique formulae are listed in table s18 and the possible structures of formulae with low carbon numbers i e 6 are proposed according to previous publications and the chemspider database notably c6ho3cl3 a unique formula only detected in the uv chlorine treated hpo is possibly a halo hydroxyl benzoquinone 2 3 5 trichloro 6 hydroxy 1 4 benzoquinone that has been detected in finished drinking water and was substantially more toxic than the regulated dbps wang et al 2014 the tpi fraction generated more unique n dbps compared to the hpo fraction fig s10b as expected the uv chlorine process was more prone to produce unique n dbps than chlorination with the tpi fraction dbps unique in uv chlorine treated fractions have higher o cw and lower aimod w compared to those unique after chlorination table s19 two unique n dbps c8h6no4cl3 in tpi chlorination and c8h6no5cl3 in tpi uv chlorine shared the same formulae with the chlorination products of tryptophan lu et al 2021 suggesting that aromatic amino acids could be the precursors of these n dbps 3 5 precursor tracking the possible precursors of n dbps were tracked in the raw hpo and tpi fractions by considering electrophilic substitution and hocl addition as the possible chlorination pathways the precursor tracking method is described in detail in text s5 compared to the hocl addition pathway a greater number of precursors were found through the electrophilic substitution pathway interestingly most of the n dbps detected in chlorinated or uv chlorine treated tpi fraction can find their precursors 81 85 in raw tpi when considering chlorine substitution as the formation pathway while the ratio decreased to 25 30 for those generated from the hpo fraction tables s20 21 besides for both the uv chlorine and chlorination processes more n dbp precursors were found in treated hpo compared to the raw hpo while an opposite trend was observed for the tpi fraction as shown in table s20 51 n dbps in uv chlorine treated hpo can find their precursors in the treated sample through chlorine substitution pathway in which 34 of the precursors were also detected in raw hpo and 17 were newly produced in the treated hpo table s20 indicating that the formation of dbps from hpo could involve multiple transformation steps and new precursors can be generated after the treatment processes as for the tpi fraction 167 out of the 207 n dbps detected after the uv chlorine process can match with the corresponding precursors in raw tpi while the number decreased to 152 when matching the precursors in the uv chlorine treated tpi this suggests that some of the possible precursors detected in raw efom fractions became undetectable after the chlorination or the uv chlorine process possibly due to the conversion toward dbps or other transformation products 3 6 toxicity evaluation it has been previously reported that water treatment processes can increase oxidative stress responses and genotoxicity farrÃ© et al 2013 xiao et al 2017 neale et al 2020 dbp formation accounted for up to 58 of oxidative stress response after water chlorination while volatile dbps only have a minor contribution hebert et al 2018 in our study the presence of hpo versus tpi efom significantly affected the levels of intracellular ros either by the uv chlorine or chlorine treatments fig 6 while the hpo fraction alone is responsible for increased toxicity in hepg2 cells as measured by cytotoxicity ros levels and other bioenergetic parameters figs 6 and s11 after treatment its presence also induced a significant increase in dna damage as shown by the levels of ph2ax fig 6 phosphorylation of h2ax is one of the widely used biomarkers of double strand breaks dsbs kuo and yang 2008 and dsbs refer to a dna damage mechanism that if left unrepaired can lead to chromosome rearrangements chromosomal deletions or other damaging mutations scully and xie 2013 collins et al 2020 among other causes oxidative stress is one of the most common inducing mechanisms for genotoxicity ma 2013 for halogenated dbps oxidative stress induced dna damage is one of the major mechanisms responsible for increased genotoxicity pals et al 2011 lan et al 2018 noteworthy is also the fact that nitrogen containing dbps are generally more genotoxic than the dbps that do not contain nitrogen plewa et al 2008 however although the tpi fraction generated a greater number of n dbps compared to the hpo fraction the levels of dna damage induced by the treated tpi samples were less than those by the hpo samples indicating that higher n dbps diversity does not always mean higher toxicity inter sample ranking analysis was performed using spearman rank correlation to link the levels of dna damage with the corresponding peak intensity of individual compounds including chlorine containing and non chlorine containing compounds detected by ft icr ms to identify the potential toxicity contributors it should be noted that only formulae detected in at least 5 out of the 6 samples were used during the calculation to avoid weak correlations the distribution of the significance levels of the chlorinated byproducts with the levels of dna damage is shown in fig s12 a total of 97 formulae were found to be positively correlated with dna damage with a high significance level p 0 05 implying that these formulae could be possible contributors to dna damage 22 out of the 97 formulae were chlorinated byproducts and 6 of them have been previously detected by zhang et al 2021 the elemental compositions and the significance levels of these 22 formulae are shown in table s22 c6h5o4scl possibly a chloro hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid was found to be the dbp with the strongest correlation p 0 001 with dna damage c5ho3cl3 was the most abundant one among these 22 dbps in our study c5ho3cl3 has also been detected in a drinking water plant in sweden as the most abundant peak and its structure was proposed as trichloro hydroxy cyclopentene dione gonsior et al 2014 the chemical formula of the n dbp with the highest significance level was c8h6o5ncl p 0 01 attention should be paid to these formulae for further toxicological evaluation 4 conclusion the study investigated uv chlorine induced transformation of efom and the resultant formation of chlorinated formulae with a focus on unknown n dbps by ft icr ms the multiple reactive radical species in the uv chlorine process facilitated the alteration of efom into formulae e g dbps featuring higher degree of oxygen content lower aromaticity and less carbon number compared with chlorination moreover uv chlorine enhanced the diversity and abundance of the formed c dbps and n dbps and favored the formation of higher cl incorporating compounds where formulae bearing 3 cl and 1 cl atoms were the dominant c dbps and n dbps respectively the tpi fraction of efom containing more nitrogenous functional groups generated a larger number of n dbps i e 207 than the hpo fraction i e 117 after the uv chlorine treatment meanwhile the tpi fraction led to more specific and unique n dbps with high intensity positioned in higher o c region compared to hpo precursor tracking suggested that formation of dbps from efom could involve multiple transformation steps nevertheless a large number of dbps could find their precursor from the raw efom through electrophilic substitution pathway the presence of hpo efom alone substantially contributed to the increased cytotoxicity the level of cytotoxicity was reduced after the uv chlorine treatment while oxidative stress induced dna damage was observed due to the formation of dbps bioassay assessment found no strong relationship between the overall toxicity and the diversity abundance of the formed n dbps totally 75 non dbps and 22 identified dbps formulae show a significant rank correlation with dna damage our study suggests that the character of efom and the transformation byproducts are both critical in comprehensively evaluating the uv chlorine process toward application further research is needed to determine the structure of dbps corresponding to the newly detected molecular formulae results that will help improving our knowledge on dbps formation mechanism and precursor origin particular effort should be deployed to identify the toxicity contributors detected in the current study and conduct a toxicological evaluation of the formed n dbps
