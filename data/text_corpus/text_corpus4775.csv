23875,this manuscript investigates the effectiveness of two possible horizontal discretizations for the global ocean model mpas ocean both applied to spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts the first discretization is trisk a c grid finite volume method that possesses many desirable mimetic properties but has a low order accuracy the second discretization was introduced for the first time by peixoto 2016 and consists of modifications to the trisk scheme designed to achieve at least first order accuracy in the l norm with the loss of some of the mimetic properties tests on shallow water and primitive equation models show that the scheme due to peixoto is indeed more accurate but presents stability issues with respect to trisk trisk is indeed found to be often more stable in time and more robust with respect to errors in the geometric properties of the grid keywords staggered c grid spherical voronoi grid mimetic discretization 1 introduction in recent years c grid discretizations have been largely adopted by atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models thanks to the relatively accurate representation of wave modes and transport processes which allows simulations on time scales of decades to centuries among c grid discretizations the trisk scheme is a finite difference volume method that is applicable to variable resolution unstructured meshes it was introduced for the first time in thuburn et al 2009 where it is shown how to discretize the coriolis terms on arbitrarily structured c grids to ensure that geostrophic modes are stationary while the coriolis terms remain energy neutral later it was applied to the nonlinear shallow water equations ringler et al 2010 since 2010 trisk has been used in the model for prediction across scales mpas for the atmosphere skamarock et al 2012 the ocean ringler et al 2013 petersen et al 2015 2019 golaz et al 2019 and in other studies weller et al 2012 weller 2012 kevlahan and dubos 2019 weller 2014 trisk possesses many desirable mimetic properties including mass conservation energy neutral coriolis and pressure terms conservation of total energy steady geostrophic modes on the f plane compatible discretization of potential vorticity with its lagrangian behavior but presents a low order accuracy in ringler et al 2010 it is shown that trisk is second order accurate in the l 2 error norm in most shallow water test cases but it also fails to converge in the l norm in some of these test cases a modification of the trisk scheme that assures first order accuracy in the maximum and l norm is presented in peixoto 2016 this scheme hereafter named the peixoto scheme proposes two main changes the first one being a different location of the normal velocities on the grid trisk is usually applied to spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts ju et al 2011 senechal 1993 where the mass tracers pressure and kinetic energy are defined at centers of the primal hexagonal pentagonal cells and the normal component of velocity is located at the edge midpoints of the dual triangle cells the midpoint of the triangle edges represents the point on the voronoi cell edge that intersects the triangle edge and in the case of general variable resolution meshes the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges and the triangle cell edges do not coincide in the peixoto scheme the placement of the velocity variables will be slightly different from trisk i e the velocities are positioned on the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges instead of the midpoint of the triangle edges this difference in positioning is shown to have significant impact on the accuracy of the discrete schemes peixoto 2016 the second main modification involves a different reconstruction of the discrete operators for the i divergence ii vorticity iii kinetic energy and iv coriolis terms the divergence and kinetic energy operators in trisk fail to approximate the continuous ones with increasing resolution in the l norm causing the method to be inconsistent in the peixoto scheme modifications to the trisk formulation of these two operators and vorticity and coriolis terms are proposed to achieve consistency on each discrete operator a drawback of the peixoto scheme is the loss of some of the mimetic properties of trisk i e 1 total energy will no longer be conserved 2 the geostrophic modes will no longer be steady on the f plane 3 the potential vorticity discretization will no longer be compatible with its lagrangian behavior the different discretization of the kinetic energy and the loss of a mimetic duality between the divergence and gradient operator is what causes the loss of total energy conservation whereas a different discretization of the coriolis term is the cause of points 2 and 3 in this work we compare the performance of the trisk and peixoto schemes in mpas ocean ringler et al 2013 petersen et al 2015 to determine if the latter would be a possible alternative to trisk which is the standard horizontal discretization of the ocean model the comparison is made in terms of accuracy stability and trade off in losing some properties of trisk an experimental convergence analysis is performed to compare the accuracy of the two schemes and metrics are given to quantify the trade off in losing total energy conservation in order to achieve first order accuracy in the l norm both schemes are tested on shallow water and primitive equation models this is the first time that the peixoto scheme is tested on a fully 3d model recent studies on this scheme peixoto et al 2018 yu et al 2020 always use shallow water models which provide a good but only partial insight on the actual behavior in a 3d model the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the two schemes within a shallow water system focusing on the differences of the grids and discrete operators in section 3 we test the two methods on a shallow water model and a fully 3d model comparing them in terms of accuracy total energy conservation and stability finally in section 4 we draw our conclusions 2 discretizations in this section the trisk and peixoto schemes are described highlighting their differences in the grids and in the formulation of the discrete operators a theoretical analysis of discrete operators for the two schemes has already been performed in peixoto 2016 and ringler et al 2010 therefore we will not repeat it in this work in general since both schemes employ a combination of piecewise linear and piecewise constant interpolations between 1st and 2nd order accuracy may be expected overall without loss of generality we focus on a shallow water system but the description can be easily generalized to a primitive equation system we consider the vector invariant form of the nonlinear shallow water equations on the sphere adapted from ringler et al 2010 and stated as 1 h t h u 0 2 u t q h u g h b k where h is fluid thickness u is the fluid vector velocity g is gravity b is the bottom topography k u 2 2 is the kinetic energy and q is the potential vorticity the term u is defined as u k u where k is the unit vector that points in the local vertical direction in eq 1 h u represents the divergence of the thickness flux whereas in eq 2 the term g h b k is the pressure gradient term and q h u is the nonlinear coriolis force we recall that q η h where η is the absolute vorticity defined as η k u f with f being the coriolis parameter the discretized version of system 1 2 is 3 h i t d i 4 u e t q e g e where d i g e and q e are discretizations of the divergence term gradient term and coriolis term respectively which depend on the grid used for the discretization scheme these operators are described in detail in the next sections for both the trisk and peixoto scheme the subscripts i and e indicate the positions of the variables and terms at either the cell centers i or the edge points e the exact location of the edge points depends once again on the grid used for the discretization scheme 2 1 grid specifications the grids used in this study consist of quasi uniform spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts built using an icosahedral geodesic grid the coarsest grid is shown in fig 1 a and is composed of 12 pentagonal voronoi cells primal grid and an underlying dual triangular grid dual grid refinements of this mesh are obtained by incremental bisection of the spherical triangles edges and application of an scvt optimization procedure which iteratively re positions triangle vertices to lie at the center of mass of their associated voronoi cells ju et al 2011 meshes were generated in this study using the jigsaw library engwirda 2017 see fig 1 b for an example of a four level refined grid from now on p i will indicate a primal mesh cell and d v a dual mesh cell let the center of any primal mesh cell p i be denoted by x i and the center of any the dual mesh cell d v be denoted by x v the points x i are the generators of a spherical voronoi tessellation and due to the use of scvt optimization are also approximations of the centroids mass centers of the voronoi cells recall that the points x i coincide with the vertices of the dual mesh triangles we will use a c grid staggering where the fluid height h is stored at x i and the normal component of the velocities u e is stored at the edge point x e due to the use of voronoi type grids the edges of the polygonal mesh cells are exactly orthogonal to the dual delaunay triangle edges an interesting consequence of working in a spherical space is that meshes do not necessarily become more uniform with refinement on the sphere the icosahedral topology used in our study is the most regular uniform available but there is a constant geometrical offset between voronoi delaunay edges in the scvt meshes that is seen to persist in spite of additional grid refinement peixoto 2016 this situation is in contrast to analyses on the cartesian plane manteuffel and white 1986 and shows that additional care is needed to create convergent discretizations on the sphere the exact location of x e differs between trisk and the peixoto scheme in trisk x e corresponds to the midpoint of the triangle edges which represents a point on the voronoi cell edge that intersects the triangle edges we will call this positioning hct whereas in the peixoto scheme x e corresponds to the midpoint of the edges of the voronoi cells we will call this positioning hcm on a mesh with exact hexagons the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges and the triangle cell edges coincide but in general they do not and fig 2 shows an example of such a situation to distinguish the location of x e given by the two grids we will refer to x e h c t to indicate the location of x e for the hct positioning and x e h c m to indicate the location of x e for the hcm positioning note that since x e h c t lies on the intersection between the voronoi cell edge and the triangle edge hct grids are orthogonal i e x e x i d e n e 2 on the other hand on hcm grids the orthogonality property will hold only approximately x e x i d e n e 2 ε e t e where ε e is a constant that depends on the distance between x e h c t and x e h c t m fig 2 also displays the vectors n e and t e and the lengths d e and l e where n e is a unit vector defined to be parallel to the line connecting primal mesh cells t e is a second unit vector defined such that t e k n e d e measures the distance between the primal mesh cells sharing edge e and l e measures the length of the voronoi edge e 2 2 divergence both trisk and the peixoto scheme adopt the same discretization for the divergence term 5 d i 1 a i e e c i n e i h e u e l e where u e is the normal component of the velocity h e is the interpolation of the fluid height to the edges a i is the area of the cell p i and n e i is an indicator function such that n e i 1 when n e is an outward normal of p i and n e i 1 when n e is an inward normal of p i as in ringler et al 2010 the notation e e c i indicates the set of edges that define the boundary of p i table 1 shows the definitions of the element groups used to build the discrete system please refer to fig 2 in ringler et al 2010 for examples of these element groups what changes between trisk and the peixoto scheme is how the fluid height is interpolated i e the computation of h e trisk uses an hct grid which is orthogonal and so the simple average 6 h e h i h j 2 will give a second order approximation with i and j indices of the voronoi cells that share the edge e on a hcm grid 6 will result in a first order approximation only to obtain a second order interpolation the peixoto scheme uses a linear interpolation with baricentric coordinates peixoto 2016 peixoto and barros 2014 let e be a voronoi cell edge and t k be a triangle that contains the interpolation point x e h c m assume that x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the three vertices of t k where the fluid height h 1 h 2 and h 3 are defined then h e is computed as 7 h e i c v v a i x e h c m a k h i where a i x e h c m is the area of the triangle formed by the two vertices opposite to i and the interpolation point x e h c m a k is the area of the triangle t k and the notation i c v v is given in table 1 fig 3 shows an example of the three areas a 1 a 2 and a 3 note that on a grid with exact hexagons where the midpoints of the voronoi cell edge and the triangle edge match exactly eqs 6 and 7 would be equivalent in conclusion both interpolations 6 and 7 are second order accurate on a hct and hcm grid respectively interestingly in peixoto and barros 2014 it is shown that three necessary conditions must hold for the divergence term 5 to achieve first order accuracy with one of these being that the edge point is the midpoint of the voronoi cell i e hcm positioning therefore on hct grids this discretization is in general inconsistent in the maximum and l norm since it does not converge on hcm grids the other two necessary conditions for 5 to be first order accurate in the maximum and l norm are i the values of h e are at least second order accurate and ii the dual grid does not have obtuse triangles for meshes where condition ii is satisfied interpolation 7 on hcm grids fulfills the requirements for the discrete operator to be first order accurate in the maximum norm 2 3 gradient term the gradient term g e is discretized in the same way in trisk and the peixoto scheme i e 8 g e g d e h i b i h j b j 1 d e k i k j where i indicates the index of the voronoi cell which the reference normal edge vector points to and j indicates the opposite cell since g e depends on k i and k j its accuracy relies on the accuracy of the kinetic energy reconstructed to the cells i j in trisk the kinetic energy is discretized as 9 k i 1 4 a i e e c i l e d e u e 2 where d e and l e represent the distance between the centers of the primal mesh cells sharing edge e and the length of such a voronoi edge respectively this discretization leads to total energy conservation ringler et al 2010 but it is not consistent on a scvt as shown in fig 5 in peixoto 2016 where no convergence is obtained in the l norm for this reason the gradient term does not converge in the l norm as well on hct grids g e could potentially be second order accurate provided that the kinetic energy discretization is second order accurate but this is not the case for trisk the potential second order accuracy comes from the fact that g e s discretization is a central differencing on orthogonal grids the peixoto scheme proposes a difference discretization than 9 for the kinetic energy i e 10 k i 1 2 u i u i where the velocities at the cell centers are reconstructed as 11 u i 1 a i e e c i x e h c m x i u e l e in perot 2000 it is shown that this discretization is first order in the maximum norm if the normal velocities are given at the midpoints of the voronoi edges that is on hcm grids on such grids since the orthogonality property holds only approximately the gradient term 8 can be at most first order accurate using the discretization provided in 10 and 11 g e is indeed first order accurate in the peixoto scheme on scvts peixoto 2016 on the other hand using 10 and 11 total energy conservation is lost note that if the midpoints of the voronoi and triangular cell edges coincide then eqs 10 11 would reduce to 9 since we would have u i x e x i u e d e 2 2 4 vorticity the discretization of the potential vorticity q η h is required for the perpendicular term q e of the momentum equation and it depends on the discretization of the absolute vorticity η k u f and the fluid height h i e 12 q v η v h v let us focus on the term h v first in both trisk and the peixoto scheme the interpolation of the fluid height at the voronoi cell vertices uses the values of the fluid height at the cell centers but the interpolation weights are different in ringler et al 2010 h v is defined as 13 h v 1 a k i c v v a i v h i where the weights a i v are the areas of the intersection of the primal voronoi and dual triangular cells and a k is the area of the triangle t k whose vertices belong to the set c v v in the peixoto scheme the weights are determined using barycentric coordinates i e 14 h v 1 a k i c v v b i v h i where b i v is the area of the triangle formed by the two vertices of t k opposite to i and the circumcenter of t k this interpolation is similar to the one adopted for h e in the divergence operator with the only difference that now the interpolation point is the triangle circumcenter instead of the location of the velocity x e h c m fig 4 shows the difference between the areas a i v and b i v the difference choice of weights for h v affects the accuracy of the two approximations eq 13 leads to a first order approximation on a hct grid ringler et al 2010 whereas 14 results in a second order approximation on a hcm grid peixoto 2016 now let us focus on the numerator of 12 η v this term can be written as 15 η v ζ v f v where f v is the coriolis parameter calculated at the voronoi cell vertices and ζ v is the discretization of the relative vorticity ζ given by 16 ζ v 1 a v e e v v u e t e v d e where a v is the area of the triangle with circumcenter v and the indicator function t e v is defined such that t e v 1 if the vector k n e is directed toward x v otherwise in 1 eq 16 is the discretization adopted for the relative vorticity in both trisk and the peixoto scheme the analysis in peixoto and barros 2014 shows that this discretization is first order accurate on grids where the tangent components of the velocities are at least second order accurately calculated at the midpoints of the edges of the triangle therefore on hct grids we have a first order approximation for the relative vorticity on hcm grids 16 will in general lead to an inconsistent discretization since the normal velocities at the midpoints of the voronoi cells do not directly represent the tangents at the midpoints of the triangle edges for more details about this inconsistency please refer to appendix a in peixoto 2016 in conclusion in the trisk scheme both h v and η v are first order accurate leading to a first order accurate potential vorticity discretization in the peixoto scheme h v is second order accurate but η v does not converge in the l norm leading to an inconsistent discretization for the potential vorticity comparing the divergence and curl operators it is important to highlight that either one of them will be inconsistent on the hcm or hct grids on hct grids the problem will occur on the divergence whereas for the hcm grids it will be in the vorticity 2 5 coriolis term the discretization of the potential vorticity introduced in the section above is needed for the coriolis term for both trisk and the peixoto scheme the coriolis term is discretized as 17 q e e e c p e w e e h e u e q e q e 2 where w e e indicates the weights and 18 q e 1 2 v i n v e e q v represents the interpolation of the potential vorticity values on the voronoi cell edges the arithmetic mean 18 results in a first order interpolation on hct grids since the interpolation point does not coincide with the midpoint of the edge on the other hand on hcm grids this interpolation is second order accurate peixoto 2016 the term e e c p e w e e h e u e represents the flux interpolation operator i e 19 h e u e e e c p e w e e h e u e the weights w e e differ between trisk and the peixoto scheme in trisk 20 w e e c e e l e d e 1 2 v a i v a i n e i where the sum is within the vertices v between edge e and e n e i is an indicator function introduced in section 2 2 and c e e is a general sign correction relative to the orientation of the tangent vector at e with respect to the dual triangular cell for more details about c e e refer to thuburn et al 2009 the areas a i v are the overlapping quadrilateral areas between the voronoi cell and the dual triangular cell already introduced in section 2 4 in general the coriolis term with the weights provided in 20 is consistent for regular hexagons but it appears to be inconsistent on icosahedral meshes as shown in weller 2014 nevertheless the weights given in 20 ensure compatible potential vorticity evolution as shown in thuburn et al 2009 finally the coriolis term is in general energy neutral on a hct grid because of the skew symmetry of the weights w e e e g w e e w e e and the averaging in 17 of the potential vorticity values on the voronoi cell edges i e q e q e 2 in the peixoto scheme the weights are defined as follows 21 w e e 1 2 l e a i x e h c m x i t e since on a hcm grid the orthogonality property holds only approximately energy conservation is not ensured in this case the closer the distance between the midpoints of the voronoi and triangle edges is the more the energy conserving condition is met within an acceptable error bound another important thing to notice is that since the discretization of the potential vorticity is inconsistent on hcm grids so is the discretization 17 of the coriolis term in peixoto 2016 the peixoto scheme is tested also on special types of hcm grids in which the midpoints of the triangle edges converge to the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges with grid refinement this type of grid was introduced by heikes and randall 1995a b the discretization of relative vorticity 16 which is inconsistent on a general hcm grid is on the other hand first order accurate on a heikes and randall grid leading to a first order accurate discretization of the potential vorticity therefore the discretization of the coriolis term with weights 21 becomes consistent on a heikes and randall grid as shown in peixoto 2016 in this work we are not using such grids thus eq 17 with weights 21 will be inconsistent on the hcm grids adopted 3 numerical results in this section we compare the numerical performance of the two schemes described above in terms of accuracy stability and trade off in losing mimetic properties like total energy conservation first we show results solving a shallow water model using test case 2 tc2 and 5 tc5 from williamson et al 1992 and the barotropically unstable jet test case from galewsky et al 2004 second we move to a fully 3d model and we solve a spin up test case with a global real world configuration the 3d test is run on two variable resolution meshes an eddy closure ec mesh that parameterizes mesoscale eddies and a rossby radius deformation scaling rrs mesh that resolves mesoscale eddies over most of the globe for the three shallow water test cases a four stages fourth order runge kutta method is used as time stepping scheme whereas for the 3d spin up test cases a split explicit scheme that takes advantage of a baroclinic barotropic time splitting is adopted this scheme is the standard option in mpas ocean and it consists of a splitting where the barotropic velocity and total ocean depth are explicitly subcycled within each large time step taken for the three dimensional baroclinic velocity please refer to ringler et al 2013 for more details on this split explicit method for the tc2 simulations the time step used is 180s for the tc5 simulations is 60s and for the barotropic jet simulations is 30s finally for the 3d spin up test a baroclinic time step of 60 min is used for the ec mesh and 2 min for the rrs grid for all the tests the meshes consist of scvts for the shallow water tests four spatial resolutions are used 2562 10 242 40 962 and 163 842 voronoi cells corresponding to a refinement level of 4 5 6 and 7 respectively of an scvt optimized icosahedron grid the time step sizes discussed above for the different test cases were used for all the four refinement levels in all configurations tight convergence of the scvt iteration is obtained updating the grid geometry via a sequence of lloyd like iterations du et al 1999 until a relative tolerance of 1 1 0 8 was reached for the tests that do not have an analytic solution a reference solution is obtained on a grid level 9 that has 2 621 442 voronoi cell for the 3d spin up test case the two variable resolution meshes are named hereafter ec60to30 and rrs30to10 in the ec60to30 grid a resolution going from 30 km at the equator and poles to 60 km at mid latitudes is used this mesh contains 235 160 voronoi cells 60 vertical layers and has been used extensively for moderate resolution realistic climate studies petersen et al 2019 golaz et al 2019 the resolution for the rrs30to10 mesh ranges from 30 km near the equator to 10 km at the poles for a total of 1 445 361 voronoi cells and the mesh includes 80 vertical layers to analyze accuracy we consider the l 2 and l norms defined as in ringler et al 2010 22 l 2 s f n j f r j 2 1 2 s f r j 2 1 2 23 l max j f n j f r j max j f r j where 24 s f j j f j a j j a j the function f n j is the numerical solution defined at the point j on the numerical mesh and f r j is the reference solution at the same j position the reference solution is either an analytic solution or a high resolution solution in the l 2 norm the function s f computes the global average of f where a j is the area associated with cell p j to analyze total energy we plot its variation calculated as the absolute difference between actual energy and initial energy divided by the initial energy similarly we compute the enstrophy variation for the two schemes as well 3 1 test case 2 steady state zonal geostrophic flow the test case 2 tc2 of williamson et al 1992 defines a zonal flow velocity field with the height in balance with the wind the problem is steady state so the initial condition should remain over all time integration the initial height and velocity field have the form 25 g h g h 0 a ω u 0 u 0 2 2 cos θ 26 u u 0 cos θ the physical parameters of the system are ω 7 292 1 0 5 s 1 g 9 80616 m s 2 and a 6 37122 1 0 6 m latitude is denoted by θ g h 0 2 94 1 0 4 m 2 s 2 and u 0 2 π a 12 days the initial condition coincides with the analytical solution for this test case fig 5 shows the convergence rate of tc2 at day 12 for the refinement levels 4 5 6 and 7 the rate is measured by the l 2 and l norms based on the thickness field norms are computed with respect to analytic solution as expected the trisk scheme does not converge in the l norm but is between 1st and 2nd order accuracy in the l 2 norm on the other hand the peixoto scheme shows second order convergence in both the l and l 2 norm this gain in accuracy comes with a loss of total energy conservation and such a loss is quantified in fig 6 where the energy variation is displayed over 15 days together with the variation in enstrophy for all four resolutions the peixoto scheme exhibits errors in total energy conservation greater than those of the trisk scheme but within reasonable bounds the enstrophy variation is similar in both schemes another important feature to look at is stability even thought the peixoto scheme shows a higher accuracy than trisk and a total energy variation within reasonable bounds it is stable only up to 35 days in general all schemes tend to develop rossby style wave modes over time and for this test case trisk appears to keep the amplitude of these waves bounded maintaining a stable instantaneous error in the height field over time see fig 7 on the other hand the peixoto scheme develops a large instantaneous error in the height field over time that causes the simulation to crash after 70 days similar results were found in yu et al 2020 3 2 test case 5 flow over mountain tc5 consists in a solid body rotation flow over an isolated mountain at mid latitude the mountain is of the form 27 b b 0 1 r r 0 with b 0 2000 m r 0 π 9 and r 2 min r 2 λ λ c 2 θ θ c 2 where λ is longitude the values of λ c and θ c are π 2 and π 6 respectively the wind and height field are as in tc2 with h 0 5960 m and u 0 20 ms 1 since this test case does not have an analytic solution convergence rates are obtained using a high resolution reference solution on a level 9 grid the rates are provided in fig 8 in this test case the l 2 and l norms are similar for the two methods with both schemes showing near second order convergence in terms of energy and enstrophy variation fig 9 shows larger errors in total energy conservation for the peixoto scheme the differences in energy variation between trisk and the peixoto scheme are larger in this test case than in tc2 another difference between tc2 and tc5 is the enstrophy variation with the peixoto scheme showing errors about on order of magnitude greater than those of the trisk scheme for this test case we did not asses the stability of the methods nevertheless more results on the stability are shown for the two remaining test cases 3 3 barotropically unstable jet test case the barotropic jet test case from galewsky et al 2004 consists of a basic zonal flow with a corresponding balanced height field to which a small perturbation is added the perturbation is used to induce the development of barotropic instability as for the two previous tests we quantify the variation in energy and enstrophy over time fig 10 shows that the order of magnitude of the errors in total energy conservation are the same as those obtained with tc5 so the loss of total energy conservation is within reasonable bounds for the peixoto scheme for this test case the variations in enstrophy are larger than for tc2 and tc5 but the difference between the errors of trisk and the peixoto scheme is still of approximately one order of magnitude the development of the barotropic instability is fully visible at day 6 when the initially unstable vorticity field rolls up into a number of vortices that progressively move eastward fig 11 shows such vortices obtained with a level 7 grid using the solution shown in galewsky et al 2004 fig 4 as reference solution we see that the jet has 4 well defined vortices at day 6 due to its higher accuracy the peixoto method is able to capture these 4 vortices whereas the solution obtained with trisk shows a spurious wave number 6 pattern in the tail of the jet rather than the desired quiescent flow these behaviors align with results shown in peixoto 2016 to study the accuracy and stability of the two schemes on unstructured meshes we investigate how the resolved vortex pattern responds to perturbations in the underlying structure of the numerical grid degrading the quality of the tessellation by a process we denote as jumbling taking an optimized scvt icosahedral grid as input the mesh jumbling procedure consists of adding a small quasi random perturbation to the position of mesh vertices and rebuilding the mesh topology to ensure the perturbed grid consists of proper voronoi cells the magnitude of the vertex perturbations are scaled by the diameter of each voronoi cell ensuring predictable results across varying mesh resolutions the resulting jumbled grids are of lower mesh quality than the optimized icosahedral inputs consisting of distorted cells and triangles defined by irregular edge lengths areas and angles the result obtained with trisk on a lower quality level 7 grid is not very different from the one shown in fig 11 and similarly vorticity patterns obtained with lower quality level 6 and 8 grids do not differ significantly from the corresponding pattern obtained on the standard level 6 and 8 grids not shown on the other hand the peixoto scheme is greatly affected by a jumbled mesh as fig 12 shows the solution becomes noisy on a lower quality mesh indicating that this scheme is more affected by the grid used than trisk the noise is even more evident on a jumbled level 6 grid this noise is an indication of the potential instability of the peixoto scheme over long time horizons instability that was already noticed in the simpler tc2 3 4 3d model ec60to30 spin up test case in this test case we solve a primitive equation system i e the incompressible boussinesq equations in hydrostatic balance their continuous and discretized form can be found in ringler et al 2013 in appendix a this test case consists of a global real world configuration on the mesh ec60to30 that has a resolution that varies from a 30 km resolution at the equator and poles to a 60 km resolution at the mid latitudes and it includes continents and realistic bathymetry the z star coordinate system within an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian framework is used in the vertical with 60 layers petersen et al 2015 the time stepping splits the baroclinic and barotropic modes with time steps of 60 and 1 min respectively where the barotropic mode subcycles with explicit predictor corrector steps sub grid scale turbulence parameterizations include k profile parameterization van roekel et al 2018 for vertical viscosity and diffusion gent mcwilliams to compute the eddy bolus velocity and redi for isopycnal diffusion see details in petersen et al 2019 quadratic bottom drag is applied with a coefficient of 0 001 wind stress at the surface is from normal year forcing data from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment large and yeager 2004 the initial conditions for temperature and salinity are shown in fig 13 and are interpolated from the data gathered by the polar science center hydrographic climatology steele et al 2001 we already established with the shallow water tests the higher accuracy of the peixoto scheme and that the loss of total energy conservation related to this scheme is within reasonable bounds what we want to asses with this test case is the stability of the peixoto scheme compared to that of trisk in a realistic 3d model from tc2 and the barotropic jet test cases it seems that the peixoto scheme has an intrinsic instability which was also observed in yu et al 2020 but no tests were done so far on a fully 3d model fig 14 shows the average and maximum values over a 30 day period of the operators for layer thickness h e kinetic energy k i relative vorticity ζ v and vertical velocity w i for each point in time the associated value is a mean over all vertical levels no significant difference is visible in the average values between the two schemes whereas a larger difference is present in the maximum values especially for h e k i and w i these differences in the maximum values impact the behavior of prognostic variables like temperature and salinity as shown in fig 15 which displays the maximum values of the salinity over time the salinity profile for the rrs30to10 mesh discussed in the next section is displayed as well the salinity is the variable that shows the larger difference between the two schemes whereas the temperature profiles look very similar not shown fig 15 shows that with the peixoto scheme the maximum value achieved by the salinity at day 30 is roughly doubled the value obtained with trisk looking at where such a value is attained in the north sea we see that the divergence operator in that location shows signs of instability for the peixoto scheme as fig 16 shows a sharp change in the divergence values between one voronoi cell and another is indeed visible for the peixoto scheme but not for trisk similar instabilities can be found in other locations for example near the philippines coast fig 17 once again the peixoto scheme shows a larger noise than trisk although some level of noise is also present in trisk finally in fig 18 we show that the equator is a problematic zone for the two schemes since they both show a high level of noise 3 5 3d model rrs30to10 spin up test case the 3d spin up test case was also run on a finer variable resolution mesh named rrs30to10 the resolution for this mesh ranges from 30 km near the equator to 10 km at the poles scaled with the rossby radius and includes continents and realistic bathymetry the number of vertical layers used is 80 the test case is therefore identical to the one described in section 3 4 just applied to a different grid fig 15 shows the values of the salinity over a 30 day period using the ec60to30 mesh left and the rrs30to10 grid right from a first look the differences between trisk and the peixoto scheme are more evident for the ec60to30 mesh and even the diagnostic operators like layer thickness kinetic energy relative vorticity and vertical velocity do not present large differences not shown however if we look more closely at the divergence operator the intrinsic instabilities of the peixoto scheme can be clearly seen for instance figs 19 and 20 display the divergence values near the west african coast and the philippines coast where sharp changes between one voronoi cell and another are visible for the peixoto scheme 4 conclusions in this paper we compare two horizontal discretizations for mpas ocean the trisk scheme which is the standard option for this model and the peixoto scheme proposed in peixoto 2016 the latter has similarities with trisk but uses a modified placement of variables on the computational grid and a different reconstruction of the discrete operators for the i divergence ii vorticity iii kinetic energy and iv coriolis terms in peixoto 2016 it is shown that the peixoto scheme is more accurate than trisk but it does not conserve some mimetic properties we test the two methods on a shallow water model and a fully 3d model and compare them in terms of accuracy total energy conservation and stability this is the first time that the peixoto scheme is tested on a primitive equation ocean model from our tests we find indeed that the peixoto scheme is more accurate than trisk in both the l and l 2 norms and we quantify its loss of total energy conservation determining that it is within reasonable bounds at least over relatively short multi day runs for an ocean model long timescale stability is a highly desirable feature since the time horizons for practical simulations span months to centuries from both the shallow water test cases and the 3d model runs we find that the peixoto scheme might be more unstable than trisk similar to yu et al 2020 we find that on tc2 the trisk scheme runs for hundreds of days whereas the peixoto scheme develops instabilities in the fluid height after 35 days and crashes after approximately 70 days in general all schemes tend to develop rossby style wave modes over time and for tc2 it is evident that trisk is able to keep the amplitude of these waves bounded in time but the peixoto scheme cannot in the barotropic jest test case we also see that trisk is more stable than the peixoto scheme with respect to grid geometry noise arises indeed in this latter scheme when irregularity is introduced to the computational grid and similar noise can be seen in operational 3d mpas ocean spin up configurations fig 16 shows sharp changes in the divergence values between one voronoi cell and another for the peixoto scheme on an eddy closure mesh similar instabilities can be seen also using a rossby radius deformation scaling mesh despite the performance of trisk and the peixoto scheme being similar overall we argue these results show that the lack of energy conservation and potential vorticity compatibility in the peixoto scheme leads to numerical difficulties allowing an injection of spurious energy to enter the system that slowly builds up over time eventually leading to instabilities and crashes on the other hand trisk despite being low order accurate keeps the discrete energy of the system in balance resulting in a good long timescale stability which is critical for climate style runs finally we believe that the result in fig 18 is also interesting where noise is present on the equator for both trisk and the peixoto scheme indicating that better improvement is needed for the c grid future work will indeed proceed in this direction and will consist of developing a higher order trisk method that maintains the current mimetic properties of trisk and aims to resolve the numerical noise that might still happen in layered ocean simulations credit authorship contribution statement sara calandrini software investigation visualization writing

23875,this manuscript investigates the effectiveness of two possible horizontal discretizations for the global ocean model mpas ocean both applied to spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts the first discretization is trisk a c grid finite volume method that possesses many desirable mimetic properties but has a low order accuracy the second discretization was introduced for the first time by peixoto 2016 and consists of modifications to the trisk scheme designed to achieve at least first order accuracy in the l norm with the loss of some of the mimetic properties tests on shallow water and primitive equation models show that the scheme due to peixoto is indeed more accurate but presents stability issues with respect to trisk trisk is indeed found to be often more stable in time and more robust with respect to errors in the geometric properties of the grid keywords staggered c grid spherical voronoi grid mimetic discretization 1 introduction in recent years c grid discretizations have been largely adopted by atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models thanks to the relatively accurate representation of wave modes and transport processes which allows simulations on time scales of decades to centuries among c grid discretizations the trisk scheme is a finite difference volume method that is applicable to variable resolution unstructured meshes it was introduced for the first time in thuburn et al 2009 where it is shown how to discretize the coriolis terms on arbitrarily structured c grids to ensure that geostrophic modes are stationary while the coriolis terms remain energy neutral later it was applied to the nonlinear shallow water equations ringler et al 2010 since 2010 trisk has been used in the model for prediction across scales mpas for the atmosphere skamarock et al 2012 the ocean ringler et al 2013 petersen et al 2015 2019 golaz et al 2019 and in other studies weller et al 2012 weller 2012 kevlahan and dubos 2019 weller 2014 trisk possesses many desirable mimetic properties including mass conservation energy neutral coriolis and pressure terms conservation of total energy steady geostrophic modes on the f plane compatible discretization of potential vorticity with its lagrangian behavior but presents a low order accuracy in ringler et al 2010 it is shown that trisk is second order accurate in the l 2 error norm in most shallow water test cases but it also fails to converge in the l norm in some of these test cases a modification of the trisk scheme that assures first order accuracy in the maximum and l norm is presented in peixoto 2016 this scheme hereafter named the peixoto scheme proposes two main changes the first one being a different location of the normal velocities on the grid trisk is usually applied to spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts ju et al 2011 senechal 1993 where the mass tracers pressure and kinetic energy are defined at centers of the primal hexagonal pentagonal cells and the normal component of velocity is located at the edge midpoints of the dual triangle cells the midpoint of the triangle edges represents the point on the voronoi cell edge that intersects the triangle edge and in the case of general variable resolution meshes the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges and the triangle cell edges do not coincide in the peixoto scheme the placement of the velocity variables will be slightly different from trisk i e the velocities are positioned on the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges instead of the midpoint of the triangle edges this difference in positioning is shown to have significant impact on the accuracy of the discrete schemes peixoto 2016 the second main modification involves a different reconstruction of the discrete operators for the i divergence ii vorticity iii kinetic energy and iv coriolis terms the divergence and kinetic energy operators in trisk fail to approximate the continuous ones with increasing resolution in the l norm causing the method to be inconsistent in the peixoto scheme modifications to the trisk formulation of these two operators and vorticity and coriolis terms are proposed to achieve consistency on each discrete operator a drawback of the peixoto scheme is the loss of some of the mimetic properties of trisk i e 1 total energy will no longer be conserved 2 the geostrophic modes will no longer be steady on the f plane 3 the potential vorticity discretization will no longer be compatible with its lagrangian behavior the different discretization of the kinetic energy and the loss of a mimetic duality between the divergence and gradient operator is what causes the loss of total energy conservation whereas a different discretization of the coriolis term is the cause of points 2 and 3 in this work we compare the performance of the trisk and peixoto schemes in mpas ocean ringler et al 2013 petersen et al 2015 to determine if the latter would be a possible alternative to trisk which is the standard horizontal discretization of the ocean model the comparison is made in terms of accuracy stability and trade off in losing some properties of trisk an experimental convergence analysis is performed to compare the accuracy of the two schemes and metrics are given to quantify the trade off in losing total energy conservation in order to achieve first order accuracy in the l norm both schemes are tested on shallow water and primitive equation models this is the first time that the peixoto scheme is tested on a fully 3d model recent studies on this scheme peixoto et al 2018 yu et al 2020 always use shallow water models which provide a good but only partial insight on the actual behavior in a 3d model the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the two schemes within a shallow water system focusing on the differences of the grids and discrete operators in section 3 we test the two methods on a shallow water model and a fully 3d model comparing them in terms of accuracy total energy conservation and stability finally in section 4 we draw our conclusions 2 discretizations in this section the trisk and peixoto schemes are described highlighting their differences in the grids and in the formulation of the discrete operators a theoretical analysis of discrete operators for the two schemes has already been performed in peixoto 2016 and ringler et al 2010 therefore we will not repeat it in this work in general since both schemes employ a combination of piecewise linear and piecewise constant interpolations between 1st and 2nd order accuracy may be expected overall without loss of generality we focus on a shallow water system but the description can be easily generalized to a primitive equation system we consider the vector invariant form of the nonlinear shallow water equations on the sphere adapted from ringler et al 2010 and stated as 1 h t h u 0 2 u t q h u g h b k where h is fluid thickness u is the fluid vector velocity g is gravity b is the bottom topography k u 2 2 is the kinetic energy and q is the potential vorticity the term u is defined as u k u where k is the unit vector that points in the local vertical direction in eq 1 h u represents the divergence of the thickness flux whereas in eq 2 the term g h b k is the pressure gradient term and q h u is the nonlinear coriolis force we recall that q η h where η is the absolute vorticity defined as η k u f with f being the coriolis parameter the discretized version of system 1 2 is 3 h i t d i 4 u e t q e g e where d i g e and q e are discretizations of the divergence term gradient term and coriolis term respectively which depend on the grid used for the discretization scheme these operators are described in detail in the next sections for both the trisk and peixoto scheme the subscripts i and e indicate the positions of the variables and terms at either the cell centers i or the edge points e the exact location of the edge points depends once again on the grid used for the discretization scheme 2 1 grid specifications the grids used in this study consist of quasi uniform spherical centroidal voronoi tessellations scvts built using an icosahedral geodesic grid the coarsest grid is shown in fig 1 a and is composed of 12 pentagonal voronoi cells primal grid and an underlying dual triangular grid dual grid refinements of this mesh are obtained by incremental bisection of the spherical triangles edges and application of an scvt optimization procedure which iteratively re positions triangle vertices to lie at the center of mass of their associated voronoi cells ju et al 2011 meshes were generated in this study using the jigsaw library engwirda 2017 see fig 1 b for an example of a four level refined grid from now on p i will indicate a primal mesh cell and d v a dual mesh cell let the center of any primal mesh cell p i be denoted by x i and the center of any the dual mesh cell d v be denoted by x v the points x i are the generators of a spherical voronoi tessellation and due to the use of scvt optimization are also approximations of the centroids mass centers of the voronoi cells recall that the points x i coincide with the vertices of the dual mesh triangles we will use a c grid staggering where the fluid height h is stored at x i and the normal component of the velocities u e is stored at the edge point x e due to the use of voronoi type grids the edges of the polygonal mesh cells are exactly orthogonal to the dual delaunay triangle edges an interesting consequence of working in a spherical space is that meshes do not necessarily become more uniform with refinement on the sphere the icosahedral topology used in our study is the most regular uniform available but there is a constant geometrical offset between voronoi delaunay edges in the scvt meshes that is seen to persist in spite of additional grid refinement peixoto 2016 this situation is in contrast to analyses on the cartesian plane manteuffel and white 1986 and shows that additional care is needed to create convergent discretizations on the sphere the exact location of x e differs between trisk and the peixoto scheme in trisk x e corresponds to the midpoint of the triangle edges which represents a point on the voronoi cell edge that intersects the triangle edges we will call this positioning hct whereas in the peixoto scheme x e corresponds to the midpoint of the edges of the voronoi cells we will call this positioning hcm on a mesh with exact hexagons the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges and the triangle cell edges coincide but in general they do not and fig 2 shows an example of such a situation to distinguish the location of x e given by the two grids we will refer to x e h c t to indicate the location of x e for the hct positioning and x e h c m to indicate the location of x e for the hcm positioning note that since x e h c t lies on the intersection between the voronoi cell edge and the triangle edge hct grids are orthogonal i e x e x i d e n e 2 on the other hand on hcm grids the orthogonality property will hold only approximately x e x i d e n e 2 ε e t e where ε e is a constant that depends on the distance between x e h c t and x e h c t m fig 2 also displays the vectors n e and t e and the lengths d e and l e where n e is a unit vector defined to be parallel to the line connecting primal mesh cells t e is a second unit vector defined such that t e k n e d e measures the distance between the primal mesh cells sharing edge e and l e measures the length of the voronoi edge e 2 2 divergence both trisk and the peixoto scheme adopt the same discretization for the divergence term 5 d i 1 a i e e c i n e i h e u e l e where u e is the normal component of the velocity h e is the interpolation of the fluid height to the edges a i is the area of the cell p i and n e i is an indicator function such that n e i 1 when n e is an outward normal of p i and n e i 1 when n e is an inward normal of p i as in ringler et al 2010 the notation e e c i indicates the set of edges that define the boundary of p i table 1 shows the definitions of the element groups used to build the discrete system please refer to fig 2 in ringler et al 2010 for examples of these element groups what changes between trisk and the peixoto scheme is how the fluid height is interpolated i e the computation of h e trisk uses an hct grid which is orthogonal and so the simple average 6 h e h i h j 2 will give a second order approximation with i and j indices of the voronoi cells that share the edge e on a hcm grid 6 will result in a first order approximation only to obtain a second order interpolation the peixoto scheme uses a linear interpolation with baricentric coordinates peixoto 2016 peixoto and barros 2014 let e be a voronoi cell edge and t k be a triangle that contains the interpolation point x e h c m assume that x 1 x 2 and x 3 are the three vertices of t k where the fluid height h 1 h 2 and h 3 are defined then h e is computed as 7 h e i c v v a i x e h c m a k h i where a i x e h c m is the area of the triangle formed by the two vertices opposite to i and the interpolation point x e h c m a k is the area of the triangle t k and the notation i c v v is given in table 1 fig 3 shows an example of the three areas a 1 a 2 and a 3 note that on a grid with exact hexagons where the midpoints of the voronoi cell edge and the triangle edge match exactly eqs 6 and 7 would be equivalent in conclusion both interpolations 6 and 7 are second order accurate on a hct and hcm grid respectively interestingly in peixoto and barros 2014 it is shown that three necessary conditions must hold for the divergence term 5 to achieve first order accuracy with one of these being that the edge point is the midpoint of the voronoi cell i e hcm positioning therefore on hct grids this discretization is in general inconsistent in the maximum and l norm since it does not converge on hcm grids the other two necessary conditions for 5 to be first order accurate in the maximum and l norm are i the values of h e are at least second order accurate and ii the dual grid does not have obtuse triangles for meshes where condition ii is satisfied interpolation 7 on hcm grids fulfills the requirements for the discrete operator to be first order accurate in the maximum norm 2 3 gradient term the gradient term g e is discretized in the same way in trisk and the peixoto scheme i e 8 g e g d e h i b i h j b j 1 d e k i k j where i indicates the index of the voronoi cell which the reference normal edge vector points to and j indicates the opposite cell since g e depends on k i and k j its accuracy relies on the accuracy of the kinetic energy reconstructed to the cells i j in trisk the kinetic energy is discretized as 9 k i 1 4 a i e e c i l e d e u e 2 where d e and l e represent the distance between the centers of the primal mesh cells sharing edge e and the length of such a voronoi edge respectively this discretization leads to total energy conservation ringler et al 2010 but it is not consistent on a scvt as shown in fig 5 in peixoto 2016 where no convergence is obtained in the l norm for this reason the gradient term does not converge in the l norm as well on hct grids g e could potentially be second order accurate provided that the kinetic energy discretization is second order accurate but this is not the case for trisk the potential second order accuracy comes from the fact that g e s discretization is a central differencing on orthogonal grids the peixoto scheme proposes a difference discretization than 9 for the kinetic energy i e 10 k i 1 2 u i u i where the velocities at the cell centers are reconstructed as 11 u i 1 a i e e c i x e h c m x i u e l e in perot 2000 it is shown that this discretization is first order in the maximum norm if the normal velocities are given at the midpoints of the voronoi edges that is on hcm grids on such grids since the orthogonality property holds only approximately the gradient term 8 can be at most first order accurate using the discretization provided in 10 and 11 g e is indeed first order accurate in the peixoto scheme on scvts peixoto 2016 on the other hand using 10 and 11 total energy conservation is lost note that if the midpoints of the voronoi and triangular cell edges coincide then eqs 10 11 would reduce to 9 since we would have u i x e x i u e d e 2 2 4 vorticity the discretization of the potential vorticity q η h is required for the perpendicular term q e of the momentum equation and it depends on the discretization of the absolute vorticity η k u f and the fluid height h i e 12 q v η v h v let us focus on the term h v first in both trisk and the peixoto scheme the interpolation of the fluid height at the voronoi cell vertices uses the values of the fluid height at the cell centers but the interpolation weights are different in ringler et al 2010 h v is defined as 13 h v 1 a k i c v v a i v h i where the weights a i v are the areas of the intersection of the primal voronoi and dual triangular cells and a k is the area of the triangle t k whose vertices belong to the set c v v in the peixoto scheme the weights are determined using barycentric coordinates i e 14 h v 1 a k i c v v b i v h i where b i v is the area of the triangle formed by the two vertices of t k opposite to i and the circumcenter of t k this interpolation is similar to the one adopted for h e in the divergence operator with the only difference that now the interpolation point is the triangle circumcenter instead of the location of the velocity x e h c m fig 4 shows the difference between the areas a i v and b i v the difference choice of weights for h v affects the accuracy of the two approximations eq 13 leads to a first order approximation on a hct grid ringler et al 2010 whereas 14 results in a second order approximation on a hcm grid peixoto 2016 now let us focus on the numerator of 12 η v this term can be written as 15 η v ζ v f v where f v is the coriolis parameter calculated at the voronoi cell vertices and ζ v is the discretization of the relative vorticity ζ given by 16 ζ v 1 a v e e v v u e t e v d e where a v is the area of the triangle with circumcenter v and the indicator function t e v is defined such that t e v 1 if the vector k n e is directed toward x v otherwise in 1 eq 16 is the discretization adopted for the relative vorticity in both trisk and the peixoto scheme the analysis in peixoto and barros 2014 shows that this discretization is first order accurate on grids where the tangent components of the velocities are at least second order accurately calculated at the midpoints of the edges of the triangle therefore on hct grids we have a first order approximation for the relative vorticity on hcm grids 16 will in general lead to an inconsistent discretization since the normal velocities at the midpoints of the voronoi cells do not directly represent the tangents at the midpoints of the triangle edges for more details about this inconsistency please refer to appendix a in peixoto 2016 in conclusion in the trisk scheme both h v and η v are first order accurate leading to a first order accurate potential vorticity discretization in the peixoto scheme h v is second order accurate but η v does not converge in the l norm leading to an inconsistent discretization for the potential vorticity comparing the divergence and curl operators it is important to highlight that either one of them will be inconsistent on the hcm or hct grids on hct grids the problem will occur on the divergence whereas for the hcm grids it will be in the vorticity 2 5 coriolis term the discretization of the potential vorticity introduced in the section above is needed for the coriolis term for both trisk and the peixoto scheme the coriolis term is discretized as 17 q e e e c p e w e e h e u e q e q e 2 where w e e indicates the weights and 18 q e 1 2 v i n v e e q v represents the interpolation of the potential vorticity values on the voronoi cell edges the arithmetic mean 18 results in a first order interpolation on hct grids since the interpolation point does not coincide with the midpoint of the edge on the other hand on hcm grids this interpolation is second order accurate peixoto 2016 the term e e c p e w e e h e u e represents the flux interpolation operator i e 19 h e u e e e c p e w e e h e u e the weights w e e differ between trisk and the peixoto scheme in trisk 20 w e e c e e l e d e 1 2 v a i v a i n e i where the sum is within the vertices v between edge e and e n e i is an indicator function introduced in section 2 2 and c e e is a general sign correction relative to the orientation of the tangent vector at e with respect to the dual triangular cell for more details about c e e refer to thuburn et al 2009 the areas a i v are the overlapping quadrilateral areas between the voronoi cell and the dual triangular cell already introduced in section 2 4 in general the coriolis term with the weights provided in 20 is consistent for regular hexagons but it appears to be inconsistent on icosahedral meshes as shown in weller 2014 nevertheless the weights given in 20 ensure compatible potential vorticity evolution as shown in thuburn et al 2009 finally the coriolis term is in general energy neutral on a hct grid because of the skew symmetry of the weights w e e e g w e e w e e and the averaging in 17 of the potential vorticity values on the voronoi cell edges i e q e q e 2 in the peixoto scheme the weights are defined as follows 21 w e e 1 2 l e a i x e h c m x i t e since on a hcm grid the orthogonality property holds only approximately energy conservation is not ensured in this case the closer the distance between the midpoints of the voronoi and triangle edges is the more the energy conserving condition is met within an acceptable error bound another important thing to notice is that since the discretization of the potential vorticity is inconsistent on hcm grids so is the discretization 17 of the coriolis term in peixoto 2016 the peixoto scheme is tested also on special types of hcm grids in which the midpoints of the triangle edges converge to the midpoints of the voronoi cell edges with grid refinement this type of grid was introduced by heikes and randall 1995a b the discretization of relative vorticity 16 which is inconsistent on a general hcm grid is on the other hand first order accurate on a heikes and randall grid leading to a first order accurate discretization of the potential vorticity therefore the discretization of the coriolis term with weights 21 becomes consistent on a heikes and randall grid as shown in peixoto 2016 in this work we are not using such grids thus eq 17 with weights 21 will be inconsistent on the hcm grids adopted 3 numerical results in this section we compare the numerical performance of the two schemes described above in terms of accuracy stability and trade off in losing mimetic properties like total energy conservation first we show results solving a shallow water model using test case 2 tc2 and 5 tc5 from williamson et al 1992 and the barotropically unstable jet test case from galewsky et al 2004 second we move to a fully 3d model and we solve a spin up test case with a global real world configuration the 3d test is run on two variable resolution meshes an eddy closure ec mesh that parameterizes mesoscale eddies and a rossby radius deformation scaling rrs mesh that resolves mesoscale eddies over most of the globe for the three shallow water test cases a four stages fourth order runge kutta method is used as time stepping scheme whereas for the 3d spin up test cases a split explicit scheme that takes advantage of a baroclinic barotropic time splitting is adopted this scheme is the standard option in mpas ocean and it consists of a splitting where the barotropic velocity and total ocean depth are explicitly subcycled within each large time step taken for the three dimensional baroclinic velocity please refer to ringler et al 2013 for more details on this split explicit method for the tc2 simulations the time step used is 180s for the tc5 simulations is 60s and for the barotropic jet simulations is 30s finally for the 3d spin up test a baroclinic time step of 60 min is used for the ec mesh and 2 min for the rrs grid for all the tests the meshes consist of scvts for the shallow water tests four spatial resolutions are used 2562 10 242 40 962 and 163 842 voronoi cells corresponding to a refinement level of 4 5 6 and 7 respectively of an scvt optimized icosahedron grid the time step sizes discussed above for the different test cases were used for all the four refinement levels in all configurations tight convergence of the scvt iteration is obtained updating the grid geometry via a sequence of lloyd like iterations du et al 1999 until a relative tolerance of 1 1 0 8 was reached for the tests that do not have an analytic solution a reference solution is obtained on a grid level 9 that has 2 621 442 voronoi cell for the 3d spin up test case the two variable resolution meshes are named hereafter ec60to30 and rrs30to10 in the ec60to30 grid a resolution going from 30 km at the equator and poles to 60 km at mid latitudes is used this mesh contains 235 160 voronoi cells 60 vertical layers and has been used extensively for moderate resolution realistic climate studies petersen et al 2019 golaz et al 2019 the resolution for the rrs30to10 mesh ranges from 30 km near the equator to 10 km at the poles for a total of 1 445 361 voronoi cells and the mesh includes 80 vertical layers to analyze accuracy we consider the l 2 and l norms defined as in ringler et al 2010 22 l 2 s f n j f r j 2 1 2 s f r j 2 1 2 23 l max j f n j f r j max j f r j where 24 s f j j f j a j j a j the function f n j is the numerical solution defined at the point j on the numerical mesh and f r j is the reference solution at the same j position the reference solution is either an analytic solution or a high resolution solution in the l 2 norm the function s f computes the global average of f where a j is the area associated with cell p j to analyze total energy we plot its variation calculated as the absolute difference between actual energy and initial energy divided by the initial energy similarly we compute the enstrophy variation for the two schemes as well 3 1 test case 2 steady state zonal geostrophic flow the test case 2 tc2 of williamson et al 1992 defines a zonal flow velocity field with the height in balance with the wind the problem is steady state so the initial condition should remain over all time integration the initial height and velocity field have the form 25 g h g h 0 a ω u 0 u 0 2 2 cos θ 26 u u 0 cos θ the physical parameters of the system are ω 7 292 1 0 5 s 1 g 9 80616 m s 2 and a 6 37122 1 0 6 m latitude is denoted by θ g h 0 2 94 1 0 4 m 2 s 2 and u 0 2 π a 12 days the initial condition coincides with the analytical solution for this test case fig 5 shows the convergence rate of tc2 at day 12 for the refinement levels 4 5 6 and 7 the rate is measured by the l 2 and l norms based on the thickness field norms are computed with respect to analytic solution as expected the trisk scheme does not converge in the l norm but is between 1st and 2nd order accuracy in the l 2 norm on the other hand the peixoto scheme shows second order convergence in both the l and l 2 norm this gain in accuracy comes with a loss of total energy conservation and such a loss is quantified in fig 6 where the energy variation is displayed over 15 days together with the variation in enstrophy for all four resolutions the peixoto scheme exhibits errors in total energy conservation greater than those of the trisk scheme but within reasonable bounds the enstrophy variation is similar in both schemes another important feature to look at is stability even thought the peixoto scheme shows a higher accuracy than trisk and a total energy variation within reasonable bounds it is stable only up to 35 days in general all schemes tend to develop rossby style wave modes over time and for this test case trisk appears to keep the amplitude of these waves bounded maintaining a stable instantaneous error in the height field over time see fig 7 on the other hand the peixoto scheme develops a large instantaneous error in the height field over time that causes the simulation to crash after 70 days similar results were found in yu et al 2020 3 2 test case 5 flow over mountain tc5 consists in a solid body rotation flow over an isolated mountain at mid latitude the mountain is of the form 27 b b 0 1 r r 0 with b 0 2000 m r 0 π 9 and r 2 min r 2 λ λ c 2 θ θ c 2 where λ is longitude the values of λ c and θ c are π 2 and π 6 respectively the wind and height field are as in tc2 with h 0 5960 m and u 0 20 ms 1 since this test case does not have an analytic solution convergence rates are obtained using a high resolution reference solution on a level 9 grid the rates are provided in fig 8 in this test case the l 2 and l norms are similar for the two methods with both schemes showing near second order convergence in terms of energy and enstrophy variation fig 9 shows larger errors in total energy conservation for the peixoto scheme the differences in energy variation between trisk and the peixoto scheme are larger in this test case than in tc2 another difference between tc2 and tc5 is the enstrophy variation with the peixoto scheme showing errors about on order of magnitude greater than those of the trisk scheme for this test case we did not asses the stability of the methods nevertheless more results on the stability are shown for the two remaining test cases 3 3 barotropically unstable jet test case the barotropic jet test case from galewsky et al 2004 consists of a basic zonal flow with a corresponding balanced height field to which a small perturbation is added the perturbation is used to induce the development of barotropic instability as for the two previous tests we quantify the variation in energy and enstrophy over time fig 10 shows that the order of magnitude of the errors in total energy conservation are the same as those obtained with tc5 so the loss of total energy conservation is within reasonable bounds for the peixoto scheme for this test case the variations in enstrophy are larger than for tc2 and tc5 but the difference between the errors of trisk and the peixoto scheme is still of approximately one order of magnitude the development of the barotropic instability is fully visible at day 6 when the initially unstable vorticity field rolls up into a number of vortices that progressively move eastward fig 11 shows such vortices obtained with a level 7 grid using the solution shown in galewsky et al 2004 fig 4 as reference solution we see that the jet has 4 well defined vortices at day 6 due to its higher accuracy the peixoto method is able to capture these 4 vortices whereas the solution obtained with trisk shows a spurious wave number 6 pattern in the tail of the jet rather than the desired quiescent flow these behaviors align with results shown in peixoto 2016 to study the accuracy and stability of the two schemes on unstructured meshes we investigate how the resolved vortex pattern responds to perturbations in the underlying structure of the numerical grid degrading the quality of the tessellation by a process we denote as jumbling taking an optimized scvt icosahedral grid as input the mesh jumbling procedure consists of adding a small quasi random perturbation to the position of mesh vertices and rebuilding the mesh topology to ensure the perturbed grid consists of proper voronoi cells the magnitude of the vertex perturbations are scaled by the diameter of each voronoi cell ensuring predictable results across varying mesh resolutions the resulting jumbled grids are of lower mesh quality than the optimized icosahedral inputs consisting of distorted cells and triangles defined by irregular edge lengths areas and angles the result obtained with trisk on a lower quality level 7 grid is not very different from the one shown in fig 11 and similarly vorticity patterns obtained with lower quality level 6 and 8 grids do not differ significantly from the corresponding pattern obtained on the standard level 6 and 8 grids not shown on the other hand the peixoto scheme is greatly affected by a jumbled mesh as fig 12 shows the solution becomes noisy on a lower quality mesh indicating that this scheme is more affected by the grid used than trisk the noise is even more evident on a jumbled level 6 grid this noise is an indication of the potential instability of the peixoto scheme over long time horizons instability that was already noticed in the simpler tc2 3 4 3d model ec60to30 spin up test case in this test case we solve a primitive equation system i e the incompressible boussinesq equations in hydrostatic balance their continuous and discretized form can be found in ringler et al 2013 in appendix a this test case consists of a global real world configuration on the mesh ec60to30 that has a resolution that varies from a 30 km resolution at the equator and poles to a 60 km resolution at the mid latitudes and it includes continents and realistic bathymetry the z star coordinate system within an arbitrary lagrangian eulerian framework is used in the vertical with 60 layers petersen et al 2015 the time stepping splits the baroclinic and barotropic modes with time steps of 60 and 1 min respectively where the barotropic mode subcycles with explicit predictor corrector steps sub grid scale turbulence parameterizations include k profile parameterization van roekel et al 2018 for vertical viscosity and diffusion gent mcwilliams to compute the eddy bolus velocity and redi for isopycnal diffusion see details in petersen et al 2019 quadratic bottom drag is applied with a coefficient of 0 001 wind stress at the surface is from normal year forcing data from the coordinated ocean ice reference experiment large and yeager 2004 the initial conditions for temperature and salinity are shown in fig 13 and are interpolated from the data gathered by the polar science center hydrographic climatology steele et al 2001 we already established with the shallow water tests the higher accuracy of the peixoto scheme and that the loss of total energy conservation related to this scheme is within reasonable bounds what we want to asses with this test case is the stability of the peixoto scheme compared to that of trisk in a realistic 3d model from tc2 and the barotropic jet test cases it seems that the peixoto scheme has an intrinsic instability which was also observed in yu et al 2020 but no tests were done so far on a fully 3d model fig 14 shows the average and maximum values over a 30 day period of the operators for layer thickness h e kinetic energy k i relative vorticity ζ v and vertical velocity w i for each point in time the associated value is a mean over all vertical levels no significant difference is visible in the average values between the two schemes whereas a larger difference is present in the maximum values especially for h e k i and w i these differences in the maximum values impact the behavior of prognostic variables like temperature and salinity as shown in fig 15 which displays the maximum values of the salinity over time the salinity profile for the rrs30to10 mesh discussed in the next section is displayed as well the salinity is the variable that shows the larger difference between the two schemes whereas the temperature profiles look very similar not shown fig 15 shows that with the peixoto scheme the maximum value achieved by the salinity at day 30 is roughly doubled the value obtained with trisk looking at where such a value is attained in the north sea we see that the divergence operator in that location shows signs of instability for the peixoto scheme as fig 16 shows a sharp change in the divergence values between one voronoi cell and another is indeed visible for the peixoto scheme but not for trisk similar instabilities can be found in other locations for example near the philippines coast fig 17 once again the peixoto scheme shows a larger noise than trisk although some level of noise is also present in trisk finally in fig 18 we show that the equator is a problematic zone for the two schemes since they both show a high level of noise 3 5 3d model rrs30to10 spin up test case the 3d spin up test case was also run on a finer variable resolution mesh named rrs30to10 the resolution for this mesh ranges from 30 km near the equator to 10 km at the poles scaled with the rossby radius and includes continents and realistic bathymetry the number of vertical layers used is 80 the test case is therefore identical to the one described in section 3 4 just applied to a different grid fig 15 shows the values of the salinity over a 30 day period using the ec60to30 mesh left and the rrs30to10 grid right from a first look the differences between trisk and the peixoto scheme are more evident for the ec60to30 mesh and even the diagnostic operators like layer thickness kinetic energy relative vorticity and vertical velocity do not present large differences not shown however if we look more closely at the divergence operator the intrinsic instabilities of the peixoto scheme can be clearly seen for instance figs 19 and 20 display the divergence values near the west african coast and the philippines coast where sharp changes between one voronoi cell and another are visible for the peixoto scheme 4 conclusions in this paper we compare two horizontal discretizations for mpas ocean the trisk scheme which is the standard option for this model and the peixoto scheme proposed in peixoto 2016 the latter has similarities with trisk but uses a modified placement of variables on the computational grid and a different reconstruction of the discrete operators for the i divergence ii vorticity iii kinetic energy and iv coriolis terms in peixoto 2016 it is shown that the peixoto scheme is more accurate than trisk but it does not conserve some mimetic properties we test the two methods on a shallow water model and a fully 3d model and compare them in terms of accuracy total energy conservation and stability this is the first time that the peixoto scheme is tested on a primitive equation ocean model from our tests we find indeed that the peixoto scheme is more accurate than trisk in both the l and l 2 norms and we quantify its loss of total energy conservation determining that it is within reasonable bounds at least over relatively short multi day runs for an ocean model long timescale stability is a highly desirable feature since the time horizons for practical simulations span months to centuries from both the shallow water test cases and the 3d model runs we find that the peixoto scheme might be more unstable than trisk similar to yu et al 2020 we find that on tc2 the trisk scheme runs for hundreds of days whereas the peixoto scheme develops instabilities in the fluid height after 35 days and crashes after approximately 70 days in general all schemes tend to develop rossby style wave modes over time and for tc2 it is evident that trisk is able to keep the amplitude of these waves bounded in time but the peixoto scheme cannot in the barotropic jest test case we also see that trisk is more stable than the peixoto scheme with respect to grid geometry noise arises indeed in this latter scheme when irregularity is introduced to the computational grid and similar noise can be seen in operational 3d mpas ocean spin up configurations fig 16 shows sharp changes in the divergence values between one voronoi cell and another for the peixoto scheme on an eddy closure mesh similar instabilities can be seen also using a rossby radius deformation scaling mesh despite the performance of trisk and the peixoto scheme being similar overall we argue these results show that the lack of energy conservation and potential vorticity compatibility in the peixoto scheme leads to numerical difficulties allowing an injection of spurious energy to enter the system that slowly builds up over time eventually leading to instabilities and crashes on the other hand trisk despite being low order accurate keeps the discrete energy of the system in balance resulting in a good long timescale stability which is critical for climate style runs finally we believe that the result in fig 18 is also interesting where noise is present on the equator for both trisk and the peixoto scheme indicating that better improvement is needed for the c grid future work will indeed proceed in this direction and will consist of developing a higher order trisk method that maintains the current mimetic properties of trisk and aims to resolve the numerical noise that might still happen in layered ocean simulations credit authorship contribution statement sara calandrini software investigation visualization writing

23876,the multiscale synoptic circulation in the southern bay of bengal region is simulated using a high resolution feature oriented regional modeling and simulation forms approach first the region s prevalent ocean circulation features are identified and mapped onto a forms template using a literature survey and analysis of in situ and remote sensing data these features include the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome anti cyclonic eddy and subsurface baroclinic eddy to the east of the smc new data driven feature models are developed for the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy using observational transects collected during the bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble of july 2016 specifically a new elliptical feature model for the smc s high salinity core is developed and utilized the developed temperature and salinity feature models are placed on the forms template and pseudo observation profiles are sampled for use in an objective analysis initialization scheme the background for the objective analysis is taken to be the nemo global analysis model data on the day of the synoptic initialization the forms derived initialization fields on 04 july 2016 are used with the mit mseas primitive equation modeling system to simulate the ocean circulation in the region from 04 july to 15 july 2016 the forecast skill of the model is quantified by comparison to the time series observations collected during bobble but not used in the forms development and argo data available in the region during the simulation four experimental short term synoptic simulations at a 3 km horizontal resolution and 70 vertical levels with and without the different components of the feature models are showcased results are utilized to calibrate and improve the feature model including the addition of a subsurface baroclinic eddy and the development of a new surface bias correction scheme to obtain a better match with validation datasets the present data driven feature modeling approach improves the representation and forecast skill for several critical dynamical features i the initial high salinity core at the time series location ii evolution and expansion of the sub surface high salinity core and iii salinization and freshening events at the time series location between 3 m to 20 m the mseas model simulation from the final experiment match the bobble temperature and salinity data total rmse of 0 14 psu in salinity and 0 57 c in temperature in between 60 120 m depths and total rmse of 0 17 psu in salinity and 0 33 c in temperature in between 3 60 m depths and the argo measured temperature and salinity total rmse of 0 16 psu in salinity and 0 66 c in temperature showcasing the model s success in providing excellent spatio temporal representation of the ocean in the region of interest keywords bay of bengal boundary layer experiment primitive equations data assimilation feature models synoptic forecasting 1 introduction keeping in view the tremendous importance of the bay of bengal in regulating the climate of the region air sea interactions and monsoons several ocean observation campaigns have been undertaken to collect in situ data from the region wijesekera et al 2016b 2015 mahadevan et al 2016 webster et al 2002 bhat et al 2001 the recently conducted bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble vinayachandran et al 2018 is one such exercise that collected high quality in situ data in the southern bay of bengal from 04 to 14 july 2016 apart from such field campaigns regional modeling studies vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 das et al 2016 jensen 2001 jensen et al 2016 data analysis from remote sensing satellites and autonomous platforms such as drifters buoys and floats murty et al 1992 schott et al 1994 schott and mccreary jr 2001 have also been undertaken to study the bay of bengal a strong seasonal feature in this region is the southwest monsoon current smc also known as the summer monsoon current that advects warm saline water from the arabian sea to the bay of bengal murty et al 1992 thereby changing the salinity structure in the bay schott et al 2009 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 this feature has been well documented through various observational campaigns large scale modeling studies and analysis of climatological datasets cutler and swallow 1984 schott et al 1994 levitus and boyer 1994 levitus et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 shankar et al 2002 the mechanism of action is that the smc brings arabian sea high salinity water ashsw that subducts below the bay of bengal waters creating a subsurface maximum in the upper thermocline region vinayachandran et al 2013 jain et al 2017 further vinayachandran et al 2013 also showed that a salt pump brings ashsw to the surface altering the stratification and influencing the monsoon understanding and accurately modeling the smc variability is pivotal to improving our knowledge of the region s ocean dynamics with the technological advancement in high performance computing facilities highly efficient numerical modeling systems availability of high resolution datasets multi platform in situ and satellite data and better model data assimilation schemes significant advancements have been achieved in data driven feature modeling for numerical simulations and research operational forecasting pinardi et al 2017 one such data driven technique the feature oriented regional modelling and simulation forms approach was introduced by gangopadhyay et al 1997 and generalized for applying it to any regional ocean gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 of the many added advantages that feature models bring the most important ones include generating more realistic 3d initialization fields by melding the synoptic features with the background climatology using a strategic feature oriented sampling and objective analysis methodology lozano et al 1996 gangopadhyay et al 2011 most importantly the forms approach is independent of the dynamical modeling system used and has been particularly useful when in situ observations or satellite data are not abundantly available significant success has been achieved in synoptic forecasting by utilizing the forms technique with different dynamical modeling systems for example forms has been employed to study the gulf stream meander and rings robinson et al 1989 glenn and robinson 1995 deep western boundary current gangopadhyay et al 1997 shelfbreak fronts lermusiaux 1999 north brazil current rings schmidt et al 2011 southeastern brazil region calado et al 2008 california current system gangopadhyay et al 2011 and the global ocean cummings et al 1997 the forms methodology applied to the southern bay of bengal provides a data driven framework for obtaining synoptic fields for initializing primitive equation dynamical models for nowcasting forecasting and assimilation in the region further it provides a systematic approach for calibration and validation of bio geo physical chemical ocean models in the present paper our objectives are to i develop a synoptic forecasting system in the southern bay of bengal using the forms technique ii improve the nowcast and short term synoptic forecast simulation skill of primitive equation dynamical models and iii obtain model forecasts at a high resolution for use in further analysis of the regional circulation we note that this paper is the first application of the forms technique in this region here we introduce the systematic approach that must be followed in developing similar feature models for nowcast and short term synoptic forecasts in different areas of the bay of bengal the forms approach in the indian ocean region can be integrated with the indian national center for ocean information services assimilation systems francis et al 2020 besides their utility for state forecast and dynamics studies such a modeling system and forecast capability could serve as an essential decision making tool in future ocean observation missions to identify sampling strategies based on information theory lermusiaux et al 2017 through a literature survey and analysis of observation and global model data we develop a template of the major synoptic features in the region viz the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome anti cyclonic eddy and subsurface baroclinic eddy to the east of the smc new feature models are developed for the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy by utilizing the observational transects collected during the bobble cruise from the feature development perspective the novelty is that we develop an elliptical analytical function for modeling the smc s high salinity core following the forms methodology the feature models are placed on the template and pseudo numerical observations are sampled at a high resolution for an objective analysis of the initial conditions such a synoptic initialization scheme is utilized along with a background from the nemo global model analysis data next the forms initialization fields are used in simulations with the mit mseas primitive equation modeling system four progressive experiments without and with different components of the feature model are showcased to analyze the skill improvement in introducing the forms methodology our results show significant skill improvement in representing and quantifying the important dynamical events observed in the independent bobble time series dataset and argo float dataset the article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the available data that helped estimate the pathway of smc satellite data and understand the smc dynamics cruise data we also evaluate global models skill to simulate the smc by comparing it with the bobble dataset in section 3 we detail the procedure to localize the region s features and develop the necessary feature models the mseas model setup including the boundary forcing and parameterization is discussed in section 4 in section 5 we showcase four experiments that led to the final feature model and discuss the results finally we end the article with conclusions and directions for future work in section 6 2 observational and global model datasets we consider the rectangular region in the southern bay of bengal enclosed by the 3 n 12 n latitudes and 82 5 e 92 e longitudes for our feature modeling and simulation studies fig 1 in this region we have access to data collected during the bobble experiment and from argo floats fig 1 b additionally remote sensing observations and global ocean model analysis data are available in this section we briefly describe the datasets and compare the observational data with available global model data motivating the need for the present feature oriented modeling and simulation work 2 1 in situ observational data the principal in situ data that we utilize for our data driven feature modeling and validation of our modeling effort was collected during the bobble cruise of july 2016 additionally the argo program argo 2020 had a few floats in the area from june to july 2016 giving us limited in situ data for validation bobble the bobble cruise was carried out in july 2016 when the smc was active a complete description of the cruise including its scientific objectives instrumentation cruise path and collected datasets is available in vinayachandran et al 2018 for the present feature model development and validation we utilize two datasets collected during bobble viz i conductivity temperature depth ctd measurements made along the section of 8 n during the outward at 1 resolution shown in fig 2 a b and return at 0 25 resolution not shown here legs of the cruise ii 10 days time series measurements at 89 e 8 n of salinity fig 2 c temperature fig 2 d and velocity from adcp in both datasets measurements were taken at a resolution of 1 m in the vertical due to ship generated turbulence adcp data in the first 10 m was removed at the time series location data was collected every 3 h specifically only the outward leg data is used for the feature model construction and the time series data is used solely for verification and validation i e not used as an input to the modeling system the salient features of the ocean flow at the time series location during the experiment are the initial surface freshening event surface salinization event between 6 to 8 july surface freshening event from 8 july till the end of the experiment initial presence of subsurface high salinity water 60 80 m and the high salinity core expansion event that starts on 7 july fig 2 george et al 2019 thushara et al 2019 argo the argo floats with wmo ids 2901593 2901595 2902157 2902158 2902161 2902570 2902605 2902612 2902681 2902682 5904313 were present in the region of interest during june and july 2016 fig 1 a shows the location of these argo floats colored by the month overlaid on a background of the sea level anomaly sla on 04 jul 2016 the data from these floats were partially utilized for informing our feature modeling choices and validation 2 2 remote sensing data sea surface temperature salinity and height data from remote sensing satellites provide us information about the spatial location of the region s features of interest enabling us to design good feature models following webber et al 2018 we utilize satellite data to estimate the pathway of smc we also compare the bobble time series observations with sst and sss to evaluate the quality of the remotely sensed data for assimilation fig 3 sla product from the copernicus data store is used for analyzing the sea surface height anomaly fig 1 a shows the sla map on 04 july 2016 as the background amsr 3e 25 km sst product amsr 3e 2020 and smap 25 km sss product jpl 2020 are used for analyzing the sea surface temperature sst and sea surface salinity sss respectively fig 3 a shows the sst on 04 july 2016 and fig 3 b shows the sss on 04 july 2016 both overlaid on geostrophic velocities computed from the sla on 04 july 2016 next we compare satellite measured sst and sss interpolated on to the time series location with the in situ time series observation from the bobble experiment fig 3 c shows the time series of sst at 89 e 8 n the in situ temperature at 3 m and the difference between these two datasets rmse 0 25 c similarly fig 3 d shows the time series of sss at 89 e 8 n the in situ salinity at 3 m and the difference between these two datasets rmse 0 39 psu from these comparisons we conclude that significant caution must be exercised before using amsr 3e and smap datasets for assimilation and validation of model simulations 2 3 global circulation model analysis data to initialize our high resolution feature oriented regional modeling setup we require the analysis from a global analysis system typically of a lower resolution for this purpose model data from two operational global circulation models with data assimilation viz hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom and nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo are evaluated our choice of these two models among the several variations of gfs available was inspired by i the availability of relatively medium resolution products 9 km ii confidence and use of these models among the community iii assimilation of satellite data in these models and iv findings in webber et al 2018 that nemo 1 12 ocean model with data assimilation faithfully reflects the smc s variability and its associated water masses for selection we compare the data products from hycom and nemo with the time series measurements from bobble hycom analysis products from the hycom model chassignet et al 2007 bleck 2002 are available through the hycom website hycom 2020 the hycom global model uses a mercator grid between 78 s and 47 n approximate equatorial resolution of 1 12 and average resolution of 9 km in our numerical domain and has 33 vertical levels extending from the surface to 5500 m with 7 vertical levels in the top 100 m the dataset contains daily snapshots of 3d potential temperature salinity velocities and 2d sea surface height hycom uses the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 and assimilates sst ssh available in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles from xbts argo floats and moored buoys the surface forcing is provided by navy global environment model navgem 3 h resolution datasets in fig 4 b d we compare the hycom salinity analysis with the time series observations of the bobble experiment it can be seen from these comparisons that hycom does not reproduce the high salinity core and it s subsequent expansion subsurface moreover the salinization and freshening events on the surface are absent in the hycom data nemo analysis products from the nemo 1 12 global ocean model with data assimilation are freely available through copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems product id global analysis forecast phy 001 024 the dataset contains 3d potential temperature salinity and currents 2d sea surface height bottom potential temperature and mixed layer thickness defined on 50 vertical levels from the surface to 5500 m with 22 levels in the top 100 m the surface forcing is provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf 3 h resolution forecasts the model assimilates the satellite sst ssh and in situ temperature and salinity data collected from the global networks including glider observations research vessels argo floats and moorings fig 4 a c compares the nemo 1 12 model analysis with the time series observations of bobble note that the bobble time series data has not been assimilated in the nemo model nemo achieves a fair surface representation of the bobble experiment qualitatively however the high salinity core expansion post 07 july at around 80 m and the initial presence of high salinity water at around 60 m are not captured when compared to the bobble time series data overall nemo analysis data has a better resemblance to the bobble data than hycom therefore nemo was chosen for initializing the feature oriented modeling and simulation setup in the present study 3 development of feature models the feature oriented regional modeling and simulation forms gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 methodology requires extensive literature study to define the basic flow features in the region of interest in the form of data driven semi analytical feature models fms with parameters that can be tuned to the available data we first describe the various features that are important in our modeling domain we then analyze the available satellite imagery and existing literature to arrive at a template where different features are mapped next we develop t s feature models using a combination of bobble cruise data and nemo analysis data finally the initial t s fields are generated by objectively analyzing the fm pseudo observations with nemo analysis as the background field we reiterate that nemo was chosen as the background field for the objective analysis based on our comparisons section 2 3 and the analysis in webber et al 2018 3 1 multiscale description of features in the region of interest the features of interest in the southern bob region are the smc re circulating gyre around the sri lanka dome sld the southern anti cyclonic eddy centered at 87 e 5 n a subsurface baroclinic eddy centered at 88 3 e 8 1 n and the branches of smc formed by interaction with the eddies george et al 2019 pirro et al 2020 the forms methodology requires the features of interest to be mapped onto an fm template where all the significant features are placed on a horizontal map at their respective locations below we describe these features and the development of the fm template fig 5 a 3 1 1 sri lanka dome during the boreal summer months june to september the sld is a persistent feature to the east of sri lanka sld manifests itself as a cyclonic re circulating gyre with smc on its southern and eastern flank southward flow that opposes the local wind on its western flank and a westward flow on its northern flank the sld has a diameter of roughly 200 300 km pirro et al 2020 this flow is hypothesized to be due to a combination of open ocean ekman pumping wind driven ekman transport and smc flow separation to the east of sri lanka vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 vinayachandran et al 1999 vos et al 2014 mccreary et al 2009 vinayachandran et al 2004 das et al 2016 the sld is visible in satellite imagery negative sla value burns et al 2017 climatological datasets locarnini 2018 and field observations lozovatsky et al 2019 we used the sla map to identify the location of the sld and map it in fig 5 a 3 1 2 anti cyclonic eddy an anti cyclonic eddy ae forms to the south east of our domain having a radius of roughly 100 km vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 the interaction of smc and rossby waves is believed to be the mechanism that generates this eddy vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 the ae is visible in the sla maps with visible downwelling of the thermocline downwelling as large as 3 4 m per day pirro et al 2020 this anticyclonic eddy ae is marked in fig 5 a the ae and sld are also identified from the maps of sla and depth of the thermocline fig 9c d 3 1 3 smc the smc is a surface 0 200 m intensified current with sld to the west and ae to the east rath et al 2019 and it supplies arabian sea water to the bay of bengal murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 2013 2018 to identify the smc s horizontal location we use the sla data and estimates of smc width from literature to determine the spatial location analyzing the sla maps and following webber et al 2018 we explore two possible options for the smc location option 1 we use the 0 05 m sla contour as the centerline of the smc webber et al 2018 and carve the smc s path by adding an offset of half the smc width on either side of the centerline solid green line in fig 5 a then the entrance and exit of smc into the computational domain are fixed using the sss snapshot from smap fig 3 b and option 2 the smc location obtained from option 1 is modified using a simple mathematical model constructed using hollow quarter ellipses connected to a rectangle at both ends fig 5 a finally to identify the smc s physical location we require an estimate of its width however the smc s width has been a matter of debate in the literature webber et al 2018 schott et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 estimated the smc s width to be around 3 to the south of sri lanka whereas wijesekera et al 2016a estimated it to be about 100 to 200 km based on transport calculations moreover webber et al 2018 reports that clear demarcation between the smc and persistent eddies is not straightforward as such various experiments of primitive equation model forecasts section 4 with varying widths between 100 to 350 km and the two options were performed to search for the best comparison with bobble data we found that a width of 250 km and option 2 offered the best fit and is therefore used in the present paper 3 1 4 subsurface baroclinic eddy from analyzing multiple numerical experiments not shown here the bobble adcp data and the salinity budget george et al 2019 we believe that the reason for the initial presence of high salinity water at depths of 50 80 m was due to advection by a subsurface baroclinic eddy centered at 88 3 e 8 1 n with a 30 km radius a search procedure where we compared multiple pe simulations with different eddy parameter options against bobble data informed this choice note that this eddy is not reflected in the coarser resolution sla maps 3 2 feature models an analysis of the nemo model data shows that the sld and ae features are well represented section 3 3 however the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy require a data driven feature model to be developed for accurate representation we describe the development of these feature models now 3 2 1 smc feature model to build a data driven feature model for smc we first determine the horizontal location fig 5a the next step is to analyze subsurface data and develop a data driven relationship for the temperature and salinity across several cross sections of the smc these cross sections will be used as pseudo ship transects that provide data for the objective analysis of the simulation s initial conditions we sample the analytical functions at a very high resolution to obtain the pseudo observations so that the initial conditions adequately describe the feature being modeled e g gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 gangopadhyay et al 2011 calado et al 2008 fig 5b shows the schema of pseudo observation locations smc fm as blue dots and eddy fm as purple dots locations at which the background nemo is provided as black dots and the extent of the domain red box as can be seen we use a larger spatial domain to construct the initialization field gangopadhyay et al 2011 further we sample the pseudo fm observations at a very high resolution compared to the background we have also used a spatially varying resolution for the background to achieve two competing objectives one the features represented by the nemo analysis data the sld and ae are adequately captured in the objective analysis two the background does not interfere with the data driven fm to create spurious flows at the boundary of fm and background in what follows we describe the development of the temperature feature model t fm and salinity feature model s fm separately temperature feature model t fm temperature plays a critical role in deciding the smc s transport based on a literature survey and our analysis we use a four section strategy to construct the t fm these four cross sections can be seen in fig 5 b as lines in black green magenta and cyan section 1 black line marks the entrance of smc into the domain section 2 brown line is a transect through 87 e 6 n where the first forking of smc occurs vinayachandran et al 2018 section 3 is a transect along 8 n green line and section 4 magenta line is a transect at the location where the smc forks again to a second eastward branch vinayachandran et al 2018 the section 4 also marks the end of the smc t fm as evidenced from sla maps and geostrophic currents to construct a data driven fm we ideally require real ship transects along these four sections and more would be better currently we only have access to actual ship based measurements along 8 n made during the bobble cruise black squares show the location of these data points in fig 5 b to fit our fm we first used the temperature and salinity data from the available argo floats fig 1a however the argo data was not sufficient for the accurate construction of smc fm the option of using only bobble data at 8 n throughout the smc was also ruled out as significant spatial variability in the cross sections were observed in the global nemo analysis data webber et al 2018 hence we utilize the nemo analysis data to construct the data driven t fm at section 1 2 and 4 the isotherms at each of the four cross sections are modeled using tan hyperbolic functions this choice emanates from the widespread use of the tan hyperbolic for modeling currents such as shelf slope fronts gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 an analysis of the bobble temperature data at 8 n fig 2 b also indicates that the tan hyperbolic is suitable for modeling the temperature in the smc analytically the function is expressed as 1 t η z t a z 1 2 t b z t a z tanh η η c γ where t a and t b are the ambient temperatures on either side of the smc γ is the cross smc half width η c is the center location of the smc and η is the distance across the smc from the center as already stated for section 1 2 and 4 we employ nemo data for t a and t b for section 3 we employ bobble data for t a and t b the location of smc extent is shown in fig 6 as dotted black lines additionally for section 3 to better model the measured data fig 6 a b we blend a tan hyperbolic function fit with t a at 86 e and t b at 88 e with another tan hyperbolic function fit with t a at 88 e and t b at 89 e for all the sections γ and η c are tuned so that the reported smc transport webber et al 2018 wijesekera et al 2016b is maintained adequately fig 7 a d shows the t fm constructed at the four chosen cross sections the fitted tan hyperbolic function is used to generate temperature observations at a high resolution across the four cross sections a simple linear interpolation is used for obtaining the pseudo observations along the smc between any two cross sections north of section 4 the t fm is tapered down to reduce the transport enabling the feature to blend into the background and exit the domain other higher order interpolation schemes spline cubic to sample from the fms along the feature were also tested it was found that the order of interpolation does not change the simulation results section 5 significantly thus to keep the fm simple linear interpolation is being employed salinity feature model s fm a high salinity core is the primary characteristic of the smc and needs to be modeled well for successful simulations this high salinity core is visible in the bobble salinity data at the 8 n section fig 6 c and must be modeled similar to the t fm we employ a section based approach to construct the s fm nemo analysis data is used to construct the s fm at section 1 and 2 at section 3 bobble salinity data collected during the outward leg of the cruise is utilized at section 4 we employ the same s fm as in section 3 and do not use the nemo data this choice was informed by several experiments not shown here that led to the conclusion that using nemo salinity at section 4 does not match time series observation during the experiments section 5 the isohalines at section 1 2 and 3 are modeled using elliptical functions the analytical ellipse representing the isohalines schematic in fig 8 a can be expressed as 2 x x c 2 a 2 z z c 2 b 2 1 where x c z c represent the center of the ellipse and a and b represent the major and minor axis lengths respectively we fit the high salinity core of the bobble data at 8 n using the above elliptical template the center major and minor axis lengths of every isohaline contour have been chosen to fit every section s data at section 2 nemo salinity analysis data shows a double ellipse structure and so our s fm has two ellipses for this section the values of the ellipse parameters for different isohalines of each section are shown in fig 8 b for section 3 rough approximations for the ellipses have been drawn based on the salinity data from the bobble cruise as seen in fig 6 d these approximate isohalines avoid overfitting to the data and provide a better generalization of our data driven s fm in the top 25 m i e above the high salinity core polylines are used for isohalines in section 1 2 3 and 4 same as the t fm north of section 4 the s fm must be blended to the background hence we add another section 4a cyan line in fig 5b at 11 n for section 4a a tan hyperbolic is used for isohalines this choice ensures that the high salinity core modeled until section 4 blends into the background without causing spurious numerical flow an analysis of nemo subsurface data and several numerical experiments on the location of section 4a presented evidence that a choice of 11 n leads to the best match with observations section 5 high resolution salinity pseudo observations are sampled along and across the smc from the s fm following a similar interpolation procedure as for t fm fig 6 c d shows a comparison between the bobble salinity data with the s fm constructed using elliptical isohalines fitted with data our goal in constructing the s fm was to match the data without overfitting and this result can be seen here fig 7 e h shows the s fm constructed at section 1 2 3 and 4a 3 2 2 feature model for eddy at 88 3 e 8 n a subsurface baroclinic eddy of 30 km radius is introduced at 88 3 e 8 1 n using the bobble cruise data for the t fm a tan hyperbolic function is fitted between the temperature profile at 88 e 8 n and the temperature profile at 89 e 8 n t a and t b respectively see eq 1 the same elliptical template of smc s fm is also used for the subsurface baroclinic eddy s fm these fms are used throughout the eddy and pseudo observations are sampled for use in the objective analysis of initial conditions 3 3 multiscale initialization once the fms are developed and pseudo observations i e the fm observations are obtained the next step is to perform an objective analysis with a background of the nemo analysis data of 04 july 2016 a multiscale objective analysis is performed in two stages in the first stage the data s horizontal average both observations and climatology serves as the background the observation and background with different error covariances are then objectively analyzed with the mean de correlation scales in the second stage the first stage oa field is used as the background only the observations are objectively analyzed with synoptic de correlation scales to produce the final oa fields lermusiaux 1999 the oa is performed level by level using a mexican hat horizontal correlation kernel with appropriate mean and synoptic de correlation length scale and zero crossing an exhaustive parameter study is conducted to identify the appropriate values for these scales watts et al 1989 lozano et al 1996 leslie et al 2010 haley and lermusiaux 2010 the final chosen parameters are tabulated in table 1 this procedure produces 3 d objectively analyzed temperature and salinity fields the corresponding velocity fig 9 c and free surface height are computed by enforcing the pe balance the temperature and salinity oa fields at 100 m and 150 m overlaid with velocity vectors are plotted in fig 9 a b the path of the smc can be seen in the salinity plots the high salinity core enters the domain at a depth of 150 m at 82 5 e then it rises to 100 m at approximately 8 n before blending into the background at 11 n in fig 9 c d we show the ssh and thermocline depth represented by the depth of the 20 c isotherm maps from the oa fields here the sld and ae introduced by the background nemo analysis data are visible confirming that these features do not require explicit feature models in fig 9 e f a vertical cross section of the temperature and salinity initial condition at 8 n is shown where the smc high salinity core is visible 4 mseas primitive equation model setup we employ the mit mseas massachusetts institute of technology multidisciplinary simulation estimation and assimilation primitive equation ocean modeling system haley and lermusiaux 2010 for our ocean simulations our model setup follows the mseas regional strategy with a careful validation calibration and verification procedure leslie et al 2008 the core of mseas is a set of physical equations that describe hydrostatic and boussinesq tidal to mesoscale dynamics with a nonlinear free surface the mseas system also has chemical and biological equations leslie et al 2010 and capabilities for stochastic predictions subramani 2018 but we do not employ those in the present study and postpone inclusion of biology to the future a detailed description of the full capabilities of the mseas system can be found in haley and lermusiaux 2010 and a description of the harvard ocean prediction system hops the predecessor of mseas can be found in robinson 1996 1999 robinson and lermusiaux 2004 logutov and robinson 2005 briefly mseas uses a finite volume numerical scheme with structured arakawa b grids for velocity and tracer in the horizontal direction and an optimized terrain following double sigma coordinate in the vertical lozano et al 1994 a numerical sponge layer is present to absorb outgoing waves with tunable time and length scales a radiation boundary condition with relaxation to the provided initial condition orlanski 1976 spall and robinson 1989 perkins et al 1997 is presently employed for the velocity tracer and free surface equations at the open ocean boundaries motivated by the synoptic time scale of our simulation since our region of interest and the numerical domain are far from the coastline tidal forcing is not enabled srtm15 data is used for the bathymetry for the vertical mixing the pacanowski and philander 1981 mixing scheme is utilized with a wind driven mixed layer calculation and mixing coefficients calculated in george et al 2019 in our numerical experiments we find that these options provide good validation to evaluate the impact of mld schemes on our synoptic forecasts we introduced within mseas the mld scheme described in george et al 2019 and found no significant difference in our simulations as such we conduct our experiments with the wind driven mld scheme and postpone the discussion of the new implementation and findings to a future manuscript a full list of the different options utilized is presented in table 2 4 1 forcing data apart from the initial conditions we must provide boundary forcing data from the atmosphere to our pe modeling system the atmospheric data from automated weather station aws instruments collected during the bobble cruise are used to validate the different atmospheric datasets we choose the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf as our forcing data after careful validation this data has a global resolution of 30 km and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80 km the data is available with a 1 h temporal resolution for the ocean simulation only the surface data is used for forcing when weather forecast data is used instead of re analysis our simulations become true ocean forecasts fig 10 a shows the total heat flux sum of shortwave radiation longwave radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux compared with the aws weather station on board the cruise ship heat flux measurement an excellent peak to peak correspondence is observed between the two datasets notably the era5 dataset faithfully reproduces the diurnal variations fig 10 b shows the wind speed from era5 compared with the aws s wind speed at the beginning of the experiment a small difference exists between the two datasets but both curves follow a similar trend as the experiment progresses overall the era5 data showed a good match with the aws data prompting us to utilize it as our forcing data the following forcing data is obtained from era5 and provided to the mit mseas modeling system i shortwave radiation ii longwave radiation iii sensible heat flux iv latent heat flux v precipitation vi evaporation air temperature at 2 m and vii wind speed at 10m wind stress both the zonal and meridional components the net heat flux mass flux and wind stress are computed and applied as surface boundary conditions by the modeling system leslie et al 2010 5 numerical experiments extensive numerical experiments resulted in the final feature model development described in section 3 here we showcase the four key experiments from all the experiments we performed that progressively led to the development of the final feature model the simulation for each experiment is started with its corresponding initial conditions on 04 july 2016 0z and run until 15 july 2016 0z coinciding with the duration of the time series observations at 89 e 8 n obtained during the bobble cruise section 2 3 in what follows we first describe the experiments after that we discuss improvements to the simulation of salinity temperature and current time series at 89 e 8 n subsurface salinity and comparison with argo data 5 1 description of experiments in the first experiment we initialize our 3 km regional model with downscaled model data from the nemo global analysis system section 2 3 on 04 july 2016 0z no data driven feature models are used here this experiment serves as the base case to set all the tunable parameters in the mseas pe modeling system such as horizontal filtering mixed layer calculation open boundary conditions and sponge parameters we try to minimize the rmse at the time series location between mseas pe simulation and bobble data during the fit also we ensure qualitative goodness of the 3 d tracer and velocity fields and 2 d free surface field further this experiment helps us in understanding the smc s sub surface flow dynamics and advocates the introduction of feature models to achieve a better match with the bobble time series data in the second experiment we introduce the smc feature models section 3 2 1 to test if that captures the salient events observed in the bobble time series data we use these fms with a background of nemo data to obtain objectively analyzed initial conditions this experiment provides a better match with the bobble time series data and accurately captures the high salinity core expansion event however the high salinity water seen at the beginning of the bobble time series at around 60 80 m depth is missing a third experiment is conducted where a subsurface baroclinic eddy feature model section 3 2 2 is introduced in addition to the smc feature models for correcting the above inaccuracy this experiment tests the hypothesis that a subsurface baroclinic eddy is needed in the initial conditions to advect the high salinity core observed in the time series data from 04 to 06 july finally in the fourth experiment we further correct the initial conditions at the surface 0 20 m through a bias correction procedure explained in section 5 3 to better reproduce the surface salinity events observed in the bobble time series data 5 2 overall rmse before analyzing the numerical results for each variable in detail table 3 provides a quick reference of the different experiments the critical results and rmse of salinity and temperature at the time series location the use of data driven feature models has reduced the rmse 60 150 m in both temperature and salinity by 47 and 55 respectively fig 11 shows the time series of rmse of salinity and temperature for the four experiments in fig 11 a we can see that the addition of the smc fm reduces the error during the high salinity core expansion event starting 07 july 2016 further the addition of the initial subsurface baroclinic eddy fm reduced the salinity error at the beginning of the experiment temperature errors have also reduced with the addition of the fm progressively fig 11 b next we perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of the model s skill to simulate different variables 5 3 salinity time series fig 12 shows the salinity time series data from bobble the time series generated by our mseas pe modeling system in the four numerical experiments and the difference between the numerical experiment and observational data as bobble data is at 1 m vertical resolution and our model has only 35 levels in the top 150 m we use a median filter to bring the bobble data to the model resolution before comparison experiment 1 fig 12 a c d even with the best set of parameters does not capture the high salinity core expansion event starting on 7 july 2016 evidenced by the higher difference in fig 12 d this behavior is similar to that of nemo analysis data itself fig 4 a c without downscaling and running mseas pe however a closer look at the surface top 20 m of fig 12c d reveals that experiment 1 reproduces the freshening event between 04 to 06 july the salinization event between 06 to 08 july and the re freshening event starting on 08 july albeit not as strong as in bobble data fig 12 a comparing the salinity at 3 m from bobble data and mseas pe model fig 12 b expt 1 confirms the latter fact fig 11a expt 1 shows that the rmse of salinity is high reflecting that the dynamics were not accurately captured and addition of data driven feature models is necessary to improve the simulation in experiment 2 fig 12 a e f the addition of t fm and s fm for the smc results in the presence of high salinity core expansion event from 07 july 2016 three other observations about the differences in the salinity fig 12 f are i the high salinity core is missing until 08 july 2016 ii the high salinity core expansion starts at a deeper depth 20 m deeper on 08 july 2016 and iii surface 3 m to 20 m salinity errors of 0 4 psu are present after 10 july 2016 a closer look at the salinity at 3 m from this experiment and bobble data fig 12 b expt 2 shows that both the freshening event from 08 july 2016 and the salinization event between 06 july 2016 and 08 july 2016 are weaker in the model than the bobble data fig 11a expt 2 shows that aside from the high rmse initially there is good agreement between the mseas pe model and bobble data experiment 3 was done to investigate the source of this initial error and the feature modeling required to correct this initial error by careful inspection of the nemo analysis data and experiments 1 and 2 we formulated the hypothesis that a subsurface baroclinic eddy advects the initial high salinity water seen at 60 m 80 m leading to our next experiment in experiment 3 a subsurface baroclinic eddy fm was introduced to obtain the high salinity core until 08 july 2016 here the mseas pe salinity fig 12 a g h shows an excellent match with the bobble data crucially the high salinity water at the beginning of the experiment is captured in addition to the high salinity core expansion event on 08 july 2016 this fact shows that the eddy fm successfully corrected the initial salinity error observed with just the smc fm experiment 2 thus we argue that a subsurface baroclinic eddy was indeed responsible for the initial salinity observed in the time series measurements the salinity rmse fig 11 expt 3 between 04 to 07 july has reduced compared to experiment 2 this reduction is due to capturing the initial high salinity water between 50 and 80 m precisely for which the eddy fm was introduced interestingly the eddy fm s interaction with the smc has improved the surface salinity simulation note that the interplay of the subsurface baroclinic eddy and smc has attracted attention webber et al 2018 and our fm can be used for further process studies e g gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 in the future to understand the dynamics at play on the surface we capture all three events i initial freshening between 04 and 06 july ii salinization between 06 and 08 july and iii freshening from 08 july however the freshening event on 08 july is not as strong as in bobble data as observed in fig 12b expt 3 in experiment 4 we attempt further corrections in the initial conditions at the surface to reduce these errors in the surface salinity from george et al 2019 we see that surface advection is responsible for bringing low salinity water to the time series location the main reason for the discrepancy between the mseas pe model and bobble data is that we do not have the correct representation of salinity in the top layers of the initial condition to resolve this issue we attempted to use data from other sources to bias correct the top layer when objectively analyzing the initial condition we started with using satellite data for the bias correction unfortunately the objective analysis of satellite data with a background of experiment 3 s initial conditions did not resolve the discrepancy not shown here and hence this idea was dropped further an analysis of the nemo model data indicates that the it captures the freshening event between 3 20 m section 2 3 but is 0 2 psu saltier than the bobble data during the days of the freshening event thus we hypothesized that using nemo profiles up to 20 m with a bias correction in the objective analysis of initial conditions will be helpful however when we corrected the nemo profiles uniformly in the entire domain and used it in the objective analysis of the initial conditions again not shown here we missed the salinization event this result indicated that the bias correction has to be applied in a limited geographical region identifying this specific region where the bias correction has to be applied is a tedious inverse problem to solve this inverse problem we mapped the approximate region of this bias correction by looking at the transport and identifying the water that comes to the time series location on 08 july 2016 we corrected the nemo profiles bias and used it in the objective analysis of the initial conditions for ensuring the smoothness of the objectively analyzed field the bias correction is blended with the background at the boundary of the region to be corrected finally in experiment 4 the bias corrected nemo profiles up to 20 m using the above procedure the smc fm the eddy fm and the nemo background are objectively analyzed to generate initial conditions experiment 4 s salinity fig 12 a i j is an improvement over experiment 3 and is closer to the bobble data as fig 12 b shows this experiment accurately captures all the surface salinity events observed in the bobble data this result highlights the need for data driven feature modeling an accurate representation of initial conditions is needed for an accurate surface salinity simulation which in turn is essential to predict the region s multiscale nonlinear dynamics for instance the sea surface salinity has been shown to affect stratification by influencing the surface and subsurface temperatures thompson et al 2006 our results highlight the utility of feature models in representing this crucial parameter 5 4 temperature time series next we evaluate the skill of the model to simulate temperature fig 13 shows the temperature time series data comparisons similar to salinity fig 12 in experiment 1 fig 13 a c d similar to salinity the near surface 0 to 60 m temperature is closer to the bobble data fig 13b whereas the subsurface 60 m to 150 m mseas pe temperature have larger errors there could be two reasons why the near surface temperature and salinity in this experiment are close to the bobble data i we use a reasonably good atmospheric forcing and ii the nemo analysis data has already assimilated the remotely sensed surface data sst and sla also we note that due to the use of the wind driven mld calculation scheme in mseas pe we do not observe the deepening of the mixed layer in the model however we introduced the mld scheme of george et al 2019 into the mseas pe model and the simulations did not change significantly even with the new mld scheme at the same time fig 13b shows a strong diurnal variation in the 3 m temperature for all experiments this variation could be due to the atmospheric forcing and the ocean model s resolution in the top 3 m further assimilation of air sea flux in mit mseas and or in situ atmospheric data assimilation in the atmospheric dataset used for forcing will correct these biases and may be undertaken in the future improvements in the mixed layer schemes george et al 2019 may also be required to correct this bias addition of the smc fm in experiment 2 fig 13 a e f makes the mseas pe temperature very close to the bobble data with a two key points seen in fig 13 f i majority of differences are observed from 04 to 07 july 2016 between 60 m and 150 m and ii largest error occurs on 07 july 2016 at 60 m the latter could be associated with the fact that we do not capture the mld deepening event on 07 july 2016 supporting this hypothesis we see that the nature of the error is positive i e the mseas temperature is colder than the bobble data at 60 m thereby suggesting that we do not have sufficient mixing from the upper layers until that depth on that day another reason could be that our vertical model resolution shown as light gray horizontal lines in fig 13 f is coarser than the high resolution data collected during bobble experiments 3 and 4 were to improve salinity the temperature changes are not significant compared to experiment 2 and thus no further comments are made 5 5 velocity time series fig 14 shows the comparison of bobble adcp velocities and those computed by our mseas pe modeling system for all experiments in experiment 1 fig 14 b we see that the surface velocity mseas pe data and adcp data show a good match whereas subsurface i e 60 m to 150 m velocity simulation is different from the adcp data mimicking the behavior of salinity and temperature simulation addition of smc fm in experiment 2 results in an excellent agreement between the bobble adcp data and mseas pe data until 10 july 2016 fig 14 a c however there are minor differences after 10 july 2016 these differences are mainly due to the mismatch in the direction of the zonal velocity between bobble adcp data and mseas pe model the contribution of zonal velocity to the overall speed is minimal fig 14 a where the velocity is predominantly southward making its simulation using primitive equations quite error prone e g subramani et al 2017 velocity time series of experiment 3 fig 14 d and 4 fig 14 e are similar to experiment 2 5 6 subsurface salinity advection to study the horizontal transport of salinity and to design accurate locations for the smc fm horizontal maps of salinity at 100 m depth for all experiments are presented in fig 15 for 07 10 and 14 july the date 07 july was chosen as it is start of the high salinity core expansion event at 89 e 8 n and 10 july is almost midway between 07 and 14 july in experiment 1 fig 15 a we notice that the high salinity core has not reached 89 e 8 n on 07 or 10 july in fact on 07 july the high salinity core is present at a location 0 3 degrees to the west of the time series location this observation initially prompted us to move the high salinity core signature in the nemo downscaled initial conditions by a few degrees and re start the simulation not shown here expecting to see the high salinity core expansion event in the mseas pe time series however this numerical shift of the nemo downscaled initial conditions did not serve its purpose leading us to conclude that the shift is not uniform and there must be a spatial variability associated with the smc captured in the nemo downscaled ic and the reality the different experiments of moving the high salinity core in the nemo analysis data also led us to hypothesize that accurate modeling of the smc s initial location and hydrography is necessary for improving model simulation in experiment 2 fig 15 b we see the advection of the high salinity water to the time series location second and third column of fig 15b george et al 2019 state that the surface 0 60 m advection was responsible for transporting the high salinity water to the time series location which led to the salinization event on 06 july 2016 from experiment 2 we see that a similar advection is responsible for the sub surface 60 150 m high salinity core expansion as well experiments 3 and 4 fig 15 c d are similar to experiment 2 5 7 comparison to argo data we also compared the data from all experiments with the argo floats available in the region during the duration of our experiment a total of 15 profiles at different locations and times figs 16 and 17 show the comparison of argo and experiment 4 s salinity and temperature we find that the mseas pe simulations match the argo measured temperature and salinity total rmse of 0 16 psu in salinity and 0 66 c in temperature showing that our model provides an excellent spatio temporal simulation of the ocean in the region of interest 6 conclusion we presented the first ever application of the feature oriented regional modelling system forms in the bay of bengal region using a data driven feature model we performed synoptic forecasting in hindcast mode from 04 july 2016 to 15 july 2016 in the region encompassing 3 n 12 n 82 5 e and 92 e our simulation duration corresponds to the time series observations collected during the bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble the simulations were done using the mseas pe modeling system on a 3 3 km horizontal grid and 70 optimized vertical levels the need for the forms approach was motivated by the fact that the available global model analysis data both hycom and nemo did not capture the critical properties observed in the bobble time series data we identified that among hycom and nemo nemo was closer to the bobble data and so we use it as a background to perform the objective analysis of our initial conditions the forms methodology involves developing a feature model sampling pseudo observations from it and performing an objective analysis with an appropriate background to construct initial conditions for synoptic forecasting a systematic approach was adopted to develop data driven feature models first the important synoptic features in the region viz the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome sld anticyclonic eddy ae and subsurface baroclinic eddy were identified and mapped at their geographical locations through a thorough literature survey and by analyzing satellite and global model analysis data next nemo global model analysis data was analyzed and it was identified that all features except the smc main branch and the subsurface baroclinic eddy were well represented in the data after that a detailed feature model for the smc main branch and the subsurface baroclinic eddy was developed a tan hyperbolic function was used for the temperature feature model and a novel elliptical feature model was developed for the salinity of the smc main branch for the eddy fm also the same functions with appropriate data driven parameters were utilized pseudo observations are generated by sampling along and across the feature models at a high resolution and objectively analyzed with a background from nemo analysis data using a two stage methodology to generate the temperature and salinity initial conditions next velocity and free surface initial conditions are generated using the pe balance equations with these initial conditions and the best available atmospheric forcing mseas pe simulates the ocean states from 04 july 2016 0z to 15 july 2016 0z we showcased four experiments that progressively led to the final feature model summarized in table 3 with key results in the first experiment the nemo downscaled analysis was used as the initial condition here the high salinity core expansion event was not captured by mseas pe model to capture this event in the second experiment the smc fm was introduced even though this experiment captured the high salinity core expansion the initial core was not captured at 60 80 m depth we hypothesized that a subsurface baroclinic eddy was responsible for the high salinity core s initial advection to the time series location thus in the third experiment we introduced a feature model for the subsurface baroclinic eddy along with the smc fm this addition improved the salinity simulation at 70 m depth from 04 to 06 july 2016 giving credence to our hypothesis about this subsurface baroclinic eddy s presence further this addition also improved surface simulation due to an interplay between the smc and the eddy however the freshening event from 08 july 2016 was not adequately captured finally to adequately capture this freshening event a fourth experiment was conducted that assimilates bias corrected nemo profiles up to 20 m in addition to the smc fm and the eddy fm the addition of above feature models and bias correction helped improve the simulations in the following ways i the smc fm helped capture the evolution of the high salinity core ii the subsurface eddy fm helped provide the initial advective component to the high salinity core and iii initialization with bias corrected nemo surface profiles were necessary to provide for the observed surface freshening event the simulation from our novel data driven feature model based initial conditions gave an excellent match with the bobble datasets thus validating our model as seen in the present paper forms is an excellent data driven system for modeling regional oceans where features are mapped through in situ observation campaigns and or remote sensing data where such data is sparse or prior knowledge of features is unavailable e g relatively less explored parts of eastern or northern bay of bengal andaman sea etc a careful uncertainty quantification and stochastic forecasting with either ensembles or our dynamically orthogonal primitive equations subramani 2018 must be undertaken further new theory and numerical schemes to include inter annual feature models in forecasting systems from climatological datasets are required as a next step physics based studies using the mseas pe forms system could be conducted to provide a better understanding of the smc dynamics use and optimal planning of autonomous underwater vehicles for ocean monitoring and sampling to improve features models

23876,the multiscale synoptic circulation in the southern bay of bengal region is simulated using a high resolution feature oriented regional modeling and simulation forms approach first the region s prevalent ocean circulation features are identified and mapped onto a forms template using a literature survey and analysis of in situ and remote sensing data these features include the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome anti cyclonic eddy and subsurface baroclinic eddy to the east of the smc new data driven feature models are developed for the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy using observational transects collected during the bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble of july 2016 specifically a new elliptical feature model for the smc s high salinity core is developed and utilized the developed temperature and salinity feature models are placed on the forms template and pseudo observation profiles are sampled for use in an objective analysis initialization scheme the background for the objective analysis is taken to be the nemo global analysis model data on the day of the synoptic initialization the forms derived initialization fields on 04 july 2016 are used with the mit mseas primitive equation modeling system to simulate the ocean circulation in the region from 04 july to 15 july 2016 the forecast skill of the model is quantified by comparison to the time series observations collected during bobble but not used in the forms development and argo data available in the region during the simulation four experimental short term synoptic simulations at a 3 km horizontal resolution and 70 vertical levels with and without the different components of the feature models are showcased results are utilized to calibrate and improve the feature model including the addition of a subsurface baroclinic eddy and the development of a new surface bias correction scheme to obtain a better match with validation datasets the present data driven feature modeling approach improves the representation and forecast skill for several critical dynamical features i the initial high salinity core at the time series location ii evolution and expansion of the sub surface high salinity core and iii salinization and freshening events at the time series location between 3 m to 20 m the mseas model simulation from the final experiment match the bobble

depths and the argo measured temperature and salinity total rmse of 0 16 psu in salinity and 0 66 c in temperature showcasing the model s success in providing excellent spatio temporal representation of the ocean in the region of interest keywords bay of bengal boundary layer experiment primitive equations data assimilation feature models synoptic forecasting 1 introduction keeping in view the tremendous importance of the bay of bengal in regulating the climate of the region air sea interactions and monsoons several ocean observation campaigns have been undertaken to collect in situ data from the region wijesekera et al 2016b 2015 mahadevan et al 2016 webster et al 2002 bhat et al 2001 the recently conducted bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble vinayachandran et al 2018 is one such exercise that collected high quality in situ data in the southern bay of bengal from 04 to 14 july 2016 apart from such field campaigns regional modeling studies vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 das et al 2016 jensen 2001 jensen et al 2016 data analysis from remote sensing satellites and autonomous platforms such as drifters buoys and floats murty et al 1992 schott et al 1994 schott and mccreary jr 2001 have also been undertaken to study the bay of bengal a strong seasonal feature in this region is the southwest monsoon current smc also known as the summer monsoon current that advects warm saline water from the arabian sea to the bay of bengal murty et al 1992 thereby changing the salinity structure in the bay schott et al 2009 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 this feature has been well documented through various observational campaigns large scale modeling studies and analysis of climatological datasets cutler and swallow 1984 schott et al 1994 levitus and boyer 1994 levitus et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 shankar et al 2002 the mechanism of action is that the smc brings arabian sea high salinity water ashsw that subducts below the bay of bengal waters creating a subsurface maximum in the upper thermocline region vinayachandran et al 2013 jain et al 2017 further vinayachandran et al 2013 also showed that a salt pump brings ashsw to the surface altering the stratification and influencing the monsoon understanding and accurately modeling the smc variability is pivotal to improving our knowledge of the region s ocean dynamics with the technological advancement in high performance computing facilities highly efficient numerical modeling systems availability of high resolution datasets multi platform in situ and satellite data and better model data assimilation schemes significant advancements have been achieved in data driven feature modeling for numerical simulations and research operational forecasting pinardi et al 2017 one such data driven technique the feature oriented regional modelling and simulation forms approach was introduced by gangopadhyay et al 1997 and generalized for applying it to any regional ocean gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 of the many added advantages that feature models bring the most important ones include generating more realistic 3d initialization fields by melding the synoptic features with the background climatology using a strategic feature oriented sampling and objective analysis methodology lozano et al 1996 gangopadhyay et al 2011 most importantly the forms approach is independent of the dynamical modeling system used and has been particularly useful when in situ observations or satellite data are not abundantly available significant success has been achieved in synoptic forecasting by utilizing the forms technique with different dynamical modeling systems for example forms has been employed to study the gulf stream meander and rings robinson et al 1989 glenn and robinson 1995 deep western boundary current gangopadhyay et al 1997 shelfbreak fronts lermusiaux 1999 north brazil current rings schmidt et al 2011 southeastern brazil region calado et al 2008 california current system gangopadhyay et al 2011 and the global ocean cummings et al 1997 the forms methodology applied to the southern bay of bengal provides a data driven framework for obtaining synoptic fields for initializing primitive equation dynamical models for nowcasting forecasting and assimilation in the region further it provides a systematic approach for calibration and validation of bio geo physical chemical ocean models in the present paper our objectives are to i develop a synoptic forecasting system in the southern bay of bengal using the forms technique ii improve the nowcast and short term synoptic forecast simulation skill of primitive equation dynamical models and iii obtain model forecasts at a high resolution for use in further analysis of the regional circulation we note that this paper is the first application of the forms technique in this region here we introduce the systematic approach that must be followed in developing similar feature models for nowcast and short term synoptic forecasts in different areas of the bay of bengal the forms approach in the indian ocean region can be integrated with the indian national center for ocean information services assimilation systems francis et al 2020 besides their utility for state forecast and dynamics studies such a modeling system and forecast capability could serve as an essential decision making tool in future ocean observation missions to identify sampling strategies based on information theory lermusiaux et al 2017 through a literature survey and analysis of observation and global model data we develop a template of the major synoptic features in the region viz the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome anti cyclonic eddy and subsurface baroclinic eddy to the east of the smc new feature models are developed for the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy by utilizing the observational transects collected during the bobble cruise from the feature development perspective the novelty is that we develop an elliptical analytical function for modeling the smc s high salinity core following the forms methodology the feature models are placed on the template and pseudo numerical observations are sampled at a high resolution for an objective analysis of the initial conditions such a synoptic initialization scheme is utilized along with a background from the nemo global model analysis data next the forms initialization fields are used in simulations with the mit mseas primitive equation modeling system four progressive experiments without and with different components of the feature model are showcased to analyze the skill improvement in introducing the forms methodology our results show significant skill improvement in representing and quantifying the important dynamical events observed in the independent bobble time series dataset and argo float dataset the article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the available data that helped estimate the pathway of smc satellite data and understand the smc dynamics cruise data we also evaluate global models skill to simulate the smc by comparing it with the bobble dataset in section 3 we detail the procedure to localize the region s features and develop the necessary feature models the mseas model setup including the boundary forcing and parameterization is discussed in section 4 in section 5 we showcase four experiments that led to the final feature model and discuss the results finally we end the article with conclusions and directions for future work in section 6 2 observational and global model datasets we consider the rectangular region in the southern bay of bengal enclosed by the 3 n 12 n latitudes and 82 5 e 92 e longitudes for our feature modeling and simulation studies fig 1 in this region we have access to data collected during the bobble experiment and from argo floats fig 1 b additionally remote sensing observations and global ocean model analysis data are available in this section we briefly describe the datasets and compare the observational data with available global model data motivating the need for the present feature oriented modeling and simulation work 2 1 in situ observational data the principal in situ data that we utilize for our data driven feature modeling and validation of our modeling effort was collected during the bobble cruise of july 2016 additionally the argo program argo 2020 had a few floats in the area from june to july 2016 giving us limited in situ data for validation bobble the bobble cruise was carried out in july 2016 when the smc was active a complete description of the cruise including its scientific objectives instrumentation cruise path and collected datasets is available in vinayachandran et al 2018 for the present feature model development and validation we utilize two datasets collected during bobble viz i conductivity temperature depth ctd measurements made along the section of 8 n during the outward at 1 resolution shown in fig 2 a b and return at 0 25 resolution not shown here legs of the cruise ii 10 days time series measurements at 89 e 8 n of salinity fig 2 c temperature fig 2 d and velocity from adcp in both datasets measurements were taken at a resolution of 1 m in the vertical due to ship generated turbulence adcp data in the first 10 m was removed at the time series location data was collected every 3 h specifically only the outward leg data is used for the feature model construction and the time series data is used solely for verification and validation i e not used as an input to the modeling system the salient features of the ocean flow at the time series location during the experiment are the initial surface freshening event surface salinization event between 6 to 8 july surface freshening event from 8 july till the end of the experiment initial presence of subsurface high salinity water 60 80 m and the high salinity core expansion event that starts on 7 july fig 2 george et al 2019 thushara et al 2019 argo the argo floats with wmo ids 2901593 2901595 2902157 2902158 2902161 2902570 2902605 2902612 2902681 2902682 5904313 were present in the region of interest during june and july 2016 fig 1 a shows the location of these argo floats colored by the month overlaid on a background of the sea level anomaly sla on 04 jul 2016 the data from these floats were partially utilized for informing our feature modeling choices and validation 2 2 remote sensing data sea surface temperature salinity and height data from remote sensing satellites provide us information about the spatial location of the region s features of interest enabling us to design good feature models following webber et al 2018 we utilize satellite data to estimate the pathway of smc we also compare the bobble time series observations with sst and sss to evaluate the quality of the remotely sensed data for assimilation fig 3 sla product from the copernicus data store is used for analyzing the sea surface height anomaly fig 1 a shows the sla map on 04 july 2016 as the background amsr 3e 25 km sst product amsr 3e 2020 and smap 25 km sss product jpl 2020 are used for analyzing the sea surface temperature sst and sea surface salinity sss respectively fig 3 a shows the sst on 04 july 2016 and fig 3 b shows the sss on 04 july 2016 both overlaid on geostrophic velocities computed from the sla on 04 july 2016 next we compare satellite measured sst and sss interpolated on to the time series location with the in situ time series observation from the bobble experiment fig 3 c shows the time series of sst at 89 e 8 n the in situ temperature at 3 m and the difference between these two datasets rmse 0 25 c similarly fig 3 d shows the time series of sss at 89 e 8 n the in situ salinity at 3 m and the difference between these two datasets rmse 0 39 psu from these comparisons we conclude that significant caution must be exercised before using amsr 3e and smap datasets for assimilation and validation of model simulations 2 3 global circulation model analysis data to initialize our high resolution feature oriented regional modeling setup we require the analysis from a global analysis system typically of a lower resolution for this purpose model data from two operational global circulation models with data assimilation viz hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom and nucleus for european modelling of the ocean nemo are evaluated our choice of these two models among the several variations of gfs available was inspired by i the availability of relatively medium resolution products 9 km ii confidence and use of these models among the community iii assimilation of satellite data in these models and iv findings in webber et al 2018 that nemo 1 12 ocean model with data assimilation faithfully reflects the smc s variability and its associated water masses for selection we compare the data products from hycom and nemo with the time series measurements from bobble hycom analysis products from the hycom model chassignet et al 2007 bleck 2002 are available through the hycom website hycom 2020 the hycom global model uses a mercator grid between 78 s and 47 n approximate equatorial resolution of 1 12 and average resolution of 9 km in our numerical domain and has 33 vertical levels extending from the surface to 5500 m with 7 vertical levels in the top 100 m the dataset contains daily snapshots of 3d potential temperature salinity velocities and 2d sea surface height hycom uses the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 and assimilates sst ssh available in situ vertical temperature and salinity profiles from xbts argo floats and moored buoys the surface forcing is provided by navy global environment model navgem 3 h resolution datasets in fig 4 b d we compare the hycom salinity analysis with the time series observations of the bobble experiment it can be seen from these comparisons that hycom does not reproduce the high salinity core and it s subsequent expansion subsurface moreover the salinization and freshening events on the surface are absent in the hycom data nemo analysis products from the nemo 1 12 global ocean model with data assimilation are freely available through copernicus marine environment monitoring service cmems product id global analysis forecast phy 001 024 the dataset contains 3d potential temperature salinity and currents 2d sea surface height bottom potential temperature and mixed layer thickness defined on 50 vertical levels from the surface to 5500 m with 22 levels in the top 100 m the surface forcing is provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf 3 h resolution forecasts the model assimilates the satellite sst ssh and in situ temperature and salinity data collected from the global networks including glider observations research vessels argo floats and moorings fig 4 a c compares the nemo 1 12 model analysis with the time series observations of bobble note that the bobble time series data has not been assimilated in the nemo model nemo achieves a fair surface representation of the bobble experiment qualitatively however the high salinity core expansion post 07 july at around 80 m and the initial presence of high salinity water at around 60 m are not captured when compared to the bobble time series data overall nemo analysis data has a better resemblance to the bobble data than hycom therefore nemo was chosen for initializing the feature oriented modeling and simulation setup in the present study 3 development of feature models the feature oriented regional modeling and simulation forms gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 methodology requires extensive literature study to define the basic flow features in the region of interest in the form of data driven semi analytical feature models fms with parameters that can be tuned to the available data we first describe the various features that are important in our modeling domain we then analyze the available satellite imagery and existing literature to arrive at a template where different features are mapped next we develop t s feature models using a combination of bobble cruise data and nemo analysis data finally the initial t s fields are generated by objectively analyzing the fm pseudo observations with nemo analysis as the background field we reiterate that nemo was chosen as the background field for the objective analysis based on our comparisons section 2 3 and the analysis in webber et al 2018 3 1 multiscale description of features in the region of interest the features of interest in the southern bob region are the smc re circulating gyre around the sri lanka dome sld the southern anti cyclonic eddy centered at 87 e 5 n a subsurface baroclinic eddy centered at 88 3 e 8 1 n and the branches of smc formed by interaction with the eddies george et al 2019 pirro et al 2020 the forms methodology requires the features of interest to be mapped onto an fm template where all the significant features are placed on a horizontal map at their respective locations below we describe these features and the development of the fm template fig 5 a 3 1 1 sri lanka dome during the boreal summer months june to september the sld is a persistent feature to the east of sri lanka sld manifests itself as a cyclonic re circulating gyre with smc on its southern and eastern flank southward flow that opposes the local wind on its western flank and a westward flow on its northern flank the sld has a diameter of roughly 200 300 km pirro et al 2020 this flow is hypothesized to be due to a combination of open ocean ekman pumping wind driven ekman transport and smc flow separation to the east of sri lanka vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 vinayachandran et al 1999 vos et al 2014 mccreary et al 2009 vinayachandran et al 2004 das et al 2016 the sld is visible in satellite imagery negative sla value burns et al 2017 climatological datasets locarnini 2018 and field observations lozovatsky et al 2019 we used the sla map to identify the location of the sld and map it in fig 5 a 3 1 2 anti cyclonic eddy an anti cyclonic eddy ae forms to the south east of our domain having a radius of roughly 100 km vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 the interaction of smc and rossby waves is believed to be the mechanism that generates this eddy vinayachandran and yamagata 1998 the ae is visible in the sla maps with visible downwelling of the thermocline downwelling as large as 3 4 m per day pirro et al 2020 this anticyclonic eddy ae is marked in fig 5 a the ae and sld are also identified from the maps of sla and depth of the thermocline fig 9c d 3 1 3 smc the smc is a surface 0 200 m intensified current with sld to the west and ae to the east rath et al 2019 and it supplies arabian sea water to the bay of bengal murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 2013 2018 to identify the smc s horizontal location we use the sla data and estimates of smc width from literature to determine the spatial location analyzing the sla maps and following webber et al 2018 we explore two possible options for the smc location option 1 we use the 0 05 m sla contour as the centerline of the smc webber et al 2018 and carve the smc s path by adding an offset of half the smc width on either side of the centerline solid green line in fig 5 a then the entrance and exit of smc into the computational domain are fixed using the sss snapshot from smap fig 3 b and option 2 the smc location obtained from option 1 is modified using a simple mathematical model constructed using hollow quarter ellipses connected to a rectangle at both ends fig 5 a finally to identify the smc s physical location we require an estimate of its width however the smc s width has been a matter of debate in the literature webber et al 2018 schott et al 1994 vinayachandran et al 1999 estimated the smc s width to be around 3 to the south of sri lanka whereas wijesekera et al 2016a estimated it to be about 100 to 200 km based on transport calculations moreover webber et al 2018 reports that clear demarcation between the smc and persistent eddies is not straightforward as such various experiments of primitive equation model forecasts section 4 with varying widths between 100 to 350 km and the two options were performed to search for the best comparison with bobble data we found that a width of 250 km and option 2 offered the best fit and is therefore used in the present paper 3 1 4 subsurface baroclinic eddy from analyzing multiple numerical experiments not shown here the bobble adcp data and the salinity budget george et al 2019 we believe that the reason for the initial presence of high salinity water at depths of 50 80 m was due to advection by a subsurface baroclinic eddy centered at 88 3 e 8 1 n with a 30 km radius a search procedure where we compared multiple pe simulations with different eddy parameter options against bobble data informed this choice note that this eddy is not reflected in the coarser resolution sla maps 3 2 feature models an analysis of the nemo model data shows that the sld and ae features are well represented section 3 3 however the smc and subsurface baroclinic eddy require a data driven feature model to be developed for accurate representation we describe the development of these feature models now 3 2 1 smc feature model to build a data driven feature model for smc we first determine the horizontal location fig 5a the next step is to analyze subsurface data and develop a data driven relationship for the temperature and salinity across several cross sections of the smc these cross sections will be used as pseudo ship transects that provide data for the objective analysis of the simulation s initial conditions we sample the analytical functions at a very high resolution to obtain the pseudo observations so that the initial conditions adequately describe the feature being modeled e g gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 gangopadhyay et al 2011 calado et al 2008 fig 5b shows the schema of pseudo observation locations smc fm as blue dots and eddy fm as purple dots locations at which the background nemo is provided as black dots and the extent of the domain red box as can be seen we use a larger spatial domain to construct the initialization field gangopadhyay et al 2011 further we sample the pseudo fm observations at a very high resolution compared to the background we have also used a spatially varying resolution for the background to achieve two competing objectives one the features represented by the nemo analysis data the sld and ae are adequately captured in the objective analysis two the background does not interfere with the data driven fm to create spurious flows at the boundary of fm and background in what follows we describe the development of the temperature feature model t fm and salinity feature model s fm separately temperature feature model t fm temperature plays a critical role in deciding the smc s transport based on a literature survey and our analysis we use a four section strategy to construct the t fm these four cross sections can be seen in fig 5 b as lines in black green magenta and cyan section 1 black line marks the entrance of smc into the domain section 2 brown line is a transect through 87 e 6 n where the first forking of smc occurs vinayachandran et al 2018 section 3 is a transect along 8 n green line and section 4 magenta line is a transect at the location where the smc forks again to a second eastward branch vinayachandran et al 2018 the section 4 also marks the end of the smc t fm as evidenced from sla maps and geostrophic currents to construct a data driven fm we ideally require real ship transects along these four sections and more would be better currently we only have access to actual ship based measurements along 8 n made during the bobble cruise black squares show the location of these data points in fig 5 b to fit our fm we first used the temperature and salinity data from the available argo floats fig 1a however the argo data was not sufficient for the accurate construction of smc fm the option of using only bobble data at 8 n throughout the smc was also ruled out as significant spatial variability in the cross sections were observed in the global nemo analysis data webber et al 2018 hence we utilize the nemo analysis data to construct the data driven t fm at section 1 2 and 4 the isotherms at each of the four cross sections are modeled using tan hyperbolic functions this choice emanates from the widespread use of the tan hyperbolic for modeling currents such as shelf slope fronts gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 an analysis of the bobble temperature data at 8 n fig 2 b also indicates that the tan hyperbolic is suitable for modeling the temperature in the smc analytically the function is expressed as 1 t η z t a z 1 2 t b z t a z tanh η η c γ where t a and t b are the ambient temperatures on either side of the smc γ is the cross smc half width η c is the center location of the smc and η is the distance across the smc from the center as already stated for section 1 2 and 4 we employ nemo data for t a and t b for section 3 we employ bobble data for t a and t b the location of smc extent is shown in fig 6 as dotted black lines additionally for section 3 to better model the measured data fig 6 a b we blend a tan hyperbolic function fit with t a at 86 e and t b at 88 e with another tan hyperbolic function fit with t a at 88 e and t b at 89 e for all the sections γ and η c are tuned so that the reported smc transport webber et al 2018 wijesekera et al 2016b is maintained adequately fig 7 a d shows the t fm constructed at the four chosen cross sections the fitted tan hyperbolic function is used to generate temperature observations at a high resolution across the four cross sections a simple linear interpolation is used for obtaining the pseudo observations along the smc between any two cross sections north of section 4 the t fm is tapered down to reduce the transport enabling the feature to blend into the background and exit the domain other higher order interpolation schemes spline cubic to sample from the fms along the feature were also tested it was found that the order of interpolation does not change the simulation results section 5 significantly thus to keep the fm simple linear interpolation is being employed salinity feature model s fm a high salinity core is the primary characteristic of the smc and needs to be modeled well for successful simulations this high salinity core is visible in the bobble salinity data at the 8 n section fig 6 c and must be modeled similar to the t fm we employ a section based approach to construct the s fm nemo analysis data is used to construct the s fm at section 1 and 2 at section 3 bobble salinity data collected during the outward leg of the cruise is utilized at section 4 we employ the same s fm as in section 3 and do not use the nemo data this choice was informed by several experiments not shown here that led to the conclusion that using nemo salinity at section 4 does not match time series observation during the experiments section 5 the isohalines at section 1 2 and 3 are modeled using elliptical functions the analytical ellipse representing the isohalines schematic in fig 8 a can be expressed as 2 x x c 2 a 2 z z c 2 b 2 1 where x c z c represent the center of the ellipse and a and b represent the major and minor axis lengths respectively we fit the high salinity core of the bobble data at 8 n using the above elliptical template the center major and minor axis lengths of every isohaline contour have been chosen to fit every section s data at section 2 nemo salinity analysis data shows a double ellipse structure and so our s fm has two ellipses for this section the values of the ellipse parameters for different isohalines of each section are shown in fig 8 b for section 3 rough approximations for the ellipses have been drawn based on the salinity data from the bobble cruise as seen in fig 6 d these approximate isohalines avoid overfitting to the data and provide a better generalization of our data driven s fm in the top 25 m i e above the high salinity core polylines are used for isohalines in section 1 2 3 and 4 same as the t fm north of section 4 the s fm must be blended to the background hence we add another section 4a cyan line in fig 5b at 11 n for section 4a a tan hyperbolic is used for isohalines this choice ensures that the high salinity core modeled until section 4 blends into the background without causing spurious numerical flow an analysis of nemo subsurface data and several numerical experiments on the location of section 4a presented evidence that a choice of 11 n leads to the best match with observations section 5 high resolution salinity pseudo observations are sampled along and across the smc from the s fm following a similar interpolation procedure as for t fm fig 6 c d shows a comparison between the bobble salinity data with the s fm constructed using elliptical isohalines fitted with data our goal in constructing the s fm was to match the data without overfitting and this result can be seen here fig 7 e h shows the s fm constructed at section 1 2 3 and 4a 3 2 2 feature model for eddy at 88 3 e 8 n a subsurface baroclinic eddy of 30 km radius is introduced at 88 3 e 8 1 n using the bobble cruise data for the t fm a tan hyperbolic function is fitted between the temperature profile at 88 e 8 n and the temperature profile at 89 e 8 n t a and t b respectively see eq 1 the same elliptical template of smc s fm is also used for the subsurface baroclinic eddy s fm these fms are used throughout the eddy and pseudo observations are sampled for use in the objective analysis of initial conditions 3 3 multiscale initialization once the fms are developed and pseudo observations i e the fm observations are obtained the next step is to perform an objective analysis with a background of the nemo analysis data of 04 july 2016 a multiscale objective analysis is performed in two stages in the first stage the data s horizontal average both observations and climatology serves as the background the observation and background with different error covariances are then objectively analyzed with the mean de correlation scales in the second stage the first stage oa field is used as the background only the observations are objectively analyzed with synoptic de correlation scales to produce the final oa fields lermusiaux 1999 the oa is performed level by level using a mexican hat horizontal correlation kernel with appropriate mean and synoptic de correlation length scale and zero crossing an exhaustive parameter study is conducted to identify the appropriate values for these scales watts et al 1989 lozano et al 1996 leslie et al 2010 haley and lermusiaux 2010 the final chosen parameters are tabulated in table 1 this procedure produces 3 d objectively analyzed temperature and salinity fields the corresponding velocity fig 9 c and free surface height are computed by enforcing the pe balance the temperature and salinity oa fields at 100 m and 150 m overlaid with velocity vectors are plotted in fig 9 a b the path of the smc can be seen in the salinity plots the high salinity core enters the domain at a depth of 150 m at 82 5 e then it rises to 100 m at approximately 8 n before blending into the background at 11 n in fig 9 c d we show the ssh and thermocline depth represented by the depth of the 20 c isotherm maps from the oa fields here the sld and ae introduced by the background nemo analysis data are visible confirming that these features do not require explicit feature models in fig 9 e f a vertical cross section of the temperature and salinity initial condition at 8 n is shown where the smc high salinity core is visible 4 mseas primitive equation model setup we employ the mit mseas massachusetts institute of technology multidisciplinary simulation estimation and assimilation primitive equation ocean modeling system haley and lermusiaux 2010 for our ocean simulations our model setup follows the mseas regional strategy with a careful validation calibration and verification procedure leslie et al 2008 the core of mseas is a set of physical equations that describe hydrostatic and boussinesq tidal to mesoscale dynamics with a nonlinear free surface the mseas system also has chemical and biological equations leslie et al 2010 and capabilities for stochastic predictions subramani 2018 but we do not employ those in the present study and postpone inclusion of biology to the future a detailed description of the full capabilities of the mseas system can be found in haley and lermusiaux 2010 and a description of the harvard ocean prediction system hops the predecessor of mseas can be found in robinson 1996 1999 robinson and lermusiaux 2004 logutov and robinson 2005 briefly mseas uses a finite volume numerical scheme with structured arakawa b grids for velocity and tracer in the horizontal direction and an optimized terrain following double sigma coordinate in the vertical lozano et al 1994 a numerical sponge layer is present to absorb outgoing waves with tunable time and length scales a radiation boundary condition with relaxation to the provided initial condition orlanski 1976 spall and robinson 1989 perkins et al 1997 is presently employed for the velocity tracer and free surface equations at the open ocean boundaries motivated by the synoptic time scale of our simulation since our region of interest and the numerical domain are far from the coastline tidal forcing is not enabled srtm15 data is used for the bathymetry for the vertical mixing the pacanowski and philander 1981 mixing scheme is utilized with a wind driven mixed layer calculation and mixing coefficients calculated in george et al 2019 in our numerical experiments we find that these options provide good validation to evaluate the impact of mld schemes on our synoptic forecasts we introduced within mseas the mld scheme described in george et al 2019 and found no significant difference in our simulations as such we conduct our experiments with the wind driven mld scheme and postpone the discussion of the new implementation and findings to a future manuscript a full list of the different options utilized is presented in table 2 4 1 forcing data apart from the initial conditions we must provide boundary forcing data from the atmosphere to our pe modeling system the atmospheric data from automated weather station aws instruments collected during the bobble cruise are used to validate the different atmospheric datasets we choose the era5 dataset hersbach et al 2020 provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf as our forcing data after careful validation this data has a global resolution of 30 km and resolves the atmosphere using 137 levels from the surface up to a height of 80 km the data is available with a 1 h temporal resolution for the ocean simulation only the surface data is used for forcing when weather forecast data is used instead of re analysis our simulations become true ocean forecasts fig 10 a shows the total heat flux sum of shortwave radiation longwave radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux compared with the aws weather station on board the cruise ship heat flux measurement an excellent peak to peak correspondence is observed between the two datasets notably the era5 dataset faithfully reproduces the diurnal variations fig 10 b shows the wind speed from era5 compared with the aws s wind speed at the beginning of the experiment a small difference exists between the two datasets but both curves follow a similar trend as the experiment progresses overall the era5 data showed a good match with the aws data prompting us to utilize it as our forcing data the following forcing data is obtained from era5 and provided to the mit mseas modeling system i shortwave radiation ii longwave radiation iii sensible heat flux iv latent heat flux v precipitation vi evaporation air temperature at 2 m and vii wind speed at 10m wind stress both the zonal and meridional components the net heat flux mass flux and wind stress are computed and applied as surface boundary conditions by the modeling system leslie et al 2010 5 numerical experiments extensive numerical experiments resulted in the final feature model development described in section 3 here we showcase the four key experiments from all the experiments we performed that progressively led to the development of the final feature model the simulation for each experiment is started with its corresponding initial conditions on 04 july 2016 0z and run until 15 july 2016 0z coinciding with the duration of the time series observations at 89 e 8 n obtained during the bobble cruise section 2 3 in what follows we first describe the experiments after that we discuss improvements to the simulation of salinity temperature and current time series at 89 e 8 n subsurface salinity and comparison with argo data 5 1 description of experiments in the first experiment we initialize our 3 km regional model with downscaled model data from the nemo global analysis system section 2 3 on 04 july 2016 0z no data driven feature models are used here this experiment serves as the base case to set all the tunable parameters in the mseas pe modeling system such as horizontal filtering mixed layer calculation open boundary conditions and sponge parameters we try to minimize the rmse at the time series location between mseas pe simulation and bobble data during the fit also we ensure qualitative goodness of the 3 d tracer and velocity fields and 2 d free surface field further this experiment helps us in understanding the smc s sub surface flow dynamics and advocates the introduction of feature models to achieve a better match with the bobble time series data in the second experiment we introduce the smc feature models section 3 2 1 to test if that captures the salient events observed in the bobble time series data we use these fms with a background of nemo data to obtain objectively analyzed initial conditions this experiment provides a better match with the bobble time series data and accurately captures the high salinity core expansion event however the high salinity water seen at the beginning of the bobble time series at around 60 80 m depth is missing a third experiment is conducted where a subsurface baroclinic eddy feature model section 3 2 2 is introduced in addition to the smc feature models for correcting the above inaccuracy this experiment tests the hypothesis that a subsurface baroclinic eddy is needed in the initial conditions to advect the high salinity core observed in the time series data from 04 to 06 july finally in the fourth experiment we further correct the initial conditions at the surface 0 20 m through a bias correction procedure explained in section 5 3 to better reproduce the surface salinity events observed in the bobble time series data 5 2 overall rmse before analyzing the numerical results for each variable in detail table 3 provides a quick reference of the different experiments the critical results and rmse of salinity and temperature at the time series location the use of data driven feature models has reduced the rmse 60 150 m in both temperature and salinity by 47 and 55 respectively fig 11 shows the time series of rmse of salinity and temperature for the four experiments in fig 11 a we can see that the addition of the smc fm reduces the error during the high salinity core expansion event starting 07 july 2016 further the addition of the initial subsurface baroclinic eddy fm reduced the salinity error at the beginning of the experiment temperature errors have also reduced with the addition of the fm progressively fig 11 b next we perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative assessment of the model s skill to simulate different variables 5 3 salinity time series fig 12 shows the salinity time series data from bobble the time series generated by our mseas pe modeling system in the four numerical experiments and the difference between the numerical experiment and observational data as bobble data is at 1 m vertical resolution and our model has only 35 levels in the top 150 m we use a median filter to bring the bobble data to the model resolution before comparison experiment 1 fig 12 a c d even with the best set of parameters does not capture the high salinity core expansion event starting on 7 july 2016 evidenced by the higher difference in fig 12 d this behavior is similar to that of nemo analysis data itself fig 4 a c without downscaling and running mseas pe however a closer look at the surface top 20 m of fig 12c d reveals that experiment 1 reproduces the freshening event between 04 to 06 july the salinization event between 06 to 08 july and the re freshening event starting on 08 july albeit not as strong as in bobble data fig 12 a comparing the salinity at 3 m from bobble data and mseas pe model fig 12 b expt 1 confirms the latter fact fig 11a expt 1 shows that the rmse of salinity is high reflecting that the dynamics were not accurately captured and addition of data driven feature models is necessary to improve the simulation in experiment 2 fig 12 a e f the addition of t fm and s fm for the smc results in the presence of high salinity core expansion event from 07 july 2016 three other observations about the differences in the salinity fig 12 f are i the high salinity core is missing until 08 july 2016 ii the high salinity core expansion starts at a deeper depth 20 m deeper on 08 july 2016 and iii surface 3 m to 20 m salinity errors of 0 4 psu are present after 10 july 2016 a closer look at the salinity at 3 m from this experiment and bobble data fig 12 b expt 2 shows that both the freshening event from 08 july 2016 and the salinization event between 06 july 2016 and 08 july 2016 are weaker in the model than the bobble data fig 11a expt 2 shows that aside from the high rmse initially there is good agreement between the mseas pe model and bobble data experiment 3 was done to investigate the source of this initial error and the feature modeling required to correct this initial error by careful inspection of the nemo analysis data and experiments 1 and 2 we formulated the hypothesis that a subsurface baroclinic eddy advects the initial high salinity water seen at 60 m 80 m leading to our next experiment in experiment 3 a subsurface baroclinic eddy fm was introduced to obtain the high salinity core until 08 july 2016 here the mseas pe salinity fig 12 a g h shows an excellent match with the bobble data crucially the high salinity water at the beginning of the experiment is captured in addition to the high salinity core expansion event on 08 july 2016 this fact shows that the eddy fm successfully corrected the initial salinity error observed with just the smc fm experiment 2 thus we argue that a subsurface baroclinic eddy was indeed responsible for the initial salinity observed in the time series measurements the salinity rmse fig 11 expt 3 between 04 to 07 july has reduced compared to experiment 2 this reduction is due to capturing the initial high salinity water between 50 and 80 m precisely for which the eddy fm was introduced interestingly the eddy fm s interaction with the smc has improved the surface salinity simulation note that the interplay of the subsurface baroclinic eddy and smc has attracted attention webber et al 2018 and our fm can be used for further process studies e g gangopadhyay and robinson 2002 in the future to understand the dynamics at play on the surface we capture all three events i initial freshening between 04 and 06 july ii salinization between 06 and 08 july and iii freshening from 08 july however the freshening event on 08 july is not as strong as in bobble data as observed in fig 12b expt 3 in experiment 4 we attempt further corrections in the initial conditions at the surface to reduce these errors in the surface salinity from george et al 2019 we see that surface advection is responsible for bringing low salinity water to the time series location the main reason for the discrepancy between the mseas pe model and bobble data is that we do not have the correct representation of salinity in the top layers of the initial condition to resolve this issue we attempted to use data from other sources to bias correct the top layer when objectively analyzing the initial condition we started with using satellite data for the bias correction unfortunately the objective analysis of satellite data with a background of experiment 3 s initial conditions did not resolve the discrepancy not shown here and hence this idea was dropped further an analysis of the nemo model data indicates that the it captures the freshening event between 3 20 m section 2 3 but is 0 2 psu saltier than the bobble data during the days of the freshening event thus we hypothesized that using nemo profiles up to 20 m with a bias correction in the objective analysis of initial conditions will be helpful however when we corrected the nemo profiles uniformly in the entire domain and used it in the objective analysis of the initial conditions again not shown here we missed the salinization event this result indicated that the bias correction has to be applied in a limited geographical region identifying this specific region where the bias correction has to be applied is a tedious inverse problem to solve this inverse problem we mapped the approximate region of this bias correction by looking at the transport and identifying the water that comes to the time series location on 08 july 2016 we corrected the nemo profiles bias and used it in the objective analysis of the initial conditions for ensuring the smoothness of the objectively analyzed field the bias correction is blended with the background at the boundary of the region to be corrected finally in experiment 4 the bias corrected nemo profiles up to 20 m using the above procedure the smc fm the eddy fm and the nemo background are objectively analyzed to generate initial conditions experiment 4 s salinity fig 12 a i j is an improvement over experiment 3 and is closer to the bobble data as fig 12 b shows this experiment accurately captures all the surface salinity events observed in the bobble data this result highlights the need for data driven feature modeling an accurate representation of initial conditions is needed for an accurate surface salinity simulation which in turn is essential to predict the region s multiscale nonlinear dynamics for instance the sea surface salinity has been shown to affect stratification by influencing the surface and subsurface temperatures thompson et al 2006 our results highlight the utility of feature models in representing this crucial parameter 5 4 temperature time series next we evaluate the skill of the model to simulate temperature fig 13 shows the temperature time series data comparisons similar to salinity fig 12 in experiment 1 fig 13 a c d similar to salinity the near surface 0 to 60 m temperature is closer to the bobble data fig 13b whereas the subsurface 60 m to 150 m mseas pe temperature have larger errors there could be two reasons why the near surface temperature and salinity in this experiment are close to the bobble data i we use a reasonably good atmospheric forcing and ii the nemo analysis data has already assimilated the remotely sensed surface data sst and sla also we note that due to the use of the wind driven mld calculation scheme in mseas pe we do not observe the deepening of the mixed layer in the model however we introduced the mld scheme of george et al 2019 into the mseas pe model and the simulations did not change significantly even with the new mld scheme at the same time fig 13b shows a strong diurnal variation in the 3 m temperature for all experiments this variation could be due to the atmospheric forcing and the ocean model s resolution in the top 3 m further assimilation of air sea flux in mit mseas and or in situ atmospheric data assimilation in the atmospheric dataset used for forcing will correct these biases and may be undertaken in the future improvements in the mixed layer schemes george et al 2019 may also be required to correct this bias addition of the smc fm in experiment 2 fig 13 a e f makes the mseas pe temperature very close to the bobble data with a two key points seen in fig 13 f i majority of differences are observed from 04 to 07 july 2016 between 60 m and 150 m and ii largest error occurs on 07 july 2016 at 60 m the latter could be associated with the fact that we do not capture the mld deepening event on 07 july 2016 supporting this hypothesis we see that the nature of the error is positive i e the mseas temperature is colder than the bobble data at 60 m thereby suggesting that we do not have sufficient mixing from the upper layers until that depth on that day another reason could be that our vertical model resolution shown as light gray horizontal lines in fig 13 f is coarser than the high resolution data collected during bobble experiments 3 and 4 were to improve salinity the temperature changes are not significant compared to experiment 2 and thus no further comments are made 5 5 velocity time series fig 14 shows the comparison of bobble adcp velocities and those computed by our mseas pe modeling system for all experiments in experiment 1 fig 14 b we see that the surface velocity mseas pe data and adcp data show a good match whereas subsurface i e 60 m to 150 m velocity simulation is different from the adcp data mimicking the behavior of salinity and temperature simulation addition of smc fm in experiment 2 results in an excellent agreement between the bobble adcp data and mseas pe data until 10 july 2016 fig 14 a c however there are minor differences after 10 july 2016 these differences are mainly due to the mismatch in the direction of the zonal velocity between bobble adcp data and mseas pe model the contribution of zonal velocity to the overall speed is minimal fig 14 a where the velocity is predominantly southward making its simulation using primitive equations quite error prone e g subramani et al 2017 velocity time series of experiment 3 fig 14 d and 4 fig 14 e are similar to experiment 2 5 6 subsurface salinity advection to study the horizontal transport of salinity and to design accurate locations for the smc fm horizontal maps of salinity at 100 m depth for all experiments are presented in fig 15 for 07 10 and 14 july the date 07 july was chosen as it is start of the high salinity core expansion event at 89 e 8 n and 10 july is almost midway between 07 and 14 july in experiment 1 fig 15 a we notice that the high salinity core has not reached 89 e 8 n on 07 or 10 july in fact on 07 july the high salinity core is present at a location 0 3 degrees to the west of the time series location this observation initially prompted us to move the high salinity core signature in the nemo downscaled initial conditions by a few degrees and re start the simulation not shown here expecting to see the high salinity core expansion event in the mseas pe time series however this numerical shift of the nemo downscaled initial conditions did not serve its purpose leading us to conclude that the shift is not uniform and there must be a spatial variability associated with the smc captured in the nemo downscaled ic and the reality the different experiments of moving the high salinity core in the nemo analysis data also led us to hypothesize that accurate modeling of the smc s initial location and hydrography is necessary for improving model simulation in experiment 2 fig 15 b we see the advection of the high salinity water to the time series location second and third column of fig 15b george et al 2019 state that the surface 0 60 m advection was responsible for transporting the high salinity water to the time series location which led to the salinization event on 06 july 2016 from experiment 2 we see that a similar advection is responsible for the sub surface 60 150 m high salinity core expansion as well experiments 3 and 4 fig 15 c d are similar to experiment 2 5 7 comparison to argo data we also compared the data from all experiments with the argo floats available in the region during the duration of our experiment a total of 15 profiles at different locations and times figs 16 and 17 show the comparison of argo and experiment 4 s salinity and temperature we find that the mseas pe simulations match the argo measured temperature and salinity total rmse of 0 16 psu in salinity and 0 66 c in temperature showing that our model provides an excellent spatio temporal simulation of the ocean in the region of interest 6 conclusion we presented the first ever application of the feature oriented regional modelling system forms in the bay of bengal region using a data driven feature model we performed synoptic forecasting in hindcast mode from 04 july 2016 to 15 july 2016 in the region encompassing 3 n 12 n 82 5 e and 92 e our simulation duration corresponds to the time series observations collected during the bay of bengal boundary layer experiment bobble the simulations were done using the mseas pe modeling system on a 3 3 km horizontal grid and 70 optimized vertical levels the need for the forms approach was motivated by the fact that the available global model analysis data both hycom and nemo did not capture the critical properties observed in the bobble time series data we identified that among hycom and nemo nemo was closer to the bobble data and so we use it as a background to perform the objective analysis of our initial conditions the forms methodology involves developing a feature model sampling pseudo observations from it and performing an objective analysis with an appropriate background to construct initial conditions for synoptic forecasting a systematic approach was adopted to develop data driven feature models first the important synoptic features in the region viz the southwest monsoon current smc sri lanka dome sld anticyclonic eddy ae and subsurface baroclinic eddy were identified and mapped at their geographical locations through a thorough literature survey and by analyzing satellite and global model analysis data next nemo global model analysis data was analyzed and it was identified that all features except the smc main branch and the subsurface baroclinic eddy were well represented in the data after that a detailed feature model for the smc main branch and the subsurface baroclinic eddy was developed a tan hyperbolic function was used for the temperature feature model and a novel elliptical feature model was developed for the salinity of the smc main branch for the eddy fm also the same functions with appropriate data driven parameters were utilized pseudo observations are generated by sampling along and across the feature models at a high resolution and objectively analyzed with a background from nemo analysis data using a two stage methodology to generate the temperature and salinity initial conditions next velocity and free surface initial conditions are generated using the pe balance equations with these initial conditions and the best available atmospheric forcing mseas pe simulates the ocean states from 04 july 2016 0z to 15 july 2016 0z we showcased four experiments that progressively led to the final feature model summarized in table 3 with key results in the first experiment the nemo downscaled analysis was used as the initial condition here the high salinity core expansion event was not captured by mseas pe model to capture this event in the second experiment the smc fm was introduced even though this experiment captured the high salinity core expansion the initial core was not captured at 60 80 m depth we hypothesized that a subsurface baroclinic eddy was responsible for the high salinity core s initial advection to the time series location thus in the third experiment we introduced a feature model for the subsurface baroclinic eddy along with the smc fm this addition improved the salinity simulation at 70 m depth from 04 to 06 july 2016 giving credence to our hypothesis about this subsurface baroclinic eddy s presence further this addition also improved surface simulation due to an interplay between the smc and the eddy however the freshening event from 08 july 2016 was not adequately captured finally to adequately capture this freshening event a fourth experiment was conducted that assimilates bias corrected nemo profiles up to 20 m in addition to the smc fm and the eddy fm the addition of above feature models and bias correction helped improve the simulations in the following ways i the smc fm helped capture the evolution of the high salinity core ii the subsurface eddy fm helped provide the initial advective component to the high salinity core and iii initialization with bias corrected nemo surface profiles were necessary to provide for the observed surface freshening event the simulation from our novel data driven feature model based initial conditions gave an excellent match with the bobble datasets thus validating our model as seen in the present paper forms is an excellent data driven system for modeling regional oceans where features are mapped through in situ observation campaigns and or remote sensing data where such data is sparse or prior knowledge of features is unavailable e g relatively less explored parts of eastern or northern bay of bengal andaman sea etc a careful uncertainty quantification and stochastic forecasting with either ensembles or our dynamically orthogonal primitive equations subramani 2018 must be undertaken further new theory and numerical schemes to include inter annual feature models in forecasting systems from climatological datasets are required as a next step physics based studies using the mseas pe forms system could be conducted to provide a better understanding of the smc dynamics use and optimal planning of autonomous underwater vehicles for ocean monitoring and sampling to improve features models

23877,waves propagate in a free surface ocean due to compressibility and gravity and surface tension at much smaller scale analytical solutions have long been derived independently for acoustic and gravity waves i e acoustic waves or internal gravity waves in an unbounded ocean surface gravity waves in a free surface ocean and acoustic or internal modes in a bounded ocean in the present study surface tension and earth rotation are neglected and a simple unified model based on inner and boundary dispersion relations is derived for waves propagating in a compressible stratified free surface ocean branches of acoustic gravity wave solutions are identified and visually analysed in phase space taylor developments are then carried out with respect to small parameters describing stratification and compressibility and are compared with numerical approximations of the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces finally the model recovers the known approximations for swell long surface waves internal gravity waves internal modes acoustic waves or acoustic modes and also provides information on the modifications of these solutions due to stratification and compressibility and on the coupling of acoustic and gravity waves two peculiar regions of the acoustic gravity wave phase space are more specifically highlighted and studied in detail one for long waves shedding new light on the distinction between surface waves and low order internal modes the other for marginally stable surface waves of intermediate length scale keywords model of acoustic gravity waves in the ocean free surface compressible stratified ocean 1 introduction oceanographers have now access to high performance numerical codes to explore and forecast the dynamics of a free surface compressible non hydrostatic ocean in a les 1 1 for large eddy simulation context hilt et al 2020 marchesiello et al 2021 compressibility has not been reintroduced per se acoustic waves remain at least a priori a nuisance for classical meso scale configurations but rather to avoid the resolution of large 3d numerical systems required to simulate non hydrostatic dynamics under the boussinesq assumption auclair et al 2011 2018 the compressible ocean codes are local in the sens that the evolution of the dynamics at a point is only influenced by its neighborhood and they are thus by nature well adapted to massively parallel processing besides computing costs can be drastically reduced by adjusting artificially the velocity of sound waves such an approach has already been implemented in weather forecasting models for nearly two decades skamarock et al 2001 but several reasons can explain its late arrival in ocean modelling the large gap between the velocities of ocean currents and sound waves but also the numerical treatment of the free surface through time splitting algorithms in ocean models shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the difficulty to adapt these algorithms to non hydrostatic compressible modelling auclair et al 2018 a much wider spectrum of acoustic gravity waves ag waves can consequently be simulated numerically in realistic configurations of complex bathymetries stratifications forcing or ocean circulations raising fundamental questions not only about the dynamics itself of ag waves but also about their impact on low frequency ocean circulation simple process oriented ocean configurations are required to further explore the dispersion of ag waves and to evaluate the accuracy of their numerical representation in up to date ocean models to achieve this much can be learned from studying well controlled propagations in laboratory water flumes dossmann et al 2013 or auclair et al 2014 investigate for instance large internal waves induced above bathymetry simultaneously in laboratory and numerical configurations more fundamental analytical models remain nevertheless both necessary and essential the objective pursued in this case is not only to document the propagation of ag waves in complex realistic ocean configurations numerical models are designed to do so but also to treat fundamental simple process oriented configurations in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of ag waves and to provide simple solutions to evaluate the accuracy of numerical models the present study is an original step in these directions ocean ag waves cover a large variety of propagating mechanisms and textbooks leblond and mysak 1981 gill 1982 pedlosky 2013 have detailed the derivation of analytical solutions for decades these waves can be classified in several categories depending on the type of mechanisms directly involved in their propagation neglecting earth s rotation and associated planetary waves two fundamental categories are of particular interest in the present study acoustic sound waves which are a consequence of ocean compressibility and gravity waves which are sustained by the gravity force table 1 gives a short and necessarily incomplete list of such waves a particular type of waves is most often characterized by a space time dispersion relation linking its time frequency or period with its space wave number or wavelength the phase and group velocities and wave dispersion capacity can be derived from the dispersion relations if ocean waves are short enough and generated far enough from surface and bottom boundaries they can propagate in the ocean over a few wavelengths and during a few periods as in any unbounded medium however ocean waves can also take specific forms and propagate as wave modes over the ocean wave guide for example a stratified ocean is known to allow the propagation of internal gravity modes with long horizontal wavelengths compared to the ocean depth another example is given by the acoustic modes which are associated with compressibility effects jensen et al 2011 and which have been recently revisited smith 2015 such internal and acoustic waves are qualified as modes because their vertical wavelength is constrained by the vertical extent of the domain the ocean free surface is permanently shaken by a myriad of horizontally propagating waves and it is not always clear whether these waves are modes or just vertically evanescent waves propagating horizontally capillary waves swells tidal waves tsunamis are well known examples of such free surface waves deriving a dispersion relation for acoustic waves or for internal waves in an unbounded ocean is rather straightforward the method generally includes two steps small amplitude is assumed only specific wave restoring mechanisms and medium characteristics are retained in the simplest possible wave dispersion model compressibility and pressure force for acoustic waves gravity and vertical advection of isopycnal surfaces for internal waves lighthill 1967 the introduction of a free surface brings more complexity small amplitude is postulated in this case also and both gravity and free surface motions are retained in the dispersion model surface waves are edge waves propagating at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean and the surface kinematic relation the free surface general boundary condition leads to a transcendental dispersion relation with trigonometric terms as a result further simplifications are needed and specific analytical solutions can then be found in the literature depending for example on relative depth i e the product of horizontal wave number k x and ocean depth h table 1 long gravity waves are particular solutions of small aspect ratio k x h well known to propagate horizontally with g h phase and group velocities where g is the acceleration of gravity and h a reference depth interestingly enough such waves occur in at least two distinct contexts shallow water waves shw are propagating solutions of shallow water models their vertical wave length is then viewed as infinite much larger than their horizontal wave length long swells lsw are also propagating with the same phase and group velocities but in this case they retain some of the properties of swells and their horizontal and vertical wave lengths have similar magnitudes shw and lsw are often considered as similar since their wave velocity ω k x are equal however due to the underlying assumptions made in the models leading to these solutions lsw horizontal and vertical wave numbers have equal absolute values k z l s w k x whereas shw have a vanishing vertical wave number k z s h w 0 dukowicz 2013 tackled the description of ag waves and proposed a review of various approximations in atmosphere and ocean models based on an exact treatment of gravity wave dispersion in that paper acoustic gravity waves were shown to satisfy a system of two dispersion relations and the impact of several usual assumptions of ocean models was evaluated the present study builds on eckart 1960 and dukowicz 2013 s results and more specifically focuses on the impact of both stratification and compressibility on ag wave solutions in the ocean the objective is not to provide a full description of ag waves in any realistic configurations up to date numerical models being developed for this but rather to focus on a simple and classical configuration leading to a unified as general as possible analytical model taylor expansions of dispersion relations and resulting expressions for wavelength and frequency are more systematically derived in terms of compressibility and stratification surface waves are systematically studied together with internal and acoustic modes long wave solutions are investigated here in detail another original aspect of the present study is that acoustic modes are discussed in the frame of classical ocean acoustics jensen et al 2011 and additional poles singularities of the dispersion relations induced by stratification and gravity are found a peculiar region of phase space is also identified where surface acoustic gravity surface wave are marginally stable and gravity and compressibility are both important to the authors knowledge the existence of such a region has never been discussed in the literature a graphic analysis of wave solutions is proposed in 3d frequency wave number phase space unfolding their dependency on the vertical wave number in the section 2 a linear model of ocean wave propagation is proposed with bottom and surface boundary conditions and a system of two dispersion relations the inner and boundary dispersion relations is derived the inner dispersion relation and the wave

t and κ s are the heat and salt diffusivities these equations are written in a conservative form they specify basic conservation principles conservation of mass for eq 1a conservation of momentum for eq 1b and conservation of heat and salt for eqs 1c and 1d eq 1e is a functional relation describing the thermodynamic equation of state eos at the bottom z h and surface z ζ of the ocean boundary conditions must be specified for each variable or for its derivatives a simple condition of no penetration and no slip at the ocean flat bottom can be written 2 v x h z h t 0 in an inviscid flow this latest relation is that of no normal velocity neglecting surface tension pressure drop surface pressure is given by 3 p x h z ζ t p a t m with p a t m the atmospheric pressure imposed at the surface of the ocean surface capillarity waves are consequently filtered out and will be neglected in the remaining of this work relation 2 corresponds to jensen et al s hard bottom condition with no propagation nor penetration of acoustic waves in sediment and geologic layers beneath the ocean floor jensen et al 2011 the authors additionaly recover relation 3 by assuming that the atmosphere behaves as a vacuum medium for acoustic waves this means that acoustic waves propagating from the ocean toward the ocean floor or toward the atmosphere are integrally reflected back to the ocean the surface kinematic condition expresses the motion of the free surface and relates the free surface displacement ζ to the surface vertical velocity w 4 d ζ x h t dt w x h z ζ t this kinematic boundary condition allows the propagation of surface gravity waves 2 2 eos based on pressure and density decomposition waves are defined as small disturbances to a motionless thermodynamic equilibrium state and both pressure and density can be decomposed into an equilibrium component and a small increment in addition as a first approximation the impact of atmospheric pressure p a t m can be neglected it can take an active part in wave generation but only plays a minor role during propagation the usual decomposition is now formalized for pressure 5a and density 5b 5a p x t p a t m x h t 0 g z ζ ρ h x

decomposition p p h δ p is defined by an hydrostatic component p h and a nonhydrostatic pressure increment δ p it is based on a division of the pressure field into a slow varying component in hydrostatic equilibrium and a fast varying nonhydrostatic component density can then be obtained from the eos 1e and a first order taylor development is carried out for small total pressure its lagrangian evolution can be directly related to the lagrangian evolution of pressure under the assumption of heat and salt conservation d ρ t s d t 0 when both heat and salt diffusions can be

includes compressibility effects but not n 2 and that in 5b we made the further assumption that 8 ρ t s p h c s 2 ρ h ρ ˆ h ρ h this relation is indeed an approximation since the non hydrostatic component of density leading for instance to convective instabilities has been neglected at the right hand side relations 5a 5b 6 and 8 are central to the derivation of the present model of ag waves they also provide the basis for a rather complete analysis to identify and evaluate the approximations made in more realistic compressible non hydrostatic free surface numerical models of the ocean 2

polarization relations 16 ρ ˆ h u ρ ˆ h w ρ p u z w z ρ z p z e i k x x ω t where k x and ω are respectively the horizontal wave number and wave frequency inner propagation equation polarization the polarization relations 16 can then be substituted in the propagation model 14a 14d and in the bottom boundary conditions 15a to obtain a homogeneous system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns the vertical profiles u z ρ z and p z can eventually be expressed in terms of w z to obtain an ordinary differential equation for w z 17 w z 1 d z w z k x 2 n 2 ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 d z d 2 z w z 0 assuming for now

change of variables first order terms can be removed in the ordinary differential equation 17 and further developments can be simplified by making the following change of variable 23 w z w 0 f z e z 0 d z 2 d z with f 0 1 substituting this relation in 17 leads to a second order ordinary differential equation for the unknown function f z 24 f z k x 2 n 2 ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 1 2 d z 4 d z 2 f z 0 f z differs from the vertical momentum profile w z by the attenuation factor exp z 0 d z 2 d z this factor reduces the vertical extent of wave anomalies based on the length scale d z the weaker the stratification the larger d z and the closer to each other the vertical velocities w z and f z boundary dispersion relation in terms of the unknown function f z the surface and bottom boundary conditions 20 and 22 reads 25a f 0 1 2 d 0 g k x 2 ω 2 f 0 0 25b f h 0 constant brunt väisälä frequency in the remaining of the paper the brunt väisälä frequency is assumed to be constant n 2 z n 0 2 or equivalently d z d 0 eq 23 can then be rewritten 26 w z w 0 e z 2 d 0 f z and ρ ˆ h z is given by ρ ˆ h z ρ ˆ h 0 e z d 0 the general expression of the vertical velocity perturbation profile for a constant scale height d 0 is thus 27 w x z t 1 ρ ˆ h z w z e i k x x ω t w 0 ρ ˆ h 0 e z 2 d 0 f z e i k x x ω t leaving aside for now the surface boundary condition the vertical profile f z has to satisfy the following system of equations 28a f z k x 2 n 0 2 ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 1 4 d 0 2 k z 2 f z 0 28b f h 0 the general solution of 28a 28b with the normalization f 0 1 is 29 f z sin k z h z sin k z h where the vertical wave number k z is defined in 28a and is a function of k x and ω note that f z is linear for k z 0 this particular case will be considered separately in section 2 6 2 5 inner and boundary dispersion relations the relation introduced in 28a between the vertical wave number k z horizontal wave number k x and wave frequency ω constitutes the first dispersion relation it is rewritten as 30 k z 2 k x 2 1 n 0 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 1 4 d 0 2 0 this relation does not account for surface or bottom boundary conditions and thus only deals with the propagation of waves in the inner ocean it will now be referred to as the inner dispersion relation the bottom boundary condition is accounted for in the general solution profile given by 29 injecting this vertical profile f z into the surface boundary condition 28a then leads to the boundary dispersion relation 31 ω 2 g k x 2 tan h k z k z tan h k z 2 d 0 g k x 2 1 2 d 0 k z cotan h k z a wave propagating in a bounded ocean must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relations 30 and 31 note that the traditional inner and boundary dispersion relations for a boussinesq incompressible fluid gill 1982 table 1 can be recovered from 30 and 31 by setting c s incompressibility and then d 0 incompressibility and boussinesq approximations leading to 32 k z k z i m n π h and ω 2 ω i m 2 n 2 k x 2 k x 2 k z 2 g k x 2 tan h k z k z for n n dimensionless dispersion relations as in dukowicz 2013 several parameters are now defined to obtain dimensionless dispersion relations 33 ε i 2 n 2 h g ε a 2 g h c s 2 and ε 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 h ρ ˆ h z ρ ˆ h z ε i is thus a small parameter related to gravity defined as the ratio of the order of magnitude of the first internal mode n h velocity to the velocity of long surface waves g h ε a is a small parameter related to acoustics defined as the ratio of the speed of long surface waves g h to that of sound waves c s note that ε i is defined based on brunt väisälä frequency n 7 to which compressibility effects g 2 c s 2 term have been subtracted whereas ε refers to an equivalent stratification where the effects of compressibility are included in a homogeneous ocean ε i vanishes when n 0 the depth scale can then be rewritten as d 0 2 h ε 2 this scale depth does not include any compressibility induced correction as a consequence the ratio h d 0 2 ε 2 gives an idea of the relative strength of the ocean stratification three dimensionless variables are also further defined 34 ω ω h g δ x k x h δ z k z h the inner 30 and boundary 31 dispersion relations can be written in terms of the dimensionless parameters and variables as 35a δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 ε 4 35b ω 2 δ x 2 tan δ z δ z ε 2 tan δ z in a free surface ocean wave solutions must satisfy simultaneously relations 35a and 35b this means that only one parameter among the frequency ω and horizontal or vertical wave numbers δ x and δ z can be imposed for short vertical wave numbers and far from the bottom and surface boundaries wave solutions only need to satisfy the inner dispersion relation to be dynamically consistent pure acoustic waves or pure internal gravity waves are known to propagate in the inner ocean as in an unbounded ocean the resulting set of two eqs 35a 35b for the three variables δ x δ z ω and the two parameters ε a ε i is nonlinear and simple general solutions cannot be found analytically 2 6 acoustic lamb waves depth independent surface gravity waves acoustic lamb waves the polarization relations 18 have been derived after excluding the particular dispersion relation 36 ε a 2 ω 2 δ x 2 which is the dispersion relation for acoustic lamb waves for atmospheric lamb waves see for instance apel 1987 to be a solution of the linear inviscid non rotating wave model 14a 14d with bottom boundary condition 15a these waves must be of the form 37 w z p z u z ρ z p 0 0 1 1 c s 1 c s 2 e g z c s 2 surface pressure must then vanish to satisfy the surface boundary condition 15b which can only be obtained for the trivial null solution p 0 0 this does not mean that lamb waves cannot propagate in the real ocean but just that they are not solutions of the present ocean model section 2 3 due to the surface and bottom boundary conditions indeed to have non zero amplitude the pressure or alternatively the vertical velocity must vanish simultaneously at the surface and at the ocean floor a vanishing pressure both at the surface and at the ocean floor can for instance be found in jensen s formulation of pekeris wave guide jensen et al 2011 whereas a vanishing vertical velocity can alternatively be specified by assuming that the present linear inviscid non rotating wave model is also rigid lid 15b is then replaced by w z 0 0 in this case the wave polarization is given by 37 with p 0 the pressure at the surface of the ocean depth independent surface gravity wave a second interesting wave solution has been identified in section 2 4 for δ z δ z 0 0 indeed f z is then a linear function of z which simplifies to f z z h h to satisfy the bottom boundary condition 28b the surface boundary condition 35b and the inner dispersion relation 35a impose that 38 ω 2 ω 0 2 δ x 0 2 1 ε 2 δ x 2 δ x 0 2 1 ε 2 ε i 2 ε 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 1 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 ε i 2 o ε i 4 ε a 4 this wave can only propagate at a well defined long horizontal wave length δ x δ x 0 which vanishes in a homogeneous ocean ε i 0 it is also depth independent since if vertical wave number vanishes this depth independent surface gravity wave presents similarities with lamb waves 36 both solutions are found as particular cases while deriving the polarization relations for acoustic gravity waves and they are associated with a horizontally propagating convergent divergent motion of the water column a depth independent motion of this water column compensated by a displacement of the free surface this motion is induced by gravity for depth independent surface gravity waves and by compressibility for lamb waves 2 7 frequency is real vertical wave number is either real or imaginary based on 24 and on the boundary conditions 25a and 25b the vertical wave number δ z can be shown to be either real or imaginary and the frequency ω can be shown to be real no damping in time when ε a 0 or max ε i ε a 2 the proof of these properties is detailed in appendix a 1 it is important to note that ω is forced to be real by the boundary dispersion relation and that other solutions are possible when considering the inner dispersion relation only these solutions will not be discussed in the following even in section 3 on waves in an unbounded ocean this means that in physically realistic conditions i e max ε i ε a 2 waves are either propagating or evanescent but not both along the vertical axis and that they are stable in time real δ z waves are propagating vertically while imaginary δ z waves are evanescent vertically imaginary vertical wave numbers will be written 39 δ z i δ z i with δ z i r the inner and boundary dispersion relations 35a and 35b write in this case 40a δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 ε 4 40b ω 2 δ x 2 tanh δ z i δ z i ε 2 tanh δ z i when not explicitly mentioned the standard values of the parameters used in the rest of the paper are listed in table 2 the rest of the paper is organized as follows the inner dispersion relation corresponding to waves in an unbounded ocean is studied in section 3 additional constraints related to the boundary dispersion relation i e in a bounded ocean are added in section 4 3 inner dispersion relation waves in an unbounded ocean the inner dispersion relation 35a must be satisfied by any type of ocean waves whether or not the ocean is considered as a locally unbounded medium far from surface and bottom and for wavelengths small compared to ocean depth we will show in the present section that i in δ x δ z ω phase space the inner dispersion relation leads to a dispersion surface that can be decomposed in three distinct regions corresponding to acoustic surface and internal waves ii two acoustic and stratification reference functions ω a δ x δ z and ω i δ x δ z are good approximations of the acoustic and internal regions which in turn correspond to acoustic and internal waves propagating in an unbounded ocean iii the upper and lower regions of the inner dispersion surface for respectively high and low frequencies correspond to acoustic waves and internal waves propagating in an unbounded ocean and iv the bounded central region of the inner dispersion surface corresponds to vertically vanishing waves which are referred to as surface waves in section 4 3 1 acoustic and stratification reference frequencies reference acoustic stratification functions following tolstoy 1963 the inner dispersion relation 35a can be reformulated in the simpler form 41 ω 2 ω a 2 ω i 2 ω 2 1 where ω i and ω a are functions of horizontal and vertical wave numbers defined by 42a ω a 2 δ x δ z 1 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 42b ω i 2 δ x δ z δ x 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 these two reference functions are not roots of the inner dispersion equation 41 but they are useful in their approximation and more specifically in their physical interpretation if ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 high frequency then 41 simplifies to ω 2 ω a 2 relevant to a compressible homogeneous unstratified ocean if ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 low frequency then 41 simplifies to ω 2 ω i 2 relevant to an incompressible stratified ocean therefore ω a can be interpreted as a reference acoustic function accounting for the compressibility content of the inner dispersion relation and is a solution of the inner dispersion relation for an homogeneous ocean ω i plays an equivalent role for ocean stratification it can be interpreted as a reference stratification function and is solution of the inner dispersion relation for an incompressible ocean recall that for ε a 0 or m a x ε i ε a 2 the frequency ω is real and δ z is either real or purely imaginary appendix a 1 in addition ω a 2 and ω i 2 have the same sign since their product is equal to δ x 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 0 therefore 41 implies that ω a 2 0 ω i 2 0 and that 0 ω i 2 δ x δ z ω 2 δ x δ z ω a 2 δ x δ z δ x δ z as a consequence the frequency ω is always bounded by the reference functions ω i and ω a 3 2 roots of the inner dispersion relation ω let us now define r δ x δ z the ratio of stratification to acoustic reference functions 43 r 2 δ x δ z ω i 2 ω a 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 2 r δ x δ z is an important parameter for locating the roots of the inner dispersion relation as shown in appendix a 1 ω the roots of eq 41 can only be real a consequence is that r 2 1 4 these roots can then be formulated for the squared frequency 44 ω 2 ω a 2 2 1 1 4 ω i 2 ω a 2 ω a 2 2 1 1 4 r 2 when r 2 is small the two roots are close to the acoustic and stratification reference functions ω ω a ω ω i since their product ω 2 ω 2 is always equal to ω a 2 ω i 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 we further have 45 0 ω i 2 δ x δ z ω 2 δ x δ z ε i ε a δ x ω 2 δ x δ z ω a 2 δ x δ z note also that for a weakly compressible ocean ε a 1 46 ω 2 ω i 2 256 ε a 4 ε i 6 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 4 5 o ε i 6 and for a weakly stratified ocean ε i 1 a n d ε 1 47 ω 2 ω a 2 ε a 2 ε i 4 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε a 4 4 3 o ε a 6 3 3 three regions in δ x δ z ω phase space fig 1 shows variations of the squared vertical wave number δ z 2 as a function of δ x ω for the values of ε i ε a given in table 2 negative values are encountered for medium range frequencies 1 0 1 7 ω 1 0 0 7 and large enough horizontal wave numbers δ x 0 1 0 2 this region is surrounded by high and low frequency regions of positive δ z 2 the transition lines between these regions are given by δ z 0 if ω 1 and ε a 0 then ω 2 ω a 2 and the acoustic transition line is given by ε a 2 ω 2 δ x 2 ε 4 this line is a parabola and the frequency is not bounded when δ x increases if ω 1 and ε i 0 then ω 2 ω i 2 the equation of the gravity transition line is ω 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ε 4 this line has an upper bound ω c i ε i this parabola crosses the δ x 0 axis for the acoustic cut off frequency ω c a ε 2 ε a in dimensional form this bound can be rewritten ω n and is related to the well known cut off frequency for internal gravity waves for a real frequency ω fig 1 confirms that the vertical wave number can only be real or imaginary and that the inner dispersion relation 35a authorizes three types of wave solutions two with real vertical wave numbers δ z 2 0 and one with purely imaginary wave numbers δ z 2 0 in this latest region the corresponding wave solution is evanescent separation of solutions we prove in appendix a 2 that for a non trivial non vanishing wave solution in a stratified ocean r 2 δ x δ z can be equal to 1 4 only if δ z is imaginary in this case r 2 δ x δ z 1 4 leads to a 19 and a 20 48a δ z 2 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε 4 2 ε a ε i δ x 48b ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 ε i ε a δ x ω a 2 2 a consequence is that wave solutions are well separated when δ z is real and does not vanish or when δ z is imaginary and δ z i δ z i even if 40a has two roots in this case the two corresponding branches are always connected for δ z 2 ω 2 satisfying 48a 48b and thus form a single family of ocean waves 3 4 wave solutions in an unbounded ocean for a real vertical wave number δ z r 2 2 imaginary vertical wave numbers δ z i r are treated in section 4 4 for a bounded ocean the two roots are thus always well separated and given by 49 ω δ x δ z ω i δ x δ z ω δ x δ z ω a δ x δ z modified internal waves miw the

taylor expansion of the gravity wave root ω 2 given by 44 with respect to the small parameters ε a and ε i leads to 51 ω 2 ω i g r 2 1 ε 4 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 2 o ε 8 52 1 ε 4 δ

compressibility and stratification effects are expressed by ω 2 ω 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ω a w 2 ω i g r 2 which can explain the symmetry in the above developments for modified internal and acoustic waves 3 5 homogeneous and or incompressible unbounded ocean much insight can be gained on acoustic gravity waves by a geometrical investigation of surfaces in phase space that correspond to the inner and boundary dispersion relations these surfaces will respectively be named inner and boundary dispersion surfaces fig 2 shows the inner dispersion surfaces in the δ x δ z ω space each dispersion surface corresponds to a region of the wave solutions these surfaces are plotted for a homogeneous and incompressible 2 a a homogeneous and compressible 2 b an incompressible and stratified 2 c and a compressible and stratified unbounded ocean the y axis is constructed such that the δ z 0 positive half space corresponds to the real vertical wave numbers whereas the δ z 0 negative half space corresponds to the imaginary part of pure imaginary vertical wave numbers δ z i careful inspection of the δ z 0 half space in figs 2 b 2 c and 2 d confirms the presence of two regions of solutions with real positive vertical wave numbers for large frequencies red branch the upper region corresponds to acoustic wave solutions maw figs 2 b and 2 d this region disappears under the assumption of incompressibility figs 2 a and 2 c the lower region light green branch corresponds to internal wave solutions miw figs 2 c and 2 d and disappears under the assumption of homogeneous ocean figs 2 a and 2 b the third region of wave solution light blue surfaces in fig 2 corresponds to pure imaginary vertical wave numbers in a stratified compressible unbounded ocean fig 2 d this region corresponds to intermediate values of the in a homogeneous incompressible and unbounded ocean fig 2 a shows that the unique dispersion surface is the δ x 2 δ z 2 plane 3 6 summary waves solutions in an unbounded ocean in the preceding analysis three types of waves were identified a synthesis is given by fig 2 d showing the inner dispersion surfaces for a stratified compressible ocean and fig 2 a c showing the limit cases for respectively a homogeneous and incompressible a homogeneous and compressible and a stratified but incompressible ocean approximate frequency values for modified internal and acoustic waves are summarized in tables 3 and 4 in dimensional form for comparison with introductory table 1 since the practical existence and characterization of modified surface waves is totally dependent on boundary conditions they are not summarized here but will be detailed in the next section in a more realistic bounded ocean their existence is guaranteed only if their vertical scale is much smaller than the ocean depth δ z 1 and if they do not interfere with the bottom or the surface of the ocean the next section will investigate the impact of adding the boundary dispersion relation 35b 4 waves in a bounded ocean acoustic gravity waves propagating in a bounded ocean i e considering both the free surface and the bottom boundary of the ocean are studied in the present section these wave solutions are first shown to be organised in branches i e in 1d curves parameterized by δ x 2 δ z ω 2 δ z each branch is located at the intersection of the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces and is confined to a region of phase space located between two poles of the dispersion relations modified internal and acoustic modes and then modified surface waves are studied before acoustic gravity waves in the long wave approximation are investigated 4 1 graphical investigation of modified surface waves msw modified acoustic modes mam and modified internal modes mim the compressible and stratified ocean is now assumed to be bounded wave solutions must thus satisfy both the inner 35a and boundary 35b dispersion relations in phase space they must lie at the intersections of the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces which are now plotted simultaneously on fig 3 for real vertical wave numbers k z r fig 3a the boundary dispersion surface is a piecewise surface several regions that are nearly vertical in δ x δ z log 10 ω space at δ z n π small ω and at δ z π 2 m 1 π large ω with n n and m n the intersection of these surfaces with inner dispersion relation surfaces result in a number of constrained vertical wave numbers according to n and m we will show in the following sections that the resulting wave solutions are modes and the two intersections correspond more specifically to modified internal modes mim n n and to modified acoustic modes mam m n for purely imaginary wave numbers the light blue inner dispersion surface looks like an horizontal hyperbolic surface which intersects the light gray boundary dispersion surface the resulting wave solutions correspond to modified surface waves msw far from the origin δ x δ z 0 0 at the intersection points δ z is close to δ x for long waves δ x 1 δ z 1 the boundary dispersion surfaces for real and purely imaginary δ z are in the same plane indeed the development of the boundary relation is well approximated by ω 2 δ x 2 in both cases a better approximation is given in eq 67 fig 3b shows the different solutions close to the origin δ x δ z ω 0 0 0 the acoustic wave surface does not intersect the boundary dispersion surface near the origin as proven in section 4 5 and is not present close to the origin in the context of a bounded ocean three types of wave solutions are thus graphically identified spreading on the three regions of the inner dispersion surface while satisfying the boundary dispersion relation internal gravity in a stratified ocean acoustic in a compressible ocean and surface waves in a free surface ocean they are investigated in the following using taylor expansions of the general roots ω with respect to small parameters ε i ε a leading to simple approximations of wave dispersion relations when needed asymptotic relations are derived with respect to δ x δ z or ω taylor expansions will give indications of how usual wave solutions can be modified by gravity and stratification ε i and or by compressibility ε a 4 2 poles of the dispersion relations the dispersion relations for acoustic gravity waves in a bounded ocean exhibit several discrete poles or singularities for the vertical wave number that lead to the existence of normal modes to show this we can combine the dispersion relations 35a and 35b to express the square of the horizontal wave number and the frequency as functions of the vertical wave number 56a δ x 2 δ z ε 2 sin δ z δ z cos δ z δ z 2 ε i 4 ε i 4 4 sin δ z δ z ε i 2 cos δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 sin δ z 2 δ z cos δ z sin δ z 56b ω x 2 δ z δ z 2 ε a 4 ε i 4 4 sin δ z δ z ε i 2 cos δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 sin δ z 2 δ z cos δ z the first relation 56a has two poles or singularities δ z δ z n n π with n n is indeed an approximate root of sin δ z 0 and thus a pole of δ x 2 δ z and δ z δ z m r m π 2 m π is a root of δ z tan δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 1 and thus a pole of δ x 2 δ z the second dispersion relation 56b only has one pole δ z δ z m r m π 2 m π a more accurate expression of δ z m can be obtained as an infinite series 57 δ z m r m ε a 2 ε i 2 r m ε a 2 ε i 2 2 3 ε i 2 ε a 2 3 r m 3 ε a 2 ε i 2 3 3 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 20 ε a 2 ε i 2 30 15 r m 5 o 1 r m 7 note that ω 2 δ z is continuous in δ z δ z n this set of poles confirms and extends the poles found by jensen et al 2011 for a compressible homogeneous rigid lid ideal ocean waveguide these poles are associated to the ag modes discussed in section 2 to show this one can follow jensen et al 2011 and rewrite the wave field emitted by a point source at frequency ω alternatively as a line integral or as an infinite series in fourier space the poles are then the singularities of the line integral whereas the series is the infinite sum of discrete modes the equivalence of both expressions is given by cauchy s residue theorem mei et al 2005 we further show in a 3 that the first type δ z m corresponds to the modified acoustic modes mam identified graphically in section 4 1 and plotted with a red curve in fig 3 the second type δ z n is also shown to correspond to the modified internal modes mim also identified graphically in section 4 1 but plotted in green fig 4 shows that wave solutions are organized in branches confined to the intervals δ z 2 δ z m 1 2 δ z δ z m n δ z n and δ z δ z n δ z m n 1 for n n the δ x 2 δ z 2 0 vertical plane coloured in light gray is the region where the induced effects of compressibility and stratification exactly compensate indeed 35a implies in this case that ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε 0 a study of the variations of δ x 2 δ z and ω 2 δ z shows that these functions are monotonically decreasing at respectively the third and first order in ε a ε i see appendix a 7 when δ z δ z m δ x 2 δ z and ω 2 δ z when δ z δ z n δ x 2 δ z but ω 2 δ z ε i 2 since δ z n is not a pole of ω δ z in the interval δ z m 0 the long wave branch extends to negative values of δ z 2 for an imaginary vertical wave number blue curve in fig 4 each branch of the acoustic gravity wave solutions consequently extends both in the δ x 2 0 half space of propagating waves green red and blue curves in fig 4 and in the δ x 2 0 half space of vanishing waves gray and black curves this study of the variations of δ x 2 δ z further shows that for waves propagating both horizontally and vertically δ x 2 δ z 2 0 δ z remains close to either δ z m or δ z n in each interval of solutions except for the very long wave branch fig 4 c and 0 δ z 2 δ z m 0 π 2 indeed in the case of not too long propagating waves δ x 2 δ z 2 is positive and at least larger than δ z m 0 2 meaning that whatever δ x either ε a 2 ω 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z or ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z are significantly large this is possible only if respectively δ z δ z m section 4 3 2 or δ z δ z n section 4 3 1 graphically fig 4 a b and d confirm that δ z varies sharply only in regions where δ x 2 δ z 2 0 i e in regions where the acoustic gravity wave solutions are close to the gray vertical surface δ x 2 δ z 2 0 the study of the poles finally confirms the separation of the branches of the acoustic gravity wave solutions in agreement with the results proved in appendix a 2 firstly a clear separation has now been brought to light in terms of their vertical wave numbers since the branches are confined to the interval regions locates between the poles δ z δ z m n δ z n and δ z δ z n δ z m m 1 for n n secondly in so far as the not too long wave solutions satisfy either δ z δ z m or δ z δ z n the relation 56b further confirms that the solutions are also well separated in terms of their frequency indeed we have shown that δ x 2 0 imposes in this case that δ z is close to either δ z m or δ z n since i δ z m is a pole of ω 2 and thus ω 2 δ z δ z m a n d δ z m δ z is large and ii ω 2 δ z monotonic decreasing and ω 2 δ z n ε i 2 we can conclude and confirm that ω 2 δ z δ z m ε i 2 ω 2 δ z δ z n a n d δ z n δ z 4 3 real δ z modified internal and acoustic waves as shown in section 3 3 and section 4 2 upper acoustic and lower gravity regions of the inner dispersion surface for real δ z are well separated modified acoustic modes mam and modified internal modes mim solutions can thus be studied independently we additionally showed that as long as δ z is not close to zero the acoustic gravity wave solutions remain close to one of the poles the case of long waves with δ z 0 is discussed in subsection section 4 5 4 3 1 development of internal gravity modes modified by compressibility mim waves can propagate horizontally between the bottom and surface of the ocean as in a wave guide internal gravity modes are well known such examples gill 1982 in section 4 1 graphical inspections of wave solutions confirmed that gravity waves with constrained vertical wave numbers could be found at the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces we have also shown in section 3 3 that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to internal gravity waves is well approximated by ω i 2 46 and in section 4 2 and appendix a 3 that δ z remains close to δ z n in order to refine the approximation and to parameterize this relation in terms of the horizontal wave number we equate the squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation 35b to ω 2 given by the inner dispersion relation 44 this forms a non linear equation for δ z whose solution can be approximated using two passes of a newton algorithm starting from δ z δ z n finally a taylor development in ε i ε a leads to 58 δ z δ x δ z m i m δ x δ z n 1 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 3 ε i 4 o ε 6 a development for the frequency ω 2 can be obtained by injecting expression 58 of δ z in the general expression 51 in the unbounded domain case the usual dispersion relation given in table 1 can be written in dimensional form 59 ω 2 δ x ω i g r 2 δ z δ z n δ x ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 considering only the first order correction to this relation we can omit all terms of order 3 in ε 2 in 51 to get 60 ω 2 δ x ω m i m 2 δ x ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 ω i m 2 1 2 ε i 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 2 o ε 6 therefore the main correction to the usual dispersion relation comes from the fact that δ z is not exactly equal to but remains close to δ z n n π mim correspond to the green curve in fig 3 a 4 3 2 development of acoustic modes modified by gravity mam to study modified acoustic modes at higher frequencies we now use the fact that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to acoustic waves is well approximated by ω a 2 47 and that δ z remains close to δ z m section 4 2 and a 3 again in order to get a more accurate expression of δ z parameterize by the horizontal wave number δ x we equate the inversed squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation 35b to the inversed ω 2 given by the inner dispersion relation 44 and perform the nonlinear equation s solution approximation followed by a taylor development in ε i ε a to obtain 61 δ z δ x δ z m a m δ x δ z m δ x 2 δ z m 2 2 δ z m δ x 2 δ z m 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 δ z m 2 δ x 6 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 3 δ x 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 δ z m 2 2 δ x 2 5 ε a 2 3 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z m 4 2 ε 4 δ z m 6 4 δ x 2 δ z m 2 3 δ z m 3 o ε 4 o ε 6 an expansion for the frequency ω 2 can be obtained by injecting the expression 61 of δ z in the general expression 54 in the unbounded domain case the main departure from to the usual acoustic wave frequency given in table 1 in dimensional form is given by the second order development 62 ω 2 δ x ω m a m 2 δ x 1 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 o ε 2 here stratification has a first order in ε i 2 contribution to the modification of the homogeneous case frequency this first order modification comes from the first order modification on the vertical wave number itself 61 however it is clear that the associated impact is small since ε i 2 is negligible compared with δ z m 2 in 61 and 62 because δ z m π 2 a similar conclusion was drawn in smith 2015 mam correspond to the red curves in 3 a 4 4 purely imaginary δ z modified surface acoustic gravity waves msw surface waves generally refer to waves propagating horizontally as anomalies of the ocean free surface gill 1982 in the vertical direction these surface wave anomalies are evanescent meaning that with the notation chosen in the present study the vertical wave number δ z is a purely imaginary complex number a modified surface wave msw defined by its triplet δ x δ z ω must satisfy both the inner 40a and boundary 40b dispersion relations for δ z i δ z i homogeneous incompressible ocean in an homogeneous and incompressible ocean ε i ε a 0 fig 2 the inner dispersion relation 40a implies δ z i δ x this equality is often postulated in textbooks to reduce the number of variables vertical polarization relations are then functions of δ x only gill 1982 and as a consequence the only remaining dispersion relation is the boundary dispersion relation 40b for purely imaginary vertical wave number δ z i δ x or its approximation ω 2 δ x tanh δ x in this case δ z i is reduced to a vertical length scale of energy decay with increasing distance from the surface for very long waves δ x 1 the surface wave lsw is approximately depth independent table 1 dispersion relation in the more general case non homogeneous and compressible ocean we prove in appendix a 4 the existence of solutions to 40a 40b when the parameters ε i and ε a are small we additionally prove in appendix a 5 that surface acoustic gravity waves have approximately similar horizontal and vertical wave numbers δ x δ z i this crude assumption δ x δ z i is sufficiently accurate to recover usual swell like approximations table 1 i e for sufficiently large δ x or δ z however a more accurate expression is given by 63 δ z i 2 δ x δ x 2 δ x ε i 2 tanh δ x ε a 2 tanh δ x o ε 4 in order to obtain 63 we introduce the frequency given by the boundary dispersion relation in the inner dispersion relation 40a and solve the resulting nonlinear equation by performing one pass of a newton algorithm note that the problem is formulated in terms of δ z i 2 δ x since it can be shown by looking at the error estimate of the newton algorithm that a formulation in terms of δ z i δ x is not accurate when δ x is relatively small note also that 63 requires δ x ε i for δ z i 2 to be positive this is consistent with the fact that δ x must be greater than δ x 0 ε i defined in 38 as shown in appendix a 4 however 63 does not allow us to recover the exact value δ x 0 of δ x that cancels δ z i due to the first order only approximation in terms of ε 2 the case of long surface waves with δ z i close to zero will be treated separately in section 4 5 the frequency ω 2 δ x associated to the vertical wave number δ z i 2 δ x given by 63 is well approximated by 64 ω 2 δ x δ x tanh δ x 1 1 2 ε i 2 sinh 2 δ x ε a 2 cosh 2 δ x ε i 2 δ x sinh δ x cosh δ x o ε 4 for very short waves δ x 1 these relations simplify to δ z i δ x ε 2 ω 2 δ x and we recover the frequency of short non hydrostatic waves ω 2 δ x or ω g k x in dimensional form with a slightly modified vertical wave number msw correspond to the blue curve in 3 a marginally stable surface gravity waves we proved in section 3 3 that the ratio r 2 δ x δ z is maximum and equal to 1 4 only when δ z is imaginary the relations 48a and 48b are simultaneously satisfied gray curve in fig 2 d any triplet δ x δ z ω satisfying these two relations is an acceptable wave solution only if it also satisfies the boundary dispersion relation 40b as a consequence δ x ω and δ z i ω can be obtained combining 48b and 40b both relations are recalled below then 48a leads to the non linear equation for ω given by 65a 48b δ x ε a ε i ω 2 40b ω 2 δ x 2

154 this wave solution red point in fig 5 is marginally stable ω ω and r 2 δ x δ z 1 4 further investigations of this peculiar region of surface wave phase space must in particular take into account the consequences of earth rotation and wave non linearity 4 5 long waves we now prove the existence of two sub branches of long wave solutions mode 0 modified internal modes mim 0 with horizontal wave numbers in the range δ x 0 δ x 0 and long modified surface waves lmsw in the range δ x δ x 0 dispersion relations for long waves here we perform specific developments for long waves where the vertical profile is almost depth independent δ z 0 δ z being either real or purely imaginary fig 3b this corresponds to the long wave part of the acoustic gravity branch located in the region δ z 2 δ z m 1 2 of fig 4a inserting the boundary dispersion relation 35b into the inner dispersion relation 35a and making a second order taylor expansion in δ z leads to 66 δ z 2 δ x δ z l o n g 2 δ x δ x 0 2 δ x 2

is equal to ε i the corresponding frequency can be obtained by inserting the approximation of the vertical wave number given by 66 into the boundary relation dispersion 35b an approximation at second order in δ x 2 and ε 2 is 67 ω 2 δ x ω l o n g 2 δ x δ x 2 1 1 6 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 3 ε a 2 ε 2 1 45 ε i 4 o ε 6 o δ x 4 we also define 68 δ z 0 2 δ x 0 δ x 0 2 1 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 ε i 2 3 1 ε i 2 3 δ x 2 ε a 2 3 o δ z 4 fig 6 shows the evolution of δ z 2 δ z and ω as functions of δ x for long waves 6a b and d and for short and intermediate waves 6c δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 ε i the vertical wave number δ z given by 66 is real this implies that ω 2 δ x 2 ε i δ x ε i ε a δ x since ε a 1 and thus using the bounds on ω 2 ω 2 given by 45 that these waves are always issued from the internal wave region of the inner dispersion surface ω 2 not from the acoustic wave region ω 2 in other words there is no intersection between the boundary dispersion relation and the real acoustic wave region for δ z r close to zero for the chosen boundary conditions this is consistent with the fact that acoustic lamb waves can only be solutions for different surface or bottom boundary conditions in section 2 6 dukowicz 2013 notes that this wave solution like any higher internal modes has its frequency ω 2 approximately bounded by ε i 2 i e ω n since ω 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 we however avoid to refer to this n 0 internal mode mim 0 as a barotropic wave indeed if ε i ε a 0 i e if stratification and compressibility vanish in this sub branch disappears since δ z r mim 0 propagates in the vertical direction but its vertical wave number remains small even in strongly stratified regions large values of ε i see table 6 δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 but still small δ z given by 66 is purely imaginary these long waves originate from the surface wave branch msw and will here be named lmsw when δ x increases δ z l o n g 66 converges to δ z l m s w 63 which is a better approximation for medium and short surface waves fig 6 a shows δ z 2 as a function of δ x for δ x 2 ε i the two approximations given by 66 accurate for long waves and 63 accurate for medium short waves are plotted on fig 6 b the modulus of the vertical wave number is shown on the same interval for δ x for δ x 2 ε i fig 6 c and d present the frequency ω as a function of the horizontal wave number δ x according to different approximations for small intermediate and long horizontal wave numbers ω l o n g and ω m s w are computed by inserting the corresponding approximations 66 and 63 of δ z in the boundary dispersion relation 35b ω δ x resp ω δ x represents the classical long shallow water waves resp short non hydrostatic surface waves approximation ω ω s w δ x tanh δ x is the frequency of an homogeneous and incompressible non hydrostatic ocean unsurprisingly this last approximation is accurate over the full range of horizontal wave numbers even for the set of compressible stratified equations indeed even if for long waves δ z is not directly linked to δ x in particular δ z does not vanish for δ x 0 δ z remains small less than ε i and thus δ z tan δ z is close to 1 interestingly and contrary to conclusions in dukowicz 2013 the mim 0 frequency cannot saturate at the buoyancy frequency for increasing horizontal wave number δ x but transforms into a vertically evanescent surface wave whereas its vertical wave number switches from real to purely imaginary hydrostaticity and asymptotic behaviour surface edge waves are consequently either mim 0 modes δ z r and δ x δ x 0 or modified surface waves msw δ z i r and δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 a depth independent gravity surface wave studied in section 2 6 separates these two sub branches in the long wave approximation the long wave solution 63 is an accurate approximation of both mim 0 and lmsw we now further prove that in the long wave low frequency limit for δ x δ x 0 the mim 0 is quasi hydrostatic and converges towards the g h phase velocity shallow wave solution shw when stratification loosens i e when ε i 0 for δ x δ x 0 the lmsw solution remains non hydrostatic and converges towards the other g h phase velocity long swell solution lsw when stratification loosens i e when ε i 0 the shw and lsw asymptotic solutions are recalled in table 1 and discussed in section 2 6 using the approximate solution for long waves 66 and for lmsw 63 we can compute their respective aspect ratio 69a r l o n g 2 δ x δ x 2 δ z l o n g 2 δ x 2 1 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 ε i 2 3 1 ε i 2 3 δ x 2 ε a 2 3 o δ z 4 69b r m s w 2 δ x δ x 2 δ z m s w 2 δ x ε a 2 tanh 2 δ x δ x tanh δ x ε i 2 fig 7 shows the evolutions of these aspect ratios as functions of the horizontal wave number a study of the variations of r l o n g shows that this ratio increases monotonically from 0 to infinity when δ x varies from 0 to δ x 0 and decreases monotonically from infinity to 1 when δ x varies from δ x 0 to infinity in this latter range r m s w remains close to r l o n g except in the vicinity of δ x 0 the aspect ratio r l o n g remains lower than 1 and it decreases monotonically to 0 when δ x approaches 0 in this very long wave range the mim 0 solution is thus hydrostatic and the dispersion relations 66 and 64 are approximately given by 70 δ z 2 δ z 0 2 ε i 2 ω 2 δ x 2 this solution is also the long wave approximation of the hydrostatic wave solution appendix b the second branch is a monotonic function for δ x δ x 0 and it decreases to 1 when δ x as a consequence it remains superior to 1 in this range of wave numbers the corresponding wave solution is non hydrostatic and the dispersion relations 66 and 64 are approximately given by 71 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 ω 2 δ x 2 this solution is also the long wave approximation of the non hydrostatic wave solution appendix b 4 6 summary waves solutions in a bounded ocean unlike in an unbounded ocean acoustic gravity wave solutions in a bounded free surface ocean must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relations this induces the appearance of poles in these dispersion relations for δ z π 2 m 1 π mam and for δ z n π mim with m n n x n for δ z i r the boundary dispersion relation does not exhibit any pole a stratified ocean can propagate two types of surface edge waves for medium and short wave lengths δ x δ x 0 msw are non hydrostatic r l m s w 1 evanescent δ z s w i r and converge towards the g h phase velocity depth dependent δ x δ z i wave solution lsw when both ε i 0 and δ x δ x 0 vertical variations of pressure are non hydrostatic and in a homogeneous ocean lmsw solutions remain depth dependent δ x δ z i 0 for longer waves δ x δ x 0 mim 0 are quasi hydrostatic r m i m 0 1 if δ x is not in the neighbourhood of δ x 0 vertically propagating δ z r and converges towards the shallow water g h phase velocity solution shw when both ε i 0 and δ x 0 in this case vertical variations of pressure are hydrostatic and lmiw solutions are depth independent δ z 0 when the stratification loosens ε i 0 the range of validity of mim 0 solution 0 δ x δ x 0 ε i shrinks to zero the frequency of acoustic wave solutions modified by gravity remains larger than ω c a ε 2 ε a whereas the frequency of gravity waves modified by compressibility remains smaller than ω c i ε i section 3 3 table 5 summarizes the main approximations for the different type of waves acoustic gravity and surface waves modes given in this paper these approximations are indicated in their dimensional form for sake of readability some of the relations given in table 5 are lower order versions of our derivations they generally stem from first order correction terms compared with usual dispersion relations introduced in table 1 in that case a red link to the higher approximation is given table 6 gives orders of magnitude of various characteristics of these acoustic gravity waves for the reference set of ε a ε i parameters table 2 and for a shallow or a strongly stratified ocean for the 4000 m deep reference ocean the horizontal length scale associated with the transformation of the msw into the long mim λ x l m s w 2 π δ x l m s w 4000 reaches 1367 km against 62 km for the same 10 m deep ocean when δ x decreases below δ x l m s w δ z increases monotonically to a maximum value δ z l m s w δ x 0 this vertical length scale reaches 1379 km for the 4000 m deep reference ocean and 62 km for the same 10 m deep ocean a rule can be formulated as the longer the horizontal length scale of the oscillation the shorter its vertical length scale and the weaker the stratification vanishing ε i the longer its horizontal length scale λ x l m s w this long mim solution is a low frequency oscillation of the ocean due to gravity and associated with ocean stratification it disappears when stratification vanishes and the ocean becomes an homogeneous layer of water it does persist in an incompressible ocean but is slightly modified by compressibility 5 discussion conclusion an eulerian analytical model for acoustic gravity waves propagating in a compressible stratified free surface non rotating ocean has been derived and investigated with several objectives recover acoustic waves and modes in a unified dispersion model describe analytically the modifications of the characteristics of these waves and modes for small changes in compressibility or stratification and finally anticipate the impact of compressibility in the new generation of non hydrostatic compressible ocean models auclair et al 2018 an original investigation at least to the authors knowledge based on 3d graphics in δ x δ z ω phase space has been carried out to support and illustrate the analytical developments well known acoustic and internal modes mam and mim have in particular been recovered and have been associated to the infinite number of discrete poles of the inner and boundary dispersion relations a least two peculiar regions of the phase space have been investigated in more detail firstly the long acoustic gravity wave branch has indeed been decomposed in two sub branches one associated to a modified mode 0 internal mode mim 0 with a real vertical wave number the other to a modified long surface gravity wave lmsw with imaginary vertical wave number secondly modified surface gravity waves msw have been shown to be marginally stable for intermediate wave numbers in a region of phase space where compressibility and stratification induced effects approximately compensate analytical solutions are given in dimensional form in appendix c such solutions can conveniently be used to validate non

not close to 0 the right hand side of a 21 is always small and thus δ z tan δ z has to be large i e the vertical wavenumber δ z is close to δ z n n π with n a non zero integer this agrees with the internal gravity wave solution found graphically in section 4 2 mam solutions we can now use the fact that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to acoustic waves is well

is an increasing function of δ x 4 4 this simple demonstration requires the assumption ε a 2 2 ε i 2 i e the same used in appendix to prove that the imaginary part of δ z 2 is zero let δ x 0 be the value of δ x defined by f δ x 0 δ z 0 0 δ x 0 will be given in 66 and is close to ε i in particular we have f δ x 0 f δ x 0 0 0 for δ x δ x 0 we can also verify that for a given δ x such that δ x δ x

dispersion relation implies ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 we finally get ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ z i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 1 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 using the smallness of the parameters ε a and ε i we can then conclude that δ z i 2 is indeed close to δ x 2 a 6 mim 0 long wave sub branch wave solutions of mim 0 type must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relation 35a and 35b with δ z r we have also shown that mim 0 is part of the internal branch and as a consequence approximately satisfies 42b substituting then 35b into 42b leads to a relation between

not propagate horizontally and we will assume in the following that δ x 0 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 1 0 in section 4 2 δ z m 0 has been defined as a root of ε 2 δ z cotan δ z and when δ z δ z m 0 δ x 2 δ z this means that there must exist δ z 0 0 δ z m 0 such that δ x m i m 0 δ z 0 0 and δ z 0 satisfies a 24 δ z 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z 0 we can additionally show that δ x m i m 0 δ z is monotonic

23877,waves propagate in a free surface ocean due to compressibility and gravity and surface tension at much smaller scale analytical solutions have long been derived independently for acoustic and gravity waves i e acoustic waves or internal gravity waves in an unbounded ocean surface gravity waves in a free surface ocean and acoustic or internal modes in a bounded ocean in the present study surface tension and earth rotation are neglected and a simple unified model based on inner and boundary dispersion relations is derived for waves propagating in a compressible stratified free surface ocean branches of acoustic gravity wave solutions are identified and visually analysed in phase space taylor developments are then carried out with respect to small parameters describing stratification and compressibility and are compared with numerical approximations of the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces finally the model recovers the known approximations for swell long surface waves internal gravity waves internal modes acoustic waves or acoustic modes and also provides information on the modifications of these solutions due to stratification and compressibility and on the coupling of acoustic and gravity waves two peculiar regions of the acoustic gravity wave phase space are more specifically highlighted and studied in detail one for long waves shedding new light on the distinction between surface waves and low order internal modes the other for marginally stable surface waves of intermediate length scale keywords model of acoustic gravity waves in the ocean free surface compressible stratified ocean 1 introduction oceanographers have now access to high performance numerical codes to explore and forecast the dynamics of a free surface compressible non hydrostatic ocean in a les 1 1 for large eddy simulation context hilt et al 2020 marchesiello et al 2021 compressibility has not been reintroduced per se acoustic waves remain at least a priori a nuisance for classical meso scale configurations but rather to avoid the resolution of large 3d numerical systems required to simulate non hydrostatic dynamics under the boussinesq assumption auclair et al 2011 2018 the compressible ocean codes are local in the sens that the evolution of the dynamics at a point is only influenced by its neighborhood and they are thus by nature well adapted to massively parallel processing besides computing costs can be drastically reduced by adjusting artificially the velocity of sound waves such an approach has already been implemented in weather forecasting models for nearly two decades skamarock et al 2001 but several reasons can explain its late arrival in ocean modelling the large gap between the velocities of ocean currents and sound waves but also the numerical treatment of the free surface through time splitting algorithms in ocean models shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 and the difficulty to adapt these algorithms to non hydrostatic compressible modelling auclair et al 2018 a much wider spectrum of acoustic gravity waves ag waves can consequently be simulated numerically in realistic configurations of complex bathymetries stratifications forcing or ocean circulations raising fundamental questions not only about the dynamics itself of ag waves but also about their impact on low frequency ocean circulation simple process oriented ocean configurations are required to further explore the dispersion of ag waves and to evaluate the accuracy of their numerical representation in up to date ocean models to achieve this much can be learned from studying well controlled propagations in laboratory water flumes dossmann et al 2013 or auclair et al 2014 investigate for instance large internal waves induced above bathymetry simultaneously in laboratory and numerical configurations more fundamental analytical models remain nevertheless both necessary and essential the objective pursued in this case is not only to document the propagation of ag waves in complex realistic ocean configurations numerical models are designed to do so but also to treat fundamental simple process oriented configurations in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of ag waves and to provide simple solutions to evaluate the accuracy of numerical models the present study is an original step in these directions ocean ag waves cover a large variety of propagating mechanisms and textbooks leblond and mysak 1981 gill 1982 pedlosky 2013 have detailed the derivation of analytical solutions for decades these waves can be classified in several categories depending on the type of mechanisms directly involved in their propagation neglecting earth s rotation and associated planetary waves two fundamental categories are of particular interest in the present study acoustic sound waves which are a consequence of ocean compressibility and gravity waves which are sustained by the gravity force table 1 gives a short and necessarily incomplete list of such waves a particular type of waves is most often characterized by a space time dispersion relation linking its time frequency or period with its space wave number or wavelength the phase and group velocities and wave dispersion capacity can be derived from the dispersion relations if ocean waves are short enough and generated far enough from surface and bottom boundaries they can propagate in the ocean over a few wavelengths and during a few periods as in any unbounded medium however ocean waves can also take specific forms and propagate as wave modes over the ocean wave guide for example a stratified ocean is known to allow the propagation of internal gravity modes with long horizontal wavelengths compared to the ocean depth another example is given by the acoustic modes which are associated with compressibility effects jensen et al 2011 and which have been recently revisited smith 2015 such internal and acoustic waves are qualified as modes because their vertical wavelength is constrained by the vertical extent of the domain the ocean free surface is permanently shaken by a myriad of horizontally propagating waves and it is not always clear whether these waves are modes or just vertically evanescent waves propagating horizontally capillary waves swells tidal waves tsunamis are well known examples of such free surface waves deriving a dispersion relation for acoustic waves or for internal waves in an unbounded ocean is rather straightforward the method generally includes two steps small amplitude is assumed only specific wave restoring mechanisms and medium characteristics are retained in the simplest possible wave dispersion model compressibility and pressure force for acoustic waves gravity and vertical advection of isopycnal surfaces for internal waves lighthill 1967 the introduction of a free surface brings more complexity small amplitude is postulated in this case also and both gravity and free surface motions are retained in the dispersion model surface waves are edge waves propagating at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean and the surface kinematic relation the free surface general boundary condition leads to a transcendental dispersion relation with trigonometric terms as a result further simplifications are needed and specific analytical solutions can then be found in the literature depending for example on relative depth i e the product of horizontal wave number k x and ocean depth h table 1 long gravity waves are particular solutions of small aspect ratio k x h well known to propagate horizontally with g h phase and group velocities where g is the acceleration of gravity and h a reference depth interestingly enough such waves occur in at least two distinct contexts shallow water waves shw are propagating solutions of shallow water models their vertical wave length is then viewed as infinite much larger than their horizontal wave length long swells lsw are also propagating with the same phase and group velocities but in this case they retain some of the properties of swells and their horizontal and vertical wave lengths have similar magnitudes shw and lsw are often considered as similar since their wave velocity ω k x are equal however due to the underlying assumptions made in the models leading to these solutions lsw horizontal and vertical wave numbers have equal absolute values k z l s w k x whereas shw have a vanishing vertical wave number k z s h w 0 dukowicz 2013 tackled the description of ag waves and proposed a review of various approximations in atmosphere and ocean models based on an exact treatment of gravity wave dispersion in that paper acoustic gravity waves were shown to satisfy a system of two dispersion relations and the impact of several usual assumptions of ocean models was evaluated the present study builds on eckart 1960 and dukowicz 2013 s results and more specifically focuses on the impact of both stratification and compressibility on ag wave solutions in the ocean the objective is not to provide a full description of ag waves in any realistic configurations up to date numerical models being developed for this but rather to focus on a simple and classical configuration leading to a unified as general as possible analytical model taylor expansions of dispersion relations and resulting expressions for wavelength and frequency are more systematically derived in terms of compressibility and stratification surface waves are systematically studied together with internal and acoustic modes long wave solutions are investigated here in detail another original aspect of the present study is that acoustic modes are discussed in the frame of classical ocean acoustics jensen et al 2011 and additional poles singularities of the dispersion relations induced by stratification and gravity are found a peculiar region of phase space is also identified where surface acoustic gravity surface wave are marginally stable and gravity and compressibility are both important to the authors knowledge the existence of such a region has never been discussed in the literature a graphic analysis of wave solutions is proposed in 3d frequency wave number phase space unfolding their dependency on the vertical wave number in the section 2 a linear model of ocean wave propagation is proposed with bottom and surface boundary conditions and a system of two dispersion relations the inner and boundary dispersion relations is derived the inner dispersion relation and the wave solutions propagating in an unbounded ocean are studied in detail in section 3 waves propagating in a bounded ocean are investigated in section 4 and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 linear model

latest relation is that of no normal velocity neglecting surface tension pressure drop surface pressure is given by 3 p x h z ζ t p a t m with p a t m the atmospheric pressure imposed at the surface of the ocean surface capillarity waves are consequently filtered out and will be neglected in the remaining of this work relation 2 corresponds to jensen et al s hard bottom condition with no propagation nor penetration of acoustic waves in sediment and geologic layers beneath the ocean floor jensen et al 2011 the authors additionaly recover relation 3 by assuming that the atmosphere behaves as a vacuum medium for acoustic waves this means that acoustic waves propagating from the ocean toward the ocean floor or toward the atmosphere are integrally reflected back to the ocean the surface kinematic condition expresses the motion of the free surface and relates the free surface displacement ζ to the surface vertical velocity w 4 d ζ x h t dt w x h z ζ t this kinematic boundary

they also provide the basis for a rather complete analysis to identify and evaluate the approximations made in more realistic compressible non hydrostatic free surface numerical models of the ocean 2

polarization relations 16 ρ ˆ h u ρ ˆ h w ρ p u z w z ρ z p z e i k x x ω t where k x and ω are respectively the horizontal wave number and wave frequency inner propagation equation polarization the polarization relations 16 can then be substituted in the propagation model 14a 14d and in the bottom boundary conditions 15a to obtain a homogeneous system of 4 equations with 4 unknowns the vertical

satisfy the following system of equations 28a f z k x 2 n 0 2 ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 1 4 d 0 2 k z 2 f z 0 28b f h 0 the general solution of 28a 28b with the normalization f 0 1 is 29 f z sin k z h z sin k z h where the vertical wave number k z is defined in 28a and is a function of k x and ω note that f z is linear for k z 0 this particular case will be considered separately in section 2 6 2 5 inner and boundary dispersion relations the relation introduced in 28a between the vertical wave number k z horizontal wave number k x and wave frequency ω constitutes the first dispersion relation it is rewritten as 30 k z 2 k x 2 1 n 0 2 ω 2 ω 2 c s 2 1 4 d 0 2 0 this relation does not account for surface or bottom boundary conditions and thus only deals with the propagation of waves in the inner ocean it will now be referred to as the inner dispersion relation the bottom boundary condition is accounted for in the general solution profile given by 29 injecting this vertical profile f z into the surface boundary condition 28a then leads to the boundary dispersion relation 31 ω 2 g k x 2 tan h k z k z tan h k z 2 d 0 g k x 2 1 2 d 0 k z cotan h k z a wave propagating in a bounded ocean must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relations 30 and 31 note that the traditional inner and boundary dispersion relations for a boussinesq incompressible fluid gill 1982 table 1 can be recovered from 30 and 31 by setting c s incompressibility and then d 0 incompressibility and boussinesq approximations leading to 32 k z k z i m n π h and ω 2 ω i m 2 n 2 k x 2 k x 2 k z 2 g k x 2 tan h k z k z for n n dimensionless dispersion relations as in dukowicz 2013 several parameters are now defined to obtain dimensionless dispersion relations 33 ε i 2 n 2 h g ε a 2 g h c s 2 and ε 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 h ρ ˆ h z ρ ˆ h z ε i is thus a small parameter related to gravity defined as the ratio of the order of magnitude of the first internal mode n h velocity to the velocity of long surface waves g h ε a is a small parameter related to acoustics defined as the ratio of the speed of long surface waves g h to that of sound waves c s note that ε i is defined based on brunt väisälä frequency n 7 to which compressibility effects g 2 c s 2 term have been subtracted whereas ε refers to an equivalent stratification where the effects of compressibility are included in a homogeneous ocean ε i vanishes when n 0 the depth scale can then be rewritten as d 0 2 h ε 2 this scale depth does not include any compressibility induced correction as a consequence the ratio h d 0 2 ε 2 gives an idea of the relative strength of the ocean stratification three dimensionless variables are also further defined 34 ω ω h g δ x k x h δ z k z h the inner 30 and boundary 31 dispersion relations can be written in terms of the dimensionless parameters and variables as 35a δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 ε 4 35b ω 2 δ x 2 tan δ z δ z ε 2 tan δ z in a free surface ocean wave solutions must satisfy simultaneously relations 35a and 35b this means that only one parameter among the frequency ω and horizontal or vertical wave numbers δ x and δ z can be imposed for short vertical wave numbers and far from the bottom and surface boundaries wave solutions only need to satisfy the inner dispersion relation to be dynamically consistent pure acoustic waves or pure internal gravity waves are known to propagate in the inner ocean as in an unbounded ocean the resulting set of two eqs 35a 35b for the three variables δ x δ z ω and the two parameters ε a ε i is nonlinear and simple general solutions cannot be found analytically 2 6 acoustic lamb waves depth independent surface gravity waves acoustic lamb waves the polarization relations 18 have been derived after excluding the particular dispersion relation 36 ε a 2 ω 2 δ x 2 which is the dispersion relation for acoustic lamb waves for atmospheric lamb waves see for instance apel 1987 to be a solution of the linear inviscid non rotating wave model 14a 14d with bottom boundary condition 15a these waves must be of the form 37 w z p z u z ρ z p 0 0 1 1 c s 1 c s 2 e g z c s 2 surface pressure must then vanish to satisfy the surface boundary condition 15b which can only be obtained for the trivial null solution p 0 0 this does not mean that lamb waves cannot propagate in the real ocean but just that they are not solutions of the present ocean model section 2 3 due to the surface and bottom boundary conditions indeed to have non zero amplitude the pressure or alternatively the vertical velocity must vanish simultaneously at the surface and at the ocean floor a vanishing pressure both at the surface and at the ocean floor can for instance be found in jensen s formulation of pekeris wave guide jensen et al 2011 whereas a vanishing vertical velocity can alternatively be specified by assuming that the present linear inviscid non rotating wave model is also rigid lid 15b is then replaced by w z 0 0 in this case the wave polarization is given by 37 with p 0 the pressure at the surface of the ocean depth independent surface gravity wave a second interesting wave solution has been identified in section 2 4 for δ z δ z 0 0 indeed f z is then a linear function of z which simplifies to f z z h h to satisfy the bottom boundary condition 28b the surface boundary condition 35b and the inner dispersion relation 35a impose that 38 ω 2 ω 0 2 δ x 0 2 1 ε 2 δ x 2 δ x 0 2 1 ε 2 ε i 2 ε 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 1 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 ε i 2 o ε i 4 ε a 4 this wave can only propagate at a well defined long horizontal wave length δ x δ x 0 which vanishes in a homogeneous ocean ε i 0 it is also depth independent since if vertical wave number vanishes this depth independent surface gravity wave presents similarities with lamb waves 36 both solutions are found as particular cases while deriving the polarization relations for acoustic gravity waves and they are associated with a horizontally propagating convergent divergent motion of the water column a depth independent motion of this water column compensated by a displacement of the free surface this motion is induced by gravity for depth independent surface gravity waves and by compressibility for lamb waves 2 7 frequency is real vertical wave number is either real or imaginary based on 24 and on the boundary conditions 25a and 25b the vertical wave number δ z can be shown to be either real or imaginary and the frequency ω can be shown to be real no damping in time when ε a 0 or max ε i ε a 2 the proof of these properties is detailed in appendix a 1 it is important to note that ω is forced to be real by the boundary dispersion relation and that other solutions are possible when considering the inner dispersion relation only these solutions will not be discussed in the following even in section 3 on waves in an unbounded ocean this means that in physically realistic conditions i e max ε i ε a 2 waves are either propagating or evanescent but not both along the vertical axis and that they are stable in time real δ z waves are propagating vertically while imaginary δ z waves are evanescent vertically imaginary vertical wave numbers will be written 39 δ z i δ z i with δ z i r the inner and boundary dispersion relations 35a and 35b write in this case 40a δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 ε 4 40b ω 2 δ x 2 tanh δ z i δ z i ε 2 tanh δ z i when not explicitly mentioned the standard values of the parameters used in the rest of the paper are listed in table 2 the rest of the paper is organized as follows the inner dispersion relation corresponding to waves in an unbounded ocean is studied in section 3 additional constraints related to the boundary dispersion relation i e in a bounded ocean are added in section 4 3 inner dispersion relation waves in an unbounded ocean the inner dispersion relation 35a must be satisfied by any type of ocean waves whether or not the ocean is considered as a locally unbounded medium far from surface and bottom and for wavelengths small compared to ocean depth we will show in the present section that i in δ x δ z ω phase space the inner dispersion relation leads to a dispersion surface that can be decomposed in three distinct regions corresponding to acoustic surface and internal waves ii two acoustic and stratification reference functions ω a δ x δ z and ω i δ x δ z are good approximations of the acoustic and internal regions which in turn correspond to acoustic and internal waves propagating in an unbounded ocean iii the upper and lower regions of the inner dispersion surface for respectively high and low frequencies correspond to acoustic waves and internal waves propagating in an unbounded ocean and iv the bounded central region of the inner dispersion surface corresponds to vertically vanishing waves which are referred to as surface waves in section 4 3 1 acoustic and stratification reference frequencies reference acoustic stratification functions following tolstoy 1963 the inner dispersion relation 35a can be reformulated in the simpler form 41 ω 2 ω a 2 ω i 2 ω 2 1 where ω i and ω a are functions of horizontal and vertical wave numbers defined by 42a ω a 2 δ x δ z 1 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 42b ω i 2 δ x δ z δ x 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 these two reference functions are not roots of the inner dispersion equation 41 but they are useful in their approximation and more specifically in their physical interpretation if ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 high frequency then 41 simplifies to ω 2 ω a 2 relevant to a compressible homogeneous unstratified ocean if ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 low frequency then 41 simplifies to ω 2 ω i 2 relevant to an incompressible stratified ocean therefore ω a can be interpreted as a reference acoustic function accounting for the compressibility content of the inner dispersion relation and is a solution of the inner dispersion relation for an homogeneous ocean ω i plays an equivalent role for ocean stratification it can be interpreted as a reference stratification function and is solution of the inner dispersion relation for an incompressible ocean recall that for ε a 0 or m a x ε i ε a 2 the frequency ω is real and δ z is either real or purely imaginary appendix a 1 in addition ω a 2 and ω i 2 have the same sign since their product is equal to δ x 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 0 therefore 41 implies that ω a 2 0 ω i 2 0 and that 0 ω i 2 δ x δ z ω 2 δ x δ z ω a 2 δ x δ z δ x δ z as a consequence the frequency ω is always bounded by the reference functions ω i and ω a 3 2 roots of the inner dispersion relation ω let us now define r δ x δ z the ratio of stratification to acoustic reference functions 43 r 2 δ x δ z ω i 2 ω a 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε 4 2 r δ x δ z is an important parameter for locating the roots of the inner dispersion relation as shown in appendix a 1 ω the roots of eq 41 can only be real a consequence is that r 2 1 4 these roots can then be formulated for the squared frequency 44 ω 2 ω a 2 2 1 1 4 ω i 2 ω a 2 ω a 2 2 1 1 4 r 2 when r 2 is small the two roots are close to the acoustic and stratification reference functions ω ω a ω ω i since their product ω 2 ω 2 is always equal to ω a 2 ω i 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 we further have 45 0 ω i 2 δ x δ z ω 2 δ x δ z ε i ε a δ x ω 2 δ x δ z ω a 2 δ x δ z note also that for a weakly compressible ocean ε a 1 46 ω 2 ω i 2 256 ε a 4 ε i 6 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 4 5 o ε i 6 and for a weakly stratified ocean ε i 1 a n d ε 1 47 ω 2 ω a 2 ε a 2 ε i 4 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε a 4 4 3 o ε a 6 3 3 three regions in δ x δ z ω phase space fig 1 shows variations of the squared vertical wave number δ z 2 as a function of δ x ω for the values of ε i ε a given in table 2 negative values are encountered for medium range frequencies 1 0 1 7 ω 1 0 0 7 and large enough horizontal wave numbers δ x 0 1 0 2 this region is surrounded by high and low frequency regions of positive δ z 2 the transition lines between these regions are given by δ z 0 if ω 1 and ε a 0 then ω 2 ω a 2 and the acoustic transition line is given by ε a 2 ω 2 δ x 2 ε 4 this line is a parabola and the frequency is not bounded when δ x increases if ω 1 and ε i 0 then ω 2 ω i 2 the equation of the gravity transition line is ω 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ε 4 this line has an upper bound ω c i ε i this parabola crosses the δ x 0 axis for the acoustic cut off frequency ω c a ε 2 ε a in dimensional form this bound can be rewritten ω n and is related to the well known cut off frequency for internal gravity waves for a real frequency ω fig 1 confirms that the vertical wave number can only be real or imaginary and that the inner dispersion relation 35a authorizes three types of wave solutions two with real vertical wave numbers δ z 2 0 and one with purely imaginary wave numbers δ z 2 0 in this latest region the corresponding wave solution is evanescent separation of solutions we prove in appendix a 2 that for a non trivial non vanishing wave solution in a stratified ocean r 2 δ x δ z can be equal to 1 4 only if δ z is imaginary in this case r 2 δ x δ z 1 4 leads to a 19 and a 20 48a δ z 2 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε 4 2 ε a ε i δ x 48b ω 2 ω 2 ω 2 ε i ε a δ x ω a 2 2 a consequence is that wave solutions are well separated when δ z is real and does not vanish or when δ z is imaginary and δ z i δ z i even if 40a has two roots in this case the two corresponding branches are always connected for δ z 2 ω 2 satisfying 48a 48b and thus form a single family of ocean waves 3 4 wave solutions in an unbounded ocean for a real vertical wave number δ z r 2 2 imaginary vertical wave numbers δ z i r are treated in section 4 4 for a bounded ocean the two roots are thus always well separated and given by 49 ω δ x δ z ω i δ x δ z ω δ x δ z ω a δ x δ z modified internal waves miw the traditional dispersion relation for dispersive internal gravity waves in the context of a boussinesq incompressible fluid gill 1982 see also table 1 above is 50 ω 2 ω i g r 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 a taylor expansion of the gravity wave root ω 2 given by 44 with respect to the small parameters ε a and ε i leads to 51 ω 2 ω i g r 2 1 ε 4 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 2 o ε 8 52 1 ε 4 δ

that the two roots of the inner dispersion relation are not fully separated the corrective term ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 4 δ x 2 δ z 2 2 is naturally close to r 2 formulation 52 shows that the combined effect of compressibility and stratification is always a reduction of the frequency compared with the approximated value ω i g r ω 2 ω i g r 2 ocean waves satisfying 51 will now be referred to as modified internal waves miw modified acoustic waves maw the well known dispersion relation for acoustic waves in an homogeneous fluid is table 1 53 ω a w 2 1 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 a taylor development of the acoustic root ω with respect to ε a and ε i leads this time to 54 ω 2 ω a w 2 1 ε 4 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 2 o ε 8 55 1 ε 4 δ z 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 δ x 2 2 δ x 2 δ z 2 2 o ε 4 o ε

fully separated again the corrective term is small and close to r 2 the combined effect of compressibility and stratification is always an increase of the frequency compared with the approximated value ω a w ω 2 ω a w 2 ocean waves satisfying 54 will be called modified acoustic waves maw in the following the modifications to usual internal and acoustic wave dispersion relations by compressibility and stratification effects are expressed by ω 2 ω 2 ε i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ω a w 2 ω i g r 2 which can explain the symmetry in the above developments for modified internal and acoustic waves 3 5 homogeneous and or incompressible unbounded ocean much insight can be gained on acoustic gravity waves by a geometrical investigation of surfaces in phase space that correspond to the inner and boundary dispersion relations these surfaces will respectively be named inner and boundary dispersion surfaces fig 2 shows the inner dispersion surfaces in the δ x δ z ω space each dispersion surface corresponds to a region of the wave solutions these surfaces are plotted for a homogeneous and incompressible 2 a a homogeneous and compressible 2 b an incompressible and stratified 2 c and a compressible and stratified unbounded ocean the y axis is constructed such that the δ z 0 positive half space corresponds to the real vertical wave numbers whereas the δ z 0 negative half space corresponds to the imaginary part of pure imaginary vertical wave numbers δ z i careful inspection of the δ z 0 half space in figs 2 b 2 c and 2 d confirms the presence of two regions of solutions with real positive vertical wave numbers for large frequencies red branch the upper region corresponds to acoustic wave solutions maw figs 2 b and 2 d this region disappears under the assumption of incompressibility figs 2 a and 2 c the lower region light green branch corresponds to internal wave solutions miw figs 2 c and 2 d and disappears under the assumption of homogeneous ocean figs 2 a and 2 b the third region of wave solution light blue surfaces in fig 2 corresponds to pure imaginary vertical wave numbers in a stratified compressible unbounded ocean fig 2 d this region corresponds to intermediate values of the in a homogeneous incompressible and unbounded ocean fig 2 a shows that the unique dispersion surface is the δ x 2 δ z 2 plane 3 6 summary waves solutions in an unbounded ocean in the preceding analysis three types of waves were identified a synthesis is given by fig 2 d showing the inner dispersion surfaces for a stratified compressible ocean and fig 2 a c showing the limit cases for respectively a homogeneous and incompressible a homogeneous and compressible and a stratified but incompressible ocean approximate frequency values for modified internal and acoustic waves are summarized in tables 3 and 4 in dimensional form for comparison with introductory table 1 since the practical existence and characterization of modified surface waves is totally dependent on boundary conditions they are not summarized here but will be detailed in the next section in a more realistic bounded ocean their existence is guaranteed only if their vertical scale is much smaller than the ocean depth δ z 1 and if they do not interfere with the bottom or the surface of the ocean the next section will investigate the impact of adding the boundary dispersion relation 35b 4 waves in a bounded ocean acoustic gravity waves propagating in a bounded ocean i e considering both the free surface and the bottom boundary of the ocean are studied in the present section these wave solutions are first shown to be organised in branches i e in 1d curves parameterized by δ x 2 δ z ω 2 δ z each branch is located at the intersection of the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces and is confined to a region of phase space located between two poles of the dispersion relations modified internal and acoustic modes and then modified surface waves are studied before acoustic gravity waves in the long wave approximation are investigated 4 1 graphical investigation of modified surface waves msw modified acoustic modes mam and modified internal modes mim the compressible and stratified ocean is now assumed to be bounded wave solutions must thus satisfy both the inner 35a and boundary 35b dispersion relations in phase space they must lie at the intersections of the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces which are now plotted simultaneously on fig 3 for real vertical wave numbers k z r fig 3a the boundary dispersion surface is a piecewise surface several regions that are nearly vertical in δ x δ z log 10 ω space at δ z n π small ω and at δ z π 2 m 1 π large ω with n n and m n the intersection of these surfaces with inner dispersion relation surfaces result in a number of constrained vertical wave numbers according to n and m we will show in the following sections that the resulting wave solutions are modes and the two intersections correspond more specifically to modified internal modes mim n n and to modified acoustic modes mam m n for purely imaginary wave numbers the light blue inner dispersion surface looks like an horizontal hyperbolic surface which intersects the light gray boundary dispersion surface the resulting wave solutions correspond to modified surface waves msw far from the origin δ x δ z 0 0 at the intersection points δ z is close to δ x for long waves δ x 1 δ z 1 the boundary dispersion surfaces for real and purely imaginary δ z are in the same plane indeed the development of the boundary relation is well approximated by ω 2 δ x 2 in both cases a better approximation is given in eq 67 fig 3b shows the different solutions close to the origin δ x δ z ω 0 0 0 the acoustic wave surface does not intersect the boundary dispersion surface near the origin as proven in section 4 5 and is not present close to the origin in the context of a bounded ocean three types of wave solutions are thus graphically identified spreading on the three regions of the inner dispersion surface while satisfying the boundary dispersion relation internal gravity in a stratified ocean acoustic in a compressible ocean and surface waves in a free surface ocean they are investigated in the following using taylor expansions of the general roots ω with respect to small parameters ε i ε a leading to simple approximations of wave dispersion relations when needed asymptotic relations are derived with respect to δ x δ z or ω taylor expansions will give indications of how usual wave solutions can be modified by gravity and stratification ε i and or by compressibility ε a 4 2 poles of the dispersion relations the dispersion relations for acoustic gravity waves in a bounded ocean exhibit several discrete poles or singularities for the vertical wave number that lead to the existence of normal modes to show this we can combine the dispersion relations 35a and 35b to express the square of the horizontal wave number and the frequency as functions of the vertical wave number 56a δ x 2 δ z ε 2 sin δ z δ z cos δ z δ z 2 ε i 4 ε i 4 4 sin δ z δ z ε i 2 cos δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 sin δ z 2 δ z cos δ z sin δ z 56b ω x 2 δ z δ z 2 ε a 4 ε i 4 4 sin δ z δ z ε i 2 cos δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 sin δ z 2 δ z cos δ z the first relation 56a has two poles or singularities δ z δ z n n π with n n is indeed an approximate root of sin δ z 0 and thus a pole of δ x 2 δ z and δ z δ z m r m π 2 m π is a root of δ z tan δ z ε a 2 ε i 2 1 and thus a pole of δ x 2 δ z the second dispersion relation 56b only has one pole δ z δ z m r m π 2 m π a more accurate expression of δ z m can be obtained as an infinite series 57 δ z m r m ε a 2 ε i 2 r m ε a 2 ε i 2 2 3 ε i 2 ε a 2 3 r m 3 ε a 2 ε i 2 3 3 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 20 ε a 2 ε i 2 30 15 r m 5 o 1 r m 7 note that ω 2 δ z is continuous in δ z δ z n this set of poles confirms and extends the poles found by jensen et al 2011 for a compressible homogeneous rigid lid ideal ocean waveguide these poles are associated to the ag modes discussed in section 2 to show this one can follow jensen et al 2011 and rewrite the wave field emitted by a point source at frequency ω alternatively as a line integral or as an infinite series in fourier space the poles are then the singularities of the line integral whereas the series is the infinite sum of discrete modes the equivalence of both expressions is given by cauchy s residue theorem mei et al 2005 we further show in a 3 that the first type δ z m corresponds to the modified acoustic modes mam identified graphically in section 4 1 and plotted with a red curve in fig 3 the second type δ z n is also shown to correspond to the modified internal modes mim also identified graphically in section 4 1 but plotted in green fig 4 shows that wave solutions are organized in branches confined to the intervals δ z 2 δ z m 1 2 δ z δ z m n δ z n and δ z δ z n δ z m n 1 for n n the δ x 2 δ z 2 0 vertical plane coloured in light gray is the region where the induced effects of compressibility and stratification exactly compensate indeed 35a implies in this case that ε a 2 ω 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε 0 a study of the variations of δ x 2 δ z and ω 2 δ z shows that these functions are monotonically decreasing at respectively the third and first order in ε a ε i see appendix a 7 when δ z δ z m δ x 2 δ z and ω 2 δ z when δ z δ z n δ x 2 δ z but ω 2 δ z ε i 2 since δ z n is not a pole of ω δ z in the interval δ z m 0 the long wave branch extends to negative values of δ z 2 for an imaginary vertical wave number blue curve in fig 4 each branch of the acoustic gravity wave solutions consequently extends both in the δ x 2 0 half space of propagating waves green red and blue curves in fig 4 and in the δ x 2 0 half space of vanishing waves gray and black curves this study of the variations of δ x 2 δ z further shows that for waves propagating both horizontally and vertically δ x 2 δ z 2 0 δ z remains close to either δ z m or δ z n in each interval of solutions except for the very long wave branch fig 4 c and 0 δ z 2 δ z m 0 π 2 indeed in the case of not too long propagating waves δ x 2 δ z 2 is positive and at least larger than δ z m 0 2 meaning that whatever δ x either ε a 2 ω 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z or ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z are significantly large this is possible only if respectively δ z δ z m section 4 3 2 or δ z δ z n section 4 3 1 graphically fig 4 a b and d confirm that δ z varies sharply only in regions where δ x 2 δ z 2 0 i e in regions where the acoustic gravity wave solutions are close to the gray vertical surface δ x 2 δ z 2 0 the study of the poles finally confirms the separation of the branches of the acoustic gravity wave solutions in agreement with the results proved in appendix a 2 firstly a clear separation has now been brought to light in terms of their vertical wave numbers since the branches are confined to the interval regions locates between the poles δ z δ z m n δ z n and δ z δ z n δ z m m 1 for n n secondly in so far as the not too long wave solutions satisfy either δ z δ z m or δ z δ z n the relation 56b further confirms that the solutions are also well separated in terms of their frequency indeed we have shown that δ x 2 0 imposes in this case that δ z is close to either δ z m or δ z n since i δ z m is a pole of ω 2 and thus ω 2 δ z δ z m a n d δ z m δ z is large and ii ω 2 δ z monotonic decreasing and ω 2 δ z n ε i 2 we can conclude and confirm that ω 2 δ z δ z m ε i 2 ω 2 δ z δ z n a n d δ z n δ z 4 3 real δ z modified internal and acoustic waves as shown in section 3 3 and section 4 2 upper acoustic and lower gravity regions of the inner dispersion surface for real δ z are well separated modified acoustic modes mam and modified internal modes mim solutions can thus be studied independently we additionally showed that as long as δ z is not close to zero the acoustic gravity wave solutions remain close to one of the poles the case of long waves with δ z 0 is discussed in subsection section 4 5 4 3 1 development of internal gravity modes modified by compressibility mim waves can propagate horizontally between the bottom and surface of the ocean as in a wave guide internal gravity modes are well known such examples gill 1982 in section 4 1 graphical inspections of wave solutions confirmed that gravity waves with constrained vertical wave numbers could be found at the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces we have also shown in section 3 3 that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to internal gravity waves is well approximated by ω i 2 46 and in section 4 2 and appendix a 3 that δ z remains close to δ z n in order to refine the approximation and to parameterize this relation in terms of the horizontal wave number we equate the squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation 35b to ω 2 given by the inner dispersion relation 44 this forms a non linear equation for δ z whose solution can be approximated using two passes of a newton algorithm starting from δ z δ z n finally a taylor development in ε i ε a leads to 58 δ z δ x δ z m i m δ x δ z n 1 ε i 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 3 ε i 4 o ε 6 a development for the frequency ω 2 can be obtained by injecting expression 58 of δ z in the general expression 51 in the unbounded domain case the usual dispersion relation given in table 1 can be written in dimensional form 59 ω 2 δ x ω i g r 2 δ z δ z n δ x ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 considering only the first order correction to this relation we can omit all terms of order 3 in ε 2 in 51 to get 60 ω 2 δ x ω m i m 2 δ x ε i 2 δ x 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 ω i m 2 1 2 ε i 2 δ z n 2 δ x 2 δ z n 2 2 o ε 6 therefore the main correction to the usual dispersion relation comes from the fact that δ z is not exactly equal to but remains close to δ z n n π mim correspond to the green curve in fig 3 a 4 3 2 development of acoustic modes modified by gravity mam to study modified acoustic modes at higher frequencies we now use the fact that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to acoustic waves is well approximated by ω a 2 47 and that δ z remains close to δ z m section 4 2 and a 3 again in order to get a more accurate expression of δ z parameterize by the horizontal wave number δ x we equate the inversed squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation 35b to the inversed ω 2 given by the inner dispersion relation 44 and perform the nonlinear equation s solution approximation followed by a taylor development in ε i ε a to obtain

m 2 3 δ z m 3 o ε 4 o ε 6 an expansion for the frequency ω 2 can be obtained by injecting the expression 61 of δ z in the general expression 54 in the unbounded domain case the main departure from to the usual acoustic wave frequency given in table 1 in dimensional form is given by the second order development 62 ω 2 δ x ω m a m 2 δ x 1 ε a 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 δ x 2 δ z m 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 o ε 2 here stratification has a first order in ε i 2 contribution to the modification of the homogeneous case frequency this first order modification comes from the first order modification on the vertical wave number itself 61 however it is clear that the associated impact is small since ε i 2 is negligible compared with δ z m 2 in 61 and 62 because δ z m π 2 a similar conclusion was drawn in smith 2015 mam correspond to the red curves in 3 a 4 4 purely imaginary δ z modified surface acoustic gravity waves msw surface waves generally refer to waves propagating horizontally as anomalies of the ocean free surface gill 1982 in the vertical direction these surface wave anomalies are evanescent meaning that with the notation chosen in the present study the vertical wave number δ z is a purely imaginary complex number a modified surface wave msw defined by its triplet δ x δ z ω must satisfy both the inner 40a and boundary 40b dispersion relations for δ z i δ z i homogeneous incompressible ocean in an homogeneous and incompressible ocean ε i ε a 0 fig 2 the inner dispersion relation 40a implies δ z i δ x this equality is often postulated in textbooks to reduce the number of variables vertical polarization relations are then functions of δ x only gill 1982 and as a consequence the only remaining dispersion relation is the boundary dispersion relation 40b for purely imaginary vertical wave number δ z i δ x or its approximation ω 2 δ x tanh δ x in this case δ z i is reduced to a vertical length scale of energy decay with increasing distance from the surface for very long waves δ x 1 the surface wave lsw is approximately depth independent table 1 dispersion relation in the more general case non homogeneous and compressible ocean we prove in appendix a 4 the existence of solutions to 40a 40b when the parameters ε i and ε a are small we additionally prove in appendix a 5 that surface acoustic gravity waves have approximately similar horizontal and vertical wave numbers δ x δ z i this crude assumption δ x δ z i is sufficiently accurate to recover usual swell like approximations table 1 i e for sufficiently large δ x or δ z however a more accurate expression is given by 63 δ z i 2 δ x δ x 2 δ x ε i 2 tanh δ x ε a 2 tanh δ x o ε 4 in order to obtain 63 we introduce the frequency given by the boundary dispersion relation in the inner dispersion relation 40a and solve the resulting nonlinear equation by performing one pass of a newton algorithm note that the problem is formulated in terms of δ z i 2 δ x since it can be shown by looking at the error estimate of the newton algorithm that a formulation in terms of δ z i δ x is not accurate when δ x is relatively small note also that 63 requires δ x ε i for δ z i 2 to be positive this is consistent with the fact that δ x must be greater than δ x 0 ε i defined in 38 as shown in appendix a 4 however 63 does not allow us to recover the exact value δ x 0 of δ x that cancels δ z i due to the first order only approximation in terms of ε 2 the case of long surface waves with δ z i close to zero will be treated separately in section 4 5 the frequency ω 2 δ x associated to the vertical wave number δ z i 2 δ x given by 63 is well approximated by 64 ω 2 δ x δ x tanh δ x 1 1 2 ε i 2 sinh 2 δ x ε a 2 cosh 2 δ x ε i 2 δ x sinh δ x cosh δ x o ε 4 for very short waves δ x 1 these relations simplify to δ z i δ x ε 2 ω 2 δ x and we recover the frequency of short non hydrostatic waves ω 2 δ x or ω g k x in dimensional form with a slightly modified vertical wave number msw correspond to the blue curve in 3 a marginally stable surface gravity waves we proved in section 3 3 that the ratio r 2 δ x δ z is maximum and equal to 1 4 only when δ z is imaginary the relations 48a and 48b are simultaneously satisfied gray curve in fig 2 d any triplet δ x δ z ω satisfying these two relations is an acceptable wave solution only if it also satisfies the boundary dispersion relation 40b as a consequence δ x ω and δ z i ω can be obtained combining 48b and 40b both relations are recalled below then 48a leads to the non linear equation for ω given by 65a 48b δ x ε a ε i ω 2 40b ω 2 δ x 2

the consequences of earth rotation and wave non linearity 4 5 long waves we now prove the existence of two sub branches of long wave solutions mode 0 modified internal modes mim 0 with horizontal wave numbers in the range δ x 0 δ x 0 and long modified surface waves lmsw in the range δ x δ x 0 dispersion relations for long waves here we perform specific developments for long waves where the vertical profile is almost depth independent δ z 0 δ z being either real or purely imaginary fig 3b this corresponds to the long wave part of the acoustic gravity branch located in the region δ z 2 δ z m 1 2 of fig 4a inserting the boundary dispersion relation 35b into the inner dispersion relation 35a and making a second order taylor expansion in δ z leads to 66 δ z 2 δ x δ z l o n g 2 δ x δ x 0 2 δ x 2

is equal to ε i the corresponding frequency can be obtained by inserting the approximation of the vertical wave number given by 66 into the boundary relation dispersion 35b an approximation at second order in δ x 2 and ε 2 is 67 ω 2 δ x ω l o n g 2 δ x δ x 2 1 1 6 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 3 ε a 2 ε 2 1 45 ε i 4 o ε 6 o δ x 4 we also define 68 δ z 0 2 δ x 0 δ x 0 2 1 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 ε i 2 3 1 ε i 2 3 δ x 2 ε a 2 3 o δ z 4 fig 6 shows the evolution of δ z 2 δ z and ω as functions of δ x for long waves 6a b and d and for short and intermediate waves 6c δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 ε i the vertical wave number δ z given by 66 is real this implies that ω 2 δ x 2 ε i δ x ε i ε a δ x since ε a 1 and thus using the bounds on ω 2 ω 2 given by 45 that these waves are always issued from the internal wave region of the inner dispersion surface ω 2 not from the acoustic wave region ω 2 in other words there is no intersection between the boundary dispersion relation and the real acoustic wave region for δ z r close to zero for the chosen boundary conditions this is consistent with the fact that acoustic lamb waves can only be solutions for different surface or bottom boundary conditions in section 2 6 dukowicz 2013 notes that this wave solution like any higher internal modes has its frequency ω 2 approximately bounded by ε i 2 i e ω n since ω 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 we however avoid to refer to this n 0 internal mode mim 0 as a barotropic wave indeed if ε i ε a 0 i e if stratification and compressibility vanish in this sub branch disappears since δ z r mim 0 propagates in the vertical direction but its vertical wave number remains small even in strongly stratified regions large values of ε i see table 6 δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 but still small δ z given by 66 is purely imaginary these long waves originate from the surface wave branch msw and will here be named lmsw when δ x increases δ z l o n g 66 converges to δ z l m s w 63 which is a better approximation for medium and short surface waves fig 6 a shows δ z 2 as a function of δ x for δ x 2 ε i the two approximations given by 66 accurate for long waves and 63 accurate for medium short waves are plotted on fig 6 b the modulus of the vertical wave number is shown on the same interval for δ x for δ x 2 ε i fig 6 c and d present the frequency ω as a function of the horizontal wave number δ x according to different approximations for small intermediate and long horizontal wave numbers ω l o n g and ω m s w are computed by inserting the corresponding approximations 66 and 63 of δ z in the boundary dispersion relation 35b ω δ x resp ω δ x represents the classical long shallow water waves resp short non hydrostatic surface waves approximation ω ω s w δ x tanh δ x is the frequency of an homogeneous and incompressible non hydrostatic ocean unsurprisingly this last approximation is accurate over the full range of horizontal wave numbers even for the set of compressible stratified equations indeed even if for long waves δ z is not directly linked to δ x in particular δ z does not vanish for δ x 0 δ z remains small less than ε i and thus δ z tan δ z is close to 1 interestingly and contrary to conclusions in dukowicz 2013 the mim 0 frequency cannot saturate at the buoyancy frequency for increasing horizontal wave number δ x but transforms into a vertically evanescent surface wave whereas its vertical wave number switches from real to purely imaginary hydrostaticity and asymptotic behaviour surface edge waves are consequently either mim 0 modes δ z r and δ x δ x 0 or modified surface waves msw δ z i r and δ x δ x 0 for δ x δ x 0 a depth independent gravity surface wave studied in section 2 6 separates these two sub branches in the long wave approximation the long wave solution 63 is an accurate approximation of both mim 0 and lmsw we now further prove that in the long wave low frequency limit for δ x δ x 0 the mim 0 is quasi hydrostatic and converges towards the g h phase velocity shallow wave solution shw when stratification loosens i e when ε i 0 for δ x δ x 0 the lmsw solution remains non hydrostatic and converges towards the other g h phase velocity long swell solution lsw when stratification loosens i e when ε i 0 the shw and lsw asymptotic solutions are recalled in table 1 and discussed in section 2 6 using the approximate solution for long waves 66 and for lmsw 63 we can compute their respective aspect ratio 69a r l o n g 2 δ x δ x 2 δ z l o n g 2 δ x 2 1 ε i 2 3 ε a 2 1 ε i 2 3 1 ε i 2 3 δ x 2 ε a 2 3 o δ z 4 69b r m s w 2 δ x δ x 2 δ z m s w 2 δ x ε a 2 tanh 2 δ x δ x tanh δ x ε i 2 fig 7 shows the evolutions of these aspect ratios as functions of the horizontal wave number a study of the variations of r l o n g shows that this ratio increases monotonically from 0 to infinity when δ x varies from 0 to δ x 0 and decreases monotonically from infinity to 1 when δ x varies from δ x 0 to infinity in this latter range r m s w remains close to r l o n g except in the vicinity of δ x 0 the aspect ratio r l o n g remains lower than 1 and it decreases monotonically to 0 when δ x approaches 0 in this very long wave range the mim 0 solution is thus hydrostatic and the dispersion relations 66 and 64 are approximately given by 70 δ z 2 δ z 0 2 ε i 2 ω 2 δ x 2 this solution is also the long wave approximation of the hydrostatic wave solution appendix b the second branch is a monotonic function for δ x δ x 0 and it decreases to 1 when δ x as a consequence it remains superior to 1 in this range of wave numbers the corresponding wave solution is non hydrostatic and the dispersion relations 66 and 64 are approximately given by 71 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 ω 2 δ x 2 this solution is also the long wave approximation of the non hydrostatic wave solution appendix b 4 6 summary waves solutions in a bounded ocean unlike in an unbounded ocean acoustic gravity wave solutions in a bounded free surface ocean must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relations this induces the appearance of poles in these dispersion relations for δ z π 2 m 1 π mam and for δ z n π mim with m n n x n for δ z i r the boundary dispersion relation does not exhibit any pole a stratified ocean can propagate two types of surface edge waves for medium and short wave lengths δ x δ x 0 msw are non hydrostatic r l m s w 1 evanescent δ z s w i r and converge towards the g h phase velocity depth dependent δ x δ z i wave solution lsw when both ε i 0 and δ x δ x 0 vertical variations of pressure are non hydrostatic and in a homogeneous ocean lmsw solutions remain depth dependent δ x δ z i 0 for longer waves δ x δ x 0 mim 0 are quasi hydrostatic r m i m 0 1 if δ x is not in the neighbourhood of δ x 0 vertically propagating δ z r and converges towards the shallow water g h phase velocity solution shw when both ε i 0 and δ x 0 in this case vertical variations of pressure are hydrostatic and lmiw solutions are depth independent δ z 0 when the stratification loosens ε i 0 the range of validity of mim 0 solution 0 δ x δ x 0 ε i shrinks to zero the frequency of acoustic wave solutions modified by gravity remains larger than ω c a ε 2 ε a whereas the frequency of gravity waves modified by compressibility remains smaller than ω c i ε i section 3 3 table 5 summarizes the main approximations for the different type of waves acoustic gravity and surface waves modes given in this paper these approximations are indicated in their dimensional form for sake of readability some of the relations given in table 5 are lower order versions of our derivations they generally stem from first order correction terms compared with usual dispersion relations introduced in table 1 in that case a red link to the higher approximation is given table 6 gives orders of magnitude of various characteristics of these acoustic gravity waves for the reference set of ε a ε i parameters table 2 and for a shallow or a strongly stratified ocean for the 4000 m deep reference ocean the horizontal length scale associated with the transformation of the msw into the long mim λ x l m s w 2 π δ x l m s w 4000 reaches 1367 km against 62 km for the same 10 m deep ocean when δ x decreases below δ x l m s w δ z increases monotonically to a maximum value δ z l m s w δ x 0 this vertical length scale reaches 1379 km for the 4000 m deep reference ocean and 62 km for the same 10 m deep ocean a rule can be formulated as the longer the horizontal length scale of the oscillation the shorter its vertical length scale and the weaker the stratification vanishing ε i the longer its horizontal length scale λ x l m s w this long mim solution is a low frequency oscillation of the ocean due to gravity and associated with ocean stratification it disappears when stratification vanishes and the ocean becomes an homogeneous layer of water it does persist in an incompressible ocean but is slightly modified by compressibility 5 discussion conclusion an eulerian analytical model for acoustic gravity waves propagating in a compressible stratified free surface non rotating ocean has been derived and investigated with several objectives recover acoustic waves and modes in a unified dispersion model describe analytically the modifications of the characteristics of these waves and modes for small changes in compressibility or stratification and finally anticipate the impact of compressibility in the new generation of non hydrostatic compressible ocean models auclair et al 2018 an original investigation at least to the authors knowledge based on 3d graphics in δ x δ z ω phase space has been carried out to support and illustrate the analytical developments well known acoustic and internal modes mam and mim have in particular been recovered and have been associated to the infinite number of discrete poles of the inner and boundary dispersion relations a least two peculiar regions of the phase space have been investigated in more detail firstly the long acoustic gravity wave branch has indeed been decomposed in two sub branches one associated to a modified mode 0 internal mode mim 0 with a real vertical wave number the other to a modified long surface gravity wave lmsw with imaginary vertical wave number secondly modified surface gravity waves msw have been shown to be marginally stable for intermediate wave numbers in a region of phase space where compressibility and stratification induced effects approximately compensate analytical solutions are given in dimensional form in appendix c such solutions can conveniently be used to validate non

other words differences between horizontal and vertical wavenumbers are indication of the influence of ocean stratification and or compressibility in an incompressible homogeneous unstratified ocean ε i ε a 0 and vertical and horizontal wave numbers are equal the developments of ω 2 ω 2 for small ε i ε a are identical to those for real vertical wavenumbers 51 54 just replacing δ z 2 by δ z i 2 the remaining question is that of root separation when δ z i r unlike when δ z r previous sub section the ratio r 2 δ x i δ z i can be equal to 1 4 even when δ z is not small relation 40a imposes 0 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 and in this range of values r 2 is an increasing function of δ z i 2 the value of r 2 1 4 is attained for δ z i 2 δ z i 2 given by a 19 δ z i 2 δ x 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 2 ε a ε i δ x for which the inner dispersion relation has a double root a 20 ω 2 ω 2 ε i ε a δ x when δ z i is less than δ z i the two roots become separated again since we have proved in appendix that only

not close to 0 the right hand side of a 21 is always small and thus δ z tan δ z has to be large i e the vertical wavenumber δ z is close to δ z n n π with n a non zero integer this agrees with the internal gravity wave solution found graphically in section 4 2 mam solutions we can now use the fact that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to acoustic waves is well approximated by ω a 2 making ω 2 δ x ω a 2 in the boundary dispersion relation 35b leads to a 22 δ z tan δ z ε i 2 ε a 2 2 ε a 2 1 δ z 2 1 4 ε i 2 ε a 2 2 δ x 2 since the right hand side of a 22 is small bounded by ε a 2 δ z tan δ z has to be small and thus the vertical wavenumber δ z is close to δ z m π 2 m π with m n a 4 surface waves existence let us define f δ x δ z i by f δ x δ z i δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 with ω 2 δ x 2 δ z i tanh δ z i ε a 2 ε i 2 2 the inner boundary relation translates into f δ x δ z i 0 we can check that for a given δ z i f δ x δ z i is an increasing function of δ x 4 4 this simple demonstration requires the assumption ε a 2 2 ε i 2 i e the same used in appendix to prove that the imaginary part of δ z 2 is zero let δ x 0 be the value of δ x defined by f δ x 0 δ z 0 0 δ x 0 will be given in 66 and is close to ε i in particular we have f δ x 0 f δ x 0 0 0 for δ x δ x 0 we can also verify that for a given δ x such that δ x δ x 0 the maximum of f δ x δ z is attained in δ z i 0 this proves that if δ x δ x 0 f δ x δ z i 0 δ z i therefore modified surface waves can only exist under the condition δ x δ x 0 a 5 surface waves δ z i δ x we can show that 1 δ z i tanh δ z i δ z i 2 1 δ z i r injecting these two inequalities in the surface dispersion relation leads to δ x 2 ω 2 δ z i 2 1 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 and ω 2 δ x 2 since the inner dispersion relation implies ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ x 2 ω 2 ε a 2 ω 2 we finally get ε a 2 ε i 2 2 4 δ x 2 δ z i 2 ε i 2 δ z i 2 ε a 2 δ x 2 ε i 2 1 ε a 2 ε i 2 2 using the smallness of the parameters ε a and ε i we can then conclude that δ z i 2 is indeed close to δ x 2 a 6 mim 0 long wave sub branch wave solutions of mim 0 type must satisfy both the inner and boundary dispersion relation 35a and 35b with δ z r we have also shown that mim 0 is part of the internal branch and as a consequence approximately satisfies 42b substituting then 35b into 42b leads to a relation between the horizontal and vertical wave numbers a 23 δ x 2 δ x m i m 0 2 δ z δ z 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z with δ x m i m 0 2 0 δ x 0 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 1 when δ x 0 2 0 this depth independent solution does not propagate horizontally and we will assume in the following that δ x 0 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 1 0 in section 4 2 δ z m 0 has been defined as a root of ε 2 δ z cotan δ z and when δ z δ z m 0 δ x 2 δ z this means that there must exist δ z 0 0 δ z m 0 such that δ x m i m 0 δ z 0 0 and δ z 0 satisfies a 24 δ z 2 ε 4 ε i 2 ε 2 δ z cotan δ z 0 we can additionally show that δ x m i m 0 δ z is monotonic decreasing for δ z 0 δ z 0 indeed its derivative a 25 d δ x m i m 0 d δ z δ z 2 δ z 2 ε i 2 δ z cotan δ z is positive for δ z 0 δ z 0 since it satisfies d δ x m i m 0 d δ z 0 0 and is an increasing function of δ z over this interval the monotonicity of the derivative can be proven by computing the second order derivative a 26 d 2 δ x m i m 0 d δ z 2 δ z 2 2 ε i 2 1 δ z cotan δ z sin 2 δ z and using the taylor series of cotan z we can further show that 1 δ z cotan δ z 0 and thus d 2 δ x m i m 0 d δ z 2 δ z 0 a 7 monotonicity of the branches of wave solutions to do so the derivatives of δ x

sin 2 δ z 2 δ z 2 sin 2 δ z 0 note that the relations above are not taylor expansions of the derivatives with respect to ε a and ε i they are exact relations the derivative of δ x 2 given by a 27a is negative at third order in ε a ε i whereas the derivative of ω 2 a 27b is negative only at first order in ε a ε i at higher order a 27a and a 27b additionally show the values of δ z for which δ x 2 and ω 2 are monotonic depending of the values of this two parameters δ x 2 δ z and ω 2 δ z are thus monotonously decreasing functions of δ z if ε a and ε i remains small appendix b incompressible

23878,a parameterization of new ice formation in a wave field has been developed detailed processes of new sea ice growth with multiple ice types nilas grease and pancake ice and associated wave attenuation by different sea ice types are presented and implemented into a coupled roms and swan model sea ice formation includes growth and transformation of frazil grease pancake nilas and solid ice ice types are determined by thermal condition and the wave fields simultaneously the attenuation of wave energy through the ice cover is dependent on ice types the two processes are coupled by coawst the resulting coupled model is applied to the bohai sea when compared with in situ data from oil platforms the model performed well in distinguishing solid ice pancake and nilas when compared with previous ice models without the consideration of new ice types the appearance of solid ice is delayed the total ice area and ice volume are increased solid ice thickness is increased while the type averaged thickness is reduced and heat flux from the ocean to air is increased during the freezing phase by considering the new ice formation wave attenuation in the test case is enhanced keywords new ice formation wave ice interaction multiple ice types 1 introduction the areal coverage of summertime arctic sea ice has experienced a rapid reduction in recent years thoman et al 2020 there are two immediate consequences from the expanding open water as the ice cover continues to shrink one is the increased fetch for wave generation the other is the amount and the type of new grown ice during freeze up thomson et al 2016 2018 studied the autumn wind wave and ice conditions from 1992 to 2014 in the beaufort and chukchi seas they found no change of the wind speed during this period but the waves increased in peak period 0 04 s year and significant wave height 0 01 m year they also found prevalence of pancake ice well documented in the southern ocean but rarely seen in the arctic until recent years these observations indicate waves have begun to influence the formation of ice covers in the arctic the widely used ice model cice hunke et al 2008 includes both dynamic and thermodynamic processes motion and deformation of ice covers are determined by the surface tilt wind and current forcing and internal stresses their thickness is divided into categories heat flux and mechanical ridging control growth decay of each thickness category and transfer between categories newly formed ice in open water during freeze up is considered to turn into solid ice instantly to join the thinnest ice category despite such simplifications present sea ice models are able to well capture the spatial distribution of sea ice concentration compared to observations from satellite data e g wang et al 2020 cice has gone through several generations of improvements to include snow melt pond and biochemistry active efforts to further improve ice models are ongoing notably nextsim rampal et al 2016 which has gone beyond the standard ice rheology in addition to coupling with a wave model to include ice breakage wave ice interactions has become a concentrated research topic in recent years these studies have enhanced the model ability to provide more information about an ice cover the most advanced study is reported by roach et al 2018a 2019 where an ice cover is described by a joint probability function of thickness and floe size horvat and tziperman 2015 both lateral growth melt and mechanical fracture welding control the evolution of floe size in addition to limiting the floe size dictated by the wave field shen et al 2001 however new ice formed in open water is still instantly combined into the existing ice cover the evolution of new ice has yet to be developed in these ice models new ice formation is important in a coupled atmosphere ice ocean system due to the ice type dependent porosity and salinity and the rate of change of these properties wadhams and wilkinson 1999 doble et al 2003 smedsrud and skogseth 2006 smedsrud 2011 de la rosa et al 2011 smedsrud and martin 2015 new ice formation is also particularly important in the marginal ice zone miz due to its effect on wave attenuation such attenuation has been measured for ice covers consisting large floes tens of meters across formed from fragmentation of pack ice wadhams et al 1988 during the field campaign of seastate and boundary layer physics program conducted in 2015 fall thomson et al 2018 wave ice and atmospheric data were collected simultaneously coupling these data with a wave hindcast using wavewatchiii ww3 ww3dg 2019 rogers et al 2016 extracted the spectral attenuation of waves through grease and pancake ice two major types of ice found in a wave field during freeze up the attenuation rates of grease and pancake ice are different from each other and both show strong damping for high frequency waves thus in view of the increasing wave intensity in the arctic ocean the substantial amount of new ice during autumn freeze up and their effect on wave attenuation it is time to include the dynamics of new ice formation in sea ice models in the present study we describe in detail how to expand existing ice models to include new ice formation by coupling an ice ocean model with a wave model we then apply the coupled interactive model to a test case to evaluate its performance initial ideas of how to build such a model was outlined in shen et al 2020 modeling grease ice formation and including it into a general circulation model have been pioneered by smedsrud 2011 and smedsrud and martin 2015 their studies were motivated by the concern of ocean heat loss to the atmosphere especially in polynyas despite the fact that wave effects and their role in determining the type of new ice were absent from their studies the concepts and discussions in their model development have been helpful for the present study this paper is organized in the following way in section 2 we present the various types of new ice formed during autumn freeze up we then briefly review a series of studies from two decades ago which explained the formation process of pancake ice in a wave field in section 3 we describe the algorithm of implementing the new ice types determined by thermal and wave conditions into an existing ice model in section 4 we discuss the expansion of the wave model and the ice model needed for implementing the new ice types for the wave model we choose the simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 model the wave model will include spectral wave attenuation for different ice types derived from field data the ice model will include details of new ice formation and transformation into solid ice for the ice and the ocean model we choose the regional ocean modeling system roms https www myroms org in which the ice package is imbedded in the ocean model coupling of wave and ice components will be done through the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst warner et al 2019 modeling system section 5 will use the coupled model for a hindcast test and compare the results with observations from satellite and in situ data section 6 discusses the findings and implications conclusion is given in section 7 2 process description the initial growth of an ice cover is from frazil accumulation fig 1a these sub millimeter frazil crystals form in the supercooled water column they flocculate into larger clusters as they float due to buoyancy when wind and waves are present these frazil clusters accumulate on the ocean surface in the convergent zones of the langmuir and other mixed layer circulations to form frazil streaks fig 1b as the surface accumulation increases in thickness and expanse grease ice a slushy layer of clusters on the order of millimeter to centimeter in size form fig 1c over time grease ice often congeals together in shapes of pancakes fig 1d pancakes can grow in size by freezing together with neighbors to form composites and by incorporating interstitial frazils fig 1e field observations have reported pancakes from sub meter to several meters in diameter the formation of grease and pancake ice is absent if the ocean is calm in this case only nilas a thin smooth layer of ice form fig 1f further cooling produces more frazil in open water these frazil crystals continue to spread over the surface as well as deposit under the existing ice cover the existing ice cover thickens through columnar growth and integration of the frazil suspension as freezing continues the open water area shrinks and new ice production diminishes existing young ice covers solidify and thicken to become solid ice at any given time if the wave condition changes young ice may evolve from nilas to grease or pancake ice likewise grease or pancake ice may freeze together to form a level sheet fig 1g and this young sheet ice may disintegrate if waves intensify to form pancake fig 1h or brash ice fig 1i the wave condition and ice strength determine the transformation among the three basic types of new ice level ice nilas or sheet ice pancakes or brash or grease ice with continued cooling young ice thickens and eventually becomes a solid ice cover over the years field and laboratory studies have provided insights into the physical processes involved in the formation of each ice type frazil grease nilas and pancake martin 1981 gave an early review of the frazil ice properties and its formation processes several other important studies thereafter paved the way to build mathematical models for the growth and melt of frazil ice in water bodies as summarized in daly 1994 likewise studies of grease ice formation has also gone from early field observations martin and kauffman 1981 to more recent studies in the arctic smedsrud and skogseth 2006 in the laboratories de la rosa et al 2011 naumann et al 2012 and mathematical models omstedt 1985 smedsrud and martin 2015 matsumura and ohshima 2015 nilas ice has been examined due to the formation of frost flowers which increases the albedo zatko and warren 2015 naumann et al 2012 studied the formation of grease ice and nilas in a laboratory to determine the salinity porosity and thickness of these two types of ice pancake ice formation in the field was first described in lange et al 1989 doble et al 2003 provided a variety of processes during pancake evolution including accretion at the top and congelation growth at the bottom thickening of pancake ice due to rafting was proposed in shen et al 2001 and further studied based on field evidence using laboratory and numerical experiments shen et al 2004 there is also an increasing interest in using remote sensing e g wadhams et al 2018 and in situ data e g roach et al 2018b to quantify pancake ice size and thickness the amount of literature covering each stage of the new ice formation is significant many more references may be found in the studies cited above within each new ice type frazil grease nilas and pancake there are complex processes that control their properties the model we will build here will not attempt to include all details instead we will construct a simplest model to capture the dominant processes describing the evolution of new ice to a solid ice cover in the field at any given time and location frazil young and solid ice may co exist each with its partial concentration three types of young ice nilas pancake or grease ice may also co exist especially when the observational scale is large in the model to be presented in this study such complication will be simplified to allow only one young ice type at any given time and location dictated by the local wave condition a schematic of the new ice formation and evolution to a solid ice cover is shown in fig 2 in this figure the types of ice and transformation from frazil to young ice and from young ice to solid ice are depicted these processes will be described next depending on the age of formation at a given time and location ice covers may be categorized into new ice and solid ice the latter consists of first second and multi year ice they are members of the established ice models new ice includes frazil and young ice we name grease pancake and nilas or refrozen sheet of grease pancake as young ice heat flux and the amount of open water determine the volume rate of frazil production curly gray arrows in fig 2 its surface distribution is specified by thickness and area concentration the type of young ice compatible with the wave condition will be based on theories and experimental data to be described the thermodynamic and mechanical evolution of the solid ice will remain the same as in the existing ice models thickness thresholds hf0 and hy0 in fig 2 will be used to transform frazil to young ice and young ice to solid ice before building a model for the new ice growth we first review some key elements about the formation of frazil ice and the subsequent stages omstedt 1985 and daly 1994 provide details of the fundamental physics of frazil production including nucleation flocculation buoyancy and turbulent mixing following the same basic processes but adding the hydrodynamic forcing due to wind generated surface circulation and ignoring flocculation matsumura and ohshima 2015 quantified the development of frazil and grease ice using a 3 d numerical simulation they found that under a typical wind speed of 10 m s and air temperature of 20 c the frazil accumulation was mainly near the surface with 99 concentration in the first 1 m below surface ignoring flocculation frazil cluster size was not simulated instead they defined a transition from frazil to grease ice according to the depth weighted vertical frazil accumulation when this accumulation was greater than 0 1 m in thickness the ice cover was considered to become grease ice no wave effects were included smedsrud and martin 2015 incorporated grease ice formation into a general circulation model they ignored the distinction between frazil and grease ice and separated the surface layer of frazil accumulation into unsolidified grease and solidify pancake ice the frazil ice formed inside the water body was assumed to instantly float to the surface following the theory developed in smedsrud 2011 the thickness of the grease ice layer was determined by the wind and the current stresses h g 4 9 v g l k r τ a τ w 1 3 where v g was the volume production of grease ice per unit surface area l was the computational grid length and k r was the packing resistance of a grease ice pile the area concentration of this grease ice layer was then a g v g h g they acknowledged that such formulation was grid resolution dependent and thus further improvement was needed based on a laboratory observation de la rosa et al 2011 the surface temperature and heat flux over grease ice were assumed the same as those over open water the transformation rate from grease ice v g to pancake ice v p was proposed to be v p t v p t 0 v g t 0 1 e t t s with t s 1 44 days based on the same laboratory observations the solidified pancake ice then became part of the solid ice cover and followed the same dynamic thermodynamic evolution using this model in a basin wide study smedsrud and martin 2015 found that the total ice volume in the arctic ocean from this refined model was similar to that from the standard cice model but the regional variability produced by the new model in the miz was much more pronounced than the standard model to expand the above studies and include wave effects in new ice formation it is helpful to briefly revisit a conceptual theory behind the ice morphology under the influence of wave actions shen et al 2001 because of the exponential downward decay of wave action in the water body the most important wave effects are on the surface ice layer grease ice on the surface consists of a dense layer of frazil clusters they may freeze together to form pancakes if the concentration is high enough to allow neighboring clusters to interact with each other and if the frozen bond between clusters can survive the tension and bending imposed by the waves the balance between the adhesion and separation determines the size of the pancakes at first this process is controlled by the high frequency and short waves the resulting pancakes are small as the high frequency components damp out the small pancakes may then grow as the wave curvature decreases from this conceptual model the limiting pancake diameter was determined as d b c b λ 2 2 π 2 e a or d t 2 c t λ 2 π 3 ρ i c e g a where b denotes the bending failure case and t the tensile failure case shen et al 2001 the physical parameters involved in the above are wavelength λ wave amplitude a young s modulus e gravitational acceleration g ice density ρ i c e we note that the wave curvature a λ 2 appears in both bending and tensile controlled cases when studying an elastic ice sheet dumont et al 2011 and voermans et al 2020 also used wave curvature to formulate a fracture criterion to delineate fragmented and continuous ice fields parameters c b and c t represent the cumulative strength of the freezing bonding between two ice elements against bending and tension respectively existing pancake ice may raft to mechanically thicken the young ice cover using a balance between the compressive pressure due to pancake collisions and the frictional resistance the equilibrium rafting thickness was derived to be 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 where k c and k r are parameters describing the friction and collisional restitution properties of the pancakes this formulation was theoretically derived and checked against laboratory and discrete element simulations dai et al 2004 we summarize the process to be modeled as follows frazil ice forms in open water in calm water nilas form over the entire open water area with sufficient wave agitation part of the frazil production distributes underneath the solid ice part of it forms streaks in open water the area and thickness of these streaks grow in time as the thickness grows beyond a threshold young ice forms the type of young ice can be grease pancake or a continuous sheet ice dictated by the wave condition as the young ice thickens beyond a threshold it joins the existing solid ice at any stage of the development young ice may switch back and forth between sheet pancake or grease ice depending on the wave condition 3 formulation in this section we describe the algorithm to be included in the expanded ice model it corresponds to fig 2 which shows the growth sequence in a single grid cell from open water the processes include formation of frazil in water surface evolution from frazil to young ice grease pancake or nilas sheet ice and evolution from young ice to solid ice formulations of these three stages will be described next at any given time we separate the surface area in each computational grid into four sub fractions c o c f c y and c s the subscripts represent open water frazil ice young ice and solid ice respectively 3 1 frazil ice ice formation begins when ocean water is supercooled as in the existing ice models we let all frazil ice produced in the water body float to the surface instantly this is a reasonable approximation based on the simulation of matsumura and ohshima 2015 instead of assuming a grid size dependent thickness of the surface frazil accumulation as in smedsrud and martin 2015 we will assume its area concentration instead based on observations surface frazil ice is first concentrated in the zones of convergence due to ocean circulations to form streaks herman et al 2020 these zones then spread to the rest of open water we thus parameterize the area of frazil streaks as c f t 1 e t t f c o where t f is a time scale for frazil suspension to spread over the open water this parameter together with other model parameters to be introduced are discussed in appendix a from physical considerations this time scale should be positively correlated with wind speed in the limit of no wind frazil ice spreads evenly over the whole open water area with t f 0 and 1 e t t f 1 the incremental change of frazil ice concentration is thus 1 δ c f c o δ t t f where δ t is the time step c o 1 c s c y c f is the open water fraction with a known volume production v f calculated from the heat budget frazil ice thickness is then determined as h f v f c f 3 2 young ice grease pancake and nilas as heat loss continues frazil ice accumulates and thickens on the water surface to form young ice the thickness threshold is set at h f 0 0 05 m this young ice may be grease pancake or nilas depending on the water surface condition to determine which ice type is compatible with the wave field we start from the results obtained in shen et al 2001 2004 which provided the relation between the wave condition and the maximum pancake size we define a dimensionless number δ d λ where d is the limiting ice diameter dictated by either the bending or the tensile failure 2 δ b d b λ c b λ 2 π 2 e a δ t d t λ 2 c t π 3 ρ i c e g a since the theory was developed under a monochromatic wave to be consistent we will use λ mean wavelength and a significant wave height 2 2 for field conditions parameters c b and c t units n m2 are the cumulative strength of the freezing bonding between two neighboring ice elements against bending and tension respectively these two parameters should be related to temperature and salinity with a decreasing trend as temperature or salinity increase c t and c b e are unknown for young ice we carried out a sensitivity test for a range of c t and c b e in appendix b if pancakes form from open water and continue to grow by connecting with neighbors laboratory data favored tensile control shen et al 2004 field data reported in roach et al 2018b showed that both tensile and bending control could explain the observed pancake size it is conceivable that both cases may apply in the field depending on which failure mode dominates in our model we set δ min δ b δ t so that whichever failure criterion is reached first decides the size of the pancakes for a given wave condition if the bond strength between elements in a pancake is sufficient to let the pancake grow to be 1 4 the wavelength then it can grow indefinitely because the curvature a λ 2 that determines the pancake size from either bending or tensile failure repeats every 1 4 wavelength hence if δ 1 4 nilas or sheet ice form at the other extreme demarcation between grease and pancake ice is not obvious pancakes grow from frazil clusters continuously until they reach the maximum size compatible with the wave condition there is no obvious mechanistic reason to define the smallest pancake ice we thus use an observational criterion to artificially define a smallest pancake ice d m i n below which the surface ice is grease ice with the above arguments we have the following criteria to demarcate the young ice types for a given wave field 3 δ d m i n λ grease d m i n λ δ 1 4 pancake δ 1 4 nilas in the above we set d m i n 2 cm based on many laboratory observations when the surface ice elements were below 2 cm no circular shape formation was detectable and the surface layer resembled a soupy slush shen et al 2001 2004 pancake grease ice formed in wave conditions may raft to form layers rafting stops when the friction resistance of a pile of pancakes and the compressive pressure between pancakes balance either other the final equilibrium rafting thickness has been derived as 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 dai et al 2004 in the model to be developed we do not allow the rafted pile to collapse hence 4 h y max 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 h y o l d where h y is the thickness of this young ice and h y o l d is the thickness in the last time step 3 3 transformation from young to solid ice the final step of ice formation is the transformation from young to solid ice the threshold of solid ice formation is a crucial element in thermodynamics as it affects heat flux at the water ice and air ice interface this threshold is commonly called the collection thickness in sea ice models for the present study we will use h y 0 0 25 m for this threshold a discussion of this choice is in appendix c as autumn progresses to winter with limited fetch columnar growth under the existing ice increases frazil production in the small remaining open water area surrounding the solid ice reduces young ice contribution to the overall ice cover gradually diminishes 3 4 thermodynamics and dynamics of existing ice in the entire progression from step 3 1 to 3 3 i e open water to solid ice cover

additional formulation in the expanded model shown above is to treat the young ice and frazil ice for which we will assume that all relevant thermal properties of the young ice and frazil ice are the same as open water for grease ice this assumption is based on laboratory data from de la rosa et al 2011 for pancake and nilas sheet ice the appropriateness of this assumption remains to be seen in any case since the thickness threshold for young ice to transform to solid ice is set at 0 25 m its insolation effect should be small note that the above formulation has not included lateral growth melt which is left for future work the dynamics of the entire ice cover is expanded from the existing ice model to treat the forcing for solid ice young ice and frazil ice differently 6 d d t v s v y

young ice and solid ice is listed in appendix a 4 wave model and coupling with ice ocean model in this section we describe the modifications introduced to the wave model to consider different ice types and the coupling of ice ccean and wave models 4 1 attenuation of waves under multiple ice types most wave models including the one we will use are based on the radiative transfer equation 7 f f

e is the ice area concentration for the miz the group velocity inside an ice cover approximates that in open water collins et al 2018 terms on the right side of eq 7 represent processes that generate dissipate or redistribute wave energy s i n is wave growth by the wind s d s w is wave decay due to whitecapping s n l 3 and s n l 4 are nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions s d s b and s d s b r are wave decay due to bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking s i c e is wave attenuation due to ice ice damping only happens in an ice covered area and wind energy input and whitecapping are assumed to happen only in open water the rate of ice induced attenuation s i c e is needed for different ice types a wave spectrum f f θ consists of many frequency components each is related to a complex wave number k f k r f i k i f through the dispersion relation attenuation of the wave amplitude is reflected in the imaginary part of this wave number through e i k x σ t e k i x e i k r x σ t where σ 2 π f is the angular frequency the dissipation term is related to k i through s i c e 2 c g k i f field studies suggest different ice types have different spectral attenuation rates rogers et al 2016 different theories have been proposed to quantify this attenuation as discussed in several reviews shen 2019 squire 2020 it is inconclusive at present how to choose from these theories and how to quantify the parameters in these theories empirical formulas have been proposed to bypass this difficulty a six degree polynomial k i f c 0 c 1 f c 2 f 2 c 3 f 3 c 4 f 4 c 5 f 5 c 6 f 6 has been recommended to represent all data obtained so far collins and rogers 2017 in which c 0 to c 6 are constants that have different values corresponding to different ice types meylan et al 2014 proposed a simpler equation 8 k i f c 2 f 2 c 4 f 4 to fit data obtained in the antarctic miz with c 2 1 06 1 0 3 and c 4 2 3 1 0 2 the data set was from an ice field consisted of floes around 10 m in size we will assign these values to the solid ice type rogers et al 2018 used the same equation to fit data obtained in a field of pancakes mixed in frazil ice they found that with the same type of buoy used in the antarctic miz c 2 0 284 1 0 3 and c 4 1 53 1 0 2 we will assign these values to pancake ice for grease and frazil ice we digitize data from rogers et al 2016 their figure 8 the two fitting curves are shown in fig 3 with the values of c 2 and c 4 listed in table a 1 for nilas the attenuation is set to zero it should be noted that in different papers the method used to derive attenuation from buoy data was not the same meylan et al 2014 compared wave energy between two buoys to obtain the attenuation coefficients rogers et al 2016 used model hindcasts to match the buoy measurements at different locations the best matched k i values were chosen for each ice type observed at the buoy sites potential differences of attenuation coefficients caused by different data analyses may exist rogers et al 2021 the validity of these empirical formulas will be further discussed in section 6 3 to implement different attenuation rates for different ice types the ice damping term in eq 7 is modified to 9 c i c e s i c e c s s solid c y s young c f s frazil 10 s solid f 2 c g k i solid s young f 2 c g k i young s frazil f 2 c g k i frazil where s solid s young and s frazil are sea ice sink terms derived from the corresponding exponential attenuation rates k i solid k i young and k i frazil the term s young or correspondingly the damping coefficient k i young depends on the possible types pancake grease or nilas these types are determined by the value of δ from eq 3 4 2 implementation and wave ice interaction coupling to implement the above attenuation rates in a wave model we need to choose a wave model both ww3 and swan are well established third generation spectral wave models widely used in simulating waves in the ocean for the present study we choose swan which is developed to compute random short crested wind generated waves in coastal regions comparisons of ww3 and swan in the north sea show that both models give similar spectra de león et al 2018 for the combined ice ocean model to be coupled with swan we choose roms in which the ice package is imbedded in the ocean model the sea ice model in roms is a combination of ice thermodynamic model mellor and kantha 1989 and ice dynamics model hunke and dukowicz 1997 the solid ice is considered to have only one ice thickness category in roms to focus on the effect of new ice this choice is appropriate to realize the interaction of waves and ice the coupling part is completed by coawst variables conveyed from roms to swan include solid ice concentration c s and thickness h s young concentration c y and thickness h y frazil ice concentration c f and thickness h f and ice type in young ice δ in turn the significant wave height s w h and the mean wavelength w l are conveyed from swan to roms 5 testing of the coupled model we now use the coupled model in a test case 5 1 numerical experiment design the test is carried out in the bohai sea due to its location 37 41 n 117 122 e bohai sea ice cover is completely seasonal ice in the bohai sea forms as early as december and melts completely the following march each year the bohai sea ice experiences a complete cycle of freezing and melting because of the low latitude the freezing is slow and the period before young ice becomes solid ice is long these conditions emphasize the need to pay more attention to young ice processes the numerical experiment is designed as follows the domain of interest 37 41 n 117 5 122 5 e for the coupled roms and swan model is named d1 shown in fig 4 for roms the spatial resolution of arakawa c grid is 1 15 1 15 the depth is divided into 11 layers time resolution for the 3 d equations is 30 s and 10 timesteps for the 2 d equations between each 3 d timestep the bathymetry is interpolated from the etopo1 dataset https www ngdc noaa gov mgg global global html and each grid point is smoothed by the 4 surrounding points to avoid numerical collapse caused by too large terrain gradient all meteorological data are from ecmwf reanalysis interim era interim products the reason for this choice of data set versus the more recent era5 is to match the swan model setting suitable for the bohai sea lv et al 2014 the surface air relative humidity h a i r 100 6 11 1 0 7 5 t a i r 237 7 t a i r 6 11 1 0 7 5 t d e w 237 7 t d e w is calculated by the surface air temperature and the dewpoint temperature which are from the era interim data set too the boundary and initial conditions including sea surface height vertically integrated momentum water velocity temperature and salinity these data are interpolated from the 41 layer hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom and the global ocean forecasting system gofs 1 12 5 analysis for tidal forcing the harmonic constituents are calculated from tide model driver tmd with eight principle constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 it is found that the surface air temperature from era interim does not agree with the in situ data for bohai sea as shown in fig 4 the in situ data was measured at an oil platform 40 m above the sea surface table d 3 a 0 24 c needs to be added for the corresponding surface temperature based on a general rule of a decrease of 6 c per 1000 m increase in elevation the time resolution of era interim data is 3 h and 1 h for the measured data the measurements were carried out during daytime 8 00 18 00 local time by comparing these temperature data at the corresponding time the in situ air temperature is in general above the era interim data with an average of 2 19 c higher thus we increase the era interim surface air temperature by 2 c in the test case incidentally though slightly better the more recent era5 data was also below the in situ data at this site 1 67 o c instead of 2 19 o c the parameter settings for running roms follow the example of northwest gulf of alaska in the technical manual for a coupled sea ice ocean circulation model hedström 2009 the simulation covers the winter of 2018 2019 the bathymetry and wind forcing data for swan are the same as in roms to establish the boundary conditions for the wave field in domain d1 we first run swan to generate the wave field driven by wind in d2 35 41 e 117 5 127 e fig 5 this provides the wave conditions at the east open boundary for d1 the grids in this study are regularly spaced in latitude longitude with a spatial resolution of 1 15 1 15 the spectra are composed of 24 directions uniformly discretized from 0 to 360 degree and 32 frequencies logarithmically discretized from 0 05 to 0 96 hz the swan model is run in the third generation and non stationary mode with komen komen et al 1984 exponential growth of wind input quadruplet wave interaction dissipation due to whitecapping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking are taken into account in the simulation the parameters of whitecapping dissipation cds2 and collins bottom friction cfw are set to 2 2e 5 and 0 01 respectively by comparing with field data at 9 stations lv et al 2014 showed that this setting was optimum for swan in the bohai sea driven by the wind data from era interim to ensure the accuracy of the wave simulations we compare the simulated significant wave height with records from the w0101 buoy located at the bohai strait as shown by the red square in fig 5 fig 6 shows that the simulated significant wave height agrees well with measurements exhibiting a correlation coefficient of 0 93 5 2 comparisons of model results with modis the sea ice area concentration and effective thickness ice thickness times ice concentration a measure of ice volume are now compared with modis images we choose january 8 2019 and february 7 2019 which are less cloudy and the sea ice coverage in the liaodong bay is clear in fig 7 a d are sea ice coverage from modis images b e are the model ice concentration c s c y c f and c f the effective thickness c s h s c y h y c f h f of all ice types the model ice concentration is in general consistent with the satellite observation but more so in the northeast part of the liaodong bay the model results show high ice concentration at both northeast and northwest corners of liaodong bay but very different for effective thickness in the northwest the ice is thin in the range of 2 9 cm and it is much thicker in the northeast in the range of 17 32 cm 5 3 comparisons of model results with in situ observations in liaodong bay the ice conditions observed at two locations jz93 and jz202 in the liaodong bay fig 5 are used to examine the model results the observations include air temperature ice total concentration mean and maximum ice thickness and the occurrence of ice type appendix d figs 8 and 9 show the time series of observed ice concentration ice thickness observed ice types and the corresponding model results all in situ data were obtained from 8 00 to 18 00 local time we pick the model results from the corresponding period for comparison in fig 8 blue red and black dashed lines are model ice concentration of young ice frazil ice and solid ice respectively while the purple dots are measured total ice concentration the in situ data do not separate concentration into different types from december 15 to december 28 2018 at jz93 sea ice appeared very early and maintained a relatively high concentration after a period of ice free condition while at jz202 the ice concentration was sporadic until february 2019 though the trend is consistent with observations the model ice concentrations are above the observations most of the time we note these two platforms especially jz202 are very near the ice edge with maximum type averaged ice thickness less than 0 16 m fig 9 hence ice appeared during the night and diminished rapidly at daytime on some days before february the observation data were once a day table d 1 the model output was every 6 h any variations in between were not represented the occasional high ice concentration in the model in the beginning of the winter was not observed this could be due to the transient nature of the ice cover during formation and the long duration between observations later in winter the absence of lateral melting in the present model and the strong dynamical change of ice conditions at these two locations might have contributed to the difference between the observation and model results additionally the presence of frazil ice is under represented in fig 8 because of its rapid transition to young ice which makes them easily missed in the sparse output in fig 9 the orange and yellow dots are measured mean and maximum ice thickness and the dashed gray line is the type averaged model ice thickness defined as c s h s c y h y c f h f c s c y c f fig 9 shows good agreement between model results and observations where the model ice thickness is mostly within the band between the mean and maximum thickness some thin ice under 5 cm simulated by the present model is not observed before february at jz202 the in situ observation categorized ice types as follows initial frazil ice rind 5 cm ice film nilas 10 cm elastic thin ice pancake 10 cm gray ice 10 15 cm gray white ice 15 30 cm white ice 30 cm fig 10 compares the observed ice types table d 2 with the model results blue dots indicate pancake or nilas were observed which we classify as young ice and black dots indicate gray white ice or gray ice were observed which we classify as solid ice blue line and black line are model concentration of young and solid ice respectively fig 10 a shows that a higher concentration of a given ice type corresponds to a higher occurrence of that ice type being observed the model results are in good agreement with observations at jz93 but at jz202 as shown in fig 10 b solid ice was very rarely observed while modeled solid ice persisted in the beginning of february albeit at low values the lack of observed solid ice at this location is possibly due to its low concentration the occurrence of young ice is higher than solid ice at both jz93 and jz202 in fig 10 and table d 2 we omit the frazil and ice rind category because they are difficult to observe from distance hence less reliable as mentioned in sections 3 and 4 young ice could be pancake grease or nilas depending on the wave conditions eq 4 in fig 11 the blue and red dots are observed nilas and pancake ice and the orange line is δ which represents wave conditions the dividing line is δ 1 4 above which nilas is expected and below which pancake and grease ice are expected blue dots indicate nilas are observed in the in situ data and orange dots indicate that pancakes are observed this comparison shows 70 of the observed nilas and 75 of the observed pancake ice are consistent with the model results at jz93 and 66 of the observed nilas and 70 of the observed pancake ice are consistent with the model results at jz202 grease ice is absent from both the model results and the in situ data considering bohai sea especially liaodong bay is a coastal region surrounded by land on three sides wave amplitudes are usually small hence it is reasonable that nilas are frequently observed but grease ice is absent 6 results and discussion 6 1 model results of sea ice fig 12 shows the distributions of the effective thickness for frazil pancake nilas and solid ice averaged over the whole freezing stage of 2018 2019 the distribution of solid ice is concentrated in the northeast part of liaodong bay pancake ice and nilas have a similar distribution they are more concentrated in the northwest part of liaodong bay this result is less due to thermodynamics but more due to the ice drift direction which mostly oscillates between northeast and southwest when most of the northeast part of liaodong bay is covered with solid ice the newly produced young ice can only be distributed around the edge of solid ice in this test case 62 15 of young ice is pancake ice and the rest is nilas the effective thickness of frazil ice is much smaller compared to young ice and solid ice with a mean effective thickness less than 10 3 m when young ice and solid ice are formed part of the produced frazil is simply attached to the bottom of the existing ice cover surface frazil is distributed mostly along the coastline and the edge of the ice cover next we compare the results from two numerical experiments the first one is the model proposed in this paper which we call the multiple ice module the other one is the roms ice module in the standard roms all ice is considered solid ice new ice becomes part of the existing solid ice instantly the default collection thickness in roms ice module is 1 m with this value the roms ice is much thicker black line in fig 13 than all other model results in this figure the thickness is the mean value over all of the ice covered cells in domain d1 fig 5 for a fairer comparison the collection thickness in roms ice module is changed to 0 25 m which is the threshold for young ice to become solid ice used in the multiple ice module as shown in fig 13 the roms ice with the threshold of 0 25 m has a comparable thickness with the solid ice obtained from the multiple ice module the average thickness of frazil ice young ice solid ice and roms ice with 0 25 m threshold are 0 027 0 056 0 278 and 0 224 m respectively using the multiple ice module solid ice appears about 200 h later than using roms ice in the multiple ice module formation of ice begins with frazil ice and young ice solid ice does not form until young ice has sufficiently thickened by heat loss or wave rafting the difference of appearance of solid ice and roms ice has an impact on heat flux and wave attenuation this time difference may be negligible in very cold regions when ice grows fast but it becomes notable in low latitude areas that freeze slowly for the miz where new ice formation is most dynamic the advancement and retreat of ice edges may also be more sensitive to the treatment of the new ice fig 14 a and b show the ice volume and area from roms ice respectively and the corresponding values for frazil young and solid ice from the multiple ice module again these data are the mean over all ice covered cells in domain d1 in the beginning of freezing young ice and frazil ice form before they are transformed into solid ice at this point solid ice barely exists from the multiple ice module while the area from roms ice steadily develops with the continuous loss of heat young ice evolves into solid ice and solid ice gradually dominates if we take all ice in the multiple ice module as a group from fig 14 a and b roms ice has smaller concentration and greater thickness ice in the multiple ice module occupies a larger area but has a thinner average thickness compared to roms ice more than 14 of ice volume forms from the multiple ice module on average over this period this difference might be caused by several factors first young ice is thermally more dynamic because it is thinner second the ocean air heat flux is treated differently in the two modules since all relevant thermal properties of the young ice and frazil ice are assumed the same as open water in fig 15 the black line and blue line are the heat flux from ocean to air from the roms ice module and the multiple ice module respectively the difference between the two is plotted as the orange line with a magnified vertical scale as fig 15 shows with the multiple ice module the ocean loses more heat except for the last part when ice is melting similar findings are also reported in smedsrud and martin 2015 in which they included grease ice as a distinct category and assumed its thermal properties were the same as open water the delayed appearance of solid ice in the multiple ice module also allows more heat loss from the perspective of heat flux taking young ice and frazil ice into account increases the heat loss of the ocean during the freezing period 6 2 model results of significant wave height the larger ice area in the multiple ice module not only affects heat flux at the ocean air interface but also enhances damping of waves energy three numerical experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of different ice modules on waves in the liaodong bay 1 waves with no interaction with ice 2 waves with attenuation by roms ice 3 waves with multiple ice types fig 16 shows waves with the multiple ice module are significantly damped compared to waves with roms ice and no ice the larger ice area from the multiple ice module blocks more wind input and simultaneously damps more wave energy although the attenuation from frazil grease nilas and pancake ice are smaller than attenuation of solid ice fig 3 the multiple ice module still attenuates more wave energy due to the larger ice area fig 17 shows the distribution of averaged significant wave height in the bohai sea the attenuation on wave energy in liaodong bay is obvious from both the multiple ice module and roms ice module the multiple ice module yields a larger ice cover area hence more ability to damp waves but at the same time the damped waves have less ability to transform sheet ice to pancake or brash ice thus maintaining the thermal insulation better we do not have wave data in this region except the buoy in the bohai strait fig 5 to verify the present results 6 3 model improvements needed the proposed model is a first step towards coupling wave and ice models as interactive components the most obvious improvements needed are listed below 1 appendix a provides parameters we used in the present study to complete the multiple ice module some of these parameter values used such as t f 1 44 day in eq 1 and k c 1 in eq 4 are tentative a sensitivity study of these parameters is desired 2 based on a laboratory observation de la rosa et al 2011 the surface temperature and heat flux over grease ice were assumed the same as those over open water we further assume that this assumption applies to young ice whether such assumption is correct needs to be seen concerning the surface temperature we found that the era interim data was lower than the in situ measurement hence the air temperature is adjusted in the input of this test case by adding the mean discrepancy 2 c an independent check using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep cfsv2 data at a nearby location shows 5 c higher temperature than the era interim data these comparisons underline the importance of having in situ data to calibrate the model input especially for small scale and more dynamically changing locations 3 the formulas used here to quantify wave attenuation in different ice types are empirical they presently are only frequency and ice type dependent as discussed in thomson et al 2021 instrument or measurement noise may affect the high frequency part of the measured spectra thus alter the polynomial fit in addition to other spurious effects such as roll over rogers et al 2021 used extensive buoy data collected in the antarctic marginal ice zone to revisit the spectral attenuation behavior they removed the high frequency part to avoid noise contamination and fitted the data with both the same polynomial as adopted here and several other simple power laws the resulting polynomial fit had coefficients that were on the same order as adopted here for pancake ice however more importantly their data analysis showed that spectral attenuation depended on not only frequency but also ice thickness wave amplitude and proximity to the ice edge regarding attenuation for very high frequency waves rabault et al 2017 showed in a field experiment that for 0 8 1 hz waves the attenuation in grease ice was on the order of 0 1 m 1 such high attenuation at very high frequencies has also been found in laboratory studies newyear and martin 1997 zhao and shen 2015 once validated in field conditions these high frequency attenuation will certainly change the empirical formulas future field studies will improve both quantity and quality of the data to modify the formulas used here in the bohai sea these additional considerations are probably less important due to its mild ice condition 0 3 m ice thickness for most part and low wave activities wave height 1 m and peak frequency around 0 1 0 2 hz 4 several major mechanisms already considered in cice and other sea ice models need to be implemented in the present model for example ice floe size distribution ice lateral melting and ice fracture welding need to be included the resulting model concentration is likely to reduce at least during ice retreat with these improvements 5 comparing with the in situ data the present model appears capable of simulating ice types relatively reliably however its ability to model the wave conditions has not been confirmed due to the lack of wave data at the test site we plan to test a new case where both ice and wave conditions are available 7 conclusion a parameterization of new ice formation in a wave field has been developed the present model couples ice and wave as interactive components the wave field dictates the types of new ice frazil grease pancake and nilas that would form and in turn the types of ice determines the wave damping the interaction of multiple types of ice and wave damping is first formulated based on existing theories field observations and experimental data these formulations are then implemented to expand roms and swan and then using coawst to couple the two ice types depend on the thermal condition and the wave field simultaneously the spectral attenuation of wave energy under an ice cover depends on the ice type the model is tested in the bohai sea a coastal sea with a seasonal ice cover we simulated the winter season from december 2018 to march 2019 the results show a reasonable comparison of ice concentration with the modis images the model is capable of producing a good comparison of ice type and thickness when compared with in situ data by incorporating multiple types of new ice determined by the combination of thermodynamics and the wave field in our test case we have found 1 the appearance of solid ice is delayed 2 more ice volume is produced and more area is covered by ice in the freezing period 3 ocean and ice lose more heat to the air which increases ice growth as shown in smedsrud and martin 2015 we believe the above observations are independent of locations in addition we have found that wave attenuation is enhanced through multiple types of ice because of the larger ice area however this outcome may be a result of the generally thin ice condition as in bohai sea in regions with much thicker ice if wave attenuation is indeed strongly affected by ice thickness then solid ice may play a stronger role and the effect of new ice may become less important the coupled model has many parameters that may be site specific for instance the threshold of young ice transforming to solid ice might need tuning in different domains in view of the continuous development undertaken in the current ice and wave models corresponding improvements can be expected for the present model credit authorship contribution statement che yue software data curation formal analysis methodology validation writing original

surface water and ice velocity respectively c a and c w are the drag coefficients at the air ice and water ice interface respectively from lu et al 2011 the water drag coefficient for a 1 km smooth floe was about 3 4 5 4 1 0 3 and for ice in polynya was about 1 5 3 1 0 3 the polynya ice was a combination of solid ice young ice and open water from these data we set c w 4 5 1 0 3 for solid ice and half of that for young ice for air drag we set c a 3 1 0 3 for solid ice and c a 1 5 1 0 3 for young ice these values produce ice drift velocities that agree reasonably well with in situ data figs a 1

ice both appear p means only pancake ice appears and p n means pancake ice and nilas ice appear from ning et al 2009 and the in situ observations fig 10 and table d 2 only pancake and nilas were observed therefore we set c t 1 102 kg m 1 s 1 and c b e 1 10 2 in the test case appendix c the transformation threshold from frazil ice to young ice and young ice to solid ice the minimum thickness of solid ice in the bohai sea is 0 1 to 0 3 m ning et al 2009 we take 0 25 m as the threshold for young ice to evolve into solid ice this value is close to the recommended collection thickness 0 2 m from sansiviero et al 2017 the thickness of the accumulated frazil ice layer from observations is on the order of centimeters drucker et al 2003 we thus take 0 05 m as the threshold for frazil ice to evolve into young ice appendix d field data sea ice data containing ice concentration thickness type and air temperature in the winter of 2018 2019 were obtained from the jz93 and jz202 oil platforms the two platforms are equipped with a comprehensive system to monitor sea ice this ice data collection started in the 1990s part of the data and data processing is reported in zhang et al 2017 ice thickness and concentration are determined by analyzing images from videos and photos ice type is manually observed and recorded a weather station is used to record air temperature and other meteorological parameters the relevant data for the present study are provided below in the following table the ice types are defined as nilas 10 cm elastic thin ice pancake 10 cm gray ice 10 15 cm

23878,a parameterization of new ice formation in a wave field has been developed detailed processes of new sea ice growth with multiple ice types nilas grease and pancake ice and associated wave attenuation by different sea ice types are presented and implemented into a coupled roms and swan model sea ice formation includes growth and transformation of frazil grease pancake nilas and solid ice ice types are determined by thermal condition and the wave fields simultaneously the attenuation of wave energy through the ice cover is dependent on ice types the two processes are coupled by coawst the resulting coupled model is applied to the bohai sea when compared with in situ data from oil platforms the model performed well in distinguishing solid ice pancake and nilas when compared with previous ice models without the consideration of new ice types the appearance of solid ice is delayed the total ice area and ice volume are increased solid ice thickness is increased while the type averaged thickness is reduced and heat flux from the ocean to air is increased during the freezing phase by considering the new ice formation wave attenuation in the test case is enhanced keywords new ice formation wave ice interaction multiple ice types 1 introduction the areal coverage of summertime arctic sea ice has experienced a rapid reduction in recent years thoman et al 2020 there are two immediate consequences from the expanding open water as the ice cover continues to shrink one is the increased fetch for wave generation the other is the amount and the type of new grown ice during freeze up thomson et al 2016 2018 studied the autumn wind wave and ice conditions from 1992 to 2014 in the beaufort and chukchi seas they found no change of the wind speed during this period but the waves increased in peak period 0 04 s year and significant wave height 0 01 m year they also found prevalence of pancake ice well documented in the southern ocean but rarely seen in the arctic until recent years these observations indicate waves have begun to influence the formation of ice covers in the arctic the widely used ice model cice hunke et al 2008 includes both dynamic and thermodynamic processes motion and deformation of ice covers are determined by the surface tilt wind and current forcing and internal stresses their thickness is divided into categories heat flux and mechanical ridging control growth decay of each thickness category and transfer between categories newly formed ice in open water during freeze up is considered to turn into solid ice instantly to join the thinnest ice category despite such simplifications present sea ice models are able to well capture the spatial distribution of sea ice concentration compared to observations from satellite data e g wang et al 2020 cice has gone through several generations of improvements to include snow melt pond and biochemistry active efforts to further improve ice models are ongoing notably nextsim rampal et al 2016 which has gone beyond the standard ice rheology in addition to coupling with a wave model to include ice breakage wave ice interactions has become a concentrated research topic in recent years these studies have enhanced the model ability to provide more information about an ice cover the most advanced study is reported by roach et al 2018a 2019 where an ice cover is described by a joint probability function of thickness and floe size horvat and tziperman 2015 both lateral growth melt and mechanical fracture welding control the evolution of floe size in addition to limiting the floe size dictated by the wave field shen et al 2001 however new ice formed in open water is still instantly combined into the existing ice cover the evolution of new ice has yet to be developed in these ice models new ice formation is important in a coupled atmosphere ice ocean system due to the ice type dependent porosity and salinity and the rate of change of these properties wadhams and wilkinson 1999 doble et al 2003 smedsrud and skogseth 2006 smedsrud 2011 de la rosa et al 2011 smedsrud and martin 2015 new ice formation is also particularly important in the marginal ice zone miz due to its effect on wave attenuation such attenuation has been measured for ice covers consisting large floes tens of meters across formed from fragmentation of pack ice wadhams et al 1988 during the field campaign of seastate and boundary layer physics program conducted in 2015 fall thomson et al 2018 wave ice and atmospheric data were collected simultaneously coupling these data with a wave hindcast using wavewatchiii ww3 ww3dg 2019 rogers et al 2016 extracted the spectral attenuation of waves through grease and pancake ice two major types of ice found in a wave field during freeze up the attenuation rates of grease and pancake ice are different from each other and both show strong damping for high frequency waves thus in view of the increasing wave intensity in the arctic ocean the substantial amount of new ice during autumn freeze up and their effect on wave attenuation it is time to include the dynamics of new ice formation in sea ice models in the present study we describe in detail how to expand existing ice models to include new ice formation by coupling an ice ocean model with a wave model we then apply the coupled interactive model to a test case to evaluate its performance initial ideas of how to build such a model was outlined in shen et al 2020 modeling grease ice formation and including it into a general circulation model have been pioneered by smedsrud 2011 and smedsrud and martin 2015 their studies were motivated by the concern of ocean heat loss to the atmosphere especially in polynyas despite the fact that wave effects and their role in determining the type of new ice were absent from their studies the concepts and discussions in their model development have been helpful for the present study this paper is organized in the following way in section 2 we present the various types of new ice formed during autumn freeze up we then briefly review a series of studies from two decades ago which explained the formation process of pancake ice in a wave field in section 3 we describe the algorithm of implementing the new ice types determined by thermal and wave conditions into an existing ice model in section 4 we discuss the expansion of the wave model and the ice model needed for implementing the new ice types for the wave model we choose the simulating waves nearshore swan booij et al 1999 model the wave model will include spectral wave attenuation for different ice types derived from field data the ice model will include details of new ice formation and transformation into solid ice for the ice and the ocean model we choose the regional ocean modeling system roms https www myroms org in which the ice package is imbedded in the ocean model coupling of wave and ice components will be done through the coupled ocean atmosphere wave sediment transport coawst warner et al 2019 modeling system section 5 will use the coupled model for a hindcast test and compare the results with observations from satellite and in situ data section 6 discusses the findings and implications conclusion is given in section 7 2 process description the initial growth of an ice cover is from frazil accumulation fig 1a these sub millimeter frazil crystals form in the supercooled water column they flocculate into larger clusters as they float due to buoyancy when wind and waves are present these frazil clusters accumulate on the ocean surface in the convergent zones of the langmuir and other mixed layer circulations to form frazil streaks fig 1b as the surface accumulation increases in thickness and expanse grease ice a slushy layer of clusters on the order of millimeter to centimeter in size form fig 1c over time grease ice often congeals together in shapes of pancakes fig 1d pancakes can grow in size by freezing together with neighbors to form composites and by incorporating interstitial frazils fig 1e field observations have reported pancakes from sub meter to several meters in diameter the formation of grease and pancake ice is absent if the ocean is calm in this case only nilas a thin smooth layer of ice form fig 1f further cooling produces more frazil in open water these frazil crystals continue to spread over the surface as well as deposit under the existing ice cover the existing ice cover thickens through columnar growth and integration of the frazil suspension as freezing continues the open water area shrinks and new ice production diminishes existing young ice covers solidify and thicken to become solid ice at any given time if the wave condition changes young ice may evolve from nilas to grease or pancake ice likewise grease or pancake ice may freeze together to form a level sheet fig 1g and this young sheet ice may disintegrate if waves intensify to form pancake fig 1h or brash ice fig 1i the wave condition and ice strength determine the transformation among the three basic types of new ice level ice nilas or sheet ice pancakes or brash or grease ice with continued cooling young ice thickens and eventually becomes a solid ice cover over the years field and laboratory studies have provided insights into the physical processes involved in the formation of each ice type frazil grease nilas and pancake martin 1981 gave an early review of the frazil ice properties and its formation processes several other important studies thereafter paved the way to build mathematical models for the growth and melt of frazil ice in water bodies as summarized in daly 1994 likewise studies of grease ice formation has also gone from early field observations martin and kauffman 1981 to more recent studies in the arctic smedsrud and skogseth 2006 in the laboratories de la rosa et al 2011 naumann et al 2012 and mathematical models omstedt 1985 smedsrud and martin 2015 matsumura and ohshima 2015 nilas ice has been examined due to the formation of frost flowers which increases the albedo zatko and warren 2015 naumann et al 2012 studied the formation of grease ice and nilas in a laboratory to determine the salinity porosity and thickness of these two types of ice pancake ice formation in the field was first described in lange et al 1989 doble et al 2003 provided a variety of processes during pancake evolution including accretion at the top and congelation growth at the bottom thickening of pancake ice due to rafting was proposed in shen et al 2001 and further studied based on field evidence using laboratory and numerical experiments shen et al 2004 there is also an increasing interest in using remote sensing e g wadhams et al 2018 and in situ data e g roach et al 2018b to quantify pancake ice size and thickness the amount of literature covering each stage of the new ice formation is significant many more references may be found in the studies cited above within each new ice type frazil grease nilas and pancake there are complex processes that control their properties the model we will build here will not attempt to include all details instead we will construct a simplest model to capture the dominant processes describing the evolution of new ice to a solid ice cover in the field at any given time and location frazil young and solid ice may co exist each with its partial concentration three types of young ice nilas pancake or grease ice may also co exist especially when the observational scale is large in the model to be presented in this study such complication will be simplified to allow only one young ice type at any given time and location dictated by the local wave condition a schematic of the new ice formation and evolution to a solid ice cover is shown in fig 2 in this figure the types of ice and transformation from frazil to young ice and from young ice to solid ice are depicted these processes will be described next depending on the age of formation at a given time and location ice covers may be categorized into new ice and solid ice the latter consists of first second and multi year ice they are members of the established ice models new ice includes frazil and young ice we name grease pancake and nilas or refrozen sheet of grease pancake as young ice heat flux and the amount of open water determine the volume rate of frazil production curly gray arrows in fig 2 its surface distribution is specified by thickness and area concentration the type of young ice compatible with the wave condition will be based on theories and experimental data to be described the thermodynamic and mechanical evolution of the solid ice will remain the same as in the existing ice models thickness thresholds hf0 and hy0 in fig 2 will be used to transform frazil to young ice and young ice to solid ice before building a model for the new ice growth we first review some key elements about the formation of frazil ice and the subsequent stages omstedt 1985 and daly 1994 provide details of the fundamental physics of frazil production including nucleation flocculation buoyancy and turbulent mixing following the same basic processes but adding the hydrodynamic forcing due to wind generated surface circulation and ignoring flocculation matsumura and ohshima 2015 quantified the development of frazil and grease ice using a 3 d numerical simulation they found that under a typical wind speed of 10 m s and air temperature of 20 c the frazil accumulation was mainly near the surface with 99 concentration in the first 1 m below surface ignoring flocculation frazil cluster size was not simulated instead they defined a transition from frazil to grease ice according to the depth weighted vertical frazil accumulation when this accumulation was greater than 0 1 m in thickness the ice cover was considered to become grease ice no wave effects were included smedsrud and martin 2015 incorporated grease ice formation into a general circulation model they ignored the distinction between frazil and grease ice and separated the surface layer of frazil accumulation into unsolidified grease and solidify pancake ice the frazil ice formed inside the water body was assumed to instantly float to the surface following the theory developed in smedsrud 2011 the thickness of the grease ice layer was determined by the wind and the current stresses h g 4 9 v g l k r τ a τ w 1 3 where v g was the volume production of grease ice per unit surface area l was the computational grid length and k r was the packing resistance of a grease ice pile the area concentration of this grease ice layer was then a g v g h g they acknowledged that such formulation was grid resolution dependent and thus further improvement was needed based on a laboratory observation de la rosa et al 2011 the surface temperature and heat flux over grease ice were assumed the same as those over open water the transformation rate from grease ice v g to pancake ice v p was proposed to be v p t v p t 0 v g t 0 1 e t t s with t s 1 44 days based on the same laboratory observations the solidified pancake ice then became part of the solid ice cover and followed the same dynamic thermodynamic evolution using this model in a basin wide study smedsrud and martin 2015 found that the total ice volume in the arctic ocean from this refined model was similar to that from the standard cice model but the regional variability produced by the new model in the miz was much more pronounced than the standard model to expand the above studies and include wave effects in new ice formation it is helpful to briefly revisit a conceptual theory behind the ice morphology under the influence of wave actions shen et al 2001 because of the exponential downward decay of wave action in the water body the most important wave effects are on the surface ice layer grease ice on the surface consists of a dense layer of frazil clusters they may freeze together to form pancakes if the concentration is high enough to allow neighboring clusters to interact with each other and if the frozen bond between clusters can survive the tension and bending imposed by the waves the balance between the adhesion and separation determines the size of the pancakes at first this process is controlled by the high frequency and short waves the resulting pancakes are small as the high frequency components damp out the small pancakes may then grow as the wave curvature decreases from this conceptual model the limiting pancake diameter was determined as d b c b λ 2 2 π 2 e a or d t 2 c t λ 2 π 3 ρ i c e g a where b denotes the bending failure case and t the tensile failure case shen et al 2001 the physical parameters involved in the above are wavelength λ wave amplitude a young s modulus e gravitational acceleration g ice density ρ i c e we note that the wave curvature a λ 2 appears in both bending and tensile controlled cases when studying an elastic ice sheet dumont et al 2011 and voermans et al 2020 also used wave curvature to formulate a fracture criterion to delineate fragmented and continuous ice fields parameters c b and c t represent the cumulative strength of the freezing bonding between two ice elements against bending and tension respectively existing pancake ice may raft to mechanically thicken the young ice cover using a balance between the compressive pressure due to pancake collisions and the frictional resistance the equilibrium rafting thickness was derived to be 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 where k c and k r are parameters describing the friction and collisional restitution properties of the pancakes this formulation was theoretically derived and checked against laboratory and discrete element simulations dai et al 2004 we summarize the process to be modeled as follows frazil ice forms in open water in calm water nilas form over the entire open water area with sufficient wave agitation part of the frazil production distributes underneath the solid ice part of it forms streaks in open water the area and thickness of these streaks grow in time as the thickness grows beyond a threshold young ice forms the type of young ice can be grease pancake or a continuous sheet ice dictated by the wave condition as the young ice thickens beyond a threshold it joins the existing solid ice at any stage of the development young ice may switch back and forth between sheet pancake or grease ice depending on the wave condition 3 formulation in this section we describe the algorithm to be included in the expanded ice model it corresponds to fig 2 which shows the growth sequence in a single grid cell from open water the processes include formation of frazil in water surface evolution from frazil to young ice grease pancake or nilas sheet ice and evolution from young ice to solid ice formulations of these three stages will be described next at any given time we separate the surface area in each computational grid into four sub fractions c o c f c y and c s the subscripts represent open water frazil ice young ice and solid ice respectively 3 1 frazil ice ice formation begins when ocean water is supercooled as in the existing ice models we let all frazil ice produced in the water body float to the surface instantly this is a reasonable approximation based on the simulation of matsumura and ohshima 2015 instead of assuming a grid size dependent thickness of the surface frazil accumulation as in smedsrud and martin 2015 we will assume its area concentration instead based on observations surface frazil ice is first concentrated in the zones of convergence due to ocean circulations to form streaks herman et al 2020 these zones then spread to the rest of open water we thus parameterize the area of frazil streaks as c f t 1 e t t f c o where t f is a time scale for frazil suspension to spread over the open water this parameter together with other model parameters to be introduced are discussed in appendix a from physical considerations this time scale should be positively correlated with wind speed in the limit of no wind frazil ice spreads evenly over the whole open water area with t f 0 and 1 e t t f 1 the incremental change of frazil ice concentration is thus 1 δ c f c o δ t t f where δ t is the time step c o 1 c s c y c f is the open water fraction with a known volume production v f calculated from the heat budget frazil ice thickness is then determined as h f v f c f 3 2 young ice grease pancake and nilas as heat loss continues frazil ice accumulates and thickens on the water surface to form young ice the thickness threshold is set at h f 0 0 05 m this young ice may be grease pancake or nilas depending on the water surface condition to determine which ice type is compatible with the wave field we start from the results obtained in shen et al 2001 2004 which provided the relation between the wave condition and the maximum pancake size we define a dimensionless number δ d λ where d is the limiting ice diameter dictated by either the bending or the tensile failure 2 δ b d b λ c b λ 2 π 2 e a δ t d t λ 2 c t π 3 ρ i c e g a since the theory was developed under a monochromatic wave to be consistent we will use λ mean wavelength and a significant wave height 2 2 for field conditions parameters c b and c t units n m2 are the cumulative strength of the freezing bonding between two neighboring ice elements against bending and tension respectively these two parameters should be related to temperature and salinity with a decreasing trend as temperature or salinity increase c t and c b e are unknown for young ice we carried out a sensitivity test for a range of c t and c b e in appendix b if pancakes form from open water and continue to grow by connecting with neighbors laboratory data favored tensile control shen et al 2004 field data reported in roach et al 2018b showed that both tensile and bending control could explain the observed pancake size it is conceivable that both cases may apply in the field depending on which failure mode dominates in our model we set δ min δ b δ t so that whichever failure criterion is reached first decides the size of the pancakes for a given wave condition if the bond strength between elements in a pancake is sufficient to let the pancake grow to be 1 4 the wavelength then it can grow indefinitely because the curvature a λ 2 that determines the pancake size from either bending or tensile failure repeats every 1 4 wavelength hence if δ 1 4 nilas or sheet ice form at the other extreme demarcation between grease and pancake ice is not obvious pancakes grow from frazil clusters continuously until they reach the maximum size compatible with the wave condition there is no obvious mechanistic reason to define the smallest pancake ice we thus use an observational criterion to artificially define a smallest pancake ice d m i n below which the surface ice is grease ice with the above arguments we have the following criteria to demarcate the young ice types for a given wave field 3 δ d m i n λ grease d m i n λ δ 1 4 pancake δ 1 4 nilas in the above we set d m i n 2 cm based on many laboratory observations when the surface ice elements were below 2 cm no circular shape formation was detectable and the surface layer resembled a soupy slush shen et al 2001 2004 pancake grease ice formed in wave conditions may raft to form layers rafting stops when the friction resistance of a pile of pancakes and the compressive pressure between pancakes balance either other the final equilibrium rafting thickness has been derived as 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 dai et al 2004 in the model to be developed we do not allow the rafted pile to collapse hence 4 h y max 2 π 3 k c k r a 2 d 2 λ 3 h y o l d where h y is the thickness of this young ice and h y o l d is the thickness in the last time step 3 3 transformation from young to solid ice the final step of ice formation is the transformation from young to solid ice the threshold of solid ice formation is a crucial element in thermodynamics as it affects heat flux at the water ice and air ice interface this threshold is commonly called the collection thickness in sea ice models for the present study we will use h y 0 0 25 m for this threshold a discussion of this choice is in appendix c as autumn progresses to winter with limited fetch columnar growth under the existing ice increases frazil production in the small remaining open water area surrounding the solid ice reduces young ice contribution to the overall ice cover gradually diminishes 3 4 thermodynamics and dynamics of existing ice in the entire progression from step 3 1 to 3 3 i e open water to solid ice cover heat flux determines the new ice production 5 d c s h s d t ρ o ρ i c s w i o s w a i s c s w f r d c y h y d t ρ o ρ i c y w i o y w a i y c y w f r d c f h f d t ρ o ρ i c f w i o f w a i f 1 c y c

interface w a i is the melt rate on the upper ice snow surface w f r is the rate of frazil ice growth this thermodynamic formulation already exists in the present ice model for solid ice the additional formulation in the expanded model shown above is to treat the young ice and frazil ice for which we will assume that all relevant thermal properties of the young ice and frazil ice are the same as open water for grease ice this assumption is based on laboratory data from de la rosa et al 2011 for pancake and nilas sheet ice the appropriateness of this assumption remains to be seen in any case since the thickness threshold for young ice to transform to solid ice is set at 0 25 m its insolation effect should be small note that the above formulation has not included lateral growth melt which is left for future work the dynamics of the entire ice cover is expanded from the existing ice model to treat the forcing for solid ice young ice and frazil ice differently 6 d d t v s v y

frazil ice and the water ice stress for frazil ice is considered to be negligible the internal stresses of both young ice and frazil ice are set to zero the detailed assignment of drag coefficients of young ice and solid ice is listed in appendix a 4 wave model and coupling with ice ocean model in this section we describe the modifications introduced to the wave model to consider different ice types and the coupling of ice ccean and wave models 4 1 attenuation of waves under multiple ice types most wave models including the one we will use are based on the radiative transfer equation 7 f f θ t x c g f f θ 1 c i c e s i n s d s w s n l 3 s n l 4 s d s b s d s b r c i c e s i c e where f f θ is the spectral energy density for frequency f in the θ direction c g is the group velocity c i c e is the ice area concentration for the miz the group velocity inside an ice cover approximates that in open water collins et al 2018 terms on the right side of eq 7 represent processes that generate dissipate or redistribute wave energy s i n is wave growth by the wind s d s w is wave decay due to whitecapping s n l 3 and s n l 4 are nonlinear transfer of wave energy through three wave and four wave interactions s d s b and s d s b r are wave decay due to bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking s i c e is wave attenuation due to ice ice damping only happens in an ice covered area and wind energy input and whitecapping are assumed to happen only in open water the rate of ice induced attenuation s i c e is needed for different ice types a wave spectrum f f θ consists of many frequency components each is related to a complex wave number k f k r f i k i f through the dispersion relation attenuation of the wave amplitude is reflected in the imaginary part of this wave number through e i k x σ t e k i x e i k r x σ t where σ 2 π f is the angular frequency the dissipation term is related to k i through s i c e 2 c g k i f field studies suggest different ice types have different spectral attenuation rates rogers et al 2016 different theories have been proposed to quantify this attenuation as discussed in several reviews shen 2019 squire 2020 it is inconclusive at present how to choose from these theories and how to quantify the parameters in these theories empirical formulas have been proposed to bypass this difficulty a six degree polynomial k i f c 0 c 1 f c 2 f 2 c 3 f 3 c 4 f 4 c 5 f 5 c 6 f 6 has been recommended to represent all data obtained so far collins and rogers 2017 in which c 0 to c 6 are constants that have different values corresponding to different ice types meylan et al 2014 proposed a simpler equation 8 k i f c 2 f 2 c 4 f 4 to fit data obtained in the antarctic miz with c 2 1 06 1 0 3 and c 4 2 3 1 0 2 the data set was from an ice field consisted of floes around 10 m in size we will assign these values to the solid ice type rogers et al 2018 used the same equation to fit data obtained in a field of pancakes mixed in frazil ice they found that with the same type of buoy used in the antarctic miz c 2 0 284 1 0 3 and c 4 1 53 1 0 2 we will assign these values to pancake ice for grease and frazil ice we digitize data from rogers et al 2016 their figure 8 the two fitting curves are shown in fig 3 with the values of c 2 and c 4 listed in table a 1 for nilas the attenuation is set to zero it should be noted that in different papers the method used to derive attenuation from buoy data was not the same meylan et al 2014 compared wave energy between two buoys to obtain the attenuation coefficients rogers et al 2016 used model hindcasts to match the buoy measurements at different locations the best matched k i values were chosen for each ice type observed at the buoy sites potential differences of attenuation coefficients caused by different data analyses may exist rogers et al 2021 the validity of these empirical formulas will be further discussed in section 6 3 to implement different attenuation rates for different ice types the ice damping term in eq 7 is modified to 9 c i c e s i c e c s s solid c y s young c f s frazil 10 s solid f 2 c g k i solid s young f 2 c g k i young s frazil f 2 c g k i frazil where s solid s young and s frazil are sea ice sink terms derived from the corresponding exponential attenuation rates k i solid k i young and k i frazil the term s young or correspondingly the damping coefficient k i young depends on the possible types pancake grease or nilas these types are determined by the value of δ from eq 3 4 2 implementation and wave ice interaction coupling to implement the above attenuation rates in a wave model we need to choose a wave model both ww3 and swan are well established third generation spectral wave models widely used in simulating waves in the ocean for the present study we choose swan which is developed to compute random short crested wind generated waves in coastal regions comparisons of ww3 and swan in the north sea show that both models give similar spectra de león et al 2018 for the combined ice ocean model to be coupled with swan we choose roms in which the ice package is imbedded in the ocean model the sea ice model in roms is a combination of ice thermodynamic model mellor and kantha 1989 and ice dynamics model hunke and dukowicz 1997 the solid ice is considered to have only one ice thickness category in roms to focus on the effect of new ice this choice is appropriate to realize the interaction of waves and ice the coupling part is completed by coawst variables conveyed from roms to swan include solid ice concentration c s and thickness h s young concentration c y and thickness h y frazil ice concentration c f and thickness h f and ice type in young ice δ in turn the significant wave height s w h and the mean wavelength w l are conveyed from swan to roms 5 testing of the coupled model we now use the coupled model in a test case 5 1 numerical experiment design the test is carried out in the bohai sea due to its location 37 41 n 117 122 e bohai sea ice cover is completely seasonal ice in the bohai sea forms as early as december and melts completely the following march each year the bohai sea ice experiences a complete cycle of freezing and melting because of the low latitude the freezing is slow and the period before young ice becomes solid ice is long these conditions emphasize the need to pay more attention to young ice processes the numerical experiment is designed as follows the domain of interest 37 41 n 117 5 122 5 e for the coupled roms and swan model is named d1 shown in fig 4 for roms the spatial resolution of arakawa c grid is 1 15 1 15 the depth is divided into 11 layers time resolution for the 3 d equations is 30 s and 10 timesteps for the 2 d equations between each 3 d timestep the bathymetry is interpolated from the etopo1 dataset https www ngdc noaa gov mgg global global html and each grid point is smoothed by the 4 surrounding points to avoid numerical collapse caused by too large terrain gradient all meteorological data are from ecmwf reanalysis interim era interim products the reason for this choice of data set versus the more recent era5 is to match the swan model setting suitable for the bohai sea lv et al 2014 the surface air relative humidity h a i r 100 6 11 1 0 7 5 t a i r 237 7 t a i r 6 11 1 0 7 5 t d e w 237 7 t d e w is calculated by the surface air temperature and the dewpoint temperature which are from the era interim data set too the boundary and initial conditions including sea surface height vertically integrated momentum water velocity temperature and salinity these data are interpolated from the 41 layer hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom and the global ocean forecasting system gofs 1 12 5 analysis for tidal forcing the harmonic constituents are calculated from tide model driver tmd with eight principle constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 it is found that the surface air temperature from era interim does not agree with the in situ data for bohai sea as shown in fig 4 the in situ data was measured at an oil platform 40 m above the sea surface table d 3 a 0 24 c needs to be added for the corresponding surface temperature based on a general rule of a decrease of 6 c per 1000 m increase in elevation the time resolution of era interim data is 3 h and 1 h for the measured data the measurements were carried out during daytime 8 00 18 00 local time by comparing these temperature data at the corresponding time the in situ air temperature is in general above the era interim data with an average of 2 19 c higher thus we increase the era interim surface air temperature by 2 c in the test case incidentally though slightly better the more recent era5 data was also below the in situ data at this site 1 67 o c instead of 2 19 o c the parameter settings for running roms follow the example of northwest gulf of alaska in the technical manual for a coupled sea ice ocean circulation model hedström 2009 the simulation covers the winter of 2018 2019 the bathymetry and wind forcing data for swan are the same as in roms to establish the boundary conditions for the wave field in domain d1 we first run swan to generate the wave field driven by wind in d2 35 41 e 117 5 127 e fig 5 this provides the wave conditions at the east open boundary for d1 the grids in this study are regularly spaced in latitude longitude with a spatial resolution of 1 15 1 15 the spectra are composed of 24 directions uniformly discretized from 0 to 360 degree and 32 frequencies logarithmically discretized from 0 05 to 0 96 hz the swan model is run in the third generation and non stationary mode with komen komen et al 1984 exponential growth of wind input quadruplet wave interaction dissipation due to whitecapping bottom friction and depth induced wave breaking are taken into account in the simulation the parameters of whitecapping dissipation cds2 and collins bottom friction cfw are set to 2 2e 5 and 0 01 respectively by comparing with field data at 9 stations lv et al 2014 showed that this setting was optimum for swan in the bohai sea driven by the wind data from era interim to ensure the accuracy of the wave simulations we compare the simulated significant wave height with records from the w0101 buoy located at the bohai strait as shown by the red square in fig 5 fig 6 shows that the simulated significant wave height agrees well with measurements exhibiting a correlation coefficient of 0 93 5 2 comparisons of model results with modis the sea ice area concentration and effective thickness ice thickness times ice concentration a measure of ice volume are now compared with modis images we choose january 8 2019 and february 7 2019 which are less cloudy and the sea ice coverage in the liaodong bay is clear in fig 7 a d are sea ice coverage from modis images b e are the model ice concentration c s c y c f and c f the effective thickness c s h s c y h y c f h f of all ice types the model ice concentration is in general consistent with the satellite observation but more so in the northeast part of the liaodong bay the model results show high ice concentration at both northeast and northwest corners of liaodong bay but very different for effective thickness in the northwest the ice is thin in the range of 2 9 cm and it is much thicker in the northeast in the range of 17 32 cm 5 3 comparisons of model results with in situ observations in liaodong bay the ice conditions observed at two locations jz93 and jz202 in the liaodong bay fig 5 are used to examine the model results the observations include air temperature ice total concentration mean and maximum ice thickness and the occurrence of ice type appendix d figs 8 and 9 show the time series of observed ice concentration ice thickness observed ice types and the corresponding model results all in situ data were obtained from 8 00 to 18 00 local time we pick the model results from the corresponding period for comparison in fig 8 blue red and black dashed lines are model ice concentration of young ice frazil ice and solid ice respectively while the purple dots are measured total ice concentration the in situ data do not separate concentration into different types from december 15 to december 28 2018 at jz93 sea ice appeared very early and maintained a relatively high concentration after a period of ice free condition while at jz202 the ice concentration was sporadic until february 2019 though the trend is consistent with observations the model ice concentrations are above the observations most of the time we note these two platforms especially jz202 are very near the ice edge with maximum type averaged ice thickness less than 0 16 m fig 9 hence ice appeared during the night and diminished rapidly at daytime on some days before february the observation data were once a day table d 1 the model output was every 6 h any variations in between were not represented the occasional high ice concentration in the model in the beginning of the winter was not observed this could be due to the transient nature of the ice cover during formation and the long duration between observations later in winter the absence of lateral melting in the present model and the strong dynamical change of ice conditions at these two locations might have contributed to the difference between the observation and model results additionally the presence of frazil ice is under represented in fig 8 because of its rapid transition to young ice which makes them easily missed in the sparse output in fig 9 the orange and yellow dots are measured mean and maximum ice thickness and the dashed gray line is the type averaged model ice thickness defined as c s h s c y h y c f h f c s c y c f fig 9 shows good agreement between model results and observations where the model ice thickness is mostly within the band between the mean and maximum thickness some thin ice under 5 cm simulated by the present model is not observed before february at jz202 the in situ observation categorized ice types as follows initial frazil ice rind 5 cm ice film nilas 10 cm elastic thin ice pancake 10 cm gray ice 10 15 cm gray white ice 15 30 cm white ice 30 cm fig 10 compares the observed ice types table d 2 with the model results blue dots indicate pancake or nilas were observed which we classify as young ice and black dots indicate gray white ice or gray ice were observed which we classify as solid ice blue line and black line are model concentration of young and solid ice respectively fig 10 a shows that a higher concentration of a given ice type corresponds to a higher occurrence of that ice type being observed the model results are in good agreement with observations at jz93 but at jz202 as shown in fig 10 b solid ice was very rarely observed while modeled solid ice persisted in the beginning of february albeit at low values the lack of observed solid ice at this location is possibly due to its low concentration the occurrence of young ice is higher than solid ice at both jz93 and jz202 in fig 10 and table d 2 we omit the frazil and ice rind category because they are difficult to observe from distance hence less reliable as mentioned in sections 3 and 4 young ice could be pancake grease or nilas depending on the wave conditions eq 4 in fig 11 the blue and red dots are observed nilas and pancake ice and the orange line is δ which represents wave conditions the dividing line is δ 1 4 above which nilas is expected and below which pancake and grease ice are expected blue dots indicate nilas are observed in the in situ data and orange dots indicate that pancakes are observed this comparison shows 70 of the observed nilas and 75 of the observed pancake ice are consistent with the model results at jz93 and 66 of the observed nilas and 70 of the observed pancake ice are consistent with the model results at jz202 grease ice is absent from both the model results and the in situ data considering bohai sea especially liaodong bay is a coastal region surrounded by land on three sides wave amplitudes are usually small hence it is reasonable that nilas are frequently observed but grease ice is absent 6 results and discussion 6 1 model results of sea ice fig 12 shows the distributions of the effective thickness for frazil pancake nilas and solid ice averaged over the whole freezing stage of 2018 2019 the distribution of solid ice is concentrated in the northeast part of liaodong bay pancake ice and nilas have a similar distribution they are more concentrated in the northwest part of liaodong bay this result is less due to thermodynamics but more due to the ice drift direction which mostly oscillates between northeast and southwest when most of the northeast part of liaodong bay is covered with solid ice the newly produced young ice can only be distributed around the edge of solid ice in this test case 62 15 of young ice is pancake ice and the rest is nilas the effective thickness of frazil ice is much smaller compared to young ice and solid ice with a mean effective thickness less than 10 3 m when young ice and solid ice are formed part of the produced frazil is simply attached to the bottom of the existing ice cover surface frazil is distributed mostly along the coastline and the edge of the ice cover next we compare the results from two numerical experiments the first one is the model proposed in this paper which we call the multiple ice module the other one is the roms ice module in the standard roms all ice is considered solid ice new ice becomes part of the existing solid ice instantly the default collection thickness in roms ice module is 1 m with this value the roms ice is much thicker black line in fig 13 than all other model results in this figure the thickness is the mean value over all of the ice covered cells in domain d1 fig 5 for a fairer comparison the collection thickness in roms ice module is changed to 0 25 m which is the threshold for young ice to become solid ice used in the multiple ice module as shown in fig 13 the roms ice with the threshold of 0 25 m has a comparable thickness with the solid ice obtained from the multiple ice module the average thickness of frazil ice young ice solid ice and roms ice with 0 25 m threshold are 0 027 0 056 0 278 and 0 224 m respectively using the multiple ice module solid ice appears about 200 h later than using roms ice in the multiple ice module formation of ice begins with frazil ice and young ice solid ice does not form until young ice has sufficiently thickened by heat loss or wave rafting the difference of appearance of solid ice and roms ice has an impact on heat flux and wave attenuation this time difference may be negligible in very cold regions when ice grows fast but it becomes notable in low latitude areas that freeze slowly for the miz where new ice formation is most dynamic the advancement and retreat of ice edges may also be more sensitive to the treatment of the new ice fig 14 a and b show the ice volume and area from roms ice respectively and the corresponding values for frazil young and solid ice from the multiple ice module again these data are the mean over all ice covered cells in domain d1 in the beginning of freezing young ice and frazil ice form before they are transformed into solid ice at this point solid ice barely exists from the multiple ice module while the area from roms ice steadily develops with the continuous loss of heat young ice evolves into solid ice and solid ice gradually dominates if we take all ice in the multiple ice module as a group from fig 14 a and b roms ice has smaller concentration and greater thickness ice in the multiple ice module occupies a larger area but has a thinner average thickness compared to roms ice more than 14 of ice volume forms from the multiple ice module on average over this period this difference might be caused by several factors first young ice is thermally more dynamic because it is thinner second the ocean air heat flux is treated differently in the two modules since all relevant thermal properties of the young ice and frazil ice are assumed the same as open water in fig 15 the black line and blue line are the heat flux from ocean to air from the roms ice module and the multiple ice module respectively the difference between the two is plotted as the orange line with a magnified vertical scale as fig 15 shows with the multiple ice module the ocean loses more heat except for the last part when ice is melting similar findings are also reported in smedsrud and martin 2015 in which they included grease ice as a distinct category and assumed its thermal properties were the same as open water the delayed appearance of solid ice in the multiple ice module also allows more heat loss from the perspective of heat flux taking young ice and frazil ice into account increases the heat loss of the ocean during the freezing period 6 2 model results of significant wave height the larger ice area in the multiple ice module not only affects heat flux at the ocean air interface but also enhances damping of waves energy three numerical experiments were carried out to evaluate the influence of different ice modules on waves in the liaodong bay 1 waves with no interaction with ice 2 waves with attenuation by roms ice 3 waves with multiple ice types fig 16 shows waves with the multiple ice module are significantly damped compared to waves with roms ice and no ice the larger ice area from the multiple ice module blocks more wind input and simultaneously damps more wave energy although the attenuation from frazil grease nilas and pancake ice are smaller than attenuation of solid ice fig 3 the multiple ice module still attenuates more wave energy due to the larger ice area fig 17 shows the distribution of averaged significant wave height in the bohai sea the attenuation on wave energy in liaodong bay is obvious from both the multiple ice module and roms ice module the multiple ice module yields a larger ice cover area hence more ability to damp waves but at the same time the damped waves have less ability to transform sheet ice to pancake or brash ice thus maintaining the thermal insulation better we do not have wave data in this region except the buoy in the bohai strait fig 5 to verify the present results 6 3 model improvements needed the proposed model is a first step towards coupling wave and ice models as interactive components the most obvious improvements needed are listed below 1 appendix a provides parameters we used in the present study to complete the multiple ice module some of these parameter values used such as t f 1 44 day in eq 1 and k c 1 in eq 4 are tentative a sensitivity study of these parameters is desired 2 based on a laboratory observation de la rosa et al 2011 the surface temperature and heat flux over grease ice were assumed the same as those over open water we further assume that this assumption applies to young ice whether such assumption is correct needs to be seen concerning the surface temperature we found that the era interim data was lower than the in situ measurement hence the air temperature is adjusted in the input of this test case by adding the mean discrepancy 2 c an independent check using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep cfsv2 data at a nearby location shows 5 c higher temperature than the era interim data these comparisons underline the importance of having in situ data to calibrate the model input especially for small scale and more dynamically changing locations 3 the formulas used here to quantify wave attenuation in different ice types are empirical they presently are only frequency and ice type dependent as discussed in thomson et al 2021 instrument or measurement noise may affect the high frequency part of the measured spectra thus alter the polynomial fit in addition to other spurious effects such as roll over rogers et al 2021 used extensive buoy data collected in the antarctic marginal ice zone to revisit the spectral attenuation behavior they removed the high frequency part to avoid noise contamination and fitted the data with both the same polynomial as adopted here and several other simple power laws the resulting polynomial fit had coefficients that were on the same order as adopted here for pancake ice however more importantly their data analysis showed that spectral attenuation depended on not only frequency but also ice thickness wave amplitude and proximity to the ice edge regarding attenuation for very high frequency waves rabault et al 2017 showed in a field experiment that for 0 8 1 hz waves the attenuation in grease ice was on the order of 0 1 m 1 such high attenuation at very high frequencies has also been found in laboratory studies newyear and martin 1997 zhao and shen 2015 once validated in field conditions these high frequency attenuation will certainly change the empirical formulas future field studies will improve both quantity and quality of the data to modify the formulas used here in the bohai sea these additional considerations are probably less important due to its mild ice condition 0 3 m ice thickness for most part and low wave activities wave height 1 m and peak frequency around 0 1 0 2 hz 4 several major mechanisms already considered in cice and other sea ice models need to be implemented in the present model for example ice floe size distribution ice lateral melting and ice fracture welding need to be included the resulting model concentration is likely to reduce at least during ice retreat with these improvements 5 comparing with the in situ data the present model appears capable of simulating ice types relatively reliably however its ability to model the wave conditions has not been confirmed due to the lack of wave data at the test site we plan to test a new case where both ice and wave conditions are available 7 conclusion a parameterization of new ice formation in a wave field has been developed the present model couples ice and wave as interactive components the wave field dictates the types of new ice frazil grease pancake and nilas that would form and in turn the types of ice determines the wave damping the interaction of multiple types of ice and wave damping is first formulated based on existing theories field observations and experimental data these formulations are then implemented to expand roms and swan and then using coawst to couple the two ice types depend on the thermal condition and the wave field simultaneously the spectral attenuation of wave energy under an ice cover depends on the ice type the model is tested in the bohai sea a coastal sea with a seasonal ice cover we simulated the winter season from december 2018 to march 2019 the results show a reasonable comparison of ice concentration with the modis images the model is capable of producing a good comparison of ice type and thickness when compared with in situ data by incorporating multiple types of new ice determined by the combination of thermodynamics and the wave field in our test case we have found 1 the appearance of solid ice is delayed 2 more ice volume is produced and more area is covered by ice in the freezing period 3 ocean and ice lose more heat to the air which increases ice growth as shown in smedsrud and martin 2015 we believe the above observations are independent of locations in addition we have found that wave attenuation is enhanced through multiple types of ice because of the larger ice area however this outcome may be a result of the generally thin ice condition as in bohai sea in regions with much thicker ice if wave attenuation is indeed strongly affected by ice thickness then solid ice may play a stronger role and the effect of new ice may become less important the coupled model has many parameters that may be site specific for instance the threshold of young ice transforming to solid ice might need tuning in different domains in view of the continuous development undertaken in the current ice and wave models corresponding improvements can be expected for the present model credit authorship contribution statement che yue software data curation formal analysis methodology validation writing original

types 1 t f is the time scale for frazil suspension to spread over the open water which is set to 1 44 days in this study this corresponds to 50 of the open water portion covered by frazil ice in one day under a constant wind sensitivity of this parameter has not been performed 2 for the rafting thickness the parameter k c k r depends on the frictional k r and collisional restitution k c properties of the pancakes dai et al 2004 k c is unknown and is set to 1 k r 1 2 1 sin ϕ 1 sin ϕ 1 n 1 ρ i ρ w where the friction angle ϕ is set to 45 and the porosity n is set to 0 5 ρ i is the density of ice and ρ w is the density of water these values yield k r 0 1455 3 the air and water stresses are τ a ρ a c a v 10 v 10 and τ w ρ w c w v w v i v w v i where v 10 v w and v i are 10 m air surface water and ice velocity respectively c a and c w are the drag coefficients at the air ice and water ice interface respectively from lu et al 2011 the water drag coefficient for a 1 km smooth floe was about 3 4 5 4 1 0 3 and for ice in polynya was about 1 5 3 1 0 3 the polynya ice was a combination of solid ice young ice and open water from these data we set c w 4 5 1 0 3 for solid ice and half of that for young ice for air drag we set c a 3 1 0 3 for solid ice and c a 1 5 1 0 3 for young ice these values produce ice drift velocities that agree reasonably well with in situ data figs a 1 and a 2 4 in the empirical spectral attenuation formulas eq 8 for solid ice we use results obtained in meylan et al 2014 for pancake ice we use results from rogers et al 2018 for grease and frazil ice we use the data from rogers et al 2016 their figure 8 these data were grouped as pancake mixed with frazil their red lines mixed open water frazil and brash pancakes their green lines and open water grease frazil their purple lines we digitized the mid point of the green lines at selected frequencies to form the data for the grease ice curve fitting and the mid point of the purple lines to form the data for the frazil ice curve fitting appendix b testing experiment of c t and c b e from laboratory data shen et al 2004 c t 11 8 kg m 1 s 2 for pancakes grown strictly from open water under a constant wave forcing the water salinity and temperature were 35 psu and 1 9 c respectively the air temperature was from 6 3 c gradually dropped to 23 5 c roach et al 2018b analyzed field data of pancake ice during a storm episode and gave the estimate of c t 0 167 kg m 1 s 2 with air temperature 12 c to 13 6 c water temperature 0 8 c to 1 4 c and salinity 32 psu for the bending control criterion gold 1971 measured c b for solid freshwater ice and reported c b 1 72 1 0 6 n m 2 with e 1 0 9 n m2 from timco and weeks 2010 c b e 1 0 3 1 0 4 for the first year sea ice both c b and e are expected to be lower for pancake ice but have never been measured considering the range of values for c b e and c t in different papers we performed a sensitivity test for c b e 1 0 4 1 0 1 and c t 1 0 1 1 0 2 table b 1 lists the results of young ice types that would form under a specific parameter set somewhere in the bohai sea during the simulated winter season p g means pancake ice and grease ice both appear p means only pancake ice appears and p n means pancake ice and nilas ice appear from ning et al 2009 and the in situ observations fig 10 and table d 2 only pancake and nilas were observed therefore we set c t 1 102 kg m 1 s 1 and c b e 1 10 2 in the test case appendix c the transformation threshold from frazil ice to young ice and young ice to solid ice the minimum thickness of solid ice in the bohai sea is 0 1 to 0 3 m ning et al 2009 we take 0 25 m as the threshold for young ice to evolve into solid ice this value is close to the recommended collection thickness 0 2 m from sansiviero et al 2017 the thickness of the accumulated frazil ice layer from observations is on the order of centimeters drucker et al 2003 we thus take 0 05 m as the threshold for frazil ice to evolve into young ice appendix d field data sea ice data containing ice concentration thickness type and air temperature in the winter of 2018 2019 were obtained from the jz93 and jz202 oil platforms the two platforms are equipped with a comprehensive system to monitor sea ice this ice data collection started in the 1990s part of the data and data processing is reported in zhang et al 2017 ice thickness and concentration are determined by analyzing images from videos and photos ice type is manually observed and recorded a weather station is used to record air temperature and other meteorological parameters the relevant data for the present study are provided below in the following table the ice types are defined as nilas 10 cm elastic thin ice pancake 10 cm gray ice 10 15 cm gray white ice 15 30 cm and white ice 30 cm the following air temperature was measured at jz93 at the elevation 40 m above the sea surface 
23879,we describe a new framework to represent wave effects on currents including several approximations stokes drift bernoulli head and quasi static pressure and a parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking the framework improves over existing methods not limited by water depth or monochromatic assumptions the approximations are validated with spectra and current profiles from a model configuration in southern california the stokes drift approximation uses two scales accounting for broadband spectra including mixed wind sea and swell the stokes drift is estimated iteratively constrained by the surface drift velocity and stokes transport being more efficient while giving smaller errors compared to a spectrum reconstruction approach one month long hydrostatic ocean model solutions at 270 m horizontal grid resolution show that waves have relatively small impacts on the mean circulation and mesoscale current variability near the surface waves increase the vorticity and divergence variance near the surface when the turbulent langmuir number is small keywords wave current interactions stokes drift wave breaking wave effects on currents 1 introduction

ocean modeling system roms following the theoretical wave average framework by mcwilliams et al 2004 the approach by uchiyama et al 2010 hereafter referred to as ums10 is based on a wkb spectral peak approximation allowing for the coupling of roms with spectral wave models such as swan booij et al 1999 or wavewatchiii the wavewatch iii development group ww3dg 2016 kumar et al 2013 2015 applied the framework by ums10 to study wave current interactions across the inner shelf and surf zone with regional model configurations of roms coupled to swan finding good performance against field observations wec forcing should ideally be computed from directional wave spectra but is it not practical as it requires the exchange of large amounts of information between models especially for configurations with relatively large domains at high horizontal resolution it is well known that the monochromatic approximation for deep water waves results in an underestimation of the stokes drift

unsteady non breaking waves and a parameterization of the vertical mixing to wave breaking suitable for coastal ocean models the stokes drift approximation builds on the work by breivik et al 2014 and breivik and christensen 2020 using an iterative two scale approach that can handle mixed wind sea and swell conditions and finite depth this manuscript is organized as follows section 2 describes the

vertical eddy diffusivity bernoulli head and quasi static pressure this work is an effort to improve over existing methodologies including the spectral peak monochromatic approach that is commonly used with coupled wave ocean models e g 28 30 66 the approximations of this work are suitable for coastal models not limited to deep water waves e g 6 7 the stokes drift for a monochromatic wave is given by 13 u s z a 2 2 σ k k cosh 2 k z h sinh 2 k d where a is the wave amplitude σ is the wave frequency which relates to the wavenumber k through the linear dispersion relationship σ k g k tanh k d 1 2 h is the water depth and d h η η ˆ with η corresponding to the surface elevation displacement η ˆ is the wave induced set down phillips 1977 uchiyama et al 2010 in terms of the wave action a 2 σ eq 13 becomes 14 u s z g a 2 σ k k k cosh 2 k z h sinh 2 k d which can be generalized for a wave directional frequency spectrum ψ f θ according to 15 u s z 2 g ψ f θ k σ k k cosh 2 k z h sinh 2 k d d f d θ with h s 4 ψ f θ d f d θ 1 2 corresponding to the significant wave height kenyon 1969 the stokes drift transport is obtained from 15 and 8 but because 16 h η η ˆ cosh 2 k z h sinh 2 k d d z 1 2 k it becomes 17 u s g ψ f θ k σ k d f d θ following breivik et al 2014 an effective wavenumber can be obtained from the ratio of the surface stokes drift to the transport as given by 18 k s e u s z 0 2 u s this is based on the profile of a deep water monochromatic wave by combining eqs 15 17 we first approximate the stokes drift according to 19 u s e u o cosh 2 k s e z h sinh 2 k s e d where u o u s 0 tanh 2 k s e d corresponds to a characteristic surface stokes drift velocity the approximation u s e is good near the surface for intermediate and deep water dominant waves however it decays much faster with depth than broadband calculations in contrast a monochromatic approximation of the form 20 u s p z g a w 2 k p 2 σ k cosh 2 k p z h sinh 2 k p d cos θ sin θ does a good job at depth and in shallow water with the wave amplitude a w h s 2 2 k p being the peak wavenumber and the spectrally weighted mean wave direction defined as 21 θ tan 1 ψ f θ f n θ sin θ d f d θ ψ f θ f n θ cos θ d f d θ the power n θ 0 is commonly used in shallow water k p h π 10 the stokes drift is approximated by 22 u s a u s p and in deeper water by combining u s e and u s p with a switch function h z according to 23 u s a h z u s p 1 h z u s e the switch function 24 h z tanh z k s e 2 1 2 was found to work well over a wide range of conditions finally u s p is adjusted iteratively by minimizing the error of the stokes drift transport to within less than 1 following mcwilliams et al 2004 the vertical tracer square displacement and corresponding diffusivity for a monochromatic wave are given by 25 r v w 2 a sinh k z h sinh k d 2 and 26 k v w 1 2 t r v w 2 respectively where the absolute value for the latter is introduced here to avoid negative diffusivities the generalized vertical parcel displacement squared for a spectrum of waves gives 27 r v w 2 2 ψ f θ sinh k z h sinh k d 2 d f d θ and the corresponding depth integrated square displacement becomes 28 r v w 2 h η η ˆ r v w 2 d z 29 2 ψ f θ coth k d k d csch 2 k d 2 k d f d θ in analogy to the stokes drift approximation the right hand side of eq 29 is approximated by 30 r v w 2 h s 2 2 2 coth k r e d k r e d csch 2 k r e d 2 k r e and the effective wavenumber k r e is first estimated from the r v w 2 at the surface divided by the broadband value of r v w 2 31 k r e r v w 2 z 0 2 r v w 2 then it is corrected iteratively according to 32 k r e r v w 2 z 0 coth k r e d k r e d csch 2 k r e d 2 r v w 2 starting with the initial guess to compute a new k r e and so on the iteration converges after a few iterations 15 or less and is not needed in deep water k p h 2 π finally the vertical square particle displacement is approximated by 33 r v w 2 h s 2 2 sinh k r e z h sinh k r e d 2 and the corresponding wave induced vertical tracer diffusivity follows from eq 26 in the absence of r v w 2 from a wave model the particle displacement squared can be approximated alternatively using the mean wavelength 34 l m 2 π k ψ f θ η 2 d f d θ with k r e 2 π l m and r v w 2 directly estimated from eq 33 finally if l m is not available k r e can be approximated by k p at the expense of significantly larger errors for r v w 2 and k v w the monochromatic wave average quasi static set down according to longuet higgins and stewart 1962 is given by 35 η ˆ a 2 k 2 sinh 2 k d which for a wave spectrum becomes 36 η ˆ ψ f θ k sinh 2 k d d f d θ the set down for a broadband spectrum is generally smaller than a monochromatic approximation based on h s and k p for intermediate water depth assuming that η ˆ calculated spectrally is known we calculate a filtered wave amplitude a f such that a monochromatic approximation 37 η ˆ m a f 2 k p 2 sinh 2 k p d matches the broadband set down at intermediate water depths or shallower k p h 2 π specifically 38 a f a w min 1 η ˆ η ˆ m 1 2 being limited to a f a w since η ˆ m becomes very small in deep water the filtered wave amplitude a f is used for the approximation of quasi static pressure as described below the bernoulli head without the quasi static terms for a monochromatic wave is given by 39 k 1 4 σ a 2 k sinh 2 k d h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k z z d z where v k u and u is the eulerian current velocity it is approximated by 40 k a 1 4 σ a f 2 k p sinh 2 k p d h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k p z z d z with k p k p cos θ sin θ following ums10 the leading order quasi static pressure is given by 41 p g a 2 2 σ tanh h sinh 2 h v z η η ˆ cosh 2 h v z h h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 cosh 2 k z d z 2 k tanh h v η η ˆ where h k d the first and third pressure terms can only be finite in intermediate and shallow water because of the tanh 2 h sinh 2 h factor and therefore are approximated with the filtered long wave information a f and k p the second term is approximated with k p but with the total wave amplitude a w and the fourth pressure term is approximated with the surface stokes drift and the two scales k e and k p the complete pressure approximation for the four terms is given by 42 p a g h p σ a f 2 v z η p 1 g h p σ a w 2 cosh 2 h p v z h p 2 g h p σ a f 2 h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 cosh 2 k p z d z p 3 2 m k p k e u s u η η ˆ p 4 where g h p σ g 2 σ tanh h p sinh 2 h p h p k p d and m k p k e is a non dimensional function that smoothly connects the deep water and shallow water regimes according to 43 m k p k e sinh 2 k e d cosh 2 k e h tanh k p h sinh 2 k p d cosh 2 k p h 1 tanh k p h in deep water k p d 2 π the last term in 42 becomes u s u η whereas in shallow water k p d π 10 it matches the monochromatic approximation 41 fourth term in terms of a w and k p for the sake of comparison we also consider the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 to compute the wec forcing the wave spectral reconstruction is based on the premise that given a few parameters energy mean period and direction and possibly other spectral moments directional wave spectra can be reconstructed based on empirical models the reconstruction can include a combination of different wave systems for example mixed wind sea and swell kumar et al 2017 proposed the use of the jonswap spectrum and the spectral partition information from ww3 to reconstruct the directional spectrum from which wec forcing can be computed by ocean circulation models the spectral reconstruction is computationally expensive and not necessarily more accurate as demonstrated here 2 3 non conservative wec effects here we consider the energy and momentum flux due to surface wave breaking the flux of energy due to wave breaking enhances the vertical mixing near the surface which is commonly modeled with various turbulence closure schemes craig and banner 1994 terray et al 1999 burchard 2001 umlauf and burchard 2003 we model the vertical mixing due to wave breaking k b r directly as a near surface enhancement of the k profile parameterization kpp 32 by generalizing the framework introduced by ums10 for both white capping and depth limited breaking ums10 prescribed several profiles for k b r z in shallow water that were constrained by a depth average diffusivity k b r c b h s 2 e d s ρ w 1 3 where c b is a dimensionless factor o 0 1 e d s is the flux of energy due to wave breaking and ρ w is the water density the vertical profiles were designed for shallow water and therefore are not immediately applicable for deep water wave breaking we follow a different approach our starting point is the empirical scaling of the turbulent kinetic energy tke dissipation profile ε z by sutherland and melville 2015 hereafter referred to as sm15 based on h s and the energy flux due to wave breaking e d s according to 44 ε h s ρ w e d s ε n f z where ε n is the non dimensional dissipation rate ρ w is the water density and z z h s is the non dimensional depth with z z η η ˆ being the depth from the surface sm15 reported two power law regimes ε n z 2 for z 1 and ε n z 1 closer to the surface eq 44 differs from the scaling by terray et al 1996 which is in terms of the wind input as opposed to the dissipation due to breaking the input of tke due to breaking e d s ρ w is often parameterized as m u w 3 with u w corresponding to the water side friction velocity and m 100 craig and banner 1994 more recently esters et al 2018 reported tke dissipation rate measurements collected with a vertical profiles over a wide range of conditions their measurements did not capture the enhancement of ε near the surface which could be in part because their data did resolve the dissipation profile very near surface i e z h s 1 they reported a single power law dependence of ε z 3 2 we model the nondimensional tke dissipation profile according to 45 f z 0 9508 a f b f z c f z 2 with a f 4 30 b f 8 3 and c f 10 3 such that 3 0 f z d z 1 approximately matching sm15 eq 45 can be used to model the dissipation profile ε z provided e d s and h s are known for a given turbulent length scale ℓ and tke dissipation ε the eddy viscosity k is often parameterized as 46 k ε ℓ 1 3 ℓ following terray et al 1999 we prescribe the turbulent length scale with a linear profile according to 47 ℓ z κ z o z z o κ z z z o where κ is the von kármán constant z o is the roughness length the surface roughness length z o is commonly parameterized as z o a h s with a being a constant between 0 2 and 1 terray et al 1999 burchard 2001 we use a 0 6 which is consistent with moghimi et al 2016 finally we parameterize the vertical mixing due to wave breaking k b r with eqs 45 47 including a tapering function t z 1 tanh 4 z approaching zero for z 3 the complete parameterization of k b r becomes 48 k b r z t z ε z 1 3 ℓ 4 3 which is added to kpp for both the momentum and scalar diffusivities we do not distinguish between mixing due to white capping in deep water and depth induced breaking our approach is suitable for both deep and shallow wave breaking giving depth averaged diffusivities 49 k b r k b r z η d z d z 50 0 1 e d s ρ w 1 3 h s for z η max h 2 h s which is larger than that of usm10 by a factor of 2 the breaking diffusivity model of usm10 consists k b r z c b r e d s ρ w 1 3 h r m s f b r where h r m s h s 2 is the root mean square wave height f b r is a prescribed vertical structure normalized such that h η η ˆ f b r z d z 1 and c b r is a non dimensional scaling factor o 0 1 usm10 considered three arbitrary types of vertical structures f b r z with different decay rates in shallow water our approach differs from usm10 in terms of the vertical structure and in magnitude by a factor of 2 which is consistent with the different wave breaking height scaling parameters h s vs h r m s based on the conservation of momentum the momentum flux vector at the ocean surface is given by 51 τ o c τ d s τ u where τ d s ρ g s d s f θ k σ 1 d f d θ is the resolved momentum flux due to breaking in deep water s d s f θ is the spectral energy dissipation due to breaking and τ u is the momentum flux supported by tangential stress and the unresolved part of the wave spectrum the latter can be obtained from the momentum conservation equation on the air side τ a τ w τ u with τ a corresponding to the total wind stress and τ w ρ g s i n f θ k σ 1 d f d θ is wave induced stress therefore the ocean side stress can be written as 52 τ o c τ a τ w τ d s which is consistent with breivik et al 2015 and wu et al 2019 for winds and waves in equilibrium τ w τ d s thus τ o c τ a which corresponds to the common assumption used for ocean models the ocean side stress becomes smaller than the wind stress for developing waves and can exceed τ a for decaying winds similarly τ o c can deviate in direction from τ a for conditions of misaligned winds and waves in this study as discussed in section 2 5 2 τ o c is approximated as τ a since their magnitude difference is generally small but is introduced here for completeness we note that staneva et al 2017 reported significant differences on storm surge levels produced in the north sea by τ o c compared to τ a 2 4 idealized shoaling waves the wave approximations were tested with an idealized wave shoaling experiment using ww3 the shoaling wave test case of ww3 tp1 8 consisting of a linear 1 km long beach profile out to 12 m water depth was extended 5 km further offshore with a quadratic shelf profile out to a water depth of 400 m the offshore boundary conditions were specified with a directional wave spectrum from an idealized wind forced solution close to wind wave equilibrium with 10 m s winds romero 2019 and h s 2 6 m the wave spectrum was allowed to propagate toward the beach without wind forcing bottom friction ardhuin et al 2003 and depth induced breaking battjes and janssen 1978 were activated with no other source terms directional spectra were saved at selected locations and used to test the wec forcing approximations offline wave solutions did not include current effects on waves the purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate the various approximations for an idealized shoaling broadband wave spectrum starting from deep water the current profiles used for the computations of the pressure and the bernoulli head are u z u s z for convenience because u s z has non zero second derivatives needed for some of the terms the significant wave height h s set down η ˆ and η ˆ m η ˆ are plotted as a function of the water depth scaled by k p in fig 1a the wave height decreases sharply in shallow water due to depth induced breaking and bottom friction the monochromatic set down η ˆ m is larger than the broadband value for 1 k p h 2 where η ˆ is small but finite the set down calculated from the spectral reconstruction pww3 is in good agreement with direct computations with a small positive bias 20 the bernoulli head 39 and pressure 41 generalized for a wave spectrum given by 53 k 1 2 σ ψ f θ k sinh 2 k d h z 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k z z d z d f d θ and 54 p g ψ f θ σ tanh h sinh 2 h v z η η ˆ cosh 2 h v z h h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 cosh 2 k z d z 2 k tanh h v η η ˆ d f d θ computed from the resolved spectrum and spectral reconstruction are plotted against k p h in fig 1b f the pressure terms magnitudes 1 4 are plotted separately in panels c f the corresponding approximations 40 and 42 shown in purple and estimates from the spectral reconstruction pww3 shown in blue are in good agreement with the direct computations with relatively small differences the spectral reconstruction gives the largest difference for p 4 with a negative bias of 30 in intermediate and deep water all pressure terms and bernoulli head have maxima in shallow water with k and p 4 being dominant in deep water the corresponding stokes drift profiles computed from the resolved directional spectra and spectral reconstruction are compared to the approximation in fig 2 for water depths varying from deep k p h π to shallow k p h π 10 in panels a e the stokes drift approximation accurately reproduces the broadband computations with small deviations near the surface at k p h 0 3 e the spectral reconstruction gives errors up 20 in magnitude with larger errors near the surface the monochromatic approximation misses the shear intensification near the surface for k p h 0 3 the shoaling waves analysis is complemented by the analyzing structure of the vertical diffusivity due to wave breaking in shallow water we compare the different vertical structures of f b r z d 1 k b r z d z computed from eq 48 against the three types of vertical structures considered by usm10 in fig 2f the vertical structure of 48 is most similar to the structure type iii of ums10 with relatively strong decay near the surface in contrast structures type i and ii show more gradual decay near the surface although the different structures differ in shape all four show qualitatively similar trends over the depth range of twice h s 2 5 regional model configuration the coupling framework is evaluated with ww3 and implemented in roms building on the work by ums10 we used an existing nested configuration in southern california with a horizontal resolution of 270 m see figure 1 in 52 2 5 1 wave model the ww3 solutions from romero et al 2020 hereafter referred to as rhm20 were used to evaluate the coupling framework offline the solutions cover two one month long periods in the winter 2006 and spring 2007 the winter period included periods of strong winds and relatively large waves with surface winds reaching 18 m s and h s up to 8 5 m in the open ocean the model configuration includes realistic bathymetry and wind forcing from the weather research and forecasting wrf model renault et al 2016 the wave model was constrained with buoy observations through boundary conditions and validated against independent buoys within the domain as described in rhm20 the wave model was forced with the wind input by ardhuin et al 2010 the discrete interaction approximation of the nonlinear energy fluxes hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 the saturation based wave breaking dissipation by romero 2019 and bottom dissipation of ardhuin et al 2003 available wave directional spectra at seven different buoy locations diablo canyon harvest goleta rincon anacapa santa monica and san pedro see fig 1 in rhm20 in water depths between 550 and 20 m for the two periods were used to evaluate the wave approximations we used the corresponding roms current profiles from rhm20 at the buoy locations for the offline computation and validation of the pressure and bernoulli head 2 5 2 ocean model the wave approximations and parameterization of the vertical mixing due to breaking waves described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 were implemented and tested in roms with the 270 m resolution configuration in southern california renault et al 2016 dauhajre et al 2019 romero et al 2020 which includes realistic bathymetry tides and forcing from wrf the vertical grid has 50 levels in terrain following or sigma coordinates with vertical grid cell refinement near the surface and the bottom the wave forcing was generated offline from a ww3 solution identical to that described in romero et al 2020 except for the addition of tidal forcing from non wec roms output through changes in water elevation to avoid unphysically large waves at the coast for our relatively coarse roms model particularly around islands with abrupt changes in water depth ww3 included depth induced breaking dissipation battjes and janssen 1978 this was further supplemented offline with a depth dependent wave height limiter according to 55 h s min γ d h s with γ 0 78 ww3dg similarly the online computed stokes drift transport surface stokes drift and wave set down were also scaled offline by a limiting factor f 2 with f min 1 γ d h s calculated prior to applying the limiter 55 the power of two for the factor f 2 is dimensionally consistent with the dependence of the stokes drift and set down on the wave amplitude squared the γ factor helped maintain numerical stability at the coastline but not everywhere enabling the depth limited breaking diffusivity even for this relatively coarse model grid is by far the most effective way to maintain numerical stability and reasonable integration times steps without violating the cfl condition in roms all wec runs include both the limiter and the depth limited wave breaking diffusivity note that the waves do not vanish at the boundary which has to be accounted for in the boundary conditions of roms at the land interface by imposing zero normal lagrangian flow the roms boundary conditions at the shore are free slip and zero normal flux for non wec and zero normal lagrangian flux for wec with u z u s z open boundaries of the outgoing barotropic flow and surface elevation use shallow gravity wave radiation conditions flather 1976 chapman 1985 and the tangential barotropic velocities use an orlanski radiation condition orlanski 1976 orlanski type radiation boundary conditions are also used for the baroclinic fields including tracers but with additional nudging toward the parent solution marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 we subtracted the normal stokes drift at the boundary from the inflow of the non wec parent used for the nudging of the wec run following kumar et al 2015 the outgoing baroclinic flow and tracers were weakly nudged with a time scale of 360 days while the incoming normal flow and tracers are strongly nudged with a time scale of 30 min we carried out several tests with longer nudging time scales for the incoming flow and tracers which resulted in spurious and apparent artifacts at the boundaries of the wec solutions for comparison the control non wec run was also tightly nudged despite the fact that weakly nudged non wec solutions behave reasonably near the boundaries sponge layers of 40 grid cells with a horizontal diffusivity linearly decreasing from 5 m 2 s at the boundary to zero in the interior were used for both wec and non wec runs roms vertical mixing is parameterized with the k profile parameterization kpp 15 32 the non breaking wave induced mixing from the time derivative of mean particle displacement variance k v w eq 26 was included as an additional source of mixing although it is several orders of magnitude smaller than kpp except at the surface where kpp is zero as mentioned before all wec runs included vertical mixing due to depth limited breaking to help maintain numerical stability at the coastline particularly for the vertical cfl condition deep water breaking diffusivity was not included except in one of the runs additional sources of wec mixing due to bottom drag are not considered in this study comparisons between τ o c and τ a based on offline computations from ww3 solutions at the buoy locations indicated that in general τ o c τ a is a good approximation with a few percent in magnitude except in certain areas close to the shore reaching differences of up to 10 in magnitude due spatial inhomogeneities of the winds for the surface momentum flux in roms we assume wind wave equilibrium i e τ o c τ a and τ a is computed with the bulk formulation described in large and yeager 2004 and large 2006 eq 52 is introduced in section 2 3 for completeness for general applications τ a should be computed from the wave model accounting for sea state or wave age dependence and s i n should account for atmospheric stability effects including humidity ecmwf 2013 table 1 summarizes the different model solutions based on the forcing which are 1 a control ctl without wec 2 spectral peak monochromatic wec wecm corresponding to ums10 3 broadband wec forcing within the framework here described wecb and 4 wecb with near surface vertical mixing due to breaking enabled wcbk 3 results the results are divided into two subsections 1 analysis of the wave approximations and parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking and 2 analysis of roms wec solutions compared to a control without wave forcing 3 1 stokes drift we begin this subsection by comparing the stokes drift approximation against broadband computations using the resolved directional spectrum from the ww3 regional configuration in california for the sake of comparison we also analyze the stokes drift obtained with the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 examples during a strong wind wave event in deep 550 m and shallower water depth 20 m are shown in fig 3 left and right panels respectively the resolved directional spectra left sub panels are compared against the spectral reconstruction according to kumar et al 2017 right sub panels referred to as pww3 following their labeling the directional spectrum reconstruction pww3 is narrower than the resolved spectrum the corresponding azimuth integrated spectra ψ f ψ f θ d θ are shown in figs 3c d the resolved 1d spectrum in pink shows a tail of approximately f 5 within the level observed by romero and melville 2010 and lenain and melville 2017 in contrast the reconstructed spectrum pww3 decays much faster with increasing frequency particularly for the shallower case the resulting vertical stokes drift profiles in 3e f show the spectral reconstruction is missing a significant fraction of the stokes drift near the surface for the shallower water case panel f because of the lower energy levels of the spectrum at higher frequencies the stokes drift approximation from this study u s a is shown in purple accurately matching the broadband computations in deep water e with small but noticeable errors for the shallower water case f as described in section 2 1 the approximation u s a is composed of two parts 1 u s e which is based on a vertical scale constrained by the known surface stokes drift and stokes transport and 2 u s p calculated using the peak wavenumber significant wave height and mean wave direction the two components u s e and u s p are smoothly combined with a ramp function yielding u s a both u s e and u s p are shown in fig 3e f with dashed red and blue lines respectively the component u s e matches the pink curve at the surface by design but decays much faster with depth for z 10 m in contrast the monochromatic approximation u s p based on the spectral peak information better matches the pink line at depth strongly underestimating the stokes drift near the surface the resulting blended approximation u s a giving more weight to u s e near the surface and u s p at depth does a good job matching the profiles computed from directional wave spectra ww3 examples of complex spectra during mixed wind sea and swell with strong misalignment are shown in fig 4 in deep 472 m left panels and shallower water depth 22 m right panels the two spectral peaks can be clearly seen in the directional spectra a b from both ww3 and the spectral reconstruction pww3 with an angle separation of 90 degrees or more the directional spreading of the swell band is larger in reconstruction compared to that of the resolved spectra the corresponding 1d spectra clearly show the two peaks of the wind sea and the swell with the latter containing most of the energy for this case of weak wind forcing the ww3 spectra pink show a tail consistent with the equilibrium spectrum of f 4 by resio et al 2004 under weak wind forcing the spectrum would be expected to transition to a saturation regime of f 5 at higher frequencies not resolved by the model romero and melville 2010 lenain and melville 2017 romero 2019 the reconstructed spectrum blue decays much faster with increasing frequency in panel c underestimating the stokes drift near the surface e in contrast pww3 overestimates the surface stokes drift in f despite the fact that the tail of the spectrum is slightly lower than that of ww3 which is consistent with the narrower directional spreading of the wind sea webb and fox kemper 2015 the approximation u s a does a good job matching the broadband computations near the surface and at depth but with larger differences at intermediate depths 1 z 10 particularly in fig 4e thus far we have focused on the profiles of the stokes drift magnitude the direction of a stokes drift profile is constant with depth only when the directional wave spectrum is symmetric in azimuth and aligned in a particular direction across frequencies which is often not the case for realistic spectra due to misalignment of the longer dominant waves and the wind or mixed wind sea and swell sullivan et al 2012 lenain and melville 2014 large et al 2019 romero et al 2019 fig 5 shows the vertical profiles of the stokes drift direction θ s for the examples shown in figs 3 and 4 the ww3 stokes drift profiles pink of the large wave event figs 5a b show angle variations of about 10 to 15 degrees between the surface and z 20 m which correlate with the approximation u s a but with appreciable differences the direction of u s a smoothly connects the angles in depth of its constituents u s e and u p in contrast θ s for the spectral reconstruction is depth independent because the spectrum only has a single peak leading to larger directional errors near the surface for the case of mixed wind sea and swell the spectral reconstruction gives excellent agreement with the full broadband profile θ s z while that of the approximation u s a gives similar trends compared to ww3 but with finite errors the directional error of the approximation at depth is directly dependent on how well the longer waves are aligned with the spectrally weighted mean direction θ this can be improved for mixed wind sea swell conditions by using a mean wave direction weighted more strongly by the longer waves or alternatively by using the mean swell direction from the partition pww3 instead of θ as shown in figs 5 with dotted purple lines the stokes drift approximation was examined more thoroughly with the ww3 solutions from the two one month long periods in december 2006 and the spring 2007 rhm20 the available wave spectra from the seven locations were used for this analysis bulk comparisons of the stokes drift magnitude between the approximation u s a and the spectral reconstruction pww3 against the broadband computations are shown in figs 6a d respectively the data for all depths z max 30 h are included there is considerably more scatter in the spectral reconstruction compared to the approximation u s a the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the normalized bias nb defined as 56 nb x x x r e f x r e f and 57 nrmse x x x r e f 2 x r e f 2 1 2 where x is a given variable with known reference value x r e f ardhuin et al 2010 are indicated in each panel the stokes drift approximation gives a nrmse of 9 and no bias whereas for the spectral reconstruction nrmse 26 and nb 1 these comparisons are dominated by the stokes drift near the surface where the magnitude is largest the same comparisons for cases without background swell shown in figs 6g j give smaller errors by a 2 except for the bias of spectral reconstruction increasing in magnitude with nb 4 the vertical distribution of the absolute magnitude differences of the stokes drift approximation and the spectral reconstruction against pww3 against the spectral calculation are shown in figs 6b e respectively the stokes drift approximation shows the largest amplitude errors at about 2 m below the surface in contrast the spectral reconstruction gives the largest errors near the surface spanning a much wider range than that of the approximation which is consistent with the scatter shown in 6a d however the vertical profile of angle deviations from the spectral calculation are on average larger for the stokes drift approximation compared to the spectral reconstruction shown in figs 6c f the average rms angle deviations are 6 and 3 for u s a and pww3 respectively which are indicated with dashed lines fig 6e f excluding the cases with background swell the vertical errors of the stokes drift approximation are slightly reduced for the amplitude and significantly reduced for the direction without several outliers figs 6h i the vertical distribution of the stokes drift error for the spectral reconstruction without background swell fig 6k l is nearly unchanged for the magnitude and only slightly improved for the direction near the surface this analysis shows that neither method is perfect but the method here described captures most of the variability of the stokes drift the spectral reconstruction does best in terms of directionality at depth for mixed wind sea swell conditions near the surface where most of the stokes drift is contained the errors of the spectral reconstruction can be substantial in both magnitude and direction as shown earlier the directional error of stokes drift approximation in the presence of a background swell can be reduced by using the swell direction when available 3 2 set down bernoulli head and quasi static pressure the set down comparing the monochromatic and the spectral reconstruction estimates pww3 against direct computations from the resolved spectra are plotted in 7a d respectively both the nb and nrmse are about 40 for the monochromatic values and 20 for the spectral reconstruction our wec implementation with roms uses η ˆ from ww3 the ratio η ˆ m η ˆ is used for the computation of p a the set down for the data here analyzed is negligible except for the cases in relatively shallower water h 20 m the corresponding bernoulli head and pressure approximations evaluated offline against direct computations from resolved spectra are shown in figs 7b c there is a good correspondence between the two sets with nb of 13 and 4 and nrmse of 14 and 7 for k a and p a respectively the spectral reconstruction fig 7e f gives slightly smaller errors for the bernoulli head and much larger errors for the quasi static errors of about 50 for both nrmse and nb 3 3 vertical mixing due to non breaking unsteady waves we proceed to analyze the different approximations of the wave induced vertical diffusivity due to unsteady waves 26 fig 8a c shows a scatter plot comparing the approximations to the direct estimates of k v w from the directional spectrum the iterative method monochromatic based on mean wavelength l m and monochromatic based on the peak wavenumber are shown in panels a c respectively the iterative method gives the smallest errors with nrmse 9 and a small positive bias nb 5 both of which increase to nrmse 11 and nb 7 for the method based on l m the approximation in terms of k p gives the largest errors with nrmse nb 35 in practice the iterative method would require the depth integrated vertical parcel displacement r v w 2 eq 29 which is not a standard output parameter of ww3 however l m is an optional output parameter of ww3 and can be used to approximate k v w along with h s with relatively small errors alternatively h s and k p can be used to approximate k v w but with substantial errors the corresponding values calculated from the spectral reconstruction gives much larger errors fig 8d with nrms 59 and a positive normalized bias of 38 3 4 vertical mixing due to wave breaking here we demonstrate the parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking the non dimensional tke dissipation profile 45 is plotted on the figure of sm15 in fig 9a the sm15 data color coded by wave age includes near surface measurements obtained with an infrared stereo camera system our profile approximately matches the measurements at lower wave ages and does not account for the large dissipation values closest to the surface the large dissipation values are confined to a thin layer with a small contribution to the depth integrated dissipation fig 9b shows two examples of the vertical mixing with and without the contribution due to wave breaking the two cases shown are in deep water with conditions with wind speeds of 13 and 19 m s h s 8 5 and 4 5 m and e d s 1 9 and 0 55 w m 2 with the stronger forcing case corresponding the profile with larger vertical mixing the contribution of k b r closest to the surface 2 6 for times the magnitude of kpp for these examples as shown in the inset 3 5 wave effects on currents in this subsection one month long roms solutions for the regional configuration are analyzed in terms of the mean circulation eddy kinetic energy and current gradients the purpose of this analysis is to highlight some of the impacts of due to wec we compare different wec solutions against one another and the control without wec a detailed analysis of wec at submesoscales in the open ocean is described in hypolite et al 2021 the average circulation at 1 m below the surface for the month of december 2006 is shown in fig 10a b corresponding to the control ctl and broadband wec wecb solution respectively the corresponding monthly average stokes drift velocity at z 1 m is mapped in fig 10c reaching a magnitude of 5 cm s due to the southeast in the open ocean this is consistent with the predominant wind forcing from the northwest there is an obvious contrast for the surface stokes drift in the open ocean compared the southern california bight which is sheltered by the abrupt change of the coastline at point conception and the islands therefore wec is expected to be most significant outside the bight from increased exposure to wave forcing the monthly circulation of the control and the wec solution are very similar both in the open ocean and sheltered areas with a few noticeable differences fig 11a the largest differences are primarily due horizontal mismatch of the mesoscale mean circulation which can be seen in patterns with alternating sign surrounding the mesoscale flow north of point conception there is an increase of the mean circulation along the perimeter of the coast and a reduction of the mean current further offshore over areas exposed to the incoming wave energy the mean circulation from the other solutions wecm and wecbk are also very similar and therefore are not shown for reference the average spectral peak monochromatic stokes drift at z 1 m is shown in fig 10d being about half of the broadband mean in open ocean fig 10c the difference in mean current magnitude for wecm and wecbk relative to wecb are shown in fig 11c e again the differences primarily show structural differences around the mesoscale circulation the mean circulation for wecm is more similar to wecb compared to wecbk which shows largest differences the wecbk solution gives a reduction of the current amplitude over the santa barbara eddy i e the cyclonic circulation within the santa barbara channel suggesting that vertical shear is important for the eddy the eddy kinetic energy eke defined as eke 1 2 u 2 v 2 with u u u corresponding to the current anomaly and the brackets denoting the temporal monthly average is shown at 1 m below the surface for ctl and wecb in figs 12a b overall the large scale eke pattern is again very similar between the two runs with minor qualitative differences differences in eke between wecb and ctl in fig 11b are primarily due to the misalignment of the large scale circulation there is a coherent reduction in eke due to wec along the coast north of point conception in the santa maria basin the monochromatic wec forcing compared to wecb gives on average increased surface eke 11d in contrast the vertical diffusivity due to breaking on average reduces the near surface eke 11e this shows that wec forcing here considered has relatively small impacts on the mean circulation and the mesoscale current variability the ocean surface for the relatively short model integration of one month with tightly nudged boundaries toward the parent solution we further explore the impacts of wec on small scale current variability starting with monthly variances of the vorticity ζ v x u y and divergence δ u x v y also computed at 1 m below the surface for ctl and wecb figs 12c f the vorticity variance is larger than that of the divergence by about a factor of 2 for both wec and the control solution both the vorticity and divergence variances are enhanced in the open ocean by wec compared to the control the increase of the variances is most evident in the lower left area of the model configuration to better assess the wec impacts the variance fields were smoothed with a 20 km isotropic low pass filter and directly compared through the differences wec minus the control which are shown in figs 13a b corresponding to the vorticity and divergence fields respectively wec on average increases the vorticity and divergence variances particularly in the open ocean with increased exposure to wave forcing however these effects are partially reduced for the spectral peak monochromatic wec forcing 13c d or when the vertical mixing due to wave breaking is included 13e f in particular for the surface divergence the wec effects on the surface current variability are further analyzed with respect to the turbulent langmuir number l a t u w u s 0 which was introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to characterize langmuir turbulence of large eddy simulations les with u w corresponding to the water side friction velocity our roms solutions are hydrostatic and larger scale yet it is reasonable to expect that the impacts of wec can be characterized to some extent with l a t as a starting point we consider the time series of wind speed resolved surface stokes drift and l a t at harvest in the open ocean fig 14 the location of the harvest buoy is indicated with a white start in fig 10 there are three events with wind speeds exceeding 15 m s and resolved surface stokes drift exceeding 15 cm s with the largest wind wave event toward the end of the month l a t varies between 0 2 and 1 but generally asymptotes toward 0 3 which is representative of the langmuir turbulence regime mcwilliams et al 1997 the lowest values of l a t happen between storms when the wind speed is small and the stokes drift is relatively large during the three large wind events l a t approaches 0 3 but generally remains just above it taking the time series at harvest as representative of the synoptic wave forcing conditions we sorted the model data into two groups to compute ensemble statistics a strong wave forcing group with l a t 0 37 l a t 1 and a weak wave forcing group with l a t 0 37 l a t 2 the threshold of 0 37 is arbitrary but small changes to the threshold do not affect the results of the analysis the resulting maps for the average l a t are shown in fig 15a b in the open ocean l a t is about 0 33 and 0 43 for the strong l a t 1 and weak l a t 1 wave forcing cases respectively the corresponding filtered vorticity and divergence variance differences between wecb and non wec are shown in panels c d and e f respectively the vorticity and divergence variances due to wec are largest for the group with the lower l a t in the open ocean in contrast the impacts of wec on the vorticity and divergence variances within the southern california bight are generally small where l a t is large the relative variance differences between the two groups for wecb figs 15g h show no bias for the vorticity and a positive bias for the divergence with values of up to 120 corresponding to larger divergence variance for the group with larger wave forcing l a t 1 this shows that although the current gradient variability differences relative to the control are inversely related to l a t the current gradient variability for the wecb run at low l a t is increased only for the divergence offshore the work by hypolite et al 2021 investigates wec in the open ocean at submesoscales in more detail including higher horizontal resolution comparing conditions with remotely generated swell vs locally forced wind waves their analysis shows that wec impacts increase with increasing model resolution they also show that wec enhances the near surface velocity and density gradients but locally generated waves additionally result in a sink of surface buoyancy gradients from the onset of small scale structures with strong current gradients and vertical velocities 4 summary and discussion we presented a set of wave approximations and a parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking for coupled wave ocean models within the wave average framework by mcwilliams et al 2004 the proposed framework is well suited for coastal applications not limited to deep water or narrowband waves and is significantly more efficient and accurate to a certain extent than the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 the approximations were demonstrated offline with solutions from ww3 for an idealized shoaling wave spectrum and validated with model data from a realistic regional model configuration in southern california the approximation of the stokes drift uses a two scale approach to handle misaligned winds and dominant waves and mixed wind sea and swell conditions the stokes drift approximation gives overall smaller errors in magnitude with nrmse 9 compared to the spectral reconstruction of kumar et al 2017 based on a jonswap spectrum with nrmse of 26 in terms of direction the proposed approximation gives smaller errors near the surface but larger errors at depth compared to the spectral reconstruction especially in conditions with mixed wind sea and swell the bernoulli head approximated monochromatically using the spectral peak information ums10 and the spectral reconstruction was shown to give errors of about 14 and 8 respectively the quasi static pressure based on a two scale approach resulted in nrmse of 7 and a bias of 4 whereas the spectral reconstruction gives much larger errors approaching 50 approximations of the wave induced vertical diffusivity due to the time rate of change of particle displacement square resulted in errors of 11 or smaller increasing to 35 for the monochromatic approximation based on the spectral peak information and larger errors 59 for the spectral reconstruction we implemented the wave approximations and vertical mixing parameterization due to breaking in roms building on the work by ums10 the wave parameters used for the conservative roms wec forcing files are a w peak wave period t p θ surface and depth average stokes drift vector and set down adding to a total 8 parameters which is exactly twice the number of parameters used by the original code of ums10 for non conservative wec forcing a similar number of parameters is needed for a spectral reconstruction and two spectral bands wind sea and swell a total of 8 parameters is relatively small compared to 500 or more for a full spectral coupling depending on the resolution of the directional spectrum of the wave model in terms of computation our wec implementation is slower than the original code of ums10 by about 20 this a relatively small additional cost when compared to the spectral reconstruction approach or a full 2d spectrum exchange from the wave model for which the wec terms have to be computed for all spectral components and added together effectively increasing the number of operations by a factor nf nd with nf and nd corresponding to the number of frequencies and directions used to discretize the wave spectrum in roms to compute the wec terms spectrally with a 15 degree resolution nd 24 and 20 frequencies the cost would increase by a factor of 500 which is prohibitive at the moment for realistic applications the new wec framework was tested with a regional configuration forced offline with ww3 a one month long solution in southern california with a horizontal resolution of 270 m was compared against a control solution without wave forcing wec impacts on the monthly average near surface circulation and eddy kinetic energy are small wec impacts are most significant at small scales increasing surface current gradient variability with larger impacts when the turbulent langmuir number is small the surface current gradient variability enhancement due to wec near the surface is partially reduced when the vertical mixing due breaking is included similarly wec impacts on surface current variability are larger for broadband wec forcing compared to the spectral peak monochromatic approach the proposed wave approximations improve upon the work by ums10 by accounting for finite spectral bandwidth not limited to only using the spectral peak information this allows for the modeling of wave effects on currents more realistically including conditions of mixed wind sea and swell the stokes drift approximation makes no assumption about the spectral shape unlike other studies that impose or assume a spectral shape e g 7 27 the proposed approximation is the only one to this day that is both performant and realistic for broadband spectra ultimately wec forcing ideally should be computed directly from the directional wave spectrum at the expense of significantly increasing the amount of information exchanged across models and computation but is not feasible for realistic configurations the current approach allows for the investigation of wave current interactions seamlessly across the open ocean continental shelf inner shelf and surf zone future applications include investigation of wec on material transport and dispersion e g 55 56

framework by ums10 to study wave current interactions across the inner shelf and surf zone with regional model configurations of roms coupled to swan finding good performance against field observations wec forcing should ideally be computed from directional wave spectra but is it not practical as it requires the exchange of large amounts of information between models especially for configurations with relatively large domains at high horizontal resolution it is well known that the monochromatic approximation for deep water waves results in an underestimation of the stokes drift

used with coupled wave ocean models e g 28 30 66 the approximations of this work are suitable for coastal models not limited to deep water waves e g 6 7 the stokes drift for a monochromatic wave is

2 u s this is based on the profile of a deep water monochromatic wave by combining eqs 15 17 we first approximate the stokes drift according to 19 u s e u o cosh 2 k s e z h sinh 2 k s e d where u o u s 0 tanh 2 k s e d corresponds to a characteristic surface stokes drift velocity the approximation u s e is good near the surface for intermediate and deep water dominant waves however it decays much faster with depth than broadband calculations in contrast a monochromatic approximation of the form 20 u s p z g a w 2 k p 2 σ k cosh 2 k p z h sinh 2 k p d cos θ sin θ does a good job at depth and in shallow water with the wave amplitude a w h s 2 2 k p being the peak wavenumber and the spectrally weighted mean wave direction defined as 21 θ tan 1 ψ f θ f n θ sin θ d f d θ ψ f θ f n θ cos θ d f d θ the power n θ 0 is commonly used in shallow water k p h π 10 the stokes drift is approximated by 22 u s a u s p and in deeper water by combining u s e and u s p with a switch function h z according to 23 u s a h z u s p 1 h z u s e the switch function 24 h z tanh z k s e 2 1 2 was found to work well over a wide range of conditions finally u s p is adjusted iteratively by minimizing the error of the stokes drift transport to within less than 1 following mcwilliams et al 2004 the vertical tracer square displacement and corresponding diffusivity for a monochromatic wave are given by 25 r v w 2 a sinh k z h sinh k d 2 and 26 k v w 1 2 t r v w 2 respectively where the absolute value for the latter is introduced here to avoid negative diffusivities the generalized vertical parcel displacement squared for a spectrum of waves gives 27 r v w 2 2 ψ f θ sinh k z h sinh k d 2 d f d θ and the corresponding depth integrated square displacement becomes 28 r v w 2 h η η ˆ r v w 2 d z 29 2 ψ f θ coth k d k d csch 2 k d 2 k d f d θ in analogy to the stokes drift approximation the right hand side of eq 29 is approximated by 30 r v w 2 h s 2 2 2 coth k r e d k r e d csch 2 k r e d 2 k r e and the effective wavenumber k r e is first estimated from the r v w 2 at the surface divided by the broadband value of r v w 2 31 k r e r v w 2 z 0 2 r v w 2 then it is corrected iteratively according to 32 k r e r v w 2 z 0 coth k r e d k r e d csch 2 k r e d 2 r v w 2 starting with the initial guess to compute a new k r e and so on the iteration converges after a few iterations 15 or less and is not needed in deep water k p h 2 π finally the vertical square particle displacement is approximated by 33 r v w 2 h s 2 2 sinh k r e z h sinh k r e d 2 and the corresponding wave induced vertical tracer diffusivity follows from eq 26 in the absence of r v w 2 from a wave model the particle displacement squared can be approximated alternatively using the mean wavelength 34 l m 2 π k ψ f θ η 2 d f d θ with k r e 2 π l m and r v w 2 directly estimated from eq 33 finally if l m is not available k r e can be approximated by k p at the expense of significantly larger errors for r v w 2 and k v w the monochromatic wave average quasi static set down according to longuet higgins and stewart 1962 is given by 35 η ˆ a 2 k 2 sinh 2 k d which for a wave spectrum becomes 36 η ˆ ψ f θ k sinh 2 k d d f d θ the set down for a broadband spectrum is generally smaller than a monochromatic approximation based on h s and k p for intermediate water depth assuming that η ˆ calculated spectrally is known we calculate a filtered wave amplitude a f such that a monochromatic approximation 37 η ˆ m a f 2 k p 2 sinh 2 k p d matches the broadband set down at intermediate water depths or shallower k p h 2 π specifically 38 a f a w min 1 η ˆ η ˆ m 1 2 being limited to a f a w since η ˆ m becomes very small in deep water the filtered wave amplitude a f is used for the approximation of quasi static pressure as described below the bernoulli head without the quasi static terms for a monochromatic wave is given by 39 k 1 4 σ a 2 k sinh 2 k d h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k z z d z where v k u and u is the eulerian current velocity it is approximated by 40 k a 1 4 σ a f 2 k p sinh 2 k p d h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k p z z d z with k p k p cos θ sin θ following ums10 the leading order quasi static pressure is given by 41 p g a 2 2 σ tanh h sinh 2 h v z η η ˆ cosh 2 h v z h h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 cosh 2 k z d z 2 k tanh h v η η ˆ where h k d the first and third pressure terms can only be finite in intermediate and shallow water because of the tanh 2 h sinh 2 h factor and therefore are approximated with the filtered long wave information a f and k p the second term is approximated with k p but with the total wave amplitude a w and the fourth pressure term is approximated with the surface stokes drift and the two scales k e and k p the complete pressure approximation for the four terms is given by 42 p a g

deep water k p d 2 π the last term in 42 becomes u s u η whereas in shallow water k p d π 10 it matches the monochromatic approximation 41 fourth term in terms of a w and k p for the sake of comparison we also consider the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 to compute the wec forcing the wave spectral reconstruction is based on the premise that given a few parameters energy mean period and direction and possibly other spectral moments directional wave spectra can be reconstructed based on empirical models the reconstruction can include a combination of different wave systems for example mixed wind sea and swell kumar et al 2017 proposed the use of the jonswap spectrum and the spectral partition information from ww3 to reconstruct the directional spectrum from which wec forcing can be computed by ocean circulation models the spectral reconstruction is computationally expensive and not necessarily more accurate as demonstrated here 2 3 non conservative wec effects here we consider the energy and momentum flux due to surface wave breaking the flux of energy due to wave breaking enhances the vertical mixing near the surface which is commonly modeled with various turbulence closure schemes craig and banner 1994 terray et al 1999 burchard 2001 umlauf and burchard 2003 we model the vertical mixing due to wave breaking k b r directly as a near surface enhancement of the k profile parameterization kpp 32 by generalizing the framework introduced by ums10 for both white capping and depth limited breaking ums10 prescribed several profiles for k b r z in shallow water that were constrained by a depth average diffusivity k b r c b h s 2 e d s ρ w 1 3 where c b is a dimensionless factor o 0 1 e d s is the flux of energy due to wave breaking and ρ w is the water density the vertical profiles were designed for shallow water and therefore are not immediately applicable for deep water wave breaking we follow a different approach our starting point is the empirical scaling of the turbulent kinetic energy tke dissipation profile ε z by sutherland and melville 2015 hereafter referred to as sm15 based on h s and the energy flux due to wave breaking e d s according to 44 ε h s ρ w e d s ε n f z where ε n is the non dimensional dissipation rate ρ w is the water density and z z h s is the non dimensional depth with z z η η ˆ being the depth from the surface sm15 reported two power law regimes ε n z 2 for z 1 and ε n z 1 closer to the surface eq 44 differs from the scaling by terray et al 1996 which is in terms of the wind input as opposed to the dissipation due to breaking the input of tke due to breaking e d s ρ w is often parameterized as m u w 3 with u w corresponding to the water side friction velocity and m 100 craig and banner 1994 more recently esters et al 2018 reported tke dissipation rate measurements collected with a vertical profiles over a wide range of conditions their measurements did not capture the enhancement of ε near the surface which could be in part because their data did resolve the dissipation profile very near surface i e z h s 1 they reported a single power law dependence of ε z 3 2 we model the nondimensional tke dissipation profile according to 45 f z 0 9508 a f b f z c f z 2 with a f 4 30 b f 8 3 and c f 10 3 such that 3 0 f z d z 1 approximately matching sm15 eq 45 can be used to model the dissipation profile ε z provided e d s and h s are known for a given turbulent length scale ℓ and tke dissipation ε the eddy viscosity k is often parameterized as 46 k ε ℓ 1 3 ℓ following terray et al 1999 we prescribe the turbulent length scale with a linear profile according to 47 ℓ z κ z o z z o κ z z z o where κ is the von kármán constant z o is the roughness length the surface roughness length z o is commonly parameterized as z o a h s with a being a constant between 0 2 and 1 terray et al 1999 burchard 2001 we use a 0 6 which is consistent with moghimi et al 2016 finally we parameterize the vertical mixing due to wave breaking k b r with eqs 45 47 including a tapering function t z 1 tanh 4 z approaching zero for z 3 the complete parameterization of k b r becomes 48 k b r z t z ε z 1 3 ℓ 4 3 which is added to kpp for both the momentum and scalar diffusivities we do not distinguish between mixing due to white capping in deep water and depth induced breaking our approach is suitable for both deep and shallow wave breaking giving depth averaged diffusivities 49 k b r k b r z η d z d z 50 0 1 e d s ρ w 1 3 h s for z η max h 2 h s which is larger than that of usm10 by a factor of 2 the breaking diffusivity model of usm10 consists k b r z c b r e d s ρ w 1 3 h r m s f b r where h r m s h s 2 is the root mean square wave height f b r is a prescribed vertical structure normalized such that h η η ˆ f b r z d z 1 and c b r is a non dimensional scaling factor o 0 1 usm10 considered three arbitrary types of vertical structures f b r z with different decay rates in shallow water our approach differs from usm10 in terms of the vertical structure and in magnitude by a factor of 2 which is consistent with the different wave breaking height scaling parameters h s vs h r m s based on the conservation of momentum the momentum flux vector at the ocean surface is given by 51 τ o c τ d s τ u where τ d s ρ g s d s f θ k σ 1 d f d θ is the resolved momentum flux due to breaking in deep water s d s f θ is the spectral energy dissipation due to breaking and τ u is the momentum flux supported by tangential stress and the unresolved part of the wave spectrum the latter can be obtained from the momentum conservation equation on the air side τ a τ w τ u with τ a corresponding to the total wind stress and τ w ρ g s i n f θ k σ 1 d f d θ is wave induced stress therefore the ocean side stress can be written as 52 τ o c τ a τ w τ d s which is consistent with breivik et al 2015 and wu et al 2019 for winds and waves in equilibrium τ w τ d s thus τ o c τ a which corresponds to the common assumption used for ocean models the ocean side stress becomes smaller than the wind stress for developing waves and can exceed τ a for decaying winds similarly τ o c can deviate in direction from τ a for conditions of misaligned winds and waves in this study as discussed in section 2 5 2 τ o c is approximated as τ a since their magnitude difference is generally small but is introduced here for completeness we note that staneva et al 2017 reported significant differences on storm surge levels produced in the north sea by τ o c compared to τ a 2 4 idealized shoaling waves the wave approximations were tested with an idealized wave shoaling experiment using ww3 the shoaling wave test case of ww3 tp1 8 consisting of a linear 1 km long beach profile out to 12 m water depth was extended 5 km further offshore with a quadratic shelf profile out to a water depth of 400 m the offshore boundary conditions were specified with a directional wave spectrum from an idealized wind forced solution close to wind wave equilibrium with 10 m s winds romero 2019 and h s 2 6 m the wave spectrum was allowed to propagate toward the beach without wind forcing bottom friction ardhuin et al 2003 and depth induced breaking battjes and janssen 1978 were activated with no other source terms directional spectra were saved at selected locations and used to test the wec forcing approximations offline wave solutions did not include current effects on waves the purpose of this experiment was to demonstrate the various approximations for an idealized shoaling broadband wave spectrum starting from deep water the current profiles used for the computations of the pressure and the bernoulli head are u z u s z for convenience because u s z has non zero second derivatives needed for some of the terms the significant wave height h s set down η ˆ and η ˆ m η ˆ are plotted as a function of the water depth scaled by k p in fig 1a the wave height decreases sharply in shallow water due to depth induced breaking and bottom friction the monochromatic set down η ˆ m is larger than the broadband value for 1 k p h 2 where η ˆ is small but finite the set down calculated from the spectral reconstruction pww3 is in good agreement with direct computations with a small positive bias 20 the bernoulli head 39 and pressure 41 generalized for a wave spectrum given by 53 k 1 2 σ ψ f θ k sinh 2 k d h z 2 v z 2 sinh 2 k z z d z d f d θ and 54 p g ψ f θ σ tanh h sinh 2 h v z η η ˆ cosh 2 h v z h h η η ˆ 2 v z 2 cosh 2 k z d z 2 k tanh h v η η ˆ d f d θ computed from the resolved spectrum and spectral reconstruction are plotted against k p h in fig 1b f the pressure terms magnitudes 1 4 are plotted separately in panels c f the corresponding approximations 40 and 42 shown in purple and estimates from the spectral reconstruction pww3 shown in blue are in good agreement with the direct computations with relatively small differences the spectral reconstruction gives the largest difference for p 4 with a negative bias of 30 in intermediate and deep water all pressure terms and bernoulli head have maxima in shallow water with k and p 4 being dominant in deep water the corresponding stokes drift profiles computed from the resolved directional spectra and spectral reconstruction are compared to the approximation in fig 2 for water depths varying from deep k p h π to shallow k p h π 10 in panels a e the stokes drift approximation accurately reproduces the broadband computations with small deviations near the surface at k p h 0 3 e the spectral reconstruction gives errors up 20 in magnitude with larger errors near the surface the monochromatic approximation misses the shear intensification near the surface for k p h 0 3 the shoaling waves analysis is complemented by the analyzing structure of the vertical diffusivity due to wave breaking in shallow water we compare the different vertical structures of f b r z d 1 k b r z d z computed from eq 48 against the three types of vertical structures considered by usm10 in fig 2f the vertical structure of 48 is most similar to the structure type iii of ums10 with relatively strong decay near the surface in contrast structures type i and ii show more gradual decay near the surface although the different structures differ in shape all four show qualitatively similar trends over the depth range of twice h s 2 5 regional model configuration the coupling framework is evaluated with ww3 and implemented in roms building on the work by ums10 we used an existing nested configuration in southern california with a horizontal resolution of 270 m see figure 1 in 52 2 5 1 wave model the ww3 solutions from romero et al 2020 hereafter referred to as rhm20 were used to evaluate the coupling framework offline the solutions cover two one month long periods in the winter 2006 and spring 2007 the winter period included periods of strong winds and relatively large waves with surface winds reaching 18 m s and h s up to 8 5 m in the open ocean the model configuration includes realistic bathymetry and wind forcing from the weather research and forecasting wrf model renault et al 2016 the wave model was constrained with buoy observations through boundary conditions and validated against independent buoys within the domain as described in rhm20 the wave model was forced with the wind input by ardhuin et al 2010 the discrete interaction approximation of the nonlinear energy fluxes hasselmann and hasselmann 1985 the saturation based wave breaking dissipation by romero 2019 and bottom dissipation of ardhuin et al 2003 available wave directional spectra at seven different buoy locations diablo canyon harvest goleta rincon anacapa santa monica and san pedro see fig 1 in rhm20 in water depths between 550 and 20 m for the two periods were used to evaluate the wave approximations we used the corresponding roms current profiles from rhm20 at the buoy locations for the offline computation and validation of the pressure and bernoulli head 2 5 2 ocean model the wave approximations and parameterization of the vertical mixing due to breaking waves described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 were implemented and tested in roms with the 270 m resolution configuration in southern california renault et al 2016 dauhajre et al 2019 romero et al 2020 which includes realistic bathymetry tides and forcing from wrf the vertical grid has 50 levels in terrain following or sigma coordinates with vertical grid cell refinement near the surface and the bottom the wave forcing was generated offline from a ww3 solution identical to that described in romero et al 2020 except for the addition of tidal forcing from non wec roms output through changes in water elevation to avoid unphysically large waves at the coast for our relatively coarse roms model particularly around islands with abrupt changes in water depth ww3 included depth induced breaking dissipation battjes and janssen 1978 this was further supplemented offline with a depth dependent wave height limiter according to 55 h s min γ d h s with γ 0 78 ww3dg similarly the online computed stokes drift transport surface stokes drift and wave set down were also scaled offline by a limiting factor f 2 with f min 1 γ d h s calculated prior to applying the limiter 55 the power of two for the factor f 2 is dimensionally consistent with the dependence of the stokes drift and set down on the wave amplitude squared the γ factor helped maintain numerical stability at the coastline but not everywhere enabling the depth limited breaking diffusivity even for this relatively coarse model grid is by far the most effective way to maintain numerical stability and reasonable integration times steps without violating the cfl condition in roms all wec runs include both the limiter and the depth limited wave breaking diffusivity note that the waves do not vanish at the boundary which has to be accounted for in the boundary conditions of roms at the land interface by imposing zero normal lagrangian flow the roms boundary conditions at the shore are free slip and zero normal flux for non wec and zero normal lagrangian flux for wec with u z u s z open boundaries of the outgoing barotropic flow and surface elevation use shallow gravity wave radiation conditions flather 1976 chapman 1985 and the tangential barotropic velocities use an orlanski radiation condition orlanski 1976 orlanski type radiation boundary conditions are also used for the baroclinic fields including tracers but with additional nudging toward the parent solution marchesiello et al 2001 mason et al 2010 we subtracted the normal stokes drift at the boundary from the inflow of the non wec parent used for the nudging of the wec run following kumar et al 2015 the outgoing baroclinic flow and tracers were weakly nudged with a time scale of 360 days while the incoming normal flow and tracers are strongly nudged with a time scale of 30 min we carried out several tests with longer nudging time scales for the incoming flow and tracers which resulted in spurious and apparent artifacts at the boundaries of the wec solutions for comparison the control non wec run was also tightly nudged despite the fact that weakly nudged non wec solutions behave reasonably near the boundaries sponge layers of 40 grid cells with a horizontal diffusivity linearly decreasing from 5 m 2 s at the boundary to zero in the interior were used for both wec and non wec runs roms vertical mixing is parameterized with the k profile parameterization kpp 15 32 the non breaking wave induced mixing from the time derivative of mean particle displacement variance k v w eq 26 was included as an additional source of mixing although it is several orders of magnitude smaller than kpp except at the surface where kpp is zero as mentioned before all wec runs included vertical mixing due to depth limited breaking to help maintain numerical stability at the coastline particularly for the vertical cfl condition deep water breaking diffusivity was not included except in one of the runs additional sources of wec mixing due to bottom drag are not considered in this study comparisons between τ o c and τ a based on offline computations from ww3 solutions at the buoy locations indicated that in general τ o c τ a is a good approximation with a few percent in magnitude except in certain areas close to the shore reaching differences of up to 10 in magnitude due spatial inhomogeneities of the winds for the surface momentum flux in roms we assume wind wave equilibrium i e τ o c τ a and τ a is computed with the bulk formulation described in large and yeager 2004 and large 2006 eq 52 is introduced in section 2 3 for completeness for general applications τ a should be computed from the wave model accounting for sea state or wave age dependence and s i n should account for atmospheric stability effects including humidity ecmwf 2013 table 1 summarizes the different model solutions based on the forcing which are 1 a control ctl without wec 2 spectral peak monochromatic wec wecm corresponding to ums10 3 broadband wec forcing within the framework here described wecb and 4 wecb with near surface vertical mixing due to breaking enabled wcbk 3 results the results are divided into two subsections 1 analysis of the wave approximations and parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking and 2 analysis of roms wec solutions compared to a control without wave forcing 3 1 stokes drift we begin this subsection by comparing the stokes drift approximation against broadband computations using the resolved directional spectrum from the ww3 regional configuration in california for the sake of comparison we also analyze the stokes drift obtained with the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 examples during a strong wind wave event in deep 550 m and shallower water depth 20 m are shown in fig 3 left and right panels respectively the resolved directional spectra left sub panels are compared against the spectral reconstruction according to kumar et al 2017 right sub panels referred to as pww3 following their labeling the directional spectrum reconstruction pww3 is narrower than the resolved spectrum the corresponding azimuth integrated spectra ψ f ψ f θ d θ are shown in figs 3c d the resolved 1d spectrum in pink shows a tail of approximately f 5 within the level observed by romero and melville 2010 and lenain and melville 2017 in contrast the reconstructed spectrum pww3 decays much faster with increasing frequency particularly for the shallower case the resulting vertical stokes drift profiles in 3e f show the spectral reconstruction is missing a significant fraction of the stokes drift near the surface for the shallower water case panel f because of the lower energy levels of the spectrum at higher frequencies the stokes drift approximation from this study u s a is shown in purple accurately matching the broadband computations in deep water e with small but noticeable errors for the shallower water case f as described in section 2 1 the approximation u s a is composed of two parts 1 u s e which is based on a vertical scale constrained by the known surface stokes drift and stokes transport and 2 u s p calculated using the peak wavenumber significant wave height and mean wave direction the two components u s e and u s p are smoothly combined with a ramp function yielding u s a both u s e and u s p are shown in fig 3e f with dashed red and blue lines respectively the component u s e matches the pink curve at the surface by design but decays much faster with depth for z 10 m in contrast the monochromatic approximation u s p based on the spectral peak information better matches the pink line at depth strongly underestimating the stokes drift near the surface the resulting blended approximation u s a giving more weight to u s e near the surface and u s p at depth does a good job matching the profiles computed from directional wave spectra ww3 examples of complex spectra during mixed wind sea and swell with strong misalignment are shown in fig 4 in deep 472 m left panels and shallower water depth 22 m right panels the two spectral peaks can be clearly seen in the directional spectra a b from both ww3 and the spectral reconstruction pww3 with an angle separation of 90 degrees or more the directional spreading of the swell band is larger in reconstruction compared to that of the resolved spectra the corresponding 1d spectra clearly show the two peaks of the wind sea and the swell with the latter containing most of the energy for this case of weak wind forcing the ww3 spectra pink show a tail consistent with the equilibrium spectrum of f 4 by resio et al 2004 under weak wind forcing the spectrum would be expected to transition to a saturation regime of f 5 at higher frequencies not resolved by the model romero and melville 2010 lenain and melville 2017 romero 2019 the reconstructed spectrum blue decays much faster with increasing frequency in panel c underestimating the stokes drift near the surface e in contrast pww3 overestimates the surface stokes drift in f despite the fact that the tail of the spectrum is slightly lower than that of ww3 which is consistent with the narrower directional spreading of the wind sea webb and fox kemper 2015 the approximation u s a does a good job matching the broadband computations near the surface and at depth but with larger differences at intermediate depths 1 z 10 particularly in fig 4e thus far we have focused on the profiles of the stokes drift magnitude the direction of a stokes drift profile is constant with depth only when the directional wave spectrum is symmetric in azimuth and aligned in a particular direction across frequencies which is often not the case for realistic spectra due to misalignment of the longer dominant waves and the wind or mixed wind sea and swell sullivan et al 2012 lenain and melville 2014 large et al 2019 romero et al 2019 fig 5 shows the vertical profiles of the stokes drift direction θ s for the examples shown in figs 3 and 4 the ww3 stokes drift profiles pink of the large wave event figs 5a b show angle variations of about 10 to 15 degrees between the surface and z 20 m which correlate with the approximation u s a but with appreciable differences the direction of u s a smoothly connects the angles in depth of its constituents u s e and u p in contrast θ s for the spectral reconstruction is depth independent because the spectrum only has a single peak leading to larger directional errors near the surface for the case of mixed wind sea and swell the spectral reconstruction gives excellent agreement with the full broadband profile θ s z while that of the approximation u s a gives similar trends compared to ww3 but with finite errors the directional error of the approximation at depth is directly dependent on how well the longer waves are aligned with the spectrally weighted mean direction θ this can be improved for mixed wind sea swell conditions by using a mean wave direction weighted more strongly by the longer waves or alternatively by using the mean swell direction from the partition pww3 instead of θ as shown in figs 5 with dotted purple lines the stokes drift approximation was examined more thoroughly with the ww3 solutions from the two one month long periods in december 2006 and the spring 2007 rhm20 the available wave spectra from the seven locations were used for this analysis bulk comparisons of the stokes drift magnitude between the approximation u s a and the spectral reconstruction pww3 against the broadband computations are shown in figs 6a d respectively the data for all depths z max 30 h are included there is considerably more scatter in the spectral reconstruction compared to the approximation u s a the normalized root mean square error nrmse and the normalized bias nb defined as 56 nb x x x r e f x r e f and 57 nrmse x x x r e f 2 x r e f 2 1 2 where x is a given variable with known reference value x r e f ardhuin et al 2010 are indicated in each panel the stokes drift approximation gives a nrmse of 9 and no bias whereas for the spectral reconstruction nrmse 26 and nb 1 these comparisons are dominated by the stokes drift near the surface where the magnitude is largest the same comparisons for cases without background swell shown in figs 6g j give smaller errors by a 2 except for the bias of spectral reconstruction increasing in magnitude with nb 4 the vertical distribution of the absolute magnitude differences of the stokes drift approximation and the spectral reconstruction against pww3 against the spectral calculation are shown in figs 6b e respectively the stokes drift approximation shows the largest amplitude errors at about 2 m below the surface in contrast the spectral reconstruction gives the largest errors near the surface spanning a much wider range than that of the approximation which is consistent with the scatter shown in 6a d however the vertical profile of angle deviations from the spectral calculation are on average larger for the stokes drift approximation compared to the spectral reconstruction shown in figs 6c f the average rms angle deviations are 6 and 3 for u s a and pww3 respectively which are indicated with dashed lines fig 6e f excluding the cases with background swell the vertical errors of the stokes drift approximation are slightly reduced for the amplitude and significantly reduced for the direction without several outliers figs 6h i the vertical distribution of the stokes drift error for the spectral reconstruction without background swell fig 6k l is nearly unchanged for the magnitude and only slightly improved for the direction near the surface this analysis shows that neither method is perfect but the method here described captures most of the variability of the stokes drift the spectral reconstruction does best in terms of directionality at depth for mixed wind sea swell conditions near the surface where most of the stokes drift is contained the errors of the spectral reconstruction can be substantial in both magnitude and direction as shown earlier the directional error of stokes drift approximation in the presence of a background swell can be reduced by using the swell direction when available 3 2 set down bernoulli head and quasi static pressure the set down comparing the monochromatic and the spectral reconstruction estimates pww3 against direct computations from the resolved spectra are plotted in 7a d respectively both the nb and nrmse are about 40 for the monochromatic values and 20 for the spectral reconstruction our wec implementation with roms uses η ˆ from ww3 the ratio η ˆ m η ˆ is used for the computation of p a the set down for the data here analyzed is negligible except for the cases in relatively shallower water h 20 m the corresponding bernoulli head and pressure approximations evaluated offline against direct computations from resolved spectra are shown in figs 7b c there is a good correspondence between the two sets with nb of 13 and 4 and nrmse of 14 and 7 for k a and p a respectively the spectral reconstruction fig 7e f gives slightly smaller errors for the bernoulli head and much larger errors for the quasi static errors of about 50 for both nrmse and nb 3 3 vertical mixing due to non breaking unsteady waves we proceed to analyze the different approximations of the wave induced vertical diffusivity due to unsteady waves 26 fig 8a c shows a scatter plot comparing the approximations to the direct estimates of k v w from the directional spectrum the iterative method monochromatic based on mean wavelength l m and monochromatic based on the peak wavenumber are shown in panels a c respectively the iterative method gives the smallest errors with nrmse 9 and a small positive bias nb 5 both of which increase to nrmse 11 and nb 7 for the method based on l m the approximation in terms of k p gives the largest errors with nrmse nb 35 in practice the iterative method would require the depth integrated vertical parcel displacement r v w 2 eq 29 which is not a standard output parameter of ww3 however l m is an optional output parameter of ww3 and can be used to approximate k v w along with h s with relatively small errors alternatively h s and k p can be used to approximate k v w but with substantial errors the corresponding values calculated from the spectral reconstruction gives much larger errors fig 8d with nrms 59 and a positive normalized bias of 38 3 4 vertical mixing due to wave breaking here we demonstrate the parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking the non dimensional tke dissipation profile 45 is plotted on the figure of sm15 in fig 9a the sm15 data color coded by wave age includes near surface measurements obtained with an infrared stereo camera system our profile approximately matches the measurements at lower wave ages and does not account for the large dissipation values closest to the surface the large dissipation values are confined to a thin layer with a small contribution to the depth integrated dissipation fig 9b shows two examples of the vertical mixing with and without the contribution due to wave breaking the two cases shown are in deep water with conditions with wind speeds of 13 and 19 m s h s 8 5 and 4 5 m and e d s 1 9 and 0 55 w m 2 with the stronger forcing case corresponding the profile with larger vertical mixing the contribution of k b r closest to the surface 2 6 for times the magnitude of kpp for these examples as shown in the inset 3 5 wave effects on currents in this subsection one month long roms solutions for the regional configuration are analyzed in terms of the mean circulation eddy kinetic energy and current gradients the purpose of this analysis is to highlight some of the impacts of due to wec we compare different wec solutions against one another and the control without wec a detailed analysis of wec at submesoscales in the open ocean is described in hypolite et al 2021 the average circulation at 1 m below the surface for the month of december 2006 is shown in fig 10a b corresponding to the control ctl and broadband wec wecb solution respectively the corresponding monthly average stokes drift velocity at z 1 m is mapped in fig 10c reaching a magnitude of 5 cm s due to the southeast in the open ocean this is consistent with the predominant wind forcing from the northwest there is an obvious contrast for the surface stokes drift in the open ocean compared the southern california bight which is sheltered by the abrupt change of the coastline at point conception and the islands therefore wec is expected to be most significant outside the bight from increased exposure to wave forcing the monthly circulation of the control and the wec solution are very similar both in the open ocean and sheltered areas with a few noticeable differences fig 11a the largest differences are primarily due horizontal mismatch of the mesoscale mean circulation which can be seen in patterns with alternating sign surrounding the mesoscale flow north of point conception there is an increase of the mean circulation along the perimeter of the coast and a reduction of the mean current further offshore over areas exposed to the incoming wave energy the mean circulation from the other solutions wecm and wecbk are also very similar and therefore are not shown for reference the average spectral peak monochromatic stokes drift at z 1 m is shown in fig 10d being about half of the broadband mean in open ocean fig 10c the difference in mean current magnitude for wecm and wecbk relative to wecb are shown in fig 11c e again the differences primarily show structural differences around the mesoscale circulation the mean circulation for wecm is more similar to wecb compared to wecbk which shows largest differences the wecbk solution gives a reduction of the current amplitude over the santa barbara eddy i e the cyclonic circulation within the santa barbara channel suggesting that vertical shear is important for the eddy the eddy kinetic energy eke defined as eke 1 2 u 2 v 2 with u u u corresponding to the current anomaly and the brackets denoting the temporal monthly average is shown at 1 m below the surface for ctl and wecb in figs 12a b overall the large scale eke pattern is again very similar between the two runs with minor qualitative differences differences in eke between wecb and ctl in fig 11b are primarily due to the misalignment of the large scale circulation there is a coherent reduction in eke due to wec along the coast north of point conception in the santa maria basin the monochromatic wec forcing compared to wecb gives on average increased surface eke 11d in contrast the vertical diffusivity due to breaking on average reduces the near surface eke 11e this shows that wec forcing here considered has relatively small impacts on the mean circulation and the mesoscale current variability the ocean surface for the relatively short model integration of one month with tightly nudged boundaries toward the parent solution we further explore the impacts of wec on small scale current variability starting with monthly variances of the vorticity ζ v x u y and divergence δ u x v y also computed at 1 m below the surface for ctl and wecb figs 12c f the vorticity variance is larger than that of the divergence by about a factor of 2 for both wec and the control solution both the vorticity and divergence variances are enhanced in the open ocean by wec compared to the control the increase of the variances is most evident in the lower left area of the model configuration to better assess the wec impacts the variance fields were smoothed with a 20 km isotropic low pass filter and directly compared through the differences wec minus the control which are shown in figs 13a b corresponding to the vorticity and divergence fields respectively wec on average increases the vorticity and divergence variances particularly in the open ocean with increased exposure to wave forcing however these effects are partially reduced for the spectral peak monochromatic wec forcing 13c d or when the vertical mixing due to wave breaking is included 13e f in particular for the surface divergence the wec effects on the surface current variability are further analyzed with respect to the turbulent langmuir number l a t u w u s 0 which was introduced by mcwilliams et al 1997 to characterize langmuir turbulence of large eddy simulations les with u w corresponding to the water side friction velocity our roms solutions are hydrostatic and larger scale yet it is reasonable to expect that the impacts of wec can be characterized to some extent with l a t as a starting point we consider the time series of wind speed resolved surface stokes drift and l a t at harvest in the open ocean fig 14 the location of the harvest buoy is indicated with a white start in fig 10 there are three events with wind speeds exceeding 15 m s and resolved surface stokes drift exceeding 15 cm s with the largest wind wave event toward the end of the month l a t varies between 0 2 and 1 but generally asymptotes toward 0 3 which is representative of the langmuir turbulence regime mcwilliams et al 1997 the lowest values of l a t happen between storms when the wind speed is small and the stokes drift is relatively large during the three large wind events l a t approaches 0 3 but generally remains just above it taking the time series at harvest as representative of the synoptic wave forcing conditions we sorted the model data into two groups to compute ensemble statistics a strong wave forcing group with l a t 0 37 l a t 1 and a weak wave forcing group with l a t 0 37 l a t 2 the threshold of 0 37 is arbitrary but small changes to the threshold do not affect the results of the analysis the resulting maps for the average l a t are shown in fig 15a b in the open ocean l a t is about 0 33 and 0 43 for the strong l a t 1 and weak l a t 1 wave forcing cases respectively the corresponding filtered vorticity and divergence variance differences between wecb and non wec are shown in panels c d and e f respectively the vorticity and divergence variances due to wec are largest for the group with the lower l a t in the open ocean in contrast the impacts of wec on the vorticity and divergence variances within the southern california bight are generally small where l a t is large the relative variance differences between the two groups for wecb figs 15g h show no bias for the vorticity and a positive bias for the divergence with values of up to 120 corresponding to larger divergence variance for the group with larger wave forcing l a t 1 this shows that although the current gradient variability differences relative to the control are inversely related to l a t the current gradient variability for the wecb run at low l a t is increased only for the divergence offshore the work by hypolite et al 2021 investigates wec in the open ocean at submesoscales in more detail including higher horizontal resolution comparing conditions with remotely generated swell vs locally forced wind waves their analysis shows that wec impacts increase with increasing model resolution they also show that wec enhances the near surface velocity and density gradients but locally generated waves additionally result in a sink of surface buoyancy gradients from the onset of small scale structures with strong current gradients and vertical velocities 4 summary and discussion we presented a set of wave approximations and a parameterization of the vertical mixing due to wave breaking for coupled wave ocean models within the wave average framework by mcwilliams et al 2004 the proposed framework is well suited for coastal applications not limited to deep water or narrowband waves and is significantly more efficient and accurate to a certain extent than the spectral reconstruction approach proposed by kumar et al 2017 the approximations were demonstrated offline with solutions from ww3 for an idealized shoaling wave spectrum and validated with model data from a realistic regional model configuration in southern california the approximation of the stokes drift uses a two scale approach to handle misaligned winds and dominant waves and mixed wind sea and swell conditions the stokes drift approximation gives overall smaller errors in magnitude with nrmse 9 compared to the spectral reconstruction of kumar et al 2017 based on a jonswap spectrum with nrmse of 26 in terms of direction the proposed approximation gives smaller errors near the surface but larger errors at depth compared to the spectral reconstruction especially in conditions with mixed wind sea and swell the bernoulli head approximated monochromatically using the spectral peak information ums10 and the spectral reconstruction was shown to give errors of about 14 and 8 respectively the quasi static pressure based on a two scale approach resulted in nrmse of 7 and a bias of 4 whereas the spectral reconstruction gives much larger errors approaching 50 approximations of the wave induced vertical diffusivity due to the time rate of change of particle displacement square resulted in errors of 11 or smaller increasing to 35 for the monochromatic approximation based on the spectral peak information and larger errors 59 for the spectral reconstruction we implemented the wave approximations and vertical mixing parameterization due to breaking in roms building on the work by ums10 the wave parameters used for the conservative roms wec forcing files are a w peak wave period t p θ surface and depth average stokes drift vector and set down adding to a total 8 parameters which is exactly twice the number of parameters used by the original code of ums10 for non conservative wec forcing a similar number of parameters is needed for a spectral reconstruction and two spectral bands wind sea and swell a total of 8 parameters is relatively small compared to 500 or more for a full spectral coupling depending on the resolution of the directional spectrum of the wave model in terms of computation our wec implementation is slower than the original code of ums10 by about 20 this a relatively small additional cost when compared to the spectral reconstruction approach or a full 2d spectrum exchange from the wave model for which the wec terms have to be computed for all spectral components and added together effectively increasing the number of operations by a factor nf nd with nf and nd corresponding to the number of frequencies and directions used to discretize the wave spectrum in roms to compute the wec terms spectrally with a 15 degree resolution nd 24 and 20 frequencies the cost would increase by a factor of 500 which is prohibitive at the moment for realistic applications the new wec framework was tested with a regional configuration forced offline with ww3 a one month long solution in southern california with a horizontal resolution of 270 m was compared against a control solution without wave forcing wec impacts on the monthly average near surface circulation and eddy kinetic energy are small wec impacts are most significant at small scales increasing surface current gradient variability with larger impacts when the turbulent langmuir number is small the surface current gradient variability enhancement due to wec near the surface is partially reduced when the vertical mixing due breaking is included similarly wec impacts on surface current variability are larger for broadband wec forcing compared to the spectral peak monochromatic approach the proposed wave approximations improve upon the work by ums10 by accounting for finite spectral bandwidth not limited to only using the spectral peak information this allows for the modeling of wave effects on currents more realistically including conditions of mixed wind sea and swell the stokes drift approximation makes no assumption about the spectral shape unlike other studies that impose or assume a spectral shape e g 7 27 the proposed approximation is the only one to this day that is both performant and realistic for broadband spectra ultimately wec forcing ideally should be computed directly from the directional wave spectrum at the expense of significantly increasing the amount of information exchanged across models and computation but is not feasible for realistic configurations the current approach allows for the investigation of wave current interactions seamlessly across the open ocean continental shelf inner shelf and surf zone future applications include investigation of wec on material transport and dispersion e g 55 56
