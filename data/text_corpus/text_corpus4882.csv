24410,for centuries fishers have exploited the propensity for tuna to associate with floating objects yet the reasons and mechanisms behind this behavior remain unclear the number of man made floating objects fads fish aggregating devices undergone a dramatic increase in recent decades with the development of industrial tuna purse seine fishing however current knowledge does not allow for the evaluation of the consequences of this increase on the ecology of tuna here we developed a model of tuna movements in an array of fads using passive acoustic tagging data the model was built using four behavioral rules 1 when no fad is perceived tuna exhibit a random search behavior 2 individuals can orient directly to a fad when they perceive it within a given orientation radius 3 the associative dynamics of tuna follow a daily rhythm and 4 continuous residence time crts time spend at fad by tuna are independent from previous continuous absent time cats time between two consecutive crts the model is based on only four parameters swimming speed path sinuosity orientation distance and a loss term to account for natural and fishing mortality events the model was calibrated on 70 10 cm yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares acoustically tagged in two different networks of anchored fads oahu hawaii u s a and mauritius with different fad densities our results show that the model can reproduce the time tuna spent traveling between fads i e time away from the fads as well as the total time spent by the fish in the fad array total residence time at both study sites the parameter sets that best reproduce the experimental data correspond to a steering radius between 2 and 5 km a sinuosity correlated random walk parameter between 0 9 and 0 995 and mortality rates between 1 and 3 per day this model thus parameterized could be used in future studies to predict tuna movements in arrays of different fad densities and thus provide scientific advice for their management the same approach can be used for modeling the movements of marine and terrestrial animals detected near aggregation sites keywords correlated random walk tropical tuna spatial model fish aggregating device acoustic tagging survival curve tuna motion residency 1 introduction with more than 5 3 million tonnes caught in 2019 issf 2021 tropical tuna constitutes one of the major harvested fish species currently yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares bigeye tuna t obesus and skipjack katsuwonus pelamis represent almost 95 of the global tuna catches murua et al 2021 tropical tunas display an associative behavior with floating objects forming large multi specific aggregations around them the reasons why tuna associate with floating objects are still unknown two main hypotheses are widely accepted 1 the meeting point hypothesis dagorn and fréon 1999 fréon and dagorn 2000 and 2 the indicator log hypothesis hall 1992 the meeting point hypothesis posits that floating objects act as meeting points where tuna gather to form bigger schools the indicator log hypothesis posits that natural floating objects such as logs are more numerous in productive areas as they concentrate in river months estuaries and frontal structures following this hypothesis tuna could use floating objects as indicators of productive areas fishers have used this associative behavior to their advantage for centuries dempster and taquet 2004 and more recently have deployed human made floating objects called fish aggregating device fad to increase their catches in the open ocean drifting fads are primarily used by industrial purse seine fleets while in coastal areas anchored fads are used by artisanal and semi industrial fisheries dagorn et al 2013a dempster and taquet 2004 scott and lopez 2014 about 37 of the tropical tuna catches all fishing gears are made by purse seiners on drifting fads ranging between 32 to 51 depending of the ocean dagorn et al 2013b murua et al 2021 the number of fads has drastically increased in the three past decades with more than 100 000 fads deployed globally each year scott and lopez 2014 although precise numbers are difficult to obtain this increase raised concerns over possible impacts on tuna populations because fads increase the vulnerability of tunas to capture but also because increasing the number of floating objects dagorn et al 2013b could affect their ecology marsac et al 2000 were the first to suggest that fads could act as an ecological trap for tunas following the indicator log hypothesis fads could mislead tuna if they are deployed or drift into biologically poor areas and if tuna do not differentiate between natural and man made objects therefore tuna could remain associated with fads even if their surrounding environment is detrimental to their fitness marsac et al 2000 however current knowledge does not allow for the assessment of the effects of increasing fad densities on tuna ecology even when the environment other than floating objects remains constant acoustic telemetry has been widely used to monitor tuna movements and behavior within fad arrays with this technology acoustically tagged fish i e fish equipped by an acoustic tag can be either actively tracked or detected by a set of fixed acoustic receivers in the former case known as active tracking the recorded path of the receiver which is considered as a proxy of the animal path generally corresponds to short periods of time few days at most girard et al 2004 2007 in the latter case known as passive acoustic telemetry a time series of acoustic detections is recorded within the array of receivers dagorn et al 2007 tolotti et al 2020 the acoustic receivers are generally placed in proximity of aggregation attraction sites fads in this case where it is more likely to detect the tagged individuals passive acoustic telemetry has the advantage to cover longer period of time up to several months or even more than a year depending on the tag battery life and the fish residency within the array however the time series of acoustic detections recorded at aggregation sites cannot be easily translated into movement rules previous passive acoustic telemetry studies conducted in anchored fad arrays quantified the amount of time that tuna spend associated with these floating objects residence times as well as the time they spend traveling between two objects absence times dagorn et al 2007 govinden et al 2013 robert et al 2013 rodriguez tress et al 2017 these studies highlighted the variability of such durations according to both the size of the tagged individuals robert et al 2013 as well as the species rodriguez tress et al 2017 recently pérez et al 2020 compared the residence and absence times recorded for individual tuna tagged within different fad arrays demonstrating that tuna spend less time traveling between fads and more time in association as fad density increases passive and active acoustic telemetry studies have also shown a diel rhythm in the associative behavior of tunas with close association occurring mostly during the daytime while regular excursions away from the fad are undertaken at night dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 tolotti et al 2020 furthermore active tracking studies allowed the fine scale movements of tagged individuals in arrays of fads to be investigated using acoustic telemetry data from actively tracked yellowfin tuna in anchored fad arrays in the pacific and indian oceans girard et al 2004 found that tuna adopt a random search behavior until they perceive a fad then orient towards the device at distances ranging between 4 and 17 km recently pérez et al 2020 used a simple random walk model to assess whether the observed trends in behavioural indices obtained from passive acoustic tagging data across increasing fad densities could result from the random search component in tuna behavior suggested in previous experiments girard et al 2004 while this simple model was able to explain the observed trends of shorter absence times for increasing fad densities it could not quantitatively predict their durations since it did not account for the oriented movements girard et al 2004 or for the diel pattern in tuna behavior forget et al 2015 marsac and cayré 1998 correlated random walk crw models are frequently used to reconstruct animal paths from active tracking data e g cramer et al 2021 girard et al 2004 mcclintock et al 2012 patterson et al 2009 as well as to simulate their movements byers 2001 carita et al 2012 ahearn et al 2017 cramer et al 2021 these models are used because unlike a simple random walk they account for the tendency of animals to go forward a crw model is thus a better choice than a simple random walk for animals with bilateral symmetry such as tuna on the other hand despite the large availability of passive acoustic telemetry data for tuna and their large temporal coverage this data has not been used so far to construct this type of models due to the discrete nature of the data acoustic detections recorded both in time and space the aim of this study was to develop a data based model of tuna movements in an array of fads which can reproduce the motion of tuna from one fad association to another detected through passive acoustic telemetry such model constitutes the first step to predict the effects of increasing fad numbers on tuna behavior and ecology the model was calibrated using passive acoustic telemetry data collected at two study sites mauritius see rodriguez tress et al 2017 and oahu hawaii u s a see dagorn et al 2007 robert et al 2013 with different fad densities pérez et al 2020 2 materials methods 2 1 field data passive acoustic telemetry data were used to characterize tuna movements in fad arrays this technology is based on the transmission of an acoustic signal between an acoustic transmitter or tag implanted in a tuna and acoustic receivers or hydrophones installed at specific study sites the identification of the tagged fish is possible when the fish is located close to the receivers within a given detection range passive acoustic tagging data were collected in two anchored fad arrays one around the island of mauritius rodriguez tress et al 2017 in the western indian ocean and the other around the island of oahu robert et al 2013 within the hawaiian archipelago in the central pacific ocean fig 1 these anchored fad arrays differ in their inter fad distances with the mauritian array having shorter nearest and next nearest neighboring distances than the hawaiian array pérez et al 2020 the mauritian array consisted of 9 fads with 7 equipped with acoustic receivers and the hawaiian array comprised 13 fads all of which were equipped with acoustic receivers see dagorn et al 2007 rodriguez tress et al 2017 for specifications of acoustic receivers in both arrays fads were moored in depths of between 1000 and 2500 m the design of fads was similar within the same array but differed slightly between arrays since previous studies outlined species and size dependent variability in the associative behavior of tuna at fads pérez et al 2020 robert et al 2013 rodriguez tress et al 2017 this study focused on a single species yellowfin tuna and size of 70 cm fork length fork length range 60 80 cm named yft 70 which was common to both study sites for the mauritian array due to the short duration of the experiment rodriguez tress et al 2017 the data recorded during the first 38 days was considered resulting in the smallest observation time for the hawaiian array where the experiment lasted more than one year only the initial 120 days after tagging were considered because 95 of the time between the first and the last detection at a fad lasted less than 120 days robert et al 2013 as a result the field data consisted of 14 yft 70 tagged in the mauritian array and 56 yft 70 individuals in the hawaiian array table 1 details on the tagging procedures can be found in rodriguez tress et al 2017 for the mauritian array and in robert et al 2013 for the hawaiian array 2 2 residence and absence times in the fad array acoustic telemetry data were processed to obtain information on durations of presence at and absence from instrumented fads displayed by tagged tuna following the procedure described in capello et al 2015 this procedure translates the discrete time series of acoustic detections into continuous bouts of time it relies on the definition of a maximum blanking period mbp i e a maximum temporal separation between two subsequent acoustic detections at the same fad or receiver where fish is still considered to be associated the definition of a mbp not only allows to account for small data gaps related to detection issues and sonic collisions forget et al 2015 but also for fish excursions out of the detection range of the receiver in the case of tropical tuna a mbp value of 24 h was chosen in order to account for the regular diel excursions that tuna perform out of the fad at nighttime dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 following this procedure the continuous residence times crts capello et al 2015 dagorn et al 2007 ohta and kakuma 2005 corresponded to continuous bouts of time spent at the same fad without any day scale absence 24 h conversely the time spent away from fads were defined as continuous absence times cat capello et al 2015 govinden et al 2013 absence times related to movements between two different fads were referred to as catdiff pérez et al 2020 finally for each individual the sum of all recorded crts and cats corresponded to the total residence time trt namely the time between the first and the last detection recorded in the fad array fig 2 2 3 model the model was built upon four behavioral rules based on the current knowledge of the associative behavior of tuna at fads fig 3 1 tuna display a random search behavior between two fad associations girard et al 2004 pérez et al 2020 2 at a certain distance from fads tuna show oriented movements towards fads girard et al 2004 3 the tuna association dynamics follows a diel rhythm dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 govinden et al 2021 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 tolotti et al 2020 and 4 crts were independent from previous cats robert et al 2013 as tuna like most animals have a tendency to move forward the random search movements were simulated using a correlated random walk model ahearn et al 2017 carita et al 2000 codling et al 2008 kareiva and shigesada 1983 these models are based on a markov process where consecutive changes in the animal s consecutive direction are correlated for each time step δt the position of an individual at time t depends on its previous position at time t δt and the turning angle α defining the change in direction relative to the previous time step turning angles were randomly sampled from a normal distribution defined in the range π π with zero mean and standard deviation σ following the method of bovet benhamou 1988 using the scipy stats truncnorm python function standard deviation σ 0 correspond to straight trajectories whereas in the limit σ the model converges to a simple random walk in the following σ was expressed in terms of the coefficient of sinuosity c according to the relationship σ 2ln c with c є 0 1 benhamou 2004 bovet and benhamou 1988 the limit c 0 corresponds to a simple random walk highest sinuosity whereas increasing c decreases the sinuosity with straight trajectories for c 1 a total of 9 coefficients of sinuosity were tested ranging between 0 2 and 0 9999 table 2 fig 4 illustrates the distribution of turning angles and an example of a tuna trajectory for each coefficient of sinuosity tested in order to account for the orientation behavior of tuna towards fads different values of the orientation radius were tested fig 4 table 2 and supplementary information 1 each time a tuna enters within this radius its path changes to a straight trajectory oriented towards the fad location if the tuna was located within the orientation radius of multiple fads a fad was randomly selected between them using a uniform distribution a total of six orientation radii were tested ranging between 0 no orientation to 20 km see table 2 the diel rhythm in the associative behavior of tunas was accounted for by defining two behavioral modes daytime and nighttime with a periodicity of 24 h each during the 12 h of daytime tuna displayed an orientation behavior towards fads if located within the orientation radius conversely during the 12 h of nighttime tuna did not exhibit a long range attraction to fads no oriented behavior within the orientation radius and therefore followed a simple crw dynamic in both daytime and nighttime behavioral modes a tuna was however considered to be associated with a fad when it was located within 500 m of it this value is in accordance with both the observations of tuna when they were associated with fads see josse et al 2000 moreno et al 2007 and the detection range of acoustic tags used in telemetry studies around instrumented fads see forget et al 2015 the model did not represent the association time of tuna at fads crt but these durations were needed to compare the model with the field data therefore the crts recorded from field data were used as a model input each time a tuna reaches a fad i e it was located within 500 m of it a crt value was randomly sampled from the actual crt data of the corresponding array and the simulated individuals do not move away from the fad during the entire duration of the crt the crts recorded from field data in each array are shown in the supplementary information 2 once this time has elapsed individuals could leave the fad in a random direction sampled from a uniform distribution between π π to avoid immediate returns during the 24 h following the end of a crt fish was not affected by the association radius ro of the fad of departure similarly returns due to tuna re entering the detection range within 24 h which were already taken into account in the crt duration were neglected for this purpose each time a catreturn of less than 24 h was recorded after a crt this movement was discarded and the simulation time was reset to the end of the last crt recorded fig 3 this procedure ensured that crt durations were consistent with field data since the crts recorded immediately after tagging were significantly longer than the other crts in the hawaii field experiments and slightly longer in the mauritius field data see supplementary information 2 they were not considered in the above procedure accordingly the first crt were also subtracted from the trt to ensure data consistency finally a mortality rate m was considered to account for natural and fishing mortality events that may cause the interruption of the acoustic detections for some tagged individuals for this purpose a monte carlo algorithm was applied where for each individual and at each time step a random number ε was sampled from a uniform distribution in the interval 0 1 and compared with the corresponding mortality rate using a bernoulli test a death was accepted for ε m t the constant t depends on the time step δt and on the temporal units of the mortality rate different mortality rates were tested ranging between 0 and 5 per day table 2 for a mortality rate expressed in days 1 and δt in seconds t δt 3600 24 the upper bound of 5 per day was estimated from survival analyses of field data see supplementary information 3 trts values therefore depended on both the crw dynamics which affects the number of tuna associations thus the time at which the last fad detections occur and the mortality rates fig 2 the model was run in a continuous unbounded space centered around the actual fad arrays of mauritius and hawaii the topography of each island was considered using data from the r package rworldmap south 2011 each time simulated individuals were at risk of crossing island boundaries the distribution of turning angles α was sub sampled in order to avoid the island a total of 1000 individuals were considered in each fad array for each combination of model parameters for each individual the simulations started at one of the fads of tagging in order to reproduce the experimental design as accurately as possible the probability to start at a given fad was obtained considering the number of tuna tagged at the fad relative to the total number of tuna tagged in the field experiment see supplementary information 4 two different swimming speeds were tested 0 7 and 1 4 m s corresponding to one and two body lengths per second respectively see swimming speeds in girard et al 2004 and tagging studies used in this study robert et al 2013 and rodriguez tress et al 2017 time steps δt lasted 100 s and each resulted in individual fish movements of 70 and 140 m depending on the speed a summary of all model parameters can be found in table 2 all the simulations were performed using the python 3 programming language python software foundation version 3 8 5 2 4 comparison between simulated and field data since the model aimed at fitting the time that tuna spent between two fad associations catdiff the comparison between the model and the field data focused on this metric however the distribution of catdiff also depends on the total time spent in the fad array i e longer catdiff can only be observed for longer trt as such the comparison between the model and the field data was performed for both metrics for this purpose catdiff and trt were obtained from the simulated data using the same procedures applied to the field data the selection of model parameters which best fitted the field data was made using a survival analysis by comparing the theoretical survival curves of the trt and the catdiff with those obtained from field data through a bootstrap method experimental survival curves s t were constructed capello et al 2015 which represented the proportion of events trt or catdiff longer than a given duration t for each set of parameters the survival curve of the field data was compared 1000 times with a sub sample of the same size as the field data i e 56 individuals for hawaii and 14 for mauritius table 1 randomly sampled from the 1000 simulated individuals for each of the bootstrap sample survival curves obtained from the simulated and field data were compared using cox proportional hazards regressions the statistical significance of the model was assessed using the p value from a logrank test which tested the null hypothesis of identical hazards between the model and the field data for each survival curve trt and catdiff and fad array mauritius and hawaii the percentage of retained bootstrap tests was calculated corresponding to the number of bootstrap tests showing p values 0 05 over the 1000 tests performed finally each set of parameters was assigned the lower percentage of retained bootstraps estimated over survival curves trt and catdiff and fad arrays hawaii and mauritius the cox proportional hazards regressions and logrank tests were performed using the r software r core team 2018 version 3 4 4 with the function coxph in the survival package version 3 1 8 therneau and grambsch 2000 3 results a total of 648 sets of parameters were tested table 2 of which 7 appeared to best fit both the catdiff and trt recorded in the mauritian and hawaiian arrays considering a percentage of retained bootstrap tests 85 table 3 and supplementary information 5 that is over the 1000 tests performed for each set of parameters 7 sets were not statistically different from the field data in more than 85 of the tests performed on both survival curves trt and catdiff and fad arrays mauritius and hawaii fig 5 and fig 6 present the catdiff and trt survival curves for each fad array for the two sets of parameters performing the best the complete results of the bootstrap test are available in supplementary information 6 any speed values between the tested ones 0 7 and 1 4 m s will reflected the field behavior fig 7 and supplementary information 7 in the same way all values of the mortality rate can be retained however null mortalities m 0 showed poorer bootstrap results higher percentage of retained bootraps of 62 2 see fig 7 supplementary information 6 and 7 similarly mortality rates of 5 and 1 did not appear among the 7 best fits table 3 however combinations of parameters exist with high percentages of retained bootstraps 83 5 for m 5 day and 80 1 for m 1 day see fig 7 supplementary information 6 and 7 on the opposite orientation radii of 2 and 5 km clearly stand out fig 7 and supplementary information 7 all the other values having a percentage of retained bootstraps below 55 fig 7 supplementary information 6 and even below 20 for orientation radii of 15 and 20 km fig 7 supplementary information 6 finally the coefficients of sinuosity c performing the best range from 0 9 to 0 995 all with a percentage of retained bootstraps above 80 fig 7 supplementary information 6 and 7 coefficients of c 0 2 0 999 and 0 9999 showed poorer results percentage of retained bootstraps respectively 37 2 51 3 and 7 see fig 7 supplementary information 6 and 7 4 discussion the study of animal behavior made considerable progress in the last decades thanks to the development of electronic tagging and camera trapping technologies hughey et al 2018 swann and perkins 2014 however characterizing the movement of animals in their own environment still remains a challenging task particularly in marine environments where gps technologies can rarely be used here through the use a field based modeling approach and passive acoustic telemetry data we provide for the first time a method for describing the movement behavior of tunas in fad arrays the model is built upon four main behavioral components based on the state of the art knowledge of the associative dynamics of tunas at fads random walk dynamics orientation capabilities diel behavior and a lack in correlation between the duration of consecutive crts and cats a relatively small number of parameters drive the model s properties swimming speed path sinuosity orientation radius and mortality rate despite the model s structural simplicity and the reduced number of parameters it was able to reproduce both of the investigated movement metrics time between two fad associations and total time spent in the array in two different fad arrays the four parameters tested can be related to the physiological capabilities and condition of tuna as well as their environment including the fads other tuna and non tuna species present in the array the two swimming speeds tested corresponding to the 0 7 and 1 4 m s stem from previous studies showing that swimming speed typically range between 1 and 2 body lengths per second dagorn et al 2013b girard et al 2004 in contrast despite previous evidences of a random walk behavior in tuna movements between fads girard et al 2004 pérez et al 2020 no empirical studies have estimated the sinuosity of a tuna path in a fad array as a consequence large ranges of sinuosity were considered the results show that while both speed values could be retained by the simulations only a limited subset of sinuosity coefficients emerged the majority of sinuosity coefficients that were retained indicated a rather skewed distribution of turning angles fig 3 table 3 lower sinuosity coefficients were mostly found for the highest swimming speed table 3 this is to be expected considering that for a given average distance traveled during a correlated random walk higher speeds imply lower sinuosity coefficients and vice versa hall 1977 kareiva and shigesada 1983 marsh and jones 1988 hence the values of the sinuosity coefficient c retained are valid considering the chosen time step δt 100 s it is likely that the tuna movement characteristics speed and sinuosity also depend on the fine scale environmental characteristics within the fad array such as the type and distribution of prey or the physiological conditions of the tuna itself in future the consideration of a range of swimming speeds and path sinuosity as opposed to single values could provide a more realistic picture of tuna movements however the range of values used in this study provides an initial set of movement characteristics that are compatible with field observations thus contributing to the poorly understood dynamics of tuna in a fad array the mortality rate which accounts for both natural and fishing mortality is primarily influenced by risks associated with fishing activity natural predation and disease a previous study using conventional tags from the hawaii tuna tagging project http showed a natural mortality rate of 0 36 per day and a fishing mortality of 0 67 per day for yellowfin tuna larger than 56 cm adam et al 2003 as such the global mortality rates estimated through our simulations appear to be higher than previous findings this difference could be due to a specific mortality in each study site and period considered indeed even if in both cases the hawaiian archipelago was considered these studies concern different islands and study periods for which the fishing pressure might differ as well as the natural mortality acoustic telemetry data do not allow for the direct estimation of mortality rate but do provide information on the time at which an individual is no longer detected by receivers deployed on fads generally a lack of acoustic detections indicates that tuna have either left the fad array or died movement dynamics of tuna can explain the first potential causes for a lack of detection within the model the propensity of an individual to depart from the array is directly linked to the sinuosity of its path its swimming speed and its orientation radius for instance large path sinuosity resulting from small values of the sinuosity coefficient c primarily leads to movements close to the fad of departure and little or no detections at the other fads conversely small path sinuosity form high values of the coefficient of sinuosity c generally results in individuals rapidly leaving the array fig 3 and supplementary information 1 in this way the model provides direct information on the rate at which tuna are lost from fad arrays fitting the model to the field data allows for differentiation between loss through randomness of movement and loss due to mortality table 2 and supplementary information 3 as such this field based movement model could provide a new and alternative methodology for estimating the mortality rates of tuna in a fad array in the model the orientation radius represents the distance from which tunas are able to orient themselves towards fads them while on the field tuna could be able to perceive fads before orienting themselves toward them no data is available on the distance at which tunas perceive fads but tuna movements provide input on the distance at which tunas start to orient themselves toward fads therefore the fad perception radius was not considered in this study this distance naturally depends on the tuna s ability to perceive its surrounding environment as well as on the physical characteristics of the area given the large distances from which tuna can orient themselves towards fads highlighted in previous studies girard et al 2004 as well as those found in this study the use of visual cues as explanatory factors can be discarded as sound can travel great distances underwater the perception of acoustic stimuli could be a valid hypothesis for explaining the ability of tunas to orient towards fads from such large distances environmental characteristics may impact the propagation of sounds between fads and tunas and influence how strong these sound stimuli are the physical characteristics of the water mass are known to affect the propagation of sound waves lee et al 2017 siddiqui and dong 2019 furthermore the topology of the fad array and its location relative to the coastline could also affect underwater sound propagation as sounds may be produced by the fad structures themselves they can vary depending on the materials used and the design of each structure which often differ among fad arrays although fad design has not been identified as influencing the attractiveness of fads fréon and dagorn 2000 it may impact their detectability tunas may also perceive the presence of a fad through the emission of noise generated by the fish aggregation itself in such a situation the intensity of the noise could be dependent on the quantity of fish present but also on the types of species and their activities considering these multiple potential sources of environmental variability the distance at which tuna are able to perceive fads orientation radius is likely to vary both within and between fad arrays no single value of the orientation radius can exist but rather a distribution of these distances with a subset of values for which the probability of being located in the environment is greatest a general model that describes the movements of tuna in different fad arrays with the same parameters such as the one developed in this study provides a subset of the most probable orientation distances however it is likely that a distribution of orientation distances could be more realistic and for a particular fad the orientation radius could have its own dynamics according to local environmental conditions a previous study by girard et al 2004 determined orientation radii between 4 and 17 km with a mode around 10 km this study was based on 14 yellowfin tuna yft from 47 cm to 167 cm fl that were acoustically tracked in different fad arrays brill et al 1999 dagorn et al 2000 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 and included the specie size category considered in our simulations yft of 70 cm these 14 individuals were actively tracked over short durations between 12 and 86 h due to the constraints of active tracking rather than passively monitored as in our study the radii found in our 7 sets of parameters 5 km and 2 km in one set are similar to the lower range of the orientation distances 4 17 km found by girard et al 2004 the longer orientation distances identified in that study could be attributed to the inclusion of only long paths more than 7 km away from the fads in their analysis furthermore the authors considered that the longest orientation distances e g 15 km could be the result of tuna patrolling along the coast thus using some bathymetric information rather than signals from fads as such the distances found by girard et al 2004 may represent maximum orientation distances while the average could be shorter and more similar to the values we found 2 5 km finally it is important to note that the two studies considered different datasets collected in different regions and possible inter fad array variability in the orientation radius cannot be excluded it is important to stress that the retention of the model parameters was very conservative only those valid for both metrics trt and catdiff and fad arrays were kept in doing so possible local variability in tuna behavior for example a different orientation radius depending on the study site were excluded this choice was made to obtaining the minimal and most general model that could reproduce the observations considering a threshold of 85 for the percentage of retained bootstraps provides 7 sets of parameter values over the 648 tested these values radius of orientation ranging between 2 and 5 km coefficient of sinuosity between 0 9 and 0 995 mortality rates between 2 and 3 provide the main characteristics of tuna movements in fad arrays to avoid any scaling issue the same data treatment was applied to both field and simulated data sets therefore the model can be considered to correctly reproduce the tuna movements between fads at the dayscale i e the scale related to a maximum blanking period of 24 h capello et al 2015 which was used to process the acoustic data further studies across a greater number of study sites could provide insight into how these model parameters could vary between fad arrays similarly it would be of interest to consider how this model fitted for yft 70 is able to describe the behavior of other tuna species and sizes this model could also be used for other non tuna species that associate with fads and in particular vulnerable species such as the silky sharks carcharhinus falciformis as this model aimed to simulate tuna movements in fad arrays the time tuna spent associated with fads crt was not simulated and the experimental crt distribution was used as an input of the model further model developments which consider social interactions at fads pérez et al 2020 robert et al 2014 may allow the crt durations within different fad arrays to also be integrated into the model this integration of crts into the model would involve adding social interactions between individuals and behavioral rules of social retention at the fad that follow the meeting point hypothesis dagorn and fréon 1999 fréon and dagorn 2000 robert et al 2014 5 conclusion building on current knowledge of the associative behavior tuna at fads from acoustic telemetry data our model is the first to reproduce the movement behavior of tunas in a fad array a total of 7 sets of parameters table 3 were able to reproduce with a high confidence the movements of yellowfin tuna fork length 70 cm in two different fad arrays suggesting the model is robust future model improvements could consider distributions of speeds sinuosity detection radii and mortality rates rather than fixed values which may provide a better reflection of the variability induced by the local environment and the physiological conditions of the tuna themselves this model can be used on all species that display associative behavior with floating object this includes species such as dolphinfish coryphaena hippurus or the vulnerable silky shark carcharhinus falciformis when combined with acoustic telemetry data the model can provide an alternative method for determining the mortality rate of tuna and other associated species in a fad array given the difficulty in assessing natural and fishing mortality for wild marine species this novel approach could be of interest for the stock assessment community moreover the model could be used to predict how increasing numbers of fads affect the ecology of tunas ecology both in terms of the time spent away from fads and the total time spent in a fad array this study offers a new tool to provide science based advice for the management of fad fisheries since the more time fish spend associated the more vulnerable these individuals are to the fishery scenarios could be extended to drifting fads in open ocean areas as both anchored and drifting fads alter the environment in a similar way dagorn et al 2010 while acoustic telemetry experiments have successfully characterized residence times at drifting fads forget et al 2015 govinden et al 2010 measuring in situ absence times of tunas within drifting fad arrays is a major research challenge and these parameters are key for the development of robust fad management plans by tuna regional fisheries management organisations rfmos our model provides a method for estimate these parameters in the absence of data from acoustically tagged tuna in drifting fad arrays finally the same approach can be used to study the movement behavior of other marine and terrestrial species that manifest an associative behavior with aggregating sites and for which presence absence data are recorded at these sites for instance our model could be used to study the movements of terrestrial animals who show associative behaviors with waterholes o farrill et al 2014 zvidzai et al 2013 detected through camera traps hughey et al 2018 swann and perkins 2014 more generally this method could be used even without any associative behavior at specific sites as long as the study site is equipped with regularly spaced and sufficiently numerous receivers where

24410,for centuries fishers have exploited the propensity for tuna to associate with floating objects yet the reasons and mechanisms behind this behavior remain unclear the number of man made floating objects fads fish aggregating devices undergone a dramatic increase in recent decades with the development of industrial tuna purse seine fishing however current knowledge does not allow for the evaluation of the consequences of this increase on the ecology of tuna here we developed a model of tuna movements in an array of fads using passive acoustic tagging data the model was built using four behavioral rules 1 when no fad is perceived tuna exhibit a random search behavior 2 individuals can orient directly to a fad when they perceive it within a given orientation radius 3 the associative dynamics of tuna follow a daily rhythm and 4 continuous residence time crts time spend at fad by tuna are independent from previous continuous absent time cats time between two consecutive crts the model is based on only four parameters swimming speed path sinuosity orientation distance and a loss term to account for natural and fishing mortality events the model was calibrated on 70 10 cm yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares acoustically tagged in two different networks of anchored fads oahu hawaii u s a and mauritius with different fad densities our results show that the model can reproduce the time tuna spent traveling between fads i e time away from the fads as well as the total time spent by the fish in the fad array total residence time at both study sites the parameter sets that best reproduce the experimental data correspond to a steering radius between 2 and 5 km a sinuosity correlated random walk parameter between 0 9 and 0 995 and mortality rates between 1 and 3 per day this model thus parameterized could be used in future studies to predict tuna movements in arrays of different fad densities and thus provide scientific advice for their management the same approach can be used for modeling the movements of marine and terrestrial animals detected near aggregation sites keywords correlated random walk tropical tuna spatial model fish aggregating device acoustic tagging survival curve tuna motion residency 1 introduction with more than 5 3 million tonnes caught in 2019 issf 2021 tropical tuna constitutes one of the major harvested fish species currently yellowfin tuna thunnus albacares bigeye tuna t obesus and skipjack katsuwonus pelamis represent almost 95 of the global tuna catches murua et al 2021 tropical tunas display an associative behavior with floating objects forming large multi specific aggregations around them the reasons why tuna associate with floating objects are still unknown two main hypotheses are widely accepted 1 the meeting point hypothesis dagorn and fréon 1999 fréon and dagorn 2000 and 2 the indicator log hypothesis hall 1992 the meeting point hypothesis posits that floating objects act as meeting points where tuna gather to form bigger schools the indicator log hypothesis posits that natural floating objects such as logs are more numerous in productive areas as they concentrate in river months estuaries and frontal structures following this hypothesis tuna could use floating objects as indicators of productive areas fishers have used this associative behavior to their advantage for centuries dempster and taquet 2004 and more recently have deployed human made floating objects called fish aggregating device fad to increase their catches in the open ocean drifting fads are primarily used by industrial purse seine fleets while in coastal areas anchored fads are used by artisanal and semi industrial fisheries dagorn et al 2013a dempster and taquet 2004 scott and lopez 2014 about 37 of the tropical tuna catches all fishing gears are made by purse seiners on drifting fads ranging between 32 to 51 depending of the ocean dagorn et al 2013b murua et al 2021 the number of fads has drastically increased in the three past decades with more than 100 000 fads deployed globally each year scott and lopez 2014 although precise numbers are difficult to obtain this increase raised concerns over possible impacts on tuna populations because fads increase the vulnerability of tunas to capture but also because increasing the number of floating objects dagorn et al 2013b could affect their ecology marsac et al 2000 were the first to suggest that fads could act as an ecological trap for tunas following the indicator log hypothesis fads could mislead tuna if they are deployed or drift into biologically poor areas and if tuna do not differentiate between natural and man made objects therefore tuna could remain associated with fads even if their surrounding environment is detrimental to their fitness marsac et al 2000 however current knowledge does not allow for the assessment of the effects of increasing fad densities on tuna ecology even when the environment other than floating objects remains constant acoustic telemetry has been widely used to monitor tuna movements and behavior within fad arrays with this technology acoustically tagged fish i e fish equipped by an acoustic tag can be either actively tracked or detected by a set of fixed acoustic receivers in the former case known as active tracking the recorded path of the receiver which is considered as a proxy of the animal path generally corresponds to short periods of time few days at most girard et al 2004 2007 in the latter case known as passive acoustic telemetry a time series of acoustic detections is recorded within the array of receivers dagorn et al 2007 tolotti et al 2020 the acoustic receivers are generally placed in proximity of aggregation attraction sites fads in this case where it is more likely to detect the tagged individuals passive acoustic telemetry has the advantage to cover longer period of time up to several months or even more than a year depending on the tag battery life and the fish residency within the array however the time series of acoustic detections recorded at aggregation sites cannot be easily translated into movement rules previous passive acoustic telemetry studies conducted in anchored fad arrays quantified the amount of time that tuna spend associated with these floating objects residence times as well as the time they spend traveling between two objects absence times dagorn et al 2007 govinden et al 2013 robert et al 2013 rodriguez tress et al 2017 these studies highlighted the variability of such durations according to both the size of the tagged individuals robert et al 2013 as well as the species rodriguez tress et al 2017 recently pérez et al 2020 compared the residence and absence times recorded for individual tuna tagged within different fad arrays demonstrating that tuna spend less time traveling between fads and more time in association as fad density increases passive and active acoustic telemetry studies have also shown a diel rhythm in the associative behavior of tunas with close association occurring mostly during the daytime while regular excursions away from the fad are undertaken at night dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 tolotti et al 2020 furthermore active tracking studies allowed the fine scale movements of tagged individuals in arrays of fads to be investigated using acoustic telemetry data from actively tracked yellowfin tuna in anchored fad arrays in the pacific and indian oceans girard et al 2004 found that tuna adopt a random search behavior until they perceive a fad then orient towards the device at distances ranging between 4 and 17 km recently pérez et al 2020 used a simple random walk model to assess whether the observed trends in behavioural indices obtained from passive acoustic tagging data across increasing fad densities could result from the random search component in tuna behavior suggested in previous experiments girard et al 2004 while this simple model was able to explain the observed trends of shorter absence times for increasing fad densities it could not quantitatively predict their durations since it did not account for the oriented movements girard et al 2004 or for the diel pattern in tuna behavior forget et al 2015 marsac and cayré 1998 correlated random walk crw models are frequently used to reconstruct animal paths from active tracking data e g cramer et al 2021 girard et al 2004 mcclintock et al 2012 patterson et al 2009 as well as to simulate their movements byers 2001 carita et al 2012 ahearn et al 2017 cramer et al 2021 these models are used because unlike a simple random walk they account for the tendency of animals to go forward a crw model is thus a better choice than a simple random walk for animals with bilateral symmetry such as tuna on the other hand despite the large availability of passive acoustic telemetry data for tuna and their large temporal coverage this data has not been used so far to construct this type of models due to the discrete nature of the data acoustic detections recorded both in time and space the aim of this study was to develop a data based model of tuna movements in an array of fads which can reproduce the motion of tuna from one fad association to another detected through passive acoustic telemetry such model constitutes the first step to predict the effects of increasing fad numbers on tuna behavior and ecology the model was calibrated using passive acoustic telemetry data collected at two study sites mauritius see rodriguez tress et al 2017 and oahu hawaii u s a see dagorn et al 2007 robert et al 2013 with different fad densities pérez et al 2020 2 materials methods 2 1 field data passive acoustic telemetry data were used to characterize tuna movements in fad arrays this technology is based on the transmission of an acoustic signal between an acoustic transmitter or tag implanted in a tuna and acoustic receivers or hydrophones installed at specific study sites the identification of the tagged fish is possible when the fish is located close to the receivers within a given detection range passive acoustic tagging data were collected in two anchored fad arrays one around the island of mauritius rodriguez tress et al 2017 in the western indian ocean and the other around the island of oahu robert et al 2013 within the hawaiian archipelago in the central pacific ocean fig 1 these anchored fad arrays differ in their inter fad distances with the mauritian array having shorter nearest and next nearest neighboring distances than the hawaiian array pérez et al 2020 the mauritian array consisted of 9 fads with 7 equipped with acoustic receivers and the hawaiian array comprised 13 fads all of which were equipped with acoustic receivers see dagorn et al 2007 rodriguez tress et al 2017 for specifications of acoustic receivers in both arrays fads were moored in depths of between 1000 and 2500 m the design of fads was similar within the same array but differed slightly between arrays since previous studies outlined species and size dependent variability in the associative behavior of tuna at fads pérez et al 2020 robert et al 2013 rodriguez tress et al 2017 this study focused on a single species yellowfin tuna and size of 70 cm fork length fork length range 60 80 cm named yft 70 which was common to both study sites for the mauritian array due to the short duration of the experiment rodriguez tress et al 2017 the data recorded during the first 38 days was considered resulting in the smallest observation time for the hawaiian array where the experiment lasted more than one year only the initial 120 days after tagging were considered because 95 of the time between the first and the last detection at a fad lasted less than 120 days robert et al 2013 as a result the field data consisted of 14 yft 70 tagged in the mauritian array and 56 yft 70 individuals in the hawaiian array table 1 details on the tagging procedures can be found in rodriguez tress et al 2017 for the mauritian array and in robert et al 2013 for the hawaiian array 2 2 residence and absence times in the fad array acoustic telemetry data were processed to obtain information on durations of presence at and absence from instrumented fads displayed by tagged tuna following the procedure described in capello et al 2015 this procedure translates the discrete time series of acoustic detections into continuous bouts of time it relies on the definition of a maximum blanking period mbp i e a maximum temporal separation between two subsequent acoustic detections at the same fad or receiver where fish is still considered to be associated the definition of a mbp not only allows to account for small data gaps related to detection issues and sonic collisions forget et al 2015 but also for fish excursions out of the detection range of the receiver in the case of tropical tuna a mbp value of 24 h was chosen in order to account for the regular diel excursions that tuna perform out of the fad at nighttime dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 following this procedure the continuous residence times crts capello et al 2015 dagorn et al 2007 ohta and kakuma 2005 corresponded to continuous bouts of time spent at the same fad without any day scale absence 24 h conversely the time spent away from fads were defined as continuous absence times cat capello et al 2015 govinden et al 2013 absence times related to movements between two different fads were referred to as catdiff pérez et al 2020 finally for each individual the sum of all recorded crts and cats corresponded to the total residence time trt namely the time between the first and the last detection recorded in the fad array fig 2 2 3 model the model was built upon four behavioral rules based on the current knowledge of the associative behavior of tuna at fads fig 3 1 tuna display a random search behavior between two fad associations girard et al 2004 pérez et al 2020 2 at a certain distance from fads tuna show oriented movements towards fads girard et al 2004 3 the tuna association dynamics follows a diel rhythm dagorn et al 2000 forget et al 2015 govinden et al 2021 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 tolotti et al 2020 and 4 crts were independent from previous cats robert et al 2013 as tuna like most animals have a tendency to move forward the random search movements were simulated using a correlated random walk model ahearn et al 2017 carita et al 2000 codling et al 2008 kareiva and shigesada 1983 these models are based on a markov process where consecutive changes in the animal s consecutive direction are correlated for each time step δt the position of an individual at time t depends on its previous position at time t δt and the turning angle α defining the change in direction relative to the previous time step turning angles were randomly sampled from a normal distribution defined in the range π π with zero mean and standard deviation σ following the method of bovet benhamou 1988 using the scipy stats truncnorm python function standard deviation σ 0 correspond to straight trajectories whereas in the limit σ the model converges to a simple random walk in the following σ was expressed in terms of the coefficient of sinuosity c according to the relationship σ 2ln c with c є 0 1 benhamou 2004 bovet and benhamou 1988 the limit c 0 corresponds to a simple random walk highest sinuosity whereas increasing c decreases the sinuosity with straight trajectories for c 1 a total of 9 coefficients of sinuosity were tested ranging between 0 2 and 0 9999 table 2 fig 4 illustrates the distribution of turning angles and an example of a tuna trajectory for each coefficient of sinuosity tested in order to account for the orientation behavior of tuna towards fads different values of the orientation radius were tested fig 4 table 2 and supplementary information 1 each time a tuna enters within this radius its path changes to a straight trajectory oriented towards the fad location if the tuna was located within the orientation radius of multiple fads a fad was randomly selected between them using a uniform distribution a total of six orientation radii were tested ranging between 0 no orientation to 20 km see table 2 the diel rhythm in the associative behavior of tunas was accounted for by defining two behavioral modes daytime and nighttime with a periodicity of 24 h each during the 12 h of daytime tuna displayed an orientation behavior towards fads if located within the orientation radius conversely during the 12 h of nighttime tuna did not exhibit a long range attraction to fads no oriented behavior within the orientation radius and therefore followed a simple crw dynamic in both daytime and nighttime behavioral modes a tuna was however considered to be associated with a fad when it was located within 500 m of it this value is in accordance with both the observations of tuna when they were associated with fads see josse et al 2000 moreno et al 2007 and the detection range of acoustic tags used in telemetry studies around instrumented fads see forget et al 2015 the model did not represent the association time of tuna at fads crt but these durations were needed to compare the model with the field data therefore the crts recorded from field data were used as a model input each time a tuna reaches a fad i e it was located within 500 m of it a crt value was randomly sampled from the actual crt data of the corresponding array and the simulated individuals do not move away from the fad during the entire duration of the crt the crts recorded from field data in each array are shown in the supplementary information 2 once this time has elapsed individuals could leave the fad in a random direction sampled from a uniform distribution between π π to avoid immediate returns during the 24 h following the end of a crt fish was not affected by the association radius ro of the fad of departure similarly returns due to tuna re entering the detection range within 24 h which were already taken into account in the crt duration were neglected for this purpose each time a catreturn of less than 24 h was recorded after a crt this movement was discarded and the simulation time was reset to the end of the last crt recorded fig 3 this procedure ensured that crt durations were consistent with field data since the crts recorded immediately after tagging were significantly longer than the other crts in the hawaii field experiments and slightly longer in the mauritius field data see supplementary information 2 they were not considered in the above procedure accordingly the first crt were also subtracted from the trt to ensure data consistency finally a mortality rate m was considered to account for natural and fishing mortality events that may cause the interruption of the acoustic detections for some tagged individuals for this purpose a monte carlo algorithm was applied where for each individual and at each time step a random number ε was sampled from a uniform distribution in the interval 0 1 and compared with the corresponding mortality rate using a bernoulli test a death was accepted for ε m t the constant t depends on the time step δt and on the temporal units of the mortality rate different mortality rates were tested ranging between 0 and 5 per day table 2 for a mortality rate expressed in days 1 and δt in seconds t δt 3600 24 the upper bound of 5 per day was estimated from survival analyses of field data see supplementary information 3 trts values therefore depended on both the crw dynamics which affects the number of tuna associations thus the time at which the last fad detections occur and the mortality rates fig 2 the model was run in a continuous unbounded space centered around the actual fad arrays of mauritius and hawaii the topography of each island was considered using data from the r package rworldmap south 2011 each time simulated individuals were at risk of crossing island boundaries the distribution of turning angles α was sub sampled in order to avoid the island a total of 1000 individuals were considered in each fad array for each combination of model parameters for each individual the simulations started at one of the fads of tagging in order to reproduce the experimental design as accurately as possible the probability to start at a given fad was obtained considering the number of tuna tagged at the fad relative to the total number of tuna tagged in the field experiment see supplementary information 4 two different swimming speeds were tested 0 7 and 1 4 m s corresponding to one and two body lengths per second respectively see swimming speeds in girard et al 2004 and tagging studies used in this study robert et al 2013 and rodriguez tress et al 2017 time steps δt lasted 100 s and each resulted in individual fish movements of 70 and 140 m depending on the speed a summary of all model parameters can be found in table 2 all the simulations were performed using the python 3 programming language python software foundation version 3 8 5 2 4 comparison between simulated and field data since the model aimed at fitting the time that tuna spent between two fad associations catdiff the comparison between the model and the field data focused on this metric however the distribution of catdiff also depends on the total time spent in the fad array i e longer catdiff can only be observed for longer trt as such the comparison between the model and the field data was performed for both metrics for this purpose catdiff and trt were obtained from the simulated data using the same procedures applied to the field data the selection of model parameters which best fitted the field data was made using a survival analysis by comparing the theoretical survival curves of the trt and the catdiff with those obtained from field data through a bootstrap method experimental survival curves s t were constructed capello et al 2015 which represented the proportion of events trt or catdiff longer than a given duration t for each set of parameters the survival curve of the field data was compared 1000 times with a sub sample of the same size as the field data i e 56 individuals for hawaii and 14 for mauritius table 1 randomly sampled from the 1000 simulated individuals for each of the bootstrap sample survival curves obtained from the simulated and field data were compared using cox proportional hazards regressions the statistical significance of the model was assessed using the p value from a logrank test which tested the null hypothesis of identical hazards between the model and the field data for each survival curve trt and catdiff and fad array mauritius and hawaii the percentage of retained bootstrap tests was calculated corresponding to the number of bootstrap tests showing p values 0 05 over the 1000 tests performed finally each set of parameters was assigned the lower percentage of retained bootstraps estimated over survival curves trt and catdiff and fad arrays hawaii and mauritius the cox proportional hazards regressions and logrank tests were performed using the r software r core team 2018 version 3 4 4 with the function coxph in the survival package version 3 1 8 therneau and grambsch 2000 3 results a total of 648 sets of parameters were tested table 2 of which 7 appeared to best fit both the catdiff and trt recorded in the mauritian and hawaiian arrays considering a percentage of retained bootstrap tests 85 table 3 and supplementary information 5 that is over the 1000 tests performed for each set of parameters 7 sets were not statistically different from the field data in more than 85 of the tests performed on both survival curves trt and catdiff and fad arrays mauritius and hawaii fig 5 and fig 6 present the catdiff and trt survival curves for each fad

7 4 discussion the study of animal behavior made considerable progress in the last decades thanks to the development of electronic tagging and camera trapping technologies hughey et al 2018 swann and perkins 2014 however characterizing the movement of animals in their own environment still remains a challenging task particularly in marine environments where gps technologies can rarely be used here through the use a field based modeling approach and passive acoustic telemetry data we provide for the first time a method for describing the movement behavior of tunas in fad arrays the model is built upon four main behavioral components based on the state of the art knowledge of the associative dynamics of tunas at fads random walk dynamics orientation capabilities diel behavior and a lack in correlation between the duration of consecutive crts and cats a relatively small number of parameters drive the model s properties swimming speed path sinuosity orientation radius and mortality rate despite the model s structural simplicity and the reduced number of parameters it was able to reproduce both of the investigated movement metrics time between two fad associations and total time spent in the array in two different fad arrays the four parameters tested can be related to the physiological capabilities and condition of tuna as well as their environment including the fads other tuna and non tuna species present in the array the two swimming speeds tested corresponding to the 0 7 and 1 4 m s stem from previous studies showing that swimming speed typically range between 1 and 2 body lengths per second dagorn et al 2013b girard et al 2004 in contrast despite previous evidences of a random walk behavior in tuna movements between fads girard et al 2004 pérez et al 2020 no empirical studies have estimated the sinuosity of a tuna path in a fad array as a consequence large ranges of sinuosity were considered the results show that while both speed values could be retained by the simulations only a limited subset of sinuosity coefficients emerged the majority of sinuosity coefficients that were retained indicated a rather skewed distribution of turning angles fig 3 table 3 lower sinuosity coefficients were mostly found for the highest swimming speed table 3 this is to be expected considering that for a given average distance traveled during a correlated random walk higher speeds imply lower sinuosity coefficients and vice versa hall 1977 kareiva and shigesada 1983 marsh and jones 1988 hence the values of the sinuosity coefficient c retained are valid considering the chosen time step δt 100 s it is likely that the tuna movement characteristics speed and sinuosity also depend on the fine scale environmental characteristics within the fad array such as the type and distribution of prey or the physiological conditions of the tuna itself in future the consideration of a range of swimming speeds and path sinuosity as opposed to single values could provide a more realistic picture of tuna movements however the range of values used in this study provides an initial set of movement characteristics that are compatible with field observations thus contributing to the poorly understood dynamics of tuna in a fad array the mortality rate which accounts for both natural and fishing mortality is primarily influenced by risks associated with fishing activity natural predation and disease a previous study using conventional tags from the hawaii tuna tagging project http showed a natural mortality rate of 0 36 per day and a fishing mortality of 0 67 per day for yellowfin tuna larger than 56 cm adam et al 2003 as such the global mortality rates estimated through our simulations appear to be higher than previous findings this difference could be due to a specific mortality in each study site and period considered indeed even if in both cases the hawaiian archipelago was considered these studies concern different islands and study periods for which the fishing pressure might differ as well as the natural mortality acoustic telemetry data do not allow for the direct estimation of mortality rate but do provide information on the time at which an individual is no longer detected by receivers deployed on fads generally a lack of acoustic detections indicates that tuna have either left the fad array or died movement dynamics of tuna can explain the first potential causes for a lack of detection within the model the propensity of an individual to depart from the array is directly linked to the sinuosity of its path its swimming speed and its orientation radius for instance large path sinuosity resulting from small values of the sinuosity coefficient c primarily leads to movements close to the fad of departure and little or no detections at the other fads conversely small path sinuosity form high values of the coefficient of sinuosity c generally results in individuals rapidly leaving the array fig 3 and supplementary information 1 in this way the model provides direct information on the rate at which tuna are lost from fad arrays fitting the model to the field data allows for differentiation between loss through randomness of movement and loss due to mortality table 2 and supplementary information 3 as such this field based movement model could provide a new and alternative methodology for estimating the mortality rates of tuna in a fad array in the model the orientation radius represents the distance from which tunas are able to orient themselves towards fads them while on the field tuna could be able to perceive fads before orienting themselves toward them no data is available on the distance at which tunas perceive fads but tuna movements provide input on the distance at which tunas start to orient themselves toward fads therefore the fad perception radius was not considered in this study this distance naturally depends on the tuna s ability to perceive its surrounding environment as well as on the physical characteristics of the area given the large distances from which tuna can orient themselves towards fads highlighted in previous studies girard et al 2004 as well as those found in this study the use of visual cues as explanatory factors can be discarded as sound can travel great distances underwater the perception of acoustic stimuli could be a valid hypothesis for explaining the ability of tunas to orient towards fads from such large distances environmental characteristics may impact the propagation of sounds between fads and tunas and influence how strong these sound stimuli are the physical characteristics of the water mass are known to affect the propagation of sound waves lee et al 2017 siddiqui and dong 2019 furthermore the topology of the fad array and its location relative to the coastline could also affect underwater sound propagation as sounds may be produced by the fad structures themselves they can vary depending on the materials used and the design of each structure which often differ among fad arrays although fad design has not been identified as influencing the attractiveness of fads fréon and dagorn 2000 it may impact their detectability tunas may also perceive the presence of a fad through the emission of noise generated by the fish aggregation itself in such a situation the intensity of the noise could be dependent on the quantity of fish present but also on the types of species and their activities considering these multiple potential sources of environmental variability the distance at which tuna are able to perceive fads orientation radius is likely to vary both within and between fad arrays no single value of the orientation radius can exist but rather a distribution of these distances with a subset of values for which the probability of being located in the environment is greatest a general model that describes the movements of tuna in different fad arrays with the same parameters such as the one developed in this study provides a subset of the most probable orientation distances however it is likely that a distribution of orientation distances could be more realistic and for a particular fad the orientation radius could have its own dynamics according to local environmental conditions a previous study by girard et al 2004 determined orientation radii between 4 and 17 km with a mode around 10 km this study was based on 14 yellowfin tuna yft from 47 cm to 167 cm fl that were acoustically tracked in different fad arrays brill et al 1999 dagorn et al 2000 holland et al 1990 marsac and cayré 1998 and included the specie size category considered in our simulations yft of 70 cm these 14 individuals were actively tracked over short durations between 12 and 86 h due to the constraints of active tracking rather than passively monitored as in our study the radii found in our 7 sets of parameters 5 km and 2 km in one set are similar to the lower range of the orientation distances 4 17 km found by girard et al 2004 the longer orientation distances identified in that study could be attributed to the inclusion of only long paths more than 7 km away from the fads in their analysis furthermore the authors considered that the longest orientation distances e g 15 km could be the result of tuna patrolling along the coast thus using some bathymetric information rather than signals from fads as such the distances found by girard et al 2004 may represent maximum orientation distances while the average could be shorter and more similar to the values we found 2 5 km finally it is important to note that the two studies considered different datasets collected in different regions and possible inter fad array variability in the orientation radius cannot be excluded it is important to stress that the retention of the model parameters was very conservative only those valid for both metrics trt and catdiff and fad arrays were kept in doing so possible local variability in tuna behavior for example a different orientation radius depending on the study site were excluded this choice was made to obtaining the minimal and most general model that could reproduce the observations considering a threshold of 85 for the percentage of retained bootstraps provides 7 sets of parameter values over the 648 tested these values radius of orientation ranging between 2 and 5 km coefficient of sinuosity between 0 9 and 0 995 mortality rates between 2 and 3 provide the main characteristics of tuna movements in fad arrays to avoid any scaling issue the same data treatment was applied to both field and simulated data sets therefore the model can be considered to correctly reproduce the tuna movements between fads at the dayscale i e the scale related to a maximum blanking period of 24 h capello et al 2015 which was used to process the acoustic data further studies across a greater number of study sites could provide insight into how these model parameters could vary between fad arrays similarly it would be of interest to consider how this model fitted for yft 70 is able to describe the behavior of other tuna species and sizes this model could also be used for other non tuna species that associate with fads and in particular vulnerable species such as the silky sharks carcharhinus falciformis as this model aimed to simulate tuna movements in fad arrays the time tuna spent associated with fads crt was not simulated and the experimental crt distribution was used as an input of the model further model developments which consider social interactions at fads pérez et al 2020 robert et al 2014 may allow the crt durations within different fad arrays to also be integrated into the model this integration of crts into the model would involve adding social interactions between individuals and behavioral rules of social retention at the fad that follow the meeting point hypothesis dagorn and fréon 1999 fréon and dagorn 2000 robert et al 2014 5 conclusion building on current knowledge of the associative behavior tuna at fads from acoustic telemetry data our model is the first to reproduce the movement behavior of tunas in a fad array a total of 7 sets of parameters table 3 were able to reproduce with a high confidence the movements of yellowfin tuna fork length 70 cm in two different fad arrays suggesting the model is robust future model improvements could consider distributions of speeds sinuosity detection radii and mortality rates rather than fixed values which may provide a better reflection of the variability induced by the local environment and the physiological conditions of the tuna themselves this model can be used on all species that display associative behavior with floating object this includes species such as dolphinfish coryphaena hippurus or the vulnerable silky shark carcharhinus falciformis when combined with acoustic telemetry data the model can provide an alternative method for determining the mortality rate of tuna and other associated species in a fad array given the difficulty in assessing natural and fishing mortality for wild marine species this novel approach could be of interest for the stock assessment community moreover the model could be used to predict how increasing numbers of fads affect the ecology of tunas ecology both in terms of the time spent away from fads and the total time spent in a fad array this study offers a new tool to provide science based advice for the management of fad fisheries since the more time fish spend associated the more vulnerable these individuals are to the fishery scenarios could be extended to drifting fads in open ocean areas as both anchored and drifting fads alter the environment in a similar way dagorn et al 2010 while acoustic telemetry experiments have successfully characterized residence times at drifting fads forget et al 2015 govinden et al 2010 measuring in situ absence times of tunas within drifting fad arrays is a major research challenge and these parameters are key for the development of robust fad management plans by tuna regional fisheries management organisations rfmos our model provides a method for estimate these parameters in the absence of data from acoustically tagged tuna in drifting fad arrays finally the same approach can be used to study the movement behavior of other marine and terrestrial species that manifest an associative behavior with aggregating sites and for which presence absence data are recorded at these sites for instance our model could be used to study the movements of terrestrial animals who show associative behaviors with waterholes o farrill et al 2014 zvidzai et al 2013 detected through camera traps hughey et al 2018 swann and perkins 2014 more generally this method could be used even without any associative behavior at specific sites as long as the study site is equipped with regularly spaced and sufficiently numerous receivers where individuals can be identified authors contributions s b k h and l d collected the raw data in the field g p developed the model with major contribution of a d and m c g p analysed the data and wrote

24411,quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps is helpful to direct carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reduction the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the improved whcns veg model soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulation for vegetable in simulating nitrous oxide n2o emissions under different gvps and ii analyze the impact of different management systems on n2o emissions from the gvps greenhouse vegetable experiments were carried out under different management systems including conventional con integrated int and organic org in quzhou county hebei province from 2013 to 2015 field observations of soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions were used to calibrate and validate the whcns veg model the sensitivity analysis results showed that the effects of soil hydraulic parameters on n2o emissions were higher than those of n transformation and vegetable genetic parameters the improved whcns veg model simulated soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions well under different gvps the average n2o emissions in the spring summer season 16 3 kg n ha 1 were about 2 5 times higher than the autumn winter season 6 4 kg n ha 1 among the four seasons the average n2o emissions of con org and int were 13 5 11 3 and 9 3 kg n ha 1 respectively accounting for 1 4 1 7 of the total fertilizer input the n2o emissions of the int and org systems were 31 1 and 16 3 lower than the con treatment respectively the results indicated that the improved whcns veg model can be used to simulate and analyze n2o emissions under different management systems and substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer could effectively reduce the n2o emissions in the gvps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse vegetable nitrous oxide emissions management system organic manure whcns veg model 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps have been increasing rapidly in china due to higher economic returns for farmers china has become the world s largest vegetable producer and accounts for 50 5 of the global total vegetable production zhang et al 2016 as a highly intensive production system gvps requires large amounts of water and fertilizer inputs many studies have investigated the major greenhouse vegetable production areas of china and found that these systems typically use 1000 mm of irrigation water and 1000 kg n ha 1 per season in some cases nitrogen n inputs exceeded 3000 kg n ha 1 ju et al 2009 yu et al 2010 these n levels far exceed crop demand and result in large losses to the environment through leaching and gas emissions ti et al 2015 or accumulated in the soil in the form of inorganic n therefore its n fertilizer use efficiency was much lower than those of field crops zhou et al 2016 nitrous oxide n2o and carbon dioxide co2 are two significant greenhouse gasses ghgs that contribute to global warming and the deterioration of the atmospheric environment the warming potential per molecule of n2o is 298 times that of co2 on a 100 year scale ipcc 2007 according to statistical results global n2o emissions from agriculture accounts for 60 of the total n2o caused by human activities it was estimated that by 2030 n2o emissions from agriculture would increase by 35 60 compared to 2005 if not controlled nakicenovic and swart 2000 cultivated land was the largest source of agricultural n2o emissions accounting for about 80 of agricultural n2o emissions mainly due to anthropogenic n input metz et al 2007 the annual n2o emissions from global vegetable production areas were 0 95 tg n2on accounting for 24 4 of total agricultural n2o emissions rashti et al 2015 the annual n2o emissions from vegetable systems open fields and greenhouse production in china was 3 91 kg n2on ha 1 which was 1 24 4 16 times higher than other crop systems while the n2o emissions of the greenhouse vegetable systems was 2 49 times higher than open field vegetable systems wang et al 2018 in recent years the focus of vegetable production has gradually shifted from vegetable yield to environmental impacts hochmuth 2003 some research suggested that the substituting chemical fertilizers with organic manure can significantly reduce n2o emissions b han et al 2017 han et al 2019 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 found that n2o emissions could be reduced by adjusting the chemical fertilizers rate and applying organic manure without reducing vegetable yield in addition some reports showed that organic farming reduced n2o emissions as compared to conventional farming skinner et al 2014 bhowmik et al 2016 the static box method is usually used to monitor ghg emissions from farmland this method is not only time consuming laborious and costly but also easily affected by many factors such as soil climate water and fertilizer management the results are very uncertain and cannot accurately capture the peak emissions therefore many studies used the soil crop atmosphere system models to simulate soil physical chemical and biological processes as well as crop growth but only a few models can be used to simulate the daily dynamics of n2o emissions for the crop growing season and fallow periods commonly used models for simulating n2o emissions include dndc li et al 1992 daycent parton et al 1994 ecosys grant et al 1993 fassat parton et al 1996 and wnmm li et al 2007 those models had been widely used to simulate n2o emissions under various field management practices irrigation fertilization tillage etc or different land use types agricultural fields forests grasslands and other plant types at the field or regional scales however n2o emissions from the nitrification process has been ignored by some models that were designed and used for field crops and currently few models can simulate ghg emissions for gvps due to the characteristics of high temperature humidity and intensive management in the gvps the vegetable growth and development process and the n2o gas emissions process are different from field crops recently liang et al 2018 combined the vegetable growth module of the eu rotate n model with the whcns model and constructed the water and n management model whcns veg soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulation for vegetable for gvps the whcns veg model can be used to simulate the water and n movement the c and n cycles and vegetable growth processes it has been used successfully to optimize the water and fertilizer management for gvps in north china liang et al 2018 2020 however the model does not currently simulate ghg emissions processes so it is not useful to determine optimum gvps management practices to reduce n2o emissions the objectives of this study were to 1 incorporate components of the daycent 4 5 model into the whcns veg model to provide simulations of n2o emissions 2 evaluate the accuracy of the improved model to simulate the n2o emissions process for gvps and 3 analyze the effects of different management systems on the n2o emissions and determine the optimal system to reduce n2o emissions for gvps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a long term experiment for vegetable growth has been conducted since march 2002 at the quzhou experimental station of china agricultural university the experiment site is located in the north of quzhou county 36 52 n 115 01 e elev 35 37 m hebei province china this area has a temperate and semi humid monsoon climate it has abundant climate resources such as light heat and water but is strongly affected by monsoons it is cold and dry in winter and spring and warm and rainy in summer the average annual temperature is 13 2 c the average annual rainfall is 604 mm 70 of which occurs from july to september and the average annual evaporation is 1841 mm which is 3 3 times the average annual rainfall the soil was restored salinized tidal cinnamon soil the basic surface soil chemical properties are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design the experiment consisted of three vegetable production systems conventional con integrated int and organic org each system was carried out with three replicates in one semi round arch greenhouse 52 m in length and 7 m in width about 120 m2 for each replicate the same vegetable rotation irrigation and tillage schemes have been followed in all three systems since 2002 the experiment for this work was conducted from 2013 to 2015 with two growing seasons in one year the first season was from early october to early february named the autumn winter aw season and the second season was from late february to late september named the spring summer ss season cauliflower brassica oleracea l var botrytis l and celery apium graveolens l were transplanted into three systems at the same time in autumn of 2013 and 2014 respectively while eggplant solanum melongena l was transplanted in spring of 2014 and 2015 the org system was carried out according to the international federation of organic agriculture movements ifoam with chicken and cow manure derived compost and biological and physical methods for plant protection the con system followed the local style for greenhouse vegetable production by using chemical fertilizers urea superphosphate and potassium sulfate pesticides and dry chicken manure the int system combined 50 of chemical fertilizers with 50 of compost using biological methods for general plant protection and low toxic chemical pesticides all of the three management systems applied the base fertilizer to the surface soil and the fertilizer was mixed into the 0 20 cm depth by ploughing before transplanting topdressing was only applied in ss season fertilizer in the con and int systems was applied on 20 february and 19 october in 2014 respectively and ratios of base fertilizer and topdressing are 1 7 1 for con and 2 8 1 for int respectively there was only one application on 11 march in 2015 with a ratio of 2 8 1 for con and 5 7 1 for int flood irrigation was carried out according to the local farmer practices the vegetables were irrigated 3 11 4 and 10 times for cauliflower eggplant celery and eggplant growing seasons respectively the irrigation amount was about 100 mm for each application the fertilizer n input under different management systems is shown in table 2 2 3 sampling and analysis the soil profile was excavated to a depth of 1 0 m in the greenhouse on april 2013 and samples of soil textural layers were collected for analysis of the basic soil physical and chemical properties table 1 and table 3 the soil bulk density was determined by the cutting rings method the soil texture was measured by the pipette method the som was determined by the potassium dichromate wet combustion procedure total n was measured by the kjeldahl method available p was extracted with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 at a ph of 8 5 and measured using the molybdenum blue method available k was extracted with 1 mol l 1 nh4oac at a ph of 7 by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer during the experimental period from october 2013 to september 2015 soil samples were collected 3 5 days after each irrigation at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm using a soil auger soil water content was measured by the oven drying method fresh soil samples were extracted with 2 mol l 1 kcl to determine the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n by using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany nitrous oxide fluxes were sampled by the static chamber method wang et al 2003 gas samples were taken once a week in summer once every 2 weeks in other seasons and at the 1st 3rd 5th 7th and 9th day after fertilization and 2nd 4th 6th and 8th day after irrigation sampling was between 9 00 a m and 11 00 a m air samples from the chamber headspace were collected using gas bags and the n2o concentration was simultaneously analyzed with a modified gas chromatographic agilent 7890a soil temperature at the 0 5 cm layer was also measured by geo thermometers during gas collection the detailed information on n2o fluxes calculation can be found in h han et al 2017 at harvest plants collected from a 6 m2 sample area in each replication were used to measure the yields of vegetable plant samples were also obtained from each replication in each greenhouse and dried at 75 c to determine the aboveground biomass and plant n content lu 2000 an automatic weather station rr 9100 was installed in the con system greenhouse to record meteorological elements such as temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation 2 4 whcns veg model the whcns veg model was used to simulate soil water movement soil heat and n transport and crop growth the model integrates the key processes governing water movement and n and c cycles in the soil crop system these key processes include soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement soil runoff soil temperature mineralization of fresh crop residue and soil organic n son son immobilization in biomass nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification crop growth and agricultural management practices sowing date planting density straw return crop rotation irrigation and fertilizer application etc in the model the potential evapotranspiration et is estimated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 and the richards equation are used to compute the soil water infiltration and redistribution processes respectively root water absorption is computed by using the van genuchten 1987 model with a compensatory root water uptake mechanism šimůnek and hopmans 2009 soil heat transport simulation was taken from the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 the soil mineral n transport uses the convection diffusion equation and soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 vegetable growth and development dry matter accumulation fresh yield and vegetable n uptake were derived from the eu rotate n model greenwood 2001 rahn et al 2010 a detailed model description is available in literature liang et al 2018 the model inputs include site location latitude altitude basic soil physical chemical properties crop management information planting and harvest date planting density planting depth field management initial soil moisture content and mineral n content and daily meteorological data 2 5 model improvement in this study the whcns veg model was modified to improve the simulation of n2o emissions nitrous oxide emissions from the soil are calculated as a function of total n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification the daily time step nitrification and denitrification sub models were primarily derived from the daycent 4 5 model parton et al 1996 del grosso et al 2000 2001 the n2o n2o nit produced by the nitrification process was calculated by 1 n 2

wfps water filled pore space and soil texture related physical properties that influence gas diffusivity in the soil the n2o n2o den produced by the denitrification process was calculated by the

willmott 1981 nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the index of agreement d were used to evaluate the model performance the three deviation statistics were calculated using the following equations 7 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 8 e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where pi is the simulated value oi is the measured value o is the mean of the measured value n is the number of values the rmse describes the average absolute deviation between simulated and measured values the closer is the value of the rmse to 0 the more accurate is the model e ranges between and 1 an efficiency of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated values and observed data e 0 indicates that the model predictions are the same as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency less than zero e 0 shows the model gave performance poor the d value represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and ranges from 0 to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model performance willmott 1981 based on van liew and garbrecht 2003 an acceptable simulation should have e 0 36 and d 0 7 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the parameters used for testing the whcns veg model could be divided into three categories soil hydraulic parameters crop parameters and n transformation parameters the partial sensitivity analysis was used to observe the effect of input parameter changes on the model output by changing the input parameter values one by one while keeping the remaining parameters unchanged in this study each input parameter was changed by 10 and the variation of soil n2o emissions was observed fig 1 shows the percent change in n2o for 10 changes in each of the selected model input parameters soil hydraulic parameters had a bigger influence on n2o emissions than parameters related to n transformation and crop growth among the soil hydraulic parameters θwp θr θfc and ks had a larger impact on soil n2o emissions with a relative ranking of θwp θr θfc ks θs among them the wilting point had the highest impact on n2o emissions the parameter θs had the lowest impact on soil n2o emissions among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes had a larger impact on n2o emissions the parameters rden ad and rnit had a larger impact on soil n2o emissions than other n transformation parameters crop parameters had little impact on soil n2o emissions the parameters tbase kini and kmid had a small influence on soil n2o emissions while other crop parameters a small effect on soil n2o emissions 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content and soil n concentration four vegetable crops were planted from october 2013 to september 2015 the model was first calibrated using the observed soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions for the con system and then the model was validated using the datasets from the int and org systems soil bulk density and particle fraction of the soil profile were derived from the measurements the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 3 and the crop and n transformation parameters are shown in table 4 figs 2 and 3 show the comparison of the simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer under different management systems the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured values for the con calibrated and int and org validation management systems the soil water content increased rapidly with irrigation and decreased with evapotranspiration et demand because of frequent irrigation the soil water content fluctuation was relatively large during the vegetable growing period but was small during the fallow period from january to february from september to october in 2014 and from february to march in 2015 due to lack of irrigation fig 2 there was no significant difference in soil water content under different management systems because the irrigation management was the same for all three management systems fig 3 shows the simulated surface soil nitrate concentrations agreed well with the measured values for the con calibrated int and org validation management systems the 0 20 cm soil nitrate concentrations varied sharply with a peak occurring after each fertilization event the peak values and duration of peaks were different due to the different kinds of n fertilizer used for the three systems the base fertilizer for con and int was chemical fertilizer where the n in the chemical fertilizer was easily released and leached with water flow therefore the nitrate in the con and int systems had a rapid peak followed by a rapid decline due to leaching the nitrate peak for con was the highest among the three management systems the organic manure was applied in the org system this source released nitrogen slowly under the action of microorganisms and it was not easily leached with water flow therefore the nitrate concentration peaks of the org system appeared relatively late and the duration of the peak lasted longer after fertilization the statistical indices in table 5 are the results of calibration and evaluation of soil water content and nitrate concentration the rmse values of soil nitrate concentration was less than 10 mg kg 1 while the rmse values of soil water content and n2o emissions were close to zero the ranges of e and d were 0 47 0 91 and 0 88 0 98 respectively according to the thresholds suggested by van liew and garbrecht 2003 an acceptable simulation should have a value of e 0 36 and d 0 70 the e values of water content and nitrate concentration were all greater than 0 36 and the d values were all greater than 0 70 these results indicated that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating the soil water content and nitrate concentration in this gvps under different management systems 3 2 2 n2o emissions the comparison of n2o emissions between the simulated and measured n2o emissions from the gvps under different management systems is shown in fig 4 the simulated n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values the fluctuation of n2o emissions was large in all management systems during the vegetable growing period due to the large fertilization rate and frequent irrigations the n2o emissions had an obvious peak after each irrigation and fertilization event and the whcns veg model captured the peak well the peak value of n2o was different among the three management systems because of different fertilizer types and rates the peak value for con and int was significantly higher than that of org during the calibration process the evaluation indices of n2o emissions showed that the rmse was 0 08 e value was 0 60 and the d value was 0 90 table 5 for the validation results the rmse was 0 06 e value was 0 49 and d value was 0 86 in general the simulated n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values fig 5 shows the comparison of the simulated and measured n2o emissions for the validated treatments int and org the r2 was 0 94 and the slope of linear regression was 0 92 which was close to 1 fig 6 shows the temporal dynamics of n2o emissions under different management systems the results indicated that the n2o emissions were closely related to soil water content and temperature the n2o emissions for the 2013 aw and 2014 aw seasons decreased with decreases in temperature in the 2014 ss and 2015 ss seasons the n2o emissions increased with increasing temperature among the four vegetable seasons the average n2o emissions were 6 4 kg n ha 1 for aw and 16 3 kg n ha 1 for the ss season which was 2 5 times higher than for the aw season the pearson correlation coefficient between n2o emissions and soil temperature was 0 17 p 0 01 n 740 indicating that n2o emissions were significantly positively correlated with soil temperature the soil n2o emissions were also closely related to irrigation and fertilizer applications the number of irrigations over the four seasons were 3 11 4 and 10 respectively after each irrigation there was an obvious n2o emissions peak the peak in the con system was the highest while it was the lowest for the org system in addition the n2o emissions were also affected by fertilizer application within a few days after fertilization the soil inorganic n concentration of three management systems increased fig 3 thereby increasing the soil n2o emissions the n2o emissions increased with the application of base fertilizer and topdressing as the nitrate concentration in the soil gradually decreased the n2o emissions also gradually decreased among the four season vegetables the 2014 ss season had the largest amounts of irrigation and fertilizer table 2 thus the n2o emissions were also the largest 3 3 the impact of different management systems on n2o emissions the soil n2o emissions are also related to the fertilizer type table 6 shows the order of n2o emissions was con org int the con system mainly applied chemical fertilizers and the n2o emissions were the highest except for 2015 ss the org system only used organic manure and its n2o emissions were the lowest among the four seasons compared with the con the n2o emissions for org system in the first three seasons decreased by 39 2 51 1 and increased by 128 0 in the last season the n2o emissions for int system decreased by 17 0 34 4 the n2o emissions for each season of con ranged from 7 4 to 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 1 2 2 4 of the total n input per season the n2o emissions for int was 5 0 18 9 kg n ha 1 accounting for 1 0 2 0 of total nitrogen applied while emissions for org was 4 5 18 7 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of applied nitrogen the n2o emissions in different seasons were different the average n2o emissions in aw was 6 4 kg n ha 1 while it was 16 3 kg n ha 1 in the ss season which was 2 5 times greater than the aw season the order of n2o emissions for 2013aw 2014ss and 2014aw season was con int org at the end of the 2015ss the n2o emissions of org were significantly higher than those of con and int considering no irrigation at the end of 2015ss the different surface soil properties of the three management systems maybe the reason for this table 1 the organic manure applied in con and int was far below that of the org system table 2 which led to the low soil water and fertilizer holding capacity resulting in the lower n2o emissions on the other hand the org system had high soil water and fertilizer holding capacity which results in higher n2o emissions fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 impact of soil water content and temperature on n2o emissions the n2o emissions results from the nitrification process under aerobic conditions and the denitrification process results from anaerobic conditions in the agricultural production process n2o emissions are related to soil temperature water content and the inorganic n concentration in the soil oertel et al 2016 soil water content is an important factor affecting soil gas emissions elder and lal 2008 showed that soil n2o emissions were positively correlated with soil water content increases in soil water content can increase n2o emissions produced by the denitrification process in an anaerobic environment giltrap et al 2010 many studies found that n2o emissions were related to wfps sehy et al 2003 pointed out that 60 wfps was the critical point for high n2o emissions ruser et al 2006 proposed that when wfps 70 it enhanced the denitrification process and increased the n2o emissions in our study the wfps was in the range of 29 4 86 6 and it was higher than 60 during most of the vegetable growth which likely caused soil n2o emissions at the same time the pearson correlation coefficients of wfps and n2o emissions of con int and org were 0 50 0 56 and 0 73 p 0 01 n 740 respectively indicating that wfps and n2o emissions were significantly positively correlation the results were consistent with previous studies sehy et al 2003 ruser et al 2006 in addition the frequent alternation of soil drying and wetting could stimulate n2o emissions the main reason is that some microorganisms die under drying condition which increases the active organic carbon source in the soil the oxygen promotes the nitrification process and provides a large amount of substrate for the denitrification process the denitrification process occurs when the soil becomes wet again and the n2o production is faster than the reduction process which leads to faster n2o emissions generally the n2o emissions caused by the alternate soil drying and wetting was higher than that of the continuous soil wetting ruser et al 2006 in this study the irrigation was frequent the vegetable crops were irrigated 3 11 4 and 10 times in the four seasons respectively the irrigation amount was large at 100 mm per event frequent dry wet alternation likely contributed to the soil n2o emissions the n2o emissions peaks obviously occurred after each irrigation fig 6 which was consistent with the reports by other scholars zhang et al 2018 irrigation accelerated the soil gas emissions by pressure and lead to a higher wfps 60 which created an anaerobic status which promoted the denitrification process russow et al 2000 b han et al 2017 reported that optimizing irrigation could reduce n2o emissions while ensuring yield the effects of soil temperature and water content on n2o emissions are often overlapping in the field and it is difficult to distinguish clearly through field observations fang and moncrieff 2001 groffman et al 2009 showed that temperature contributed about 50 of soil n2o emissions soil temperature was an important reason to explain the difference in soil gas emissions soil temperature could explain 86 variances of n2o emissions schindlbacher et al 2004 many studies found that increasing soil temperature could increase n2o emissions he et al 2009 yan et al 2014 klemedtsson et al 1987 showed that when the temperature was lower than 35 c the nitrification and denitrification processes were positively correlated with the temperature and the n2o emissions were positively correlated with the temperature at the same time the increase in soil temperature could promote the respiration of soil microorganisms consume a large amount of oxygen in the soil provide an anaerobic environment for the denitrification process and increase the n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 in this study the n2o emissions in gvps under different management systems showed a positive correlation with the soil temperature fig 6 during the four seasons the average temperature of the aw season was 13 1 c and the ss season was 22 6 c therefore the n2o emissions during the ss was greater than that of the aw these results were consistent with the previous research 4 2 the impact of different fertilizer types and rates on n2o emissions many studies have indicated that the application of chemical n fertilizers is the main source of n2o emissions from vegetable fields wang et al 2018 the global annual n2o released due to vegetable production was estimated as 9 5 107 kg n ha 1 of which 9 0 came from fertilizer applications rashti et al 2015 the effects of fertilization on soil n2o emissions were larger than that of soil water content and temperature niu et al 2010 peng et al 2011 in our study n2o emissions were highly correlated with fertilizer applications the pearson correlation coefficients of n2o emissions and soil nitrate concentration under different management systems were 0 28 con 0 29 int and 0 19 org p 0 01 n 740 indicating that the soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions were positively correlated wang et al 2018 conducted a meta analysis of china s vegetable production systems and found that n2o emissions had a positive linear correlation with fertilizer n application rates our results were consistent with previous studies due to the large amount of fertilization the annual n2o emissions from the gvps was 2 88 0 10 kg n ha 1 which was 1 68 2 38 times that of field crops rashti et al 2015 diao et al 2013 found that 64 6 84 5 of n2o released from vegetable fields was caused by n fertilizer yan et al 2014 showed that the n2o emissions peak occurred after fertilization and the magnitude and duration of the peaks were related to the fertilizer types and rates he et al 2009 showed that the annual n2o emissions were 2 6 8 8 kg n ha 1 when the n application rate of the gvps was 127 870 kg n ha 1 which accounted for 0 27 0 30 of the annual n input the default value of n2o emissions coefficient by ipcc 2007 was 1 this study found that the n2o emissions from vegetable fields was 4 6 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of the n fertilization and the n2o emissions coefficient were significantly higher than those of he et al 2009 and ipcc 2007 some scholars pointed out that reducing the fertilization rate could significantly reduce n2o emissions he et al 2009 demonstrated that when the traditional n application rate was reduced by 69 and 76 the n2o emissions were reduced by 51 and 27 respectively in order to reduce n2o emissions caused by agricultural activities fertilizer should be applied to meet the vegetable demand at different growing stages mcswiney and robertson 2005 yang et al 2019 found that the n application rate of 187 kg n ha 1 could balance vegetable yield and n2o emissions and the optimal n application rate for leafy vegetables was much lower than that for solanaceous vegetables huang et al 2017 showed that optimizing fertilization measures combining a 50 reduction in fertilizer with straw return maintained vegetable yield without reduction and reduced the n2o emissions by 18 37 zhang et al 2018 reported that the n2o emissions from the gvps was related to the large amount of n fertilizer application and frequent flood irrigation compared with the farmer practices the optimized fertilization could reduce the n2o emissions by 38 1 48 8 in this study the vegetable planted in 2014ss and 2015ss were eggplant compared with the 2014ss the fertilization rates of con and int in 2015ss decreased by 44 9 and 38 4 respectively as a result their n2o emissions in 2015ss was reduced by 71 5 and 69 8 respectively reducing the n fertilizer rate could significantly reduce n2o emissions our results were consistent with the previous studies some studies have shown that the application of organic manure can supply a sufficient carbon source for soil microorganisms increase soil microbial activity fix more n and reduce n2o emissions vallejo et al 2006 sanchez martin et al 2010 porter et al 2017 showed that under the condition of a low c n level in the soil excessive applications of organic manure could increase n2o emissions but at low levels of application organic manure could inhibit n2o emissions wang et al 2018 explored n2o emissions in china s vegetable production system through meta analysis and showed that n2o emissions could be reduced by adjusting the chemical fertilizers rate and applying organic manure without reducing vegetable yield in this study the con system mainly used urea and gave the highest n2o emissions with an average emissions of 13 5 kg n ha 1 per season the int system used a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer and had an average emissions of 9 3 kg n ha 1 per season the org system only used organic manure and the average n2o emissions per season were 11 3 kg n ha 1 it showed that replacing part of chemical fertilizers with organic manure could reduce n2o emissions which was consistent with previous studies in addition some measures such as straw mulching the application of controlled release fertilizers and the addition of nitrification inhibitors can also reduce n2o emissions shoji et al 2001 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 4 3 evaluation of the improved whcns veg model and its limitations in this study the improved whcn veg model was used to simulate and analyze soil water content nitrate concentration and n2o emissions of the gvps in the ncp from 2013 to 2015 the whcns veg divided the n2o production into nitrification and denitrification processes and considered the impact of meteorological conditions soil properties and water and fertilizer management practices on soil n2o emissions the simulated soil water content nitrate concentration and n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values at the same time this study also had certain limitations firstly due to the lack of measured soil ammonia concentration in this study the soil ammonia concentration could not be verified resulting in the inability to analyze the impact of soil ammonia on n2o emissions in detail secondly only two years data were used to validate the whcns veg in this study as a long term positioning experiment the more measured data are required to validate the model the more reliable results should be obtained in addition the management practices of different nitrogen management systems in this experiment also need to be improved for instance by reducing excessive irrigation and fertilization which should be optimized in future studies finally this study did not compare whcns veg with other models which can also simulate the n2o emissions process comparing and evaluating the different model performance on n2o emissions from gvps is very important in the future the model needs to be verified and evaluated for many years with multiple vegetables 5 conclusions in this study the whcns veg model was improved to simulate the n2o emissions process which mainly considered soil n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification the improved model was calibrated and validated under different vegetable production systems the sensitive analysis results showed that the effects of soil hydraulic parameters on n2o emissions were higher than those of n transformation and vegetable genetic parameters the improved whcns veg model simulated soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions under different gvps in north china very well n2o emissions is a major component of n loss in greenhouse vegetable production in north china from 2013 to 2015 the annual n2o emissions from the gvps in the study area were 4 6 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of the total n input the n2o emissions had a close relationship with soil water content and soil temperature due to frequent irrigation and high temperature the average n2o emissions in spring and summer seasons was 2 5 times of that in the autumn and winter seasons in addition n2o emissions were also closely related to the types and rates of fertilization among the three management systems the con had the highest n2o emissions due to the use of synthetic chemical fertilizer compared with the con the n2o emissions of int and org were reduced by 31 1 and 16 3 respectively the results indicated that the improved whcns veg model has great potential to simulate and analyze n2o emissions under different management systems and substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer can effectively reduce the n2o emissions in the gvps credit authorship contribution statement hongyuan zhang writing original draft methodology

24411,quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps is helpful to direct carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions reduction the objectives of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the improved whcns veg model soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulation for vegetable in simulating nitrous oxide n2o emissions under different gvps and ii analyze the impact of different management systems on n2o emissions from the gvps greenhouse vegetable experiments were carried out under different management systems including conventional con integrated int and organic org in quzhou county hebei province from 2013 to 2015 field observations of soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions were used to calibrate and validate the whcns veg model the sensitivity analysis results showed that the effects of soil hydraulic parameters on n2o emissions were higher than those of n transformation and vegetable genetic parameters the improved whcns veg model simulated soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions well under different gvps the average n2o emissions in the spring summer season 16 3 kg n ha 1 were about 2 5 times higher than the autumn winter season 6 4 kg n ha 1 among the four seasons the average n2o emissions of con org and int were 13 5 11 3 and 9 3 kg n ha 1 respectively accounting for 1 4 1 7 of the total fertilizer input the n2o emissions of the int and org systems were 31 1 and 16 3 lower than the con treatment respectively the results indicated that the improved whcns veg model can be used to simulate and analyze n2o emissions under different management systems and substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer could effectively reduce the n2o emissions in the gvps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords greenhouse vegetable nitrous oxide emissions management system organic manure whcns veg model 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production systems gvps have been increasing rapidly in china due to higher economic returns for farmers china has become the world s largest vegetable producer and accounts for 50 5 of the global total vegetable production zhang et al 2016 as a highly intensive production system gvps requires large amounts of water and fertilizer inputs many studies have investigated the major greenhouse vegetable production areas of china and found that these systems typically use 1000 mm of irrigation water and 1000 kg n ha 1 per season in some cases nitrogen n inputs exceeded 3000 kg n ha 1 ju et al 2009 yu et al 2010 these n levels far exceed crop demand and result in large losses to the environment through leaching and gas emissions ti et al 2015 or accumulated in the soil in the form of inorganic n therefore its n fertilizer use efficiency was much lower than those of field crops zhou et al 2016 nitrous oxide n2o and carbon dioxide co2 are two significant greenhouse gasses ghgs that contribute to global warming and the deterioration of the atmospheric environment the warming potential per molecule of n2o is 298 times that of co2 on a 100 year scale ipcc 2007 according to statistical results global n2o emissions from agriculture accounts for 60 of the total n2o caused by human activities it was estimated that by 2030 n2o emissions from agriculture would increase by 35 60 compared to 2005 if not controlled nakicenovic and swart 2000 cultivated land was the largest source of agricultural n2o emissions accounting for about 80 of agricultural n2o emissions mainly due to anthropogenic n input metz et al 2007 the annual n2o emissions from global vegetable production areas were 0 95 tg n2on accounting for 24 4 of total agricultural n2o emissions rashti et al 2015 the annual n2o emissions from vegetable systems open fields and greenhouse production in china was 3 91 kg n2on ha 1 which was 1 24 4 16 times higher than other crop systems while the n2o emissions of the greenhouse vegetable systems was 2 49 times higher than open field vegetable systems wang et al 2018 in recent years the focus of vegetable production has gradually shifted from vegetable yield to environmental impacts hochmuth 2003 some research suggested that the substituting chemical fertilizers with organic manure can significantly reduce n2o emissions b han et al 2017 han et al 2019 yang et al 2019 wang et al 2018 found that n2o emissions could be reduced by adjusting the chemical fertilizers rate and applying organic manure without reducing vegetable yield in addition some reports showed that organic farming reduced n2o emissions as compared to conventional farming skinner et al 2014 bhowmik et al 2016 the static box method is usually used to monitor ghg emissions from farmland this method is not only time consuming laborious and costly but also easily affected by many factors such as soil climate water and fertilizer management the results are very uncertain and cannot accurately capture the peak emissions therefore many studies used the soil crop atmosphere system models to simulate soil physical chemical and biological processes as well as crop growth but only a few models can be used to simulate the daily dynamics of n2o emissions for the crop growing season and fallow periods commonly used models for simulating n2o emissions include dndc li et al 1992 daycent parton et al 1994 ecosys grant et al 1993 fassat parton et al 1996 and wnmm li et al 2007 those models had been widely used to simulate n2o emissions under various field management practices irrigation fertilization tillage etc or different land use types agricultural fields forests grasslands and other plant types at the field or regional scales however n2o emissions from the nitrification process has been ignored by some models that were designed and used for field crops and currently few models can simulate ghg emissions for gvps due to the characteristics of high temperature humidity and intensive management in the gvps the vegetable growth and development process and the n2o gas emissions process are different from field crops recently liang et al 2018 combined the vegetable growth module of the eu rotate n model with the whcns model and constructed the water and n management model whcns veg soil water heat carbon nitrogen simulation for vegetable for gvps the whcns veg model can be used to simulate the water and n movement the c and n cycles and vegetable growth processes it has been used successfully to optimize the water and fertilizer management for gvps in north china liang et al 2018 2020 however the model does not currently simulate ghg emissions processes so it is not useful to determine optimum gvps management practices to reduce n2o emissions the objectives of this study were to 1 incorporate components of the daycent 4 5 model into the whcns veg model to provide simulations of n2o emissions 2 evaluate the accuracy of the improved model to simulate the n2o emissions process for gvps and 3 analyze the effects of different management systems on the n2o emissions and determine the optimal system to reduce n2o emissions for gvps 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area a long term experiment for vegetable growth has been conducted since march 2002 at the quzhou experimental station of china agricultural university the experiment site is located in the north of quzhou county 36 52 n 115 01 e elev 35 37 m hebei province china this area has a temperate and semi humid monsoon climate it has abundant

tidal cinnamon soil the basic surface soil chemical properties are shown in table 1 2 2 experiment design the experiment consisted of three vegetable production systems conventional con integrated int and organic org each system was carried out with three replicates in one semi round arch greenhouse 52 m in length and 7 m in width about 120 m2 for each replicate the same vegetable rotation irrigation and tillage schemes have been followed in all three systems since 2002 the experiment for this work was conducted from 2013 to 2015 with two growing seasons in one year the first season was from early october to early february named the autumn winter aw season and the second season was from late february to late september named the spring summer ss season cauliflower brassica oleracea l var botrytis l and celery apium graveolens l were transplanted into three systems at the same time in autumn of 2013 and 2014 respectively while eggplant solanum melongena l was transplanted in spring of 2014 and 2015 the org system was carried out according to the international federation of organic agriculture movements ifoam with chicken and cow manure derived compost and biological and physical methods for plant protection the con system followed the local style for greenhouse vegetable production by using chemical fertilizers urea superphosphate and potassium sulfate pesticides and dry chicken manure the int system combined 50 of chemical fertilizers with 50 of compost using biological methods for general plant protection and low toxic chemical pesticides all of the three management systems applied the base fertilizer to the surface soil and the fertilizer was mixed into the 0 20 cm depth by ploughing before transplanting topdressing was only applied in ss season fertilizer in the con and int systems was applied on 20 february and 19 october in 2014 respectively and ratios of base fertilizer and topdressing are 1 7 1 for con and 2 8 1 for int respectively there was only one application on 11 march in 2015 with a ratio of 2 8 1 for con and 5 7 1 for int flood irrigation was carried out according to the local farmer practices the vegetables were irrigated 3 11 4 and 10 times for cauliflower eggplant celery and eggplant growing seasons respectively the irrigation amount was about 100 mm for each application the fertilizer n input under different management systems is shown in table 2 2 3 sampling and analysis the soil profile was excavated to a depth of 1 0 m in the greenhouse on april 2013 and samples of soil textural layers were collected for analysis of the basic soil physical and chemical properties table 1 and table 3 the soil bulk density was determined by the cutting rings method the soil texture was measured by the pipette method the som was determined by the potassium dichromate wet combustion procedure total n was measured by the kjeldahl method available p was extracted with 0 5 mol l 1 nahco3 at a ph of 8 5 and measured using the molybdenum blue method available k was extracted with 1 mol l 1 nh4oac at a ph of 7 by using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer during the experimental period from october 2013 to september 2015 soil samples were collected 3 5 days after each irrigation at 20 cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm using a soil auger soil water content was measured by the oven drying method fresh soil samples were extracted with 2 mol l 1 kcl to determine the concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n by using a continuous flow analyzer aa3 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany nitrous oxide fluxes were sampled by the static chamber method wang et al 2003 gas samples were taken once a week in summer once every 2 weeks in other seasons and at the 1st 3rd 5th 7th and 9th day after fertilization and 2nd 4th 6th and 8th day after irrigation sampling was between 9 00 a m and 11 00 a m air samples from the chamber headspace were collected using gas bags and the n2o concentration was simultaneously analyzed with a modified gas chromatographic agilent 7890a soil temperature at the 0 5 cm layer was also measured by geo thermometers during gas collection the detailed information on n2o fluxes calculation can be found in h han et al 2017 at harvest plants collected from a 6 m2 sample area in each replication were used to measure the yields of vegetable plant samples were also obtained from each replication in each greenhouse and dried at 75 c to determine the aboveground biomass and plant n content lu 2000 an automatic weather station rr 9100 was installed in the con system greenhouse to record meteorological elements such as temperature relative humidity wind speed solar radiation 2 4 whcns veg model the whcns veg model was used to simulate soil water movement soil heat and n transport and crop growth the model integrates the key processes governing water movement and n and c cycles in the soil crop system these key processes include soil evaporation crop transpiration soil water movement soil runoff soil temperature mineralization of fresh crop residue and soil organic n son son immobilization in biomass nitrification ammonia volatilization denitrification crop growth and agricultural management practices sowing date planting density straw return crop rotation irrigation and fertilizer application etc in the model the potential evapotranspiration et is estimated using the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 and the richards equation are used to compute the soil water infiltration and redistribution processes respectively root water absorption is computed by using the van genuchten 1987 model with a compensatory root water uptake mechanism šimůnek and hopmans 2009 soil heat transport simulation was taken from the hydrus 1d model šimůnek et al 2008 the soil mineral n transport uses the convection diffusion equation and soil c and n cycling concepts were taken from the daisy model hansen et al 2012 vegetable growth and development dry matter accumulation fresh yield and vegetable n uptake were derived from the eu rotate n model greenwood 2001 rahn et al 2010 a detailed model description is available in literature liang et al 2018 the model inputs include site location latitude altitude basic soil physical chemical properties crop management information planting and harvest date planting density planting depth field management initial soil moisture content and mineral n content and daily meteorological data 2 5 model improvement in this study the whcns veg model was modified to improve the simulation of n2o emissions nitrous oxide emissions from the soil are calculated as a function of total n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification the daily time step nitrification and denitrification sub models were primarily derived from the daycent 4 5 model parton et al 1996 del grosso et al 2000 2001 the n2o n2o nit produced by the nitrification process was calculated by 1 n 2

willmott 1981 nash sutcliffe modeling efficiency e nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the index of agreement d were used to evaluate the model performance the three deviation statistics were calculated using the following equations 7 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 8 e 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 9 d 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where pi is the simulated value oi is the measured value o is the mean of the measured value n is the number of values the rmse describes the average absolute deviation between simulated and measured values the closer is the value of the rmse to 0 the more accurate is the model e ranges between and 1 an efficiency of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the simulated values and observed data e 0 indicates that the model predictions are the same as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency less than zero e 0 shows the model gave performance poor the d value represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and ranges from 0 to 1 the closer the value is to 1 the better the model performance willmott 1981 based on van liew and garbrecht 2003 an acceptable simulation should have e 0 36 and d 0 7 3 results 3 1 parameter sensitivity analysis the parameters used for testing the whcns veg model could be divided into three categories soil hydraulic parameters crop parameters and n transformation parameters the partial sensitivity analysis was used to observe the effect of input parameter changes on the model output by changing the input parameter values one by one while keeping the remaining parameters unchanged in this study each input parameter was changed by 10 and the variation of soil n2o emissions was observed fig 1 shows the percent change in n2o for 10 changes in each of the selected model input parameters soil hydraulic parameters had a bigger influence on n2o emissions than parameters related to n transformation and crop growth among the soil hydraulic parameters θwp θr θfc and ks had a larger impact on soil n2o emissions with a relative ranking of θwp θr θfc ks θs among them the wilting point had the highest impact on n2o emissions the parameter θs had the lowest impact on soil n2o emissions among the n transformation parameters the parameters related to nitrification and denitrification processes had a larger impact on n2o emissions the parameters rden ad and rnit had a larger impact on soil n2o emissions than other n transformation parameters crop parameters had little impact on soil n2o emissions the parameters tbase kini and kmid had a small influence on soil n2o emissions while other crop parameters a small effect on soil n2o emissions 3 2 model performance 3 2 1 soil water content and soil n concentration four vegetable crops were planted from october 2013 to september 2015 the model was first calibrated using the observed soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions for the con system and then the model was validated using the datasets from the int and org systems soil bulk density and particle fraction of the soil profile were derived from the measurements the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are shown in table 3 and the crop and n transformation parameters are shown in table 4 figs 2 and 3 show the comparison of the simulated and measured soil water content and nitrate concentration in the 0 20 cm soil layer under different management systems the simulated soil water content agreed well with the measured values for the con calibrated and int and org validation management systems the soil water content increased rapidly with irrigation and decreased with evapotranspiration et demand because of frequent irrigation the soil water content fluctuation was relatively large during the vegetable growing period but was small during the fallow period from january to february from september to october in 2014 and from february to march in 2015 due to lack of irrigation fig 2 there was no significant difference in soil water content under different management systems because the irrigation management was the same for all three management systems fig 3 shows the simulated surface soil nitrate concentrations agreed well with the measured values for the con calibrated int and org validation management systems the 0 20 cm soil nitrate concentrations varied sharply with a peak occurring after each fertilization event the peak values and duration of peaks were different due to the different kinds of n fertilizer used for the three systems the base fertilizer for con and int was chemical fertilizer where the n in the chemical fertilizer was easily released and leached with water flow therefore the nitrate in the con and int systems had a rapid peak followed by a rapid decline due to leaching the nitrate peak for con was the highest among the three management systems the organic manure was applied in the org system this source released nitrogen slowly under the action of microorganisms and it was not easily leached with water flow therefore the nitrate concentration peaks of the org system appeared relatively late and the duration of the peak lasted longer after fertilization the statistical indices in table 5 are the results of calibration and evaluation of soil water content and nitrate concentration the rmse values of soil nitrate concentration was less than 10 mg kg 1 while the rmse values of soil water content and n2o emissions were close to zero the ranges of e and d were 0 47 0 91 and 0 88 0 98 respectively according to the thresholds suggested by van liew and garbrecht 2003 an acceptable simulation should have a value of e 0 36 and d 0 70 the e values of water content and nitrate concentration were all greater than 0 36 and the d values were all greater than 0 70 these results indicated that the whcns veg model performed well in simulating the soil water content and nitrate concentration in this gvps under different management systems 3 2 2 n2o emissions the comparison of n2o emissions between the simulated and measured n2o emissions from the gvps under different management systems is shown in fig 4 the simulated n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values the fluctuation of n2o emissions was large in all management systems during the vegetable growing period due to the large fertilization rate and frequent irrigations the n2o emissions had an obvious peak after each irrigation and fertilization event and the whcns veg model captured the peak well the peak value of n2o was different among the three management systems because of different fertilizer types and rates the peak value for con and int was significantly higher than that of org during the calibration process the evaluation indices of n2o emissions showed that the rmse was 0 08 e value was 0 60 and the d value was 0 90 table 5 for the validation results the rmse was 0 06 e value was 0 49 and d value was 0 86 in general the simulated n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values fig 5 shows the comparison of the simulated and measured n2o emissions for the validated treatments int and org the r2 was 0 94 and the slope of linear regression was 0 92 which was close to 1 fig 6 shows the temporal dynamics of n2o emissions under different management systems the results indicated that the n2o emissions were closely related to soil water content and temperature the n2o emissions for the 2013 aw and 2014 aw seasons decreased with decreases in temperature in the 2014 ss and 2015 ss seasons the n2o emissions increased with increasing temperature among the four vegetable seasons the average n2o emissions were 6 4 kg n ha 1 for aw and 16 3 kg n ha 1 for the ss season which was 2 5 times higher than for the aw season the pearson correlation coefficient between n2o emissions and soil temperature was 0 17 p 0 01 n 740 indicating that n2o emissions were significantly positively correlated with soil temperature the soil n2o emissions were also closely related to irrigation and fertilizer applications the number of irrigations over the four seasons were 3 11 4 and 10 respectively after each irrigation there was an obvious n2o emissions peak the peak in the con system was the highest while it was the lowest for the org system in addition the n2o emissions were also affected by fertilizer application within a few days after fertilization the soil inorganic n concentration of three management systems increased fig 3 thereby increasing the soil n2o emissions the n2o emissions increased with the application of base fertilizer and topdressing as the nitrate concentration in the soil gradually decreased the n2o emissions also gradually decreased among the four season vegetables the 2014 ss season had the largest amounts of irrigation and fertilizer table 2 thus the n2o emissions were also the largest 3 3 the impact of different management systems on n2o emissions the soil n2o emissions are also related to the fertilizer type table 6 shows the order of n2o emissions was con org int the con system mainly applied chemical fertilizers and the n2o emissions were the highest except for 2015 ss the org system only used organic manure and its n2o emissions were the lowest among the four seasons compared with the con the n2o emissions for org system in the first three seasons decreased by 39 2 51 1 and increased by 128 0 in the last season the n2o emissions for int system decreased by 17 0 34 4 the n2o emissions for each season of con ranged from 7 4 to 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 1 2 2 4 of the total n input per season the n2o emissions for int was 5 0 18 9 kg n ha 1 accounting for 1 0 2 0 of total nitrogen applied while emissions for org was 4 5 18 7 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of applied nitrogen the n2o emissions in different seasons were different the average n2o emissions in aw was 6 4 kg n ha 1 while it was 16 3 kg n ha 1 in the ss season which was 2 5 times greater than the aw season the order of n2o emissions for 2013aw 2014ss and 2014aw season was con int org at the end of the 2015ss the n2o emissions of org were significantly higher than those of con and int considering no irrigation at the end of 2015ss the different surface soil properties of the three management systems maybe the reason for this table 1 the organic manure applied in con and int was far below that of the org system table 2 which led to the low soil water and fertilizer holding capacity resulting in the lower n2o emissions on the other hand the org system had high soil water and fertilizer holding capacity which results in higher n2o emissions fig 3 4 discussion 4 1 impact of soil water content and temperature on n2o emissions the n2o emissions results from the nitrification process under aerobic conditions and the denitrification process results from anaerobic conditions in the agricultural production process n2o emissions are related to soil temperature water content and the inorganic n concentration in the soil oertel et al 2016 soil water content is an important factor affecting soil gas emissions elder and lal 2008 showed that soil n2o emissions were positively correlated with soil water content increases in soil water content can increase n2o emissions produced by the denitrification process in an anaerobic environment giltrap et al 2010 many studies found that n2o emissions were related to wfps sehy et al 2003 pointed out that 60 wfps was the critical point for high n2o emissions ruser et al 2006 proposed that when wfps 70 it enhanced the denitrification process and increased the n2o emissions in our study the wfps was in the range of 29 4 86 6 and it was higher than 60 during most of the vegetable growth which likely caused soil n2o emissions at the same time the pearson correlation coefficients of wfps and n2o emissions of con int and org were 0 50 0 56 and 0 73 p 0 01 n 740 respectively indicating that wfps and n2o emissions were significantly positively correlation the results were consistent with previous studies sehy et al 2003 ruser et al 2006 in addition the frequent alternation of soil drying and wetting could stimulate n2o emissions the main reason is that some microorganisms die under drying condition which increases the active organic carbon source in the soil the oxygen promotes the nitrification process and provides a large amount of substrate for the denitrification process the denitrification process occurs when the soil becomes wet again and the n2o production is faster than the reduction process which leads to faster n2o emissions generally the n2o emissions caused by the alternate soil drying and wetting was higher than that of the continuous soil wetting ruser et al 2006 in this study the irrigation was frequent the vegetable crops were irrigated 3 11 4 and 10 times in the four seasons respectively the irrigation amount was large at 100 mm per event frequent dry wet alternation likely contributed to the soil n2o emissions the n2o emissions peaks obviously occurred after each irrigation fig 6 which was consistent with the reports by other scholars zhang et al 2018 irrigation accelerated the soil gas emissions by pressure and lead to a higher wfps 60 which created an anaerobic status which promoted the denitrification process russow et al 2000 b han et al 2017 reported that optimizing irrigation could reduce n2o emissions while ensuring yield the effects of soil temperature and water content on n2o emissions are often overlapping in the field and it is difficult to distinguish clearly through field observations fang and moncrieff 2001 groffman et al 2009 showed that temperature contributed about 50 of soil n2o emissions soil temperature was an important reason to explain the difference in soil gas emissions soil temperature could explain 86 variances of n2o emissions schindlbacher et al 2004 many studies found that increasing soil temperature could increase n2o emissions he et al 2009 yan et al 2014 klemedtsson et al 1987 showed that when the temperature was lower than 35 c the nitrification and denitrification processes were positively correlated with the temperature and the n2o emissions were positively correlated with the temperature at the same time the increase in soil temperature could promote the respiration of soil microorganisms consume a large amount of oxygen in the soil provide an anaerobic environment for the denitrification process and increase the n2o emissions butterbach bahl et al 2013 in this study the n2o emissions in gvps under different management systems showed a positive correlation with the soil temperature fig 6 during the four seasons the average temperature of the aw season was 13 1 c and the ss season was 22 6 c therefore the n2o emissions during the ss was greater than that of the aw these results were consistent with the previous research 4 2 the impact of different fertilizer types and rates on n2o emissions many studies have indicated that the application of chemical n fertilizers is the main source of n2o emissions from vegetable fields wang et al 2018 the global annual n2o released due to vegetable production was estimated as 9 5 107 kg n ha 1 of which 9 0 came from fertilizer applications rashti et al 2015 the effects of fertilization on soil n2o emissions were larger than that of soil water content and temperature niu et al 2010 peng et al 2011 in our study n2o emissions were highly correlated with fertilizer applications the pearson correlation coefficients of n2o emissions and soil nitrate concentration under different management systems were 0 28 con 0 29 int and 0 19 org p 0 01 n 740 indicating that the soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions were positively correlated wang et al 2018 conducted a meta analysis of china s vegetable production systems and found that n2o emissions had a positive linear correlation with fertilizer n application rates our results were consistent with previous studies due to the large amount of fertilization the annual n2o emissions from the gvps was 2 88 0 10 kg n ha 1 which was 1 68 2 38 times that of field crops rashti et al 2015 diao et al 2013 found that 64 6 84 5 of n2o released from vegetable fields was caused by n fertilizer yan et al 2014 showed that the n2o emissions peak occurred after fertilization and the magnitude and duration of the peaks were related to the fertilizer types and rates he et al 2009 showed that the annual n2o emissions were 2 6 8 8 kg n ha 1 when the n application rate of the gvps was 127 870 kg n ha 1 which accounted for 0 27 0 30 of the annual n input the default value of n2o emissions coefficient by ipcc 2007 was 1 this study found that the n2o emissions from vegetable fields was 4 6 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of the n fertilization and the n2o emissions coefficient were significantly higher than those of he et al 2009 and ipcc 2007 some scholars pointed out that reducing the fertilization rate could significantly reduce n2o emissions he et al 2009 demonstrated that when the traditional n application rate was reduced by 69 and 76 the n2o emissions were reduced by 51 and 27 respectively in order to reduce n2o emissions caused by agricultural activities fertilizer should be applied to meet the vegetable demand at different growing stages mcswiney and robertson 2005 yang et al 2019 found that the n application rate of 187 kg n ha 1 could balance vegetable yield and n2o emissions and the optimal n application rate for leafy vegetables was much lower than that for solanaceous vegetables huang et al 2017 showed that optimizing fertilization measures combining a 50 reduction in fertilizer with straw return maintained vegetable yield without reduction and reduced the n2o emissions by 18 37 zhang et al 2018 reported that the n2o emissions from the gvps was related to the large amount of n fertilizer application and frequent flood irrigation compared with the farmer practices the optimized fertilization could reduce the n2o emissions by 38 1 48 8 in this study the vegetable planted in 2014ss and 2015ss were eggplant compared with the 2014ss the fertilization rates of con and int in 2015ss decreased by 44 9 and 38 4 respectively as a result their n2o emissions in 2015ss was reduced by 71 5 and 69 8 respectively reducing the n fertilizer rate could significantly reduce n2o emissions our results were consistent with the previous studies some studies have shown that the application of organic manure can supply a sufficient carbon source for soil microorganisms increase soil microbial activity fix more n and reduce n2o emissions vallejo et al 2006 sanchez martin et al 2010 porter et al 2017 showed that under the condition of a low c n level in the soil excessive applications of organic manure could increase n2o emissions but at low levels of application organic manure could inhibit n2o emissions wang et al 2018 explored n2o emissions in china s vegetable production system through meta analysis and showed that n2o emissions could be reduced by adjusting the chemical fertilizers rate and applying organic manure without reducing vegetable yield in this study the con system mainly used urea and gave the highest n2o emissions with an average emissions of 13 5 kg n ha 1 per season the int system used a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer and had an average emissions of 9 3 kg n ha 1 per season the org system only used organic manure and the average n2o emissions per season were 11 3 kg n ha 1 it showed that replacing part of chemical fertilizers with organic manure could reduce n2o emissions which was consistent with previous studies in addition some measures such as straw mulching the application of controlled release fertilizers and the addition of nitrification inhibitors can also reduce n2o emissions shoji et al 2001 huang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 4 3 evaluation of the improved whcns veg model and its limitations in this study the improved whcn veg model was used to simulate and analyze soil water content nitrate concentration and n2o emissions of the gvps in the ncp from 2013 to 2015 the whcns veg divided the n2o production into nitrification and denitrification processes and considered the impact of meteorological conditions soil properties and water and fertilizer management practices on soil n2o emissions the simulated soil water content nitrate concentration and n2o emissions agreed well with the measured values at the same time this study also had certain limitations firstly due to the lack of measured soil ammonia concentration in this study the soil ammonia concentration could not be verified resulting in the inability to analyze the impact of soil ammonia on n2o emissions in detail secondly only two years data were used to validate the whcns veg in this study as a long term positioning experiment the more measured data are required to validate the model the more reliable results should be obtained in addition the management practices of different nitrogen management systems in this experiment also need to be improved for instance by reducing excessive irrigation and fertilization which should be optimized in future studies finally this study did not compare whcns veg with other models which can also simulate the n2o emissions process comparing and evaluating the different model performance on n2o emissions from gvps is very important in the future the model needs to be verified and evaluated for many years with multiple vegetables 5 conclusions in this study the whcns veg model was improved to simulate the n2o emissions process which mainly considered soil n2o emissions from nitrification and denitrification the improved model was calibrated and validated under different vegetable production systems the sensitive analysis results showed that the effects of soil hydraulic parameters on n2o emissions were higher than those of n transformation and vegetable genetic parameters the improved whcns veg model simulated soil water content soil nitrate concentration and n2o emissions under different gvps in north china very well n2o emissions is a major component of n loss in greenhouse vegetable production in north china from 2013 to 2015 the annual n2o emissions from the gvps in the study area were 4 6 28 8 kg n ha 1 accounting for 0 6 2 9 of the total n input the n2o emissions had a close relationship with soil water content and soil temperature due to frequent irrigation and high temperature the average n2o emissions in spring and summer seasons was 2 5 times of that in the autumn and winter seasons in addition n2o emissions were also closely related to the types and rates of fertilization among the three management systems the con had the highest n2o emissions due to the use of synthetic chemical fertilizer compared with the con the n2o emissions of int and org were reduced by 31 1 and 16 3 respectively the results indicated that the improved whcns veg model has great potential to simulate and analyze n2o emissions under different management systems and substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer can effectively reduce the n2o emissions in the gvps credit authorship contribution statement hongyuan zhang writing original draft methodology

24412,riverine ecosystems provide various ecosystem services one of these services is the biological control of eutrophication by grazing macroinvertebrates however riverine ecosystems are subject to numerous stressors that affect community structure functions and stability properties to manage rivers in response to these stressors a better understanding of the ecological functions underlying services is needed this requires consideration of local and regional processes which requires a metacommunity approach that links local food webs through drift and dispersal this takes into account long distance interactions that can compensate for local effects of stressors our modular model mastiff multiple aquatic stressors in flowing food webs is stage structured spatially explicit and includes coupled food webs consisting of benthic resource consumer interactions between biofilm and three competing macroinvertebrate functional types river segments are unidirectionally connected through organismal drift and bidirectionally connected through dispersal climate and land use stressors along the river can be accounted for biocontrol of biofilm eutrophication is used as an exemplary functional indicator we present the model and the underlying considerations and show in an exemplary application that explicit consideration of drift and dispersal is essential for understanding the spatiotemporal biocontrol of eutrophication the combination of drift and dispersal reduced eutrophication events while dispersal events were linked to specific periods in the species life cycles and therefore had limited potential to control drift was ubiquitous and thus responded more readily to changing habitat conditions this indicates that drift is an important factor for coping with stress situations finally we outline and discuss the potential and possibilities of mastiff as a tool for mechanistic cross scale analyses of multiple stressors to advance knowledge of riverine ecosystem functioning keywords modeling riverine ecosystems drift and dispersal multiple stressors functioning biocontrol of eutrophication 1 introduction the sustainable development goals sdgs formulated by the united nations un 2015 underpin the urgency of harmonizing societal development with the maintenance of natural life support systems especially in a changing world riverine ecosystems play an important role in this context as they are the source of various ecosystem services which are prerequisites for human well being and development mea 2005 they are crucial for securing food provisioning services for enabling recreation cultural services but also for purifying water cycling nutrients attenuating pollutants or regulating the climate regulating services such services are at risk however as riverine ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors such as harmful chemicals from land use barriers from water infrastructures reducing connectivity biological invasions or climate change stressors can influence the riverine ecosystem via the alteration of habitat conditions and availability the network structure and species abundance in food webs and the traits of individual organism furthermore the interaction between multiple stressors can be manifold neutral antagonistic or synergistic with combined effects which can propagate across different levels of organization organisms populations communities ecosystems piggott et al 2015 moreover trophic interactions and dispersal can modify multiple stressor effects bruder et al 2019 and thus form another layer of complexity other challenges in connection with multiple stressors in riverine ecosystems concern timing and scaling issues de vries et al 2020 mechanistic understanding of how bundles of such stressors interact and jointly affect the structure functions and stability properties of riverine ecosystems is thus critical for the planning of sustainable management of ecosystems effects of multiple stressors and their interactions are notoriously difficult to disentangle and predict from empirical data galic et al 2018 mechanistic models should thus complement field studies but have to fulfill a number of requirements to become useful according to loreau 2010 sound mechanistic understanding of the functioning of ecosystems can only be gained if all organismic aspects such as individual traits or ecological interactions are adequately linked to matter and energy fluxes serving as resources or stressors this is challenging but recent ecological models are increasingly meeting this demand grimm and berger 2016 grimm et al 2017 for this processes on higher organizational levels are considered as outcomes which emerge from the individual level the individuals traits interactions and responses to new site conditions are described with tested standardized submodels based on general physiological principles the resulting models are generic in the sense that they can be applied to a new situation by appropriate parameterization but without the need to develop a completely new model from the scratch one prominent next generation ecological model for the exploration of multiple stressor effects on food webs in rivers is streambugs 1 0 schuwirth and reichert 2013 schuwirth et al 2016 it addresses food webs consisting of invertebrates periphyton and particulate organic matter pom growth respiration and death rates are parameterized using generic allometric relationships derived from the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 they are affected by various site conditions light temperature and the concentrations of oxygen nutrients and pom even without calibration differences between the predicted and observed food web structures were less than 50 and could be further reduced with calibration at 36 sites in a catchment in switzerland schuwirth and reichert 2013 streambugs is rooted in ecological theory can be applied to a wide range of environmental conditions and stressor combinations and is thus powerful still it focusses on compositional effects of multiple stressors on riverine food webs mechanistic models for exploring how stressor effects alter essential ecological functions in streams are widely missing so far gray et al 2015 show a way of considering the different categories of riverine ecosystem services and linking them to specific parts of the underlying food web they highlight that especially all regulating riverine ecosystem services are provided by the first two levels of the green food web i e the benthic biofilm as the primary producer and the community of grazing macroinvertebrates one important example for a regulating riverine ecosystem service is the biocontrol of eutrophication provided by the macroinvertebrates when grazing the biofilm besides benthic filter feeders controlling plankton macroinvertebrates however are mobile in specific stages of their life cycle flying imagines actively disperse to distribute eggs while larvae start passively drifting with the water flow to escape unsuitable habitat conditions this creates a colonization cycle in which the directional downstream drift of larvae is compensated by the upstream dispersal of imagines müller 1982 moving macroinvertebrates link local food webs induce long distance interactions reallocate the grazing pressure and thus their biocontrol service but also transport or compensate effects from stressors on the riverine ecosystem hence sound understanding of the functional effects of multiple stressors on regulating riverine ecosystem services can only be gained if both local factors esp stressors site conditions trophic interactions in the food webs and regional processes esp organismal drift and dispersal water and matter flows are adequately taken into account despite their specific potentials currently available models have limitations regarding the linkage of local to regional processes de vries et al 2020 one way to overcome this drawback is considering riverine ecosystems as metacommunities i e networks of local communities which are coupled by organismal drift and dispersal this concept was specifically introduced by leibold et al 2004 for enabling the required cross scale linking in the riverine context the concept has been applied for predicting biodiversity patterns in dendritic river networks and for explaining the relative influence of drift dispersal connectivity and the local site conditions on the findings e g altermatt 2013 heino et al 2015 borthagaray et al 2015 in connection with analyses of stressor effects on ecosystems however metacommunity approaches have not been used so far this is in line with the observation that there are only few examples where the metacommunity concept was applied for tackling problems of conservation management or restoration chase et al 2020 we therefore developed the stage structured and spatially explicit model mastiff multiple aquatic stressors in flowing food webs the purpose of which is the facilitation of cross scale analyses of effects of multiple stressors on the functioning of riverine ecosystems the model follows a metacommunity approach it accounts for cross scale resource consumer interactions between the benthic biofilm and the three competing functional types of macroinvertebrate grazers limpet mayfly and chironomid which are based on the taxa ancylus fluviatilis heptageniidae and chironomidae its processes incorporate the grazers life cycle resource use growth and movement modes drift and dispersal and the biofilm s growth depending on nutrients light and biofilm consumption by grazers the model is stylized but structurally realistic as it considers a river as a channel consisting of river segments which harbor a local food web the segments are coupled through water and matter flows as well as moving grazers and are surrounded by a specific land use type riparian forest urban or agriculture which comes along with characteristic bundles of stressors influencing the site conditions in a specific way the model is generic as all process rates are described with submodels which are based on physiological principles the aim of this article is to present mastiff the requirements underlying its design structure and a first application to demonstrate its potential specifically biocontrol of eutrophication is taken as an example for a regulating riverine ecosystem service to be preserved mastiff is used for exploring i how important drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers are for the biofilm control the resulting pattern of riverine eutrophication and the performance of the biocontrol and ii how different dispersal kernels of the involved grazers are influencing the findings these investigations are performed for a hypothetical river with a sequence of neighboring habitat and land use types which is specific but typical for middle european small rivers in the application we accounted for two typical land use induced stressors in river catchments which both weaken the limitation of biofilm growth oversupply with nutrients in segments downstream from the first appearance of urban or agricultural land use along the river course and missing shading in segments with clear cutting of the riparian forest such a systematic exploration of the functional implications of drift and dispersal with simulations has not been done before but is key for understanding cross scale effects of specific stressor scenarios on the performance of biocontrol planned to be addressed in follow up work additionally we give an overview on scenarios and questions for which mastiff can be used in the future taking various kinds of stressors into account we close with synthesizing remarks on the potential of taking a metacommunity approach for advancing understanding of riverine ecosystem services their response to multiple stressors and buffering effects for functional resilience this includes implications of mastiff from a broader perspective specifically the potential for understanding the aquatic terrestrial coupling and for ecosystem assessments used in international initiatives aiming at the development of ways to fulfill the sdgs 2 methods 2 1 requirements underlying the design structure of the mastiff model to facilitate mechanistic understanding mastiff ought to be designed in a way that it is a stylized but structurally realistic representation of small rivers in middle european low mountain regions with natural or semi natural conditions at the upper reaches and increasing anthropogenic stress due to land use in agricultural and urban areas down the river being stylized means simplified for tractability to enable a use of mastiff as a virtual laboratory schlüter et al 2019 to systematically explore the consequences of a wide range of stressor scenarios and environmental gradients typical for such rivers to provide insights into key cross scale mechanisms our focus on cross scale dynamics requires that the model is spatially explicit i e represents an entire river following the stylized but structurally realistic approach rivers ought to be described as channels consisting of a sequence of river segments with characteristic environmental site conditions which are influenced by stressor effects from the land use in the surrounding catchment in less than 100 m distance to the river each river segment ought to contain a food web with competing macroinvertebrates feeding on the benthic biofilm the functional perspective of mastiff allows focusing on only three functional types of macroinvertebrate grazer species limpet mayfly and chironomid the segments ought to be linked through drifting and dispersing macroinvertebrates which then form a metacommunity for the entire river to keep the model tractable hydraulics need not to be represented explicitly instead it ought to be represented implicitly via their effects on nutrient exposure organismal drift and possible biofilm abrasion in order to get a mechanistically sound but generic description of the effect of multiple stressors demographic process rates such as biofilm growth and grazers feed demand ought to be broken down to basic physiological principles and formulated as functions on limiting environmental factors mastiff ought to be designed in a way that is can be applied to both rivers with hypothetical land use profiles and the land use profile of specific rivers as input to enable testable assessments of the composition of the local food webs and of eutrophication patterns furthermore mastiff has to consider that stressor occurrence is usually not constant but varying within and between years since the different macroinvertebrate grazer types emerge at specific times and their life stages differ in their sensitivities to stressors it is important to take life cycles into account mastiff ought to be thus stage structured instead of considering lump biomasses 2 2 summary description of the mastiff model a complete detailed model description following the odd overview design concept details protocol grimm et al 2006 2020 is provided in supplementary material and in the gitlab repository https git ufz de oesa mastiff moreover the model is open source and its executable program and source code are available from the mentioned repository the overall purpose of the model is a cross scale mechanistic understanding of how organismal drift and dispersal of macroinvertebrate grazers modify the impact of multiple stressors on the functioning of riverine ecosystems a specific functional focus in this paper is on the grazer mediated top down control of the benthic biofilm and thus eutrophication as exemplary regulating ecosystem service of particular importance mastiff is a spatially explicit model that considers the structure dynamics and functions of the aquatic ecosystem in a channel like river mastiff particularly aims to provide insights that help understanding and counteracting effects of bundles of multiple stressors on the functioning of the food webs in different river segments or the entire river for this we need a better mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay of local and regional processes for this we followed a metacommunity approach by explicitly accounting for organismal drift and dispersal this allows considering the entire metacommunity in the river instead of the local communities and food webs in isolation this enables addressing questions such as what is the relative importance of passive drift of the larvae and active dispersal of the aerial adults for the structure dynamics functions and stability properties of the riverine ecosystem and how much do the findings depend on the dispersal kernels assumed for the species involved what are the consequences for the state of the benthic biofilm covering the individual river segments what are the implications for the control of the biofilm and thus of eutrophication mediated by the macroinvertebrate grazers and what for the ecosystem functions mediated by the green part of the biofilm to consider our model realistic enough for its purpose we included patterns in grazer abundance and biofilm growth as observed in streams of the harz mountains germany wild r unpubl results the longitudinal development of land use and water temperature were adopted from a study at the holtemme river weitere et al 2021 a 3rd order river in harz mountains empirical data were provided by the federal environmental authority corine land cover program clc 2018 by the european environment agency kristensen et al 2018 and the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 the model includes the entities segments and species segments are 100 m long sections of the river and are characterized by the following state variables segment number land use type maximal shading water temperature nutrient limitation biofilm biomass biofilm condition abundance of each functional species and the number of the neighboring downstream segment the entity species is characterized by its functional type abundance of each life stage hatching month month turning into a fertile organism month of oviposition month of death as well as the body mass in larval stage mortality rate and maximal ingestion rate the spatial and temporal resolution and extent are weekly time steps and a segment length of 100 meter a monthly resolution is chosen to implement the characteristics of life cycles of each species such as dispersal and hatching for instance with 479 segments the whole holtemme river with a total length of 47 9 km will be simulated we assumed that one month consist out of 4 weeks hence one year is 48 weeks long simulations are typically run for 20 years which corresponds to 960 weeks the processes of the model which are repeated every time step are biofilm processes growth abrasion grazer processes change in the life stage mortality grazing growth organismal drift and dispersal settlement and emergence of eutrophication fig 1 the model follows a metacommunity approach thus the most important design concepts of the model are the basic principles governing drift and settlement of the macroinvertebrate grazers both are regulated by the forage biofilm biomass available and accessible in a segment and the dispersal of active aerial adult insect species by the mean of specific dispersal kernels furthermore the definition of eutrophication in a river segment that is a system state of particular interest in this paper considers a certain threshold of the local biofilm biomass where grazers cannot settle feed on and hence control the biofilm anymore fig 2 the key model output or observation can be any state variable of interest e g biofilm biomass abundance of grazers species strength of induced drift events or on a higher organizational level the eutrophication patterns along the river depending on different model settings the mentioned key processes strongly depend on the specific environmental conditions in the individual river segments fig 1 solar radiation air temperature water temperature and shading are subject to seasonal fluctuations which are incorporated via characteristic equations a spatial differentiation into segments allows us to represent 1 a water temperature profile and 2 a land use profile with several land use types that differ for example in shading and nutrient limitation in each river segment the biofilm biomass develops according to a standard growth equation which depends on limiting factors such as local light conditions nutrients and grazing pressure the biofilm biomass provides forage for the grazers the total biofilm biomass consists of three spatial compartments with different potentials for eutrophication one important compartment is the so called micro niche which offers forage but can never be eutrophic this spatial heterogeneity within a segment prevents the complete loss of grazers and allows recolonization after the other compartments return from eutrophic period above a certain threshold β 0 of biofilm biomass grazers cannot attach to the ground anymore and therefore are not able to feed on and control the biofilm we define this state transition as eutrophication fig 2 when the biofilm biomass has reached a second threshold β 1 the biofilm biomass can rip off caused by indirect hydraulic stress after this the biofilm in the segment can regrow and be recolonized by grazers again the β 1 threshold increases downstream having in mind the decreasing slope and thus hydraulic pressure along the river a second type of eutrophication is the outbreak of filamentous algae the probability of a filamentous event increases with the existing biofilm biomass in our application in this paper the maximal probability is set to zero for simplification as a consequence of insufficient forage in a river segment cause by e g eutrophication grazers respond depending on their life cycle they leave the segment enter the water column and start drifting downstream besides eutrophication a too large number of grazers could also be a reason for drift the forage is split between functional types referring to their abundance in the segment and their species specific demand the feed demand depends on body mass and water temperature which varies over time and is calculated using a standard equation from physiology that is rooted in the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 the relation m r m γ describes how metabolic rates mr scale with the body mass of the individual m e g brose 2010 johnston et al 2014 furthermore metabolic rates strongly depend on water temperature represented by the exponential arrhenius function e g gillooly et al 2001 johnston et al 2014 in the grazing process the inhabiting grazers are saturated at first the leftovers are offered to the immigrating grazers coming from upstream and trying to settle each functional type of grazer species has its own specific life cycle and mortality hatching from egg to grazing larvae or organisms the development time to a fertile adult or imagines and following oviposition a maximal life span different mortality rates due to natural or drift processes the functional type limpet represents a local species that is hardly affected by drift and thus always deposits its eggs in the same segment ancylus fluviatilis has a hololimnic life cycle and can graze on biofilm after oviposition the remaining functional types mayfly and chironomid have the ability to drift in order to find a suitable habitat but leave the water for emergence besides drift dispersal upstream and downstream of imagines mayfly and chironomid is another distribution process to reach neighboring and distant segments a species specific dispersal kernel defines the probability of a dispersing imago to land in a segment this rule is in line with muehlbauer et al 2014 who underpinned that the majority of riverine macroinvertebrates disperses along the river course and only a small percentage in dispersing overland the modular structure of the model allows to couple various spatio temporal stressors and test them individually or in combination in scenarios thereby stressors can affect environmental parameters e g mean air temperature shading nutrient limitation or species traits e g mortality 2 3 calibration and model output verification calibration aimed at 1 coexistence of the species considered 2 realistic yearly mean population abundances and 3 realistic qualitative species distribution pattern extended exploratory manual sensitivity analyses and calibration efforts data not shown identified seven most sensitive parameters that were used for calibration natural mortality mortalityratei and number of offspring offspringi for each of the three functional species and the scaling factor δ w which lowers mortality in winter when organisms usually hide and predation is low table 1 since in this model version predators are not represented explicitly we took predator induced mortality into account via natural or background mortality furthermore the number of offspring offspringi refers to recruitment of larvae and thus takes egg mortality into account implicitly as well as imagines mortality in aerial stage e g by predators living on land the model was run for all possible combinations of these seven parameters as specified in table 1 the initial conditions were b b 0 1800 for biofilm biomass abundance of limpets ancylus fluviatilis of 60 000 individuals per segment mayflies heptageniidae abundance of 30 000 individuals per segment 600 000 individuals per segment for chironomids chironomidae and the land use profile according to the river holtemme since the model is deterministic we needed only one run for each parameter combination the empirical abundance and distribution patterns for matching were extracted from field studies of headwater streams in the harz mountains i e wormsgraben forested and getel agriculture wild r unpubl results this includes the mean yearly abundance of each species and missing of the mayfly in agricultural landscapes

mayflies scenarios with a decreasing abundance of mayfly form up to downstream by choosing three segments 20 250 400 and comparing their mean abundance 4 coexistence of species after 40 years for calibration of water temperature over time and along the river environmental factors to be considered in principle are solar radiation humidity cloud cover and wind speed sinokrot and stefan 1993 but since such data were not available we used air temperature of the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 as a proxy the monthly mean air temperature of 2008 2016 is used for calibration we also accounted for the effects of shading which is determined by the land use profile we developed a spatial function based on incoming water tx 1 t in the segment x shading along the river and the difference between water and air temperature t x w t t x 1 w t l p h d 1 s h a d i n g λ x t t a i r t x t x 1 w t with t describing a certain time step and x a certain

temperature for the first segment water source shows certain seasonality and is therefore described in a time dependent way to reach a better result t 0 t s initial conditions and further simulation settings are listed in table 2 in order to calibrate the submodel water temperature the parameter was fitted specifically on empirical data for the holtemme river profile we used water temperature data at nine different sampling point positions along the holtemme river from 2011 to 2016 of the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 table 2 the sampling points were mapped to corresponding segments the shading values λ x were adapted to the holtemme profile for each month and segment after the aggregation of values per segment and month we needed an equation for each month with their starting value of t s for the first segment the aim is the fit one value which applies to all months we used a cost function with not weighted residuals and an optimization function e g nelder mead calibration was done using the r package fme rstudio team 2018 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 2 4 model output corroboration for validation with data that were not used for model design or calibration we used biofilm data of forested and agricultural headwater streams in the harz mountains wild r unpubl results biofilm biomass production was estimated monthly from 2012 to 2013 using tiles which were placed in the streams after one month of exposure biofilm was scraped off the tile dried weighed and production was estimated as mg dw mo 1 wild r unpubl results 2 5 simulation experiments the aim of the exemplary simulation experiments in this paper was to explore the relevance of drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers for the mediated biocontrol of eutrophication the performance of this important regulating ecosystem service was determined by comparing the spatiotemporal eutrophication patterns for a scenario without grazers as reference with a scenario with grazers to assess the relative importance of drift and dispersal we varied the assumptions on both the drift mortality to enable a without vs with drift comparison and the dispersal kernels a dispersal kernel is defined by the frequency distribution of upstream and downstream distances of the dispersal of active aerial adults see supp odd s24 fig 14 four dispersal scenarios were compared in the first scenario local dispersal was assumed in which the imagines of mayfly and chironomid lay their eggs in the same segment in which they emerged b1 1 b1 2 in the second and third scenario the dispersal kernel followed a narrow slim b2 1 b2 2 or broad normal distribution wide b3 1 b3 2 respectively table 3 supp fig s2 in the fourth dispersal scenario realistic species specific dispersal kernels were considered a skewed distribution for mayflies and a narrow normal distribution for chironomids using parameters derived from the literature b4 1 b4 2 as exemplary stressor bundles we focused on oversupply with nutrients and missing shading which are characteristic for river reaches with urban or agricultural land use which at the same time lack riparian forests and spatially composed them according to the land use profile along the river of interest in this study we took the holtemme river as case study here there was one river segment with nutrient inflow such that the biofilms in all downstream segments were not nutrient limited anymore for the evaluation the emerging eutrophication patterns were visualized as indicated in fig 2 each segment was marked depending on whether or not eutrophication occurred the resulting spatial patterns for each month were stacked to provide a spatio temporal overview 3 results 3 1 reproduction of empirical patterns calibration and corroboration the seven calibrated parameters are included in supplement table s1 with the calibrated model the mean yearly abundances for the considered functional types of macroinvertebrate grazer species limpet and chironomid match quantitatively with the respective empirical data extracted from field fig 3 additionally the relative ranking among the three functional types known from field is reproduced the model shows mean yearly abundances for limpet mayfly and chironomid functional types of 24 113 and 427 individuals per m² after 20 years of simulation respectively additionally we found characteristic longitudinal patterns for the mean yearly abundances for mayfly and chironomid in the simulation outcome for the study river holtemme cf supp fig s1 for the simulated mayfly we found a high abundance in the forested upper segments which is gradually decreasing when passing the downstream segments with their neighboring urban or agricultural land use for the simulated chironomid the pattern was opposite low abundance in the forested segment constantly high abundance in the land use affected segments these land use dependent abundance patterns are in line with empirical observations e g berenzen et al 2005 berger et al 2017 the mean water temperature per month at the nine sampling points along the holtemme river and the best result for the parameter by calibration are shown in fig 4 best calibration of submodel water temperature is achieved by 0 004 the equation used is thus sufficient to fit our need to represent water temperature in order to validate the model output we used biofilm accrual data of tributaries of holtemme and bode in year 2012 and 2013 these empirical data show an intensified growth of biofilm in july and october november in sampling points where agricultural land use prevailed fig 5 a this matches the simulated biofilm biomass increase for river segments with agricultural land use which peak in june july and october november fig 5b the observed small amount of biofilm accrual in river segments with riparian forests can also be detected in simulated biofilm data compared to catchments with predominantly agricultural land use empirical and simulated which show a higher amount of biofilm accrual 3 2 application study relevance of drift and dispersal for eutrophication and its biocontrol in order to determine the performance of the grazer mediated control of eutrophication and to analyze its dependence on the grazers drift the eutrophication patterns three scenarios were compared 1 a scenario completely without grazers a1 2 a scenario with grazers but without drift a2 and 3 a scenario with grazers and with drift a3 each over 20 years land use profile of the holtemme river fig 6 for the second and third scenario the dispersal kernels were set to the realistic species specific kernels the eutrophication pattern of the first scenario a1 without grazers shows one long eutrophic phase in autumn in the forest region segments dominated by urban and agricultural land use in contrast show two eutrophic phases a first one in may june and a second one in august september fig 6 a1 the pattern is consistent between the years supp fig s3 when grazers are present but do not drift a2 eutrophication disappears in forested segments furthermore in this scenario the two eutrophic phases present in the scenario without grazers a1 shift and merge to one eutrophic period of the same duration of two to three weeks in july august e g segments 80 to 130 and 260 to 350 fig 6 a2 the eutrophication patterns in the third scenario with grazers and drift a3 do not change after eight years and could be defined as the final equilibrium state fig 6 a3 supp fig s3 only one eutrophic period appears in july for two weeks from segment 80 downstream till segment 300 and three weeks from there on downstream in summary the comparison of the scenarios reveals that with grazers in the riverine ecosystem the eutrophication pattern is altered in different respects depending on the land use in the river segments the phases of eutrophication are completely removed or shifted and merged while the total duration is reduced this is a sign of substantial biocontrol that is further enhanced in face of drift the dispersal by imagines is besides drift the second process for grazers to reach other segments with implications for the biocontrol in order to disaggregate the effect of dispersal from drift eight scenarios with various dispersal kernels and turned on and off drift indicate the importance of dispersal and drift fig 7 fig 8 the scenarios without drift show a transition from mainly two eutrophic phases per year for local dispersal b1 1 via one to two eutrophic phases per year for slim dispersal b2 1 to only one eutrophication phase for a wide dispersal b3 1 the species specific dispersal b4 1 resembles slim dispersal b2 1 the scenarios without drift thus reveal that the eutrophication patterns strongly depend on the assumed dispersal kernels the broader the dispersal kernel the wider the exchange of grazers and hence the more is eutrophication prevented fig 7 in scenarios with drift fig 8 the eutrophication patterns do not differ much between the various dispersal kernels as long as there is some dispersal by active aerial adults linking the food webs in the river segments the pattern of one eutrophic phase in july is obtained even in face of local dispersal b1 2 much less eutrophication occurs in comparison to the scenario without drift b1 1 the broader the kernel is the faster the stable state is reached supp fig s5 b2 2 b3 2 in general as long as some dispersal is possible the drift is able to stabilize the pattern and reduce eutrophication effectively last but not least with drift a narrow dispersal kernel b2 2 leads to a similar eutrophication pattern as a wide dispersal kernel without drift b3 1 4 discussion 4 1 reproduction of empirical patterns our model calibration on the basis of both the abundance of selected functional types of macroinvertebrate grazers and the water temperature led to a good match between observations and model output for the holtemme river as test case the observations used for model corroboration were not used during model construction or for parameterization the presented model mastiff reproduced these observations well this indicates that despite the stylized character of mastiff the complex network of interactions has been captured sufficiently well to allow inference about mechanisms in the riverine ecosystem considered grimm and railsback 2012 this is an implication of the modeling strategy underlying mastiff namely the description of all demographic processes with tested mechanistically sound submodels which are based on generic physiological principles this strategy of next generation ecological modeling grimm and berger 2016 grimm et al 2017 has already stand the test in streambugs schuwirth et al 2013 in mastiff the strategy is extended to regional processes still the comparability between empirical and simulated data was limited empirical data corresponded to the growth of the biofilm scraped a tile after one month of exposure whereas the simulated data referred to the biofilm growth based on the biofilm on the preceding time step nevertheless the model captured the month with intensified growth well and these model results were not directly imposed anywhere but emerged from the model s interactions and processes mastiff focuses on the analysis of regulating ecosystem services such as biocontrol of eutrophication which are according to gray et al 2015 primarily provided by the first two trophic levels of the riverine food web this justifies the simplified description of the food web in mastiff i e the restriction to the green phototrophic part of the benthic biofilm as primary producer which is limited by factors such as light nutrients and grazing and grazing macroinvertebrates as consumers of the biofilm evident top down control of the macroinvertebrates from higher trophic levels such as predators is not explicitly taken into account instead it is implicitly considered by species specific mortalities of the macroinvertebrate grazers as proxy for prey preferences of the predator species these differences in the mortality can counterbalance differences in the competitive power of the grazer species as pre requisite for their coexistence due to its modular character mastiff could be expanded by an explicit implementation of predators in a later stage 4 2 relevance of drift and dispersal mastiff was specifically designed to explore the relevance of drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers for the performance of regulating riverine ecosystem service such as the biocontrol of eutrophication used as demonstrating example in this study for this we compared the eutrophication patterns emerging under scenarios without and with grazers and different assumptions on drift and dispersal for the sample river our simulation results indicated that eutrophication events occurred only in specific phases their number duration and timing were found to be strongly dependent on the presence or absence of grazers the assumptions on drift and dispersal but also on the land use type in the river segments even in the scenario without grazers there were only two eutrophication phases which were fully determined by the biofilm growth and the exceeding of the two threshold values β 0 and β 1 the duration of the eutrophication phase corresponded to the time span which the biofilm biomass needed for growing from β 0 to β 1 this also explains why the duration of eutrophication was longer in the forested area than in the other segments in the grazer free case but also in the case with grazers we have seen that eutrophication can occur depending on the land use type grazers reduce the biofilm biomass this suppressed eutrophication in the spring while eutrophication could not be prevented in july this is exactly the time when neither chironomids nor mayflies were present in the river because of their life cycles only limpets where present which were not able to control the biofilm a second eutrophication period did not develop due to the grazing pressure and was finally prevented by the winter break this shows that explicitly considering the life cycles of the grazer functional types is essential for understanding the ecosystem service biocontrol of eutrophication massol et al 2017 neutral models which ignore differences between the species would reach too short in a functional context this is also in line with findings that metacommunity assemblage in lower order rivers is controlled by species sorting and environmental filtering borthagaray et al 2015 our model results for the scenarios with grazers but without drift fig 7 also revealed that the test river can be subdivided in three zones with distinct eutrophication patterns i in all forested river segments eutrophication was prevented regardless of the assumed dispersal kernels here the local grazers were already capable to control the biofilm with its slow growth rate due to shading ii in the upstream part of the anthropogenically impacted zone eutrophication patterns were similar to those without grazers two eutrophication phases cf fig 6 a2 because of the low water temperature in this part the feed demand of the grazers grew slower than the biofilm biomass therefore eutrophication was indispensable in the respective segments that also caused loss of individuals thus only larvae from the assumed micro niches in these segments were able complete their development to the adult state become imagines and oviposit eggs in face of local or slim dispersal the low number of newly arriving larvae was insufficient to control the biofilm iii in the downstream part of the anthropogenically impacted zone eutrophication was reduced here the water temperature was higher such that the grazers feed demand grew faster than the biofilm biomass in the result the grazers could control the biofilm throughout the spring and a substantial number of imagines could emerge from these segments this shows that environmental gradients as in the water temperature can influence the performance of the grazers and the biocontrol of eutrophication we also have seen that without drift the scenario with the species specific dispersal kernel resulted in a similar eutrophication pattern as the scenario with the slim dispersal see fig 7 b2 1 and b4 1 this is in line with another empirical and model observation that chironomids with their slim dispersal kernel and their tolerance towards human perturbations genito et al 2002 are the dominating functional type in the impacted downstream part of the river this seems to have consequences for the biocontrol too while mayflies with their wider dispersal kernel but preferences for pristine berenzen et al 2005 berger et al 2017 reaches located in the upstream area is of lower influence thus without drift the spatial distribution of the different grazer functional types influences the resulting eutrophication pattern drift was found to modify the eutrophication pattern by relocating a surplus of grazers from an upstream segment to downstream segments with surplus of biofilm biomass where they contribute to biofilm control and thereby to the prevention of eutrophication the result is a persistent pattern with minimum eutrophication i e one phase in july per year e g fig 6 a3 by comparing different dispersal kernels we found that dispersal is also an important mechanism enhancing the grazing pressure on biofilms and thus preventing eutrophication by refilling distribution gaps in the grazer metacommunity as long as there was some dispersal in addition to drift and thus linkage between the local communities the persistent minimum eutrophication pattern was reached in all river segments simultaneously fig 8 b2 2 b3 2 b4 2 according to our results drift seems to be the more relevant process for the exchange of organisms and for biocontrol than dispersal while oviposition is restricted to certain months drift continuously allows responding to unfavorable local conditions the temporal independence of drift is likely to be even more relevant in the case of additional stressors as buffer mechanism in contrast dispersal or more specifically upstream movement counteracts the unidirectional downstream organismal drift and can re establish populations in upstream regions that where displaced by unfavorable conditions brittain and eikeland 1988 last but not least in contrast to dispersal drift also seems to outweigh the effect of heterogeneity in the distribution of the grazer functional types along the river on the eutrophication pattern and performance of biocontrol abbott 2011 our findings emphasize the important role of connectivity in metacommunities in riverine ecosystems for biocontrol of eutrophication the complex system of organismic exchange within a river and its direct and indirect implications are influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors schiesari et al 2018 the combined effects of these factors influence the growth rates of the populations of the dispersing taxa in the donor region or the chance of the dispersing individuals to reach a certain different location schiesari et al 2018 the loss of the connectivity within the river e g by anthropogenic activities implies a loss of habitat and hence dispersal corridors or migration routes for all kinds of organisms stendera et al 2012 as we have seen micro niches played a crucial role in times of eutrophication as they allowed at least some grazers to stay in a river segment to finish their development and to release imagines which oviposit and assure at least some re colonization of the river segment in the next generation this shows the importance of accounting for this small scale spatial heterogeneity to link drift and stressors in analyses of their functional implications is useful for several reasons e g naman et al 2016 i drift allows organisms to escape from unfavorable habitat conditions caused by physical chemical or biological stressors brittain and eikeland 1988 ii drift provides the opportunity to colonize or in our case recolonize habitats brittain and eikeland 1988 as immigration allows compensating individual loss and recolonizing empty habitats after disturbance drift can counteract effects from localized stressors iii the two movement mechanisms drift and dispersal and the mediated connectivity can be disrupted by a variety of anthropogenic stressors arim et al 2016 4 3 implications of mastiff from a broader perspective a major advantage of mastiff is the explicit and mechanistically sound linkage of local and regional factors in the following we list consequences for the potential of this approach for exploring effects of multiple stressors on regulating riverine ecosystem services beyond biocontrol of eutrophication as mastiff predicts the distribution and status of the benthic biofilm esp its green part covering the individual river segments it also allows conclusions on important biofilm mediated ecosystem functions such as primary production carbon and nutrient flow stream metabolism attenuation of pollutants or the provision of habitat limburg 2009 grizzetti et al 2019 bernhardt et al 2022 a number of conclusions can be drawn directly from the model design this concerns the analysis of cross scale stressor effects the exploration of the aquatic terrestrial coupling and the support of water related functional ecosystem assessments of relevance for international activities for fulfilling the sdgs 4 3 1 cross scale stressor effects mediated by grazer drift and dispersal grazer drift and dispersal links the food webs in all river segments tonkin et al 2018 saigo et al 2020 consequently any change in the grazer flow from one segment can potentially alter taxa abundance and ecological interactions in the food webs of all other segments as we have seen this can alter the grazing pressure in the remote segment but also the capacity to cope with local stressors through compensating individual losses this further advances our understanding of how stressors affect the functioning of riverine ecosystems i through the movement meditated linking local stressor bundles can cause cascading effects which propagate throughout the river with implications for all ecosystem services provided functional effects of local stressor bundles can thus be river wide ii via the same cascading mechanism local stressors of one segment can alter the effect of local stressors on the functioning of the food web in a remote segment in this way long distance interactions of local stressors may emerge iii thus a cross scale perspective is necessary for understanding the compositional and functional effects of multiple stressors on riverine ecosystems the possibility that local stressors can interact over large distances in a riverine ecosystem is often overlooked soranno et al 2015 this has serious consequences for the planning of strategies for water quality management and restoration evidently remote stressors can influence the effectiveness of any local conservation measure which can be strengthened or weakened thus focusing on the management of local stressor bundles would reach too short instead a more systemic network based perspective is needed for the management planning which accounts for the long distance interactions between local stressor bundles grazer drift is not permanent but an occasional response to unfavorable habitat conditions naman et al 2016 thus its occurrence can only be correctly described if the triggering mechanisms are included in mastiff three triggers of grazer drift are implemented i insufficient forage ii emergence of thick biofilms which cannot be handled by the grazers anymore first mode of eutrophication and iii outbreaks of filamentous algae which occur randomly and make habitats unfavorable for the grazers second mode of eutrophication this shows that eutrophication itself is an important trigger of grazer drift its consideration is thus prerequisite for understanding functional effects of multiple stressors in riverine ecosystems it is not the grazer drift per se that influences the systems dynamics but successful immigration events occurring only if there are releasing and receiving river segments present at the same time this shows the importance of a minimum degree of heterogeneity in the development stages of the biofilms in all river segments this is in line with the well known finding on the role of synchrony and asynchrony for population persistence in habitat networks abbott 2011 mastiff fills the gap of the application of a metacommunity approach to the assessment of stressor effects mastiff fulfills a number of formerly formulated requirements such as enhancing mechanistic understanding of stressor effects galic et al 2018 or bridging between ecosystem functioning and disturbance ecology schuwirth and reichert 2013 or including a network of interaction perspective in multiple stressor research bruder et al 2019 0rr et al 2020 4 3 2 riverine stressors and aquatic terrestrial coupling many stressors of relevance for riverine ecosystems have their origin at land and are induced by land use this concerns both changes in land cover and land management practices thus understanding stressor effects on the functioning of riverine ecosystems is crucial for understanding the aquatic terrestrial coupling being aware about side effects of land management on water quality is also key for keeping landscapes multifunctional mastiff allows accounting for the spatiotemporal pattern of occurrence of each relevant stressor this feature is particularly useful in connection with discussions on pathways towards a more sustainable agriculture esp on the adoption of precision farming garbach et al 2016 hunter et al 2017 cassman and grassini 2020 its idea is to restrict the application of agrochemicals to sites and times where they are indispensable whether such restrictions actually reduce harm on riverine ecosystems is not fully understood so far finger et al 2019 mastiff facilitates assessing cross scale effects of altered agrochemical application regimes addressing timing issues and exploring the influence of grazer drift and dispersal on the outcomes empirical data on land cover and crop cultivation in a river catchment can be get from modern techniques of remote sensing esp sentinel 2 data with a resolution of 20 20 m zhai et al 2018 phiri et al 2020 preidl et al 2020 and used for parameterizing the land use types of the river segments pre implemented in mastiff the relevance of timing questions even increases if climate change comes into play changing the timing of a measure is seen as common way for adapting agricultural practices to climate change e g howden et al 2007 this also underpins the necessity of accounting for differences in the life cycles of the grazer types to apply mastiff to another river it is sufficient to adjust the respective land use profile i e the longitudinal sequence of land use types note however that the river has a similar low stream order strahler stream order 1 3 in order to find the same functional types of species furthermore the transfer functions of light shading and temperature need to be fitted to the new region also see supp odd one way would be to adjust transfer functions for seasonal patterns at a high resolution i e for each week and segment alternatively the modular structure of mastiff would allow integrating spatial and temporal data from a catchment model or detailed monitoring data mastiff includes the catchment of a river in an implicit way for this purpose each river segment is equipped with a bundle of environmental attributes that influence the ecological processes of interest and respond to stressors in the area which drains in the river segment in a characteristic integral way what area drains in a specific river segment can be determined from earth observation data e g the eu hydro river network data base the same approach enabled büttner et al 2020 to show empirically that low order streams and their ecological state are particularly sensitive to agricultural activities in their catchments finally mastiff also incorporates another aspect of the aquatic terrestrial coupling namely the linkage mediated by the macroinvertebrate organisms which use specific aquatic and terrestrial habitats in their different development stage these organisms can only fully develop as a sign for ecosystem health if the interplay of these habitat types is appropriate in the river catchment for this mastiff s implicit way of incorporating the river catchment is still adequate as recent studies have shown e g muehlbauer et al 2014 that organismal exchange between a river and its catchment is restricted to a rather narrow zone along the river 4 3 3 potential of mastiff for a functional assessments of riverine ecosystems because of the importance of ecosystem services for human well being ecosystem assessments are carried out at various scales one important global initiative is ipbes the intergovernmental science policy platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services it aims at assessing future drivers of environmental change but also planned management interventions or policy options regarding their consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services the mission of ipbes is compatible with the goals of research on multiple stressors and their effects on the functioning of esp riverine ecosystems in 2016 ipbes has published a methodology for using models and scenarios for policy advice in this context ipbes 2016 the majority of models used under the roof of ipbes for assessments of effects of land use on biodiversity globio schipper et al 2020 globio aqua janse et al 2015 and ecosystem services invest are based on correlative modeling approaches the mentioned models have a certain focus on terrestrial ecosystem services and cultural aquatic ecosystem services fishing watching charismatic species mastiff opens the opportunity to incorporate an additional class regulating ecosystem services from small rivers provided by the benthic biofilm and taxa from the first trophic level of the riverine food webs in the assessment and to analyze its response to stressors caused by land use change mastiff supports mechanistically sound analyzes at the local and the regional scale to allow conclusions at national or global scales strategies for aggregation and upscaling are needed that is a task for future research as one step in this direction mastiff can be used for testing the predictive power of aggregated indicators such as the land use intensity index blüthgen et al 2013 erb et al 2013 felipe lucia et al 2020 widely used in global ecosystem assessments the lui index is defined as a proxy for the interplay of various land use related stressors e g use of fertilizers and pesticides mowing habitat conversion and calculated with an additive approach it was originally developed for predicting implications on biodiversity and the carbon cycle in cropland and grasslands mastiff can be used for testing the predictive power of the lui index for biocontrol of eutrophication as an exemplary regulating riverine ecosystem service main advantage of mastiff is that all individual stressors can be included in a mechanistically sound way and their combined effect be simulated as emerging property which accounts for trophic interactions grazer drift and dispersal and the spatiotemporal distribution of the stressor occurrence the modular structure of mastiff facilitates further integration with other models for example nutrient discharge models or mechanistic models of specific stressor effects in principle the design structure already allows to set stressors by site conditions currently stressors could be simulated that are tied to land use types nutrients shading e g clear cut climatic stressors such as increasing mean air temperature hydro morphological stressor by drift mortality and pesticides input influencing biofilm growth herbicides and attributes of organisms insecticides mastiff can be used as a virtual laboratory which allows users to switch different stressors and land use profiles along the river on and off and thereby to develop a mechanistic understanding furthermore due to the spatial and temporal extent benthic experiments in field studies are challenging compared to plankton benthic organisms have longer generation times for instance in addition drift and dispersal and even more their effect on community and ecosystem functioning are hard to quantify in field the logistically and ethical challenges and cost based restrictions to test impacts of multiple stressors can be circumvent by ecological models representing the system of interest stendera et al 2012 galic et al 2018 4 4 outlook recently mastiff connects segments as a linear river channel in order to be more realistic the segments could be arranged as a dendritic river network carraro et al 2020 yang et al 2021 2019 to analyze the importance of drift and dispersal with multiple connections a condition for the larger scale application however is that the fauna regions and the functional composition of the macroinvertebrates between source and receiving community is comparable furthermore so far nutrients were represented in a simplified way in mastiff by distinguishing between being limiting and non limiting for biofilm growth a more explicit representation of nutrient dynamics or coupling with a nutrient submodel which accounts for inputs from agricultural or urban sources could enlarge applicability of mastiff further in this paper we focused on biocontrol of eutrophication and the activity of macroinvertebrate grazers in the future mastiff can be extended to address further regulating ecosystem services provided by other functional groups from the first trophic level of riverine food webs in summary mastiff fills the gap of the application of a metacommunity approach to stressors effects and thus fulfills the need for a mechanistic understanding of stressors effects in a systematic way along the river it delivers knowledge on ecosystem functioning under anthropogenic disturbances in combination with the relevance

24412,riverine ecosystems provide various ecosystem services one of these services is the biological control of eutrophication by grazing macroinvertebrates however riverine ecosystems are subject to numerous stressors that affect community structure functions and stability properties to manage rivers in response to these stressors a better understanding of the ecological functions underlying services is needed this requires consideration of local and regional processes which requires a metacommunity approach that links local food webs through drift and dispersal this takes into account long distance interactions that can compensate for local effects of stressors our modular model mastiff multiple aquatic stressors in flowing food webs is stage structured spatially explicit and includes coupled food webs consisting of benthic resource consumer interactions between biofilm and three competing macroinvertebrate functional types river segments are unidirectionally connected through organismal drift and bidirectionally connected through dispersal climate and land use stressors along the river can be accounted for biocontrol of biofilm eutrophication is used as an exemplary functional indicator we present the model and the underlying considerations and show in an exemplary application that explicit consideration of drift and dispersal is essential for understanding the spatiotemporal biocontrol of eutrophication the combination of drift and dispersal reduced eutrophication events while dispersal events were linked to specific periods in the species life cycles and therefore had limited potential to control drift was ubiquitous and thus responded more readily to changing habitat conditions this indicates that drift is an important factor for coping with stress situations finally we outline and discuss the potential and possibilities of mastiff as a tool for mechanistic cross scale analyses of multiple stressors to advance knowledge of riverine ecosystem functioning keywords modeling riverine ecosystems drift and dispersal multiple stressors functioning biocontrol of eutrophication 1 introduction the sustainable development goals sdgs formulated by the united nations un 2015 underpin the urgency of harmonizing societal development with the maintenance of natural life support systems especially in a changing world riverine ecosystems play an important role in this context as they are the source of various ecosystem services which are prerequisites for human well being and development mea 2005 they are crucial for securing food provisioning services for enabling recreation cultural services but also for purifying water cycling nutrients attenuating pollutants or regulating the climate regulating services such services are at risk however as riverine ecosystems are exposed to multiple stressors such as harmful chemicals from land use barriers from water infrastructures reducing connectivity biological invasions or climate change stressors can influence the riverine ecosystem via the alteration of habitat conditions and availability the network structure and species abundance in food webs and the traits of individual organism furthermore the interaction between multiple stressors can be manifold neutral antagonistic or synergistic with combined effects which can propagate across different levels of organization organisms populations communities ecosystems piggott et al 2015 moreover trophic interactions and dispersal can modify multiple stressor effects bruder et al 2019 and thus form another layer of complexity other challenges in connection with multiple stressors in riverine ecosystems concern timing and scaling issues de vries et al 2020 mechanistic understanding of how bundles of such stressors interact and jointly affect the structure functions and stability properties of riverine ecosystems is thus critical for the planning of sustainable management of ecosystems effects of multiple stressors and their interactions are notoriously difficult to disentangle and predict from empirical data galic et al 2018 mechanistic models should thus complement field studies but have to fulfill a number of requirements to become useful according to loreau 2010 sound mechanistic understanding of the functioning of ecosystems can only be gained if all organismic aspects such as individual traits or ecological interactions are adequately linked to matter and energy fluxes serving as resources or stressors this is challenging but recent ecological models are increasingly meeting this demand grimm and berger 2016 grimm et al 2017 for this processes on higher organizational levels are considered as outcomes which emerge from the individual level the individuals traits interactions and responses to new site conditions are described with tested standardized submodels based on general physiological principles the resulting models are generic in the sense that they can be applied to a new situation by appropriate parameterization but without the need to develop a completely new model from the scratch one prominent next generation ecological model for the exploration of multiple stressor effects on food webs in rivers is streambugs 1 0 schuwirth and reichert 2013 schuwirth et al 2016 it addresses food webs consisting of invertebrates periphyton and particulate organic matter pom growth respiration and death rates are parameterized using generic allometric relationships derived from the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 they are affected by various site conditions light temperature and the concentrations of oxygen nutrients and pom even without calibration differences between the predicted and observed food web structures were less than 50 and could be further reduced with calibration at 36 sites in a catchment in switzerland schuwirth and reichert 2013 streambugs is rooted in ecological theory can be applied to a wide range of environmental conditions and stressor combinations and is thus powerful still it focusses on compositional effects of multiple stressors on riverine food webs mechanistic models for exploring how stressor effects alter essential ecological functions in streams are widely missing so far gray et al 2015 show a way of considering the different categories of riverine ecosystem services and linking them to specific parts of the underlying food web they highlight that especially all regulating riverine ecosystem services are provided by the first two levels of the green food web i e the benthic biofilm as the primary producer and the community of grazing macroinvertebrates one important example for a regulating riverine ecosystem service is the biocontrol of eutrophication provided by the macroinvertebrates when grazing the biofilm besides benthic filter feeders controlling plankton macroinvertebrates however are mobile in specific stages of their life cycle flying imagines actively disperse to distribute eggs while larvae start passively drifting with the water flow to escape unsuitable habitat conditions this creates a colonization cycle in which the directional downstream drift of larvae is compensated by the upstream dispersal of imagines müller 1982 moving macroinvertebrates link local food webs induce long distance interactions reallocate the grazing pressure and thus their biocontrol service but also transport or compensate effects from stressors on the riverine ecosystem hence sound understanding of the functional effects of multiple stressors on regulating riverine ecosystem services can only be gained if both local factors esp stressors site conditions trophic interactions in the food webs and regional processes esp organismal drift and dispersal water and matter flows are adequately taken into account despite their specific potentials currently available models have limitations regarding the linkage of local to regional processes de vries et al 2020 one way to overcome this drawback is considering riverine ecosystems as metacommunities i e networks of local communities which are coupled by organismal drift and dispersal this concept was specifically introduced by leibold et al 2004 for enabling the required cross scale linking in the riverine context the concept has been applied for predicting biodiversity patterns in dendritic river networks and for explaining the relative influence of drift dispersal connectivity and the local site conditions on the findings e g altermatt 2013 heino et al 2015 borthagaray et al 2015 in connection with analyses of stressor effects on ecosystems however metacommunity approaches have not been used so far this is in line with the observation that there are only few examples where the metacommunity concept was applied for tackling problems of conservation management or restoration chase et al 2020 we therefore developed the stage structured and spatially explicit model mastiff multiple aquatic stressors in flowing food webs the purpose of which is the facilitation of cross scale analyses of effects of multiple stressors on the functioning of riverine ecosystems the model follows a metacommunity approach it accounts for cross scale resource consumer interactions between the benthic biofilm and the three competing functional types of macroinvertebrate grazers limpet mayfly and chironomid which are based on the taxa ancylus fluviatilis heptageniidae and chironomidae its processes incorporate the grazers life cycle resource use growth and movement modes drift and dispersal and the biofilm s growth depending on nutrients light and biofilm consumption by grazers the model is stylized but structurally realistic as it considers a river as a channel consisting of river segments which harbor a local food web the segments are coupled through water and matter flows as well as moving grazers and are surrounded by a specific land use type riparian forest urban or agriculture which comes along with characteristic bundles of stressors influencing the site conditions in a specific way the model is generic as all process rates are described with submodels which are based on physiological principles the aim of this article is to present mastiff the requirements underlying its design structure and a first application to demonstrate its potential specifically biocontrol of eutrophication is taken as an example for a regulating riverine ecosystem service to be preserved mastiff is used for exploring i how important drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers are for the biofilm control the resulting pattern of riverine eutrophication and the performance of the biocontrol and ii how different dispersal kernels of the involved grazers are influencing the findings these investigations are performed for a hypothetical river with a sequence of neighboring habitat and land use types which is specific but typical for middle european small rivers in the application we accounted for two typical land use induced stressors in river catchments which both weaken the limitation of biofilm growth oversupply with nutrients in segments downstream from the first appearance of urban or agricultural land use along the river course and missing shading in segments with clear cutting of the riparian forest such a systematic exploration of the functional implications of drift and dispersal with simulations has not been done before but is key for understanding cross scale effects of specific stressor scenarios on the performance of biocontrol planned to be addressed in follow up work additionally we give an overview on scenarios and questions for which mastiff can be used in the future taking various kinds of stressors into account we close with synthesizing remarks on the potential of taking a metacommunity approach for advancing understanding of riverine ecosystem services their response to multiple stressors and buffering effects for functional resilience this includes implications of mastiff from a broader perspective specifically the potential for understanding the aquatic terrestrial coupling and for ecosystem assessments used in international initiatives aiming at the development of ways to fulfill the sdgs 2 methods 2 1 requirements underlying the design structure of the mastiff model to facilitate mechanistic understanding mastiff ought to be designed in a way that it is a stylized but structurally realistic representation of small rivers in middle european low mountain regions with natural or semi natural conditions at the upper reaches and increasing anthropogenic stress due to land use in agricultural and urban areas down the river being stylized means simplified for tractability to enable a use of mastiff as a virtual laboratory schlüter et al 2019 to systematically explore the consequences of a wide range of stressor scenarios and environmental gradients typical for such rivers to provide insights into key cross scale mechanisms our focus on cross scale dynamics requires that the model is spatially explicit i e represents an entire river following the stylized but structurally realistic approach rivers ought to be described as channels consisting of a sequence of river segments with characteristic environmental site conditions which are influenced by stressor effects from the land use in the surrounding catchment in less than 100 m distance to the river each river segment ought to contain a food web with competing macroinvertebrates feeding on the benthic biofilm the functional perspective of mastiff allows focusing on only three functional types of macroinvertebrate grazer species limpet mayfly and chironomid the segments ought to be linked through drifting and dispersing macroinvertebrates which then form a metacommunity for the entire river to keep the model tractable hydraulics need not to be represented explicitly instead it ought to be represented implicitly via their effects on nutrient exposure organismal drift and possible biofilm abrasion in order to get a mechanistically sound but generic description of the effect of multiple stressors demographic process rates such as biofilm growth and grazers feed demand ought to be broken down to basic physiological principles and formulated as functions on limiting environmental factors mastiff ought to be designed in a way that is can be applied to both rivers with hypothetical land use profiles and the land use profile of specific rivers as input to enable testable assessments of the composition of the local food webs and of eutrophication patterns furthermore mastiff has to consider that stressor occurrence is usually not constant but varying within and between years since the different macroinvertebrate grazer types emerge at specific times and their life stages differ in their sensitivities to stressors it is important to take life cycles into account mastiff ought to be thus stage structured instead of considering lump biomasses 2 2 summary description of the mastiff model a complete detailed model description following the odd overview design concept details protocol grimm et al 2006 2020 is provided in supplementary material and in the gitlab repository https git ufz de oesa mastiff moreover the model is open source and its executable program and source code are available from the mentioned repository the overall purpose of the model is a cross scale mechanistic understanding of how organismal drift and dispersal of macroinvertebrate grazers modify the impact of multiple stressors on the functioning of riverine ecosystems a specific functional focus in this paper is on the grazer mediated top down control of the benthic biofilm and thus eutrophication as exemplary regulating ecosystem service of particular importance mastiff is a spatially explicit model that considers the structure dynamics and functions of the aquatic ecosystem in a channel like river mastiff particularly aims to provide insights that help understanding and counteracting effects of bundles of multiple stressors on the functioning of the food webs in different river segments or the entire river for this we need a better mechanistic understanding of the complex interplay of local and regional processes for this we followed a metacommunity approach by explicitly accounting for organismal drift and dispersal this allows considering the entire metacommunity in the river instead of the local communities and food webs in isolation this enables addressing questions such as what is the relative importance of passive drift of the larvae and active dispersal of the aerial adults for the structure dynamics functions and stability properties of the riverine ecosystem and how much do the findings depend on the dispersal kernels assumed for the species involved what are the consequences for the state of the benthic biofilm covering the individual river segments what are the implications for the control of the biofilm and thus of eutrophication mediated by the macroinvertebrate grazers and what for the ecosystem functions mediated by the green part of the biofilm to consider our model realistic enough for its purpose we included patterns in grazer abundance and biofilm growth as observed in streams of the harz mountains germany wild r unpubl results the longitudinal development of land use and water temperature were adopted from a study at the holtemme river weitere et al 2021 a 3rd order river in harz mountains empirical data were provided by the federal environmental authority corine land cover program clc 2018 by the european environment agency kristensen et al 2018 and the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 the model includes the entities segments and species segments are 100 m long sections of the river and are characterized by the following state variables segment number land use type maximal shading water temperature nutrient limitation biofilm biomass biofilm condition abundance of each functional species and the number of the neighboring downstream segment the entity species is characterized by its functional type abundance of each life stage hatching month month turning into a fertile organism month of oviposition month of death as well as the body mass in larval stage mortality rate and maximal ingestion rate the spatial and temporal resolution and extent are weekly time steps and a segment length of 100 meter a monthly resolution is chosen to implement the characteristics of life cycles of each species such as dispersal and hatching for instance with 479 segments the whole holtemme river with a total length of 47 9 km will be simulated we assumed that one month consist out of 4 weeks hence one year is 48 weeks long simulations are typically run for 20 years which corresponds to 960 weeks the processes of the model which are repeated every time step are biofilm processes growth abrasion grazer processes change in the life stage mortality grazing growth organismal drift and dispersal settlement and emergence of eutrophication fig 1 the model follows a metacommunity approach thus the most important design concepts of the model are the basic principles governing drift and settlement of the macroinvertebrate grazers both are regulated by the forage biofilm biomass available and accessible in a segment and the dispersal of active aerial adult insect species by the mean of specific dispersal kernels furthermore the definition of eutrophication in a river segment that is a system state of particular interest in this paper considers a certain threshold of the local biofilm biomass where grazers cannot settle feed on and hence control the biofilm anymore fig 2 the key model output or observation can be any state variable of interest e g biofilm biomass abundance of grazers species strength of induced drift events or on a higher organizational level the eutrophication patterns along the river depending on different model settings the mentioned key processes strongly depend on the specific environmental conditions in the individual river segments fig 1 solar radiation air temperature water temperature and shading are subject to seasonal fluctuations which are incorporated via characteristic equations a spatial differentiation into segments allows us to represent 1 a water temperature profile and 2 a land use profile with several land use types that differ for example in shading and nutrient limitation in each river segment the biofilm biomass develops according to a standard growth equation which depends on limiting factors such as local light conditions nutrients and grazing pressure the biofilm biomass provides forage for the grazers the total biofilm biomass consists of three spatial compartments with different potentials for eutrophication one important compartment is the so called micro niche which offers forage but can never be eutrophic this spatial heterogeneity within a segment prevents the complete loss of grazers and allows recolonization after the other compartments return from eutrophic period above a certain threshold β 0 of biofilm biomass grazers cannot attach to the ground anymore and therefore are not able to feed on and control the biofilm we define this state transition as eutrophication fig 2 when the biofilm biomass has reached a second threshold β 1 the biofilm biomass can rip off caused by indirect hydraulic stress after this the biofilm in the segment can regrow and be recolonized by grazers again the β 1 threshold increases downstream having in mind the decreasing slope and thus hydraulic pressure along the river a second type of eutrophication is the outbreak of filamentous algae the probability of a filamentous event increases with the existing biofilm biomass in our application in this paper the maximal probability is set to zero for simplification as a consequence of insufficient forage in a river segment cause by e g eutrophication grazers respond depending on their life cycle they leave the segment enter the water column and start drifting downstream besides eutrophication a too large number of grazers could also be a reason for drift the forage is split between functional types referring to their abundance in the segment and their species specific demand the feed demand depends on body mass and water temperature which varies over time and is calculated using a standard equation from physiology that is rooted in the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 the relation m r m γ describes how metabolic rates mr scale with the body mass of the individual m e g brose 2010 johnston et al 2014 furthermore metabolic rates strongly depend on water temperature represented by the exponential arrhenius function e g gillooly et al 2001 johnston et al 2014 in the grazing process the inhabiting grazers are saturated at first the leftovers are offered to the immigrating grazers coming from upstream and trying to settle each functional type of grazer species has its own specific life cycle and mortality hatching from egg to grazing larvae or organisms the development time to a fertile adult or imagines and following oviposition a maximal life span different mortality rates due to natural or drift processes the functional type limpet represents a local species that is hardly affected by drift and thus always deposits its eggs in the same segment ancylus fluviatilis has a hololimnic life cycle and can graze on biofilm after oviposition the remaining functional types mayfly and chironomid have the ability to drift in order to find a suitable habitat but leave the water for emergence besides drift dispersal upstream and downstream of imagines mayfly and chironomid is another distribution process to reach neighboring and distant segments a species specific dispersal kernel defines the probability of a dispersing imago to land in a segment this rule is in line with muehlbauer et al 2014 who underpinned that the majority of riverine macroinvertebrates disperses along the river course and only a small percentage in dispersing overland the modular structure of the model allows to couple various spatio temporal stressors and test them individually or in combination in scenarios thereby stressors can affect environmental parameters e g mean air temperature shading nutrient limitation or species traits e g mortality 2 3 calibration and model output verification calibration aimed at 1 coexistence of the species considered 2 realistic yearly mean population abundances and 3 realistic qualitative species distribution pattern extended exploratory manual sensitivity analyses and calibration efforts data not shown identified seven most sensitive parameters that were used for calibration natural mortality mortalityratei and number of offspring offspringi for each of the three functional species and the scaling factor δ w which lowers mortality in winter when organisms usually hide and predation is low table 1 since in this model version predators are not represented explicitly we took predator induced mortality into account via natural or background mortality furthermore the number of offspring offspringi refers to recruitment of larvae and thus takes egg mortality into account implicitly as well as imagines mortality in aerial stage e g by predators living on land the model was run for all possible combinations of these seven parameters as specified in table 1 the initial conditions were b b 0 1800 for biofilm biomass abundance of limpets ancylus fluviatilis of 60 000 individuals per segment mayflies heptageniidae abundance of 30 000 individuals per segment 600 000 individuals per segment for chironomids chironomidae and the land use profile according to the river holtemme since the model is deterministic we needed only one run for each parameter combination the empirical abundance and distribution patterns for matching were extracted from field studies of headwater streams in the harz mountains i e wormsgraben forested and getel agriculture wild r unpubl results this includes the mean yearly abundance of each species and missing of the mayfly in agricultural landscapes fig 3 in results after initialization a simulation is run for 20 years transient phase and then evaluated according to the empirical observations of species abundance and zoning parametrization used

mayflies scenarios with a decreasing abundance of mayfly form up to downstream by choosing three segments 20 250 400 and comparing their mean abundance 4 coexistence of species after 40 years for calibration of water temperature over time and along the river environmental factors to be considered in principle are solar radiation humidity cloud cover and wind speed sinokrot and stefan 1993 but since such data were not available we used air temperature of the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 as a proxy the monthly mean air temperature of 2008 2016 is used for calibration we also accounted for the effects of shading which is determined by the land use profile we developed a spatial function based on incoming water tx 1 t in the segment x

temperature for the first segment water source shows certain seasonality and is therefore described in a time dependent way to reach a better result t 0 t s initial conditions and further simulation settings are listed in table 2 in order to calibrate the submodel water temperature the parameter was fitted specifically on empirical data for the holtemme river profile we used water temperature data at nine different sampling point positions along the holtemme river from 2011 to 2016 of the landesbetrieb für hochwasserschutz und wasserwirtschaft sachsen anhalt lhw 2017 table 2 the sampling points were mapped to corresponding segments the shading values λ x were adapted to the holtemme profile for each month and segment after the aggregation of values per segment and month we needed an equation for each month with their starting value of t s for the first segment the aim is the fit one value which applies to all months we used a cost function with not weighted residuals and an optimization function e g nelder mead calibration was done using the r package fme rstudio team 2018 soetaert and petzoldt 2010 2 4 model output corroboration for validation with data that were not used for model design or calibration we used biofilm data of forested and agricultural headwater streams in the harz mountains wild r unpubl results biofilm biomass production was estimated monthly from 2012 to 2013 using tiles which were placed in the streams after one month of exposure biofilm was scraped off the tile dried weighed and production was estimated as mg dw mo 1 wild r unpubl results 2 5 simulation experiments the aim of the exemplary simulation experiments in this paper was to explore the relevance of drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers for the mediated biocontrol of eutrophication the performance of this important regulating ecosystem service was determined by comparing the spatiotemporal eutrophication patterns for a scenario without grazers as reference with a scenario with grazers to assess the relative importance of drift and dispersal we varied the assumptions on both the drift mortality to enable a without vs with drift comparison and the dispersal kernels a dispersal kernel is defined by the frequency distribution of upstream and downstream distances of the dispersal of active aerial adults see supp odd s24 fig 14 four dispersal scenarios were compared in the first scenario local dispersal was assumed in which the imagines of mayfly and chironomid lay their eggs in the same segment in which they emerged b1 1 b1 2 in the second and third scenario the dispersal kernel followed a narrow slim b2 1 b2 2 or broad normal distribution wide b3 1 b3 2 respectively table 3 supp fig s2 in the fourth dispersal scenario realistic species specific dispersal kernels were considered a skewed distribution for mayflies and a narrow normal distribution for chironomids using parameters derived from the literature b4 1 b4 2 as exemplary stressor bundles we focused on oversupply with nutrients and missing shading which are characteristic for river reaches with urban or agricultural land use which at the same time lack riparian forests and spatially composed them according to the land use profile along the river of interest in this study we took the holtemme river as case study here there was one river segment with nutrient inflow such that the biofilms in all downstream segments were not nutrient limited anymore for the evaluation the emerging eutrophication patterns were visualized as indicated in fig 2 each segment was marked depending on whether or not eutrophication occurred the resulting spatial patterns for each month were stacked to provide a spatio temporal overview 3 results 3 1 reproduction of empirical patterns calibration and corroboration the seven calibrated parameters are included in supplement table s1 with the calibrated model the mean yearly abundances for the considered functional types of macroinvertebrate grazer species limpet and chironomid match quantitatively with the respective empirical data extracted from field fig 3 additionally the relative ranking among the three functional types known from field is reproduced the model shows mean yearly abundances for limpet mayfly and chironomid functional types of 24 113 and 427 individuals per m² after 20 years of simulation respectively additionally we found characteristic longitudinal patterns for the mean yearly abundances for mayfly and chironomid in the simulation outcome for the study river holtemme cf supp fig s1 for the simulated mayfly we found a high abundance in the forested upper segments which is gradually decreasing when passing the downstream segments with their neighboring urban or agricultural land use for the simulated chironomid the pattern was opposite low abundance in the forested segment constantly high abundance in the land use affected segments these land use dependent abundance patterns are in line with empirical observations e g berenzen et al 2005 berger et al 2017 the mean water temperature per month at the nine sampling points along the holtemme river and the best result for the parameter by calibration are shown in fig 4 best calibration of submodel water temperature is achieved by 0 004 the equation used is thus sufficient to fit our need to represent water temperature in order to validate the model output we used biofilm accrual data of tributaries of holtemme and bode in year 2012 and 2013 these empirical data show an intensified growth of biofilm in july and october november in sampling points where agricultural land use prevailed fig 5 a this matches the simulated biofilm biomass increase for river segments with agricultural land use which peak in june july and october november fig 5b the observed small amount of biofilm accrual in river segments with riparian forests can also be detected in simulated biofilm data compared to catchments with predominantly agricultural land use empirical and simulated which show a higher amount of biofilm accrual 3 2 application study relevance of drift and dispersal for eutrophication and its biocontrol in order to determine the performance of the grazer mediated control of eutrophication and to analyze its dependence on the grazers drift the eutrophication patterns three scenarios were compared 1 a scenario completely without grazers a1 2 a scenario with grazers but without drift a2 and 3 a scenario with grazers and with drift a3 each over 20 years land use profile of the holtemme river fig 6 for the second and third scenario the dispersal kernels were set to the realistic species specific kernels the eutrophication pattern of the first scenario a1 without grazers shows one long eutrophic phase in autumn in the forest region segments dominated by urban and agricultural land use in contrast show two eutrophic phases a first one in may june and a second one in august september fig 6 a1 the pattern is consistent between the years supp fig s3 when grazers are present but do not drift a2 eutrophication disappears in forested segments furthermore in this scenario the two eutrophic phases present in the scenario without grazers a1 shift and merge to one eutrophic period of the same duration of two to three weeks in july august e g segments 80 to 130 and 260 to 350 fig 6 a2 the eutrophication patterns in the third scenario with grazers and drift a3 do not change after eight years and could be defined as the final equilibrium state fig 6 a3 supp fig s3 only one eutrophic period appears in july for two weeks from segment 80 downstream till segment 300 and three weeks from there on downstream in summary the comparison of the scenarios reveals that with grazers in the riverine ecosystem the eutrophication pattern is altered in different respects depending on the land use in the river segments the phases of eutrophication are completely removed or shifted and merged while the total duration is reduced this is a sign of substantial biocontrol that is further enhanced in face of drift the dispersal by imagines is besides drift the second process for grazers to reach other segments with implications for the biocontrol in order to disaggregate the effect of dispersal from drift eight scenarios with various dispersal kernels and turned on and off drift indicate the importance of dispersal and drift fig 7 fig 8 the scenarios without drift show a transition from mainly two eutrophic phases per year for local dispersal b1 1 via one to two eutrophic phases per year for slim dispersal b2 1 to only one eutrophication phase for a wide dispersal b3 1 the species specific dispersal b4 1 resembles slim dispersal b2 1 the scenarios without drift thus reveal that the eutrophication patterns strongly depend on the assumed dispersal kernels the broader the dispersal kernel the wider the exchange of grazers and hence the more is eutrophication prevented fig 7 in scenarios with drift fig 8 the eutrophication patterns do not differ much between the various dispersal kernels as long as there is some dispersal by active aerial adults linking the food webs in the river segments the pattern of one eutrophic phase in july is obtained even in face of local dispersal b1 2 much less eutrophication occurs in comparison to the scenario without drift b1 1 the broader the kernel is the faster the stable state is reached supp fig s5 b2 2 b3 2 in general as long as some dispersal is possible the drift is able to stabilize the pattern and reduce eutrophication effectively last but not least with drift a narrow dispersal kernel b2 2 leads to a similar eutrophication pattern as a wide dispersal kernel without drift b3 1 4 discussion 4 1 reproduction of empirical patterns our model calibration on the basis of both the abundance of selected functional types of macroinvertebrate grazers and the water temperature led to a good match between observations and model output for the holtemme river as test case the observations used for model corroboration were not used during model construction or for parameterization the presented model mastiff reproduced these observations well this indicates that despite the stylized character of mastiff the complex network of interactions has been captured sufficiently well to allow inference about mechanisms in the riverine ecosystem considered grimm and railsback 2012 this is an implication of the modeling strategy underlying mastiff namely the description of all demographic processes with tested mechanistically sound submodels which are based on generic physiological principles this strategy of next generation ecological modeling grimm and berger 2016 grimm et al 2017 has already stand the test in streambugs schuwirth et al 2013 in mastiff the strategy is extended to regional processes still the comparability between empirical and simulated data was limited empirical data corresponded to the growth of the biofilm scraped a tile after one month of exposure whereas the simulated data referred to the biofilm growth based on the biofilm on the preceding time step nevertheless the model captured the month with intensified growth well and these model results were not directly imposed anywhere but emerged from the model s interactions and processes mastiff focuses on the analysis of regulating ecosystem services such as biocontrol of eutrophication which are according to gray et al 2015 primarily provided by the first two trophic levels of the riverine food web this justifies the simplified description of the food web in mastiff i e the restriction to the green phototrophic part of the benthic biofilm as primary producer which is limited by factors such as light nutrients and grazing and grazing macroinvertebrates as consumers of the biofilm evident top down control of the macroinvertebrates from higher trophic levels such as predators is not explicitly taken into account instead it is implicitly considered by species specific mortalities of the macroinvertebrate grazers as proxy for prey preferences of the predator species these differences in the mortality can counterbalance differences in the competitive power of the grazer species as pre requisite for their coexistence due to its modular character mastiff could be expanded by an explicit implementation of predators in a later stage 4 2 relevance of drift and dispersal mastiff was specifically designed to explore the relevance of drift and dispersal of the macroinvertebrate grazers for the performance of regulating riverine ecosystem service such as the biocontrol of eutrophication used as demonstrating example in this study for this we compared the eutrophication patterns emerging under scenarios without and with grazers and different assumptions on drift and dispersal for the sample river our simulation results indicated that eutrophication events occurred only in specific phases their number duration and timing were found to be strongly dependent on the presence or absence of grazers the assumptions on drift and dispersal but also on the land use type in the river segments even in the scenario without grazers there were only two eutrophication phases which were fully determined by the biofilm growth and the exceeding of the two threshold values β 0 and β 1 the duration of the eutrophication phase corresponded to the time span which the biofilm biomass needed for growing from β 0 to β 1 this also explains why the duration of eutrophication was longer in the forested area than in the other segments in the grazer free case but also in the case with grazers we have seen that eutrophication can occur depending on the land use type grazers reduce the biofilm biomass this suppressed eutrophication in the spring while eutrophication could not be prevented in july this is exactly the time when neither chironomids nor mayflies were present in the river because of their life cycles only limpets where present which were not able to control the biofilm a second eutrophication period did not develop due to the grazing pressure and was finally prevented by the winter break this shows that explicitly considering the life cycles of the grazer functional types is essential for understanding the ecosystem service biocontrol of eutrophication massol et al 2017 neutral models which ignore differences between the species would reach too short in a functional context this is also in line with findings that metacommunity assemblage in lower order rivers is controlled by species sorting and environmental filtering borthagaray et al 2015 our model results for the scenarios with grazers but without drift fig 7 also revealed that the test river can be subdivided in three zones with distinct eutrophication patterns i in all forested river segments eutrophication was prevented regardless of the assumed dispersal kernels here the local grazers were already capable to control the biofilm with its slow growth rate due to shading ii in the upstream part of the anthropogenically impacted zone eutrophication patterns were similar to those without grazers two eutrophication phases cf fig 6 a2 because of the low water temperature in this part the feed demand of the grazers grew slower than the biofilm biomass therefore eutrophication was indispensable in the respective segments that also caused loss of individuals thus only larvae from the assumed micro niches in these segments were able complete their development to the adult state become imagines and oviposit eggs in face of local or slim dispersal the low number of newly arriving larvae was insufficient to control the biofilm iii in the downstream part of the anthropogenically impacted zone eutrophication was reduced here the water temperature was higher such that the grazers feed demand grew faster than the biofilm biomass in the result the grazers could control the biofilm throughout the spring and a substantial number of imagines could emerge from these segments this shows that environmental gradients as in the water temperature can influence the performance of the grazers and the biocontrol of eutrophication we also have seen that without drift the scenario with the species specific dispersal kernel resulted in a similar eutrophication pattern as the scenario with the slim dispersal see fig 7 b2 1 and b4 1 this is in line with another empirical and model observation that chironomids with their slim dispersal kernel and their tolerance towards human perturbations genito et al 2002 are the dominating functional type in the impacted downstream part of the river this seems to have consequences for the biocontrol too while mayflies with their wider dispersal kernel but preferences for pristine berenzen et al 2005 berger et al 2017 reaches located in the upstream area is of lower influence thus without drift the spatial distribution of the different grazer functional types influences the resulting eutrophication pattern drift was found to modify the eutrophication pattern by relocating a surplus of grazers from an upstream segment to downstream segments with surplus of biofilm biomass where they contribute to biofilm control and thereby to the prevention of eutrophication the result is a persistent pattern with minimum eutrophication i e one phase in july per year e g fig 6 a3 by comparing different dispersal kernels we found that dispersal is also an important mechanism enhancing the grazing pressure on biofilms and thus preventing eutrophication by refilling distribution gaps in the grazer metacommunity as long as there was some dispersal in addition to drift and thus linkage between the local communities the persistent minimum eutrophication pattern was reached in all river segments simultaneously fig 8 b2 2 b3 2 b4 2 according to our results drift seems to be the more relevant process for the exchange of organisms and for biocontrol than dispersal while oviposition is restricted to certain months drift continuously allows responding to unfavorable local conditions the temporal independence of drift is likely to be even more relevant in the case of additional stressors as buffer mechanism in contrast dispersal or more specifically upstream movement counteracts the unidirectional downstream organismal drift and can re establish populations in upstream regions that where displaced by unfavorable conditions brittain and eikeland 1988 last but not least in contrast to dispersal drift also seems to outweigh the effect of heterogeneity in the distribution of the grazer functional types along the river on the eutrophication pattern and performance of biocontrol abbott 2011 our findings emphasize the important role of connectivity in metacommunities in riverine ecosystems for biocontrol of eutrophication the complex system of organismic exchange within a river and its direct and indirect implications are influenced by many biotic and abiotic factors schiesari et al 2018 the combined effects of these factors influence the growth rates of the populations of the dispersing taxa in the donor region or the chance of the dispersing individuals to reach a certain different location schiesari et al 2018 the loss of the connectivity within the river e g by anthropogenic activities implies a loss of habitat and hence dispersal corridors or migration routes for all kinds of organisms stendera et al 2012 as we have seen micro niches played a crucial role in times of eutrophication as they allowed at least some grazers to stay in a river segment to finish their development and to release imagines which oviposit and assure at least some re colonization of the river segment in the next generation this shows the importance of accounting for this small scale spatial heterogeneity to link drift and stressors in analyses of their functional implications is useful for several reasons e g naman et al 2016 i drift allows organisms to escape from unfavorable habitat conditions caused by physical chemical or biological stressors brittain and eikeland 1988 ii drift provides the opportunity to colonize or in our case recolonize habitats brittain and eikeland 1988 as immigration allows compensating individual loss and recolonizing empty habitats after disturbance drift can counteract effects from localized stressors iii the two movement mechanisms drift and dispersal and the mediated connectivity can be disrupted by a variety of anthropogenic stressors arim et al 2016 4 3 implications of mastiff from a broader perspective a major advantage of mastiff is the explicit and mechanistically sound linkage of local and regional factors in the following we list consequences for the potential of this approach for exploring effects of multiple stressors on regulating riverine ecosystem services beyond biocontrol of eutrophication as mastiff predicts the distribution and status of the benthic biofilm esp its green part covering the individual river segments it also allows conclusions on important biofilm mediated ecosystem functions such as primary production carbon and nutrient flow stream metabolism attenuation of pollutants or the provision of habitat limburg 2009 grizzetti et al 2019 bernhardt et al 2022 a number of conclusions can be drawn directly from the model design this concerns the analysis of cross scale stressor effects the exploration of the aquatic terrestrial coupling and the support of water related functional ecosystem assessments of relevance for international activities for fulfilling the sdgs 4 3 1 cross scale stressor effects mediated by grazer drift and dispersal grazer drift and dispersal links the food webs in all river segments tonkin et al 2018 saigo et al 2020 consequently any change in the grazer flow from one segment can potentially alter taxa abundance and ecological interactions in the food webs of all other segments as we have seen this can alter the grazing pressure in the remote segment but also the capacity to cope with local stressors through compensating individual losses this further advances our understanding of how stressors affect the functioning of riverine ecosystems i through the movement meditated linking local stressor bundles can cause cascading effects which propagate throughout the river with implications for all ecosystem services provided functional effects of local stressor bundles can thus be river wide ii via the same cascading mechanism local stressors of one segment can alter the effect of local stressors on the functioning of the food web in a remote segment in this way long distance interactions of local stressors may emerge iii thus a cross scale perspective is necessary for understanding the compositional and functional effects of multiple stressors on riverine ecosystems the possibility that local stressors can interact over large distances in a riverine ecosystem is often overlooked soranno et al 2015 this has serious consequences for the planning of strategies for water quality management and restoration evidently remote stressors can influence the effectiveness of any local conservation measure which can be strengthened or weakened thus focusing on the management of local stressor bundles would reach too short instead a more systemic network based perspective is needed for the management planning which accounts for the long distance interactions between local stressor bundles grazer drift is not permanent but an occasional response to unfavorable habitat conditions naman et al 2016 thus its occurrence can only be correctly described if the triggering mechanisms are included in mastiff three triggers of grazer drift are implemented i insufficient forage ii emergence of thick biofilms which cannot be handled by the grazers anymore first mode of eutrophication and iii outbreaks of filamentous algae which occur randomly and make habitats unfavorable for the grazers second mode of eutrophication this shows that eutrophication itself is an important trigger of grazer drift its consideration is thus prerequisite for understanding functional effects of multiple stressors in riverine ecosystems it is not the grazer drift per se that influences the systems dynamics but successful immigration events occurring only if there are releasing and receiving river segments present at the same time this shows the importance of a minimum degree of heterogeneity in the development stages of the biofilms in all river segments this is in line with the well known finding on the role of synchrony and asynchrony for population persistence in habitat networks abbott 2011 mastiff fills the gap of the application of a metacommunity approach to the assessment of stressor effects mastiff fulfills a number of formerly formulated requirements such as enhancing mechanistic understanding of stressor effects galic et al 2018 or bridging between ecosystem functioning and disturbance ecology schuwirth and reichert 2013 or including a network of interaction perspective in multiple stressor research bruder et al 2019 0rr et al 2020 4 3 2 riverine stressors and aquatic terrestrial coupling many stressors of relevance for riverine ecosystems have their origin at land and are induced by land use this concerns both changes in land cover and land management practices thus understanding stressor effects on the functioning of riverine ecosystems is crucial for understanding the aquatic terrestrial coupling being aware about side effects of land management on water quality is also key for keeping landscapes multifunctional mastiff allows accounting for the spatiotemporal pattern of occurrence of each relevant stressor this feature is particularly useful in connection with discussions on pathways towards a more sustainable agriculture esp on the adoption of precision farming garbach et al 2016 hunter et al 2017 cassman and grassini 2020 its idea is to restrict the application of agrochemicals to sites and times where they are indispensable whether such restrictions actually reduce harm on riverine ecosystems is not fully understood so far finger et al 2019 mastiff facilitates assessing cross scale effects of altered agrochemical application regimes addressing timing issues and exploring the influence of grazer drift and dispersal on the outcomes empirical data on land cover and crop cultivation in a river catchment can be get from modern techniques of remote sensing esp sentinel 2 data with a resolution of 20 20 m zhai et al 2018 phiri et al 2020 preidl et al 2020 and used for parameterizing the land use types of the river segments pre implemented in mastiff the relevance of timing questions even increases if climate change comes into play changing the timing of a measure is seen as common way for adapting agricultural practices to climate change e g howden et al 2007 this also underpins the necessity of accounting for differences in the life cycles of the grazer types to apply mastiff to another river it is sufficient to adjust the respective land use profile i e the longitudinal sequence of land use types note however that the river has a similar low stream order strahler stream order 1 3 in order to find the same functional types of species furthermore the transfer functions of light shading and temperature need to be fitted to the new region also see supp odd one way would be to adjust transfer functions for seasonal patterns at a high resolution i e for each week and segment alternatively the modular structure of mastiff would allow integrating spatial and temporal data from a catchment model or detailed monitoring data mastiff includes the catchment of a river in an implicit way for this purpose each river segment is equipped with a bundle of environmental attributes that influence the ecological processes of interest and respond to stressors in the area which drains in the river segment in a characteristic integral way what area drains in a specific river segment can be determined from earth observation data e g the eu hydro river network data base the same approach enabled büttner et al 2020 to show empirically that low order streams and their ecological state are particularly sensitive to agricultural activities in their catchments finally mastiff also incorporates another aspect of the aquatic terrestrial coupling namely the linkage mediated by the macroinvertebrate organisms which use specific aquatic and terrestrial habitats in their different development stage these organisms can only fully develop as a sign for ecosystem health if the interplay of these habitat types is appropriate in the river catchment for this mastiff s implicit way of incorporating the river catchment is still adequate as recent studies have shown e g muehlbauer et al 2014 that organismal exchange between a river and its catchment is restricted to a rather narrow zone along the river 4 3 3 potential of mastiff for a functional assessments of riverine ecosystems because of the importance of ecosystem services for human well being ecosystem assessments are carried out at various scales one important global initiative is ipbes the intergovernmental science policy platform for biodiversity and ecosystem services it aims at assessing future drivers of environmental change but also planned management interventions or policy options regarding their consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services the mission of ipbes is compatible with the goals of research on multiple stressors and their effects on the functioning of esp riverine ecosystems in 2016 ipbes has published a methodology for using models and scenarios for policy advice in this context ipbes 2016 the majority of models used under the roof of ipbes for assessments of effects of land use on biodiversity globio schipper et al 2020 globio aqua janse et al 2015 and ecosystem services invest are based on correlative modeling approaches the mentioned models have a certain focus on terrestrial ecosystem services and cultural aquatic ecosystem services fishing watching charismatic species mastiff opens the opportunity to incorporate an additional class regulating ecosystem services from small rivers provided by the benthic biofilm and taxa from the first trophic level of the riverine food webs in the assessment and to analyze its response to stressors caused by land use change mastiff supports mechanistically sound analyzes at the local and the regional scale to allow conclusions at national or global scales strategies for aggregation and upscaling are needed that is a task for future research as one step in this direction mastiff can be used for testing the predictive power of aggregated indicators such as the land use intensity index blüthgen et al 2013 erb et al 2013 felipe lucia et al 2020 widely used in global ecosystem assessments the lui index is defined as a proxy for the interplay of various land use related stressors e g use of fertilizers and pesticides mowing habitat conversion and calculated with an additive approach it was originally developed for predicting implications on biodiversity and the carbon cycle in cropland and grasslands mastiff can be used for testing the predictive power of the lui index for biocontrol of eutrophication as an exemplary regulating riverine ecosystem service main advantage of mastiff is that all individual stressors can be included in a mechanistically sound way and their combined effect be simulated as emerging property which accounts for trophic interactions grazer drift and dispersal and the spatiotemporal distribution of the stressor occurrence the modular structure of mastiff facilitates further integration with other models for example nutrient discharge models or mechanistic models of specific stressor effects in principle the design structure already allows to set stressors by site conditions currently stressors could be simulated that are tied to land use types nutrients shading e g clear cut climatic stressors such as increasing mean air temperature hydro morphological stressor by drift mortality and pesticides input influencing biofilm growth herbicides and attributes of organisms insecticides mastiff can be used as a virtual laboratory which allows users to switch different stressors and land use profiles along the river on and off and thereby to develop a mechanistic understanding furthermore due to the spatial and temporal extent benthic experiments in field studies are challenging compared to plankton benthic organisms have longer generation times for instance in addition drift and dispersal and even more their effect on community and ecosystem functioning are hard to quantify in field the logistically and ethical challenges and cost based restrictions to test impacts of multiple stressors can be circumvent by ecological models representing the system of interest stendera et al 2012 galic et al 2018 4 4 outlook recently mastiff connects segments as a linear river channel in order to be more realistic the segments could be arranged as a dendritic river network carraro et al 2020 yang et al 2021 2019 to analyze the importance of drift and dispersal with multiple connections a condition for the larger scale application however is that the fauna regions and the functional composition of the macroinvertebrates between source and receiving community is comparable furthermore so far nutrients were represented in a simplified way in mastiff by distinguishing between being limiting and non limiting for biofilm growth a more explicit representation of nutrient dynamics or coupling with a nutrient submodel which accounts for inputs from agricultural or urban sources could enlarge applicability of mastiff further in this paper we focused on biocontrol of eutrophication and the activity of macroinvertebrate grazers in the future mastiff can be extended to address further regulating ecosystem services provided by other functional groups from the first trophic level of riverine food webs in summary mastiff fills the gap of the application of a metacommunity approach to stressors effects and thus fulfills the need for a mechanistic understanding of stressors effects in a systematic way along the river it delivers knowledge on ecosystem functioning under anthropogenic disturbances in combination with the relevance

24413,the stability of ecological system is inseparable from the self healing ability of population therefore exploring the self healing of population after disturbance is of great significance to deeply understand the ecological stability by constructing a pair approximation model the special explicit dynamics of one population on disturbance is studied in this paper in which dynamic disturbance which can be gradually restored is used and the self healing time of the population is investigated through a mass of simulations some interesting results are obtained at a lower disturbance restoration rate the population self healing time will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance regardless of the dispersal mode of population and the existence of competition compared with local dispersal global dispersal has more obvious advantages at medium disturbance restoration rate the increase of disturbance restoration rate is not always conducive to the self healing of population and a higher disturbance restoration rate will increase the self healing time the results can give us some insights on ecological conservation keywords pair approximation self healing dynamic disturbance dispersal competition 1 introduction with the development of global climate change and industrialization the habitats of many species are under serious threats the disturbances such as natural disasters flooding fires drought etc and human influence grazing trampling sewage discharge etc liao et al 2015 will have reversible or irreversible impact on the habitat they are important factors affecting population persistence ehrlich 1995 fahrig 2001 many studies have shown that habitat destruction has a great impact not only on species persistence but also on species diversity in ecosystems hill and caswell 1999 melián and bascompte 2002 vicente et al 2006 however many studies connell and j 1978 white et al 1985 roy et al 2004 mcinerny et al 2007 have focused on the relationship between disturbance and population persistence the relationship between disturbance and population s self healing is ignored therefore we know little about the effects of different disturbances on population s self healing in fact the disturbance not only has a certain scale but also has a certain spatial correlation liao et al 2015 the autocorrelation of disturbance has a great impact on populations and communities limberger and wickham 2012 ripa and ives 2003 in addition the dispersal distance will also have a certain impact on the population schooley and branch 2007 this is something we can t ignore so we need a model considering spatial structure to simulate these conditions it enables us to deeply understand the relationship between different populations and disturbance since the pair approximation pa model was proposed by matsuda et al 1992 it has gradually attracted more and more attention and it has been used on investigating the spatial structure of species pa can take into accounts the relationship between individuals in space and can construct closed autonomous differential equation for numerical simulation therefore it has great potential on wider application nie and li 2020 in recent years some researchers improved the pa model and applied it to the field of biology bunwong 2010 hiebeler 2005 takenaka et al 1997 and many useful theoretical findings have been reached at present in exploring habitat fragmentation and species coexistence the model based on pa has obtained many good results such as investigating the impact of spatial disturbance on species persistence liao et al 2015 the coexistence of prey and predator alwan 2017 intraspecific characteristics and the impact of habitat fragmentation on species persistence ying et al 2014 but the above results are based on the instantaneous emergence and disappearance of disturbance pulse nature however in practice we know that the impact of some disturbances will not disappear instantly for example industrial pollution can destroy the habitat of population in a short time but after the pollution occurs the corresponding area needs a certain period of restoration to become a suitable area for growth again some studies also have shown that the dynamic change of habitat will have a great impact on the persistence of population dewoody et al 2005 keymer et al 2000 and the change of spatial heterogeneity over time provides useful information for management strategies munguia et al 2011 so relevant models need to be further explored in this paper we will study the self healing time of a population after gradual restoration disturbance not only study the extent and spatial correlation of disturbance but also consider the competition and different dispersal modes of population in addition in order to eliminate the influence of disturbance adding time on the results we establish a two stage pair approximation model with only once disturbance compared with the previous work table 1 the restoration of disturbance is a gradual process and self healing time of the population is concerned whether the self healing of population is successful and how long it will take are of great significance to whether manual intervention is needed in the process of ecological protection and how to quickly repair the damaged ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 model description we consider a two dimensional rectangular network composed of l l 100 100 lattices as a habitat and in order to avoid the influence of marginal effect we assume that the structure is a torus connected head to tail in order to better describe the population self healing we constructed a patch dynamic model in two stages before and after the disturbance therefore before disturbance occurs each lattice is suitable for growth there are two possible states occupied denoted by 1 or empty denoted by 0 when disturbance occurs all lattices are divided into two categories disturbed denoted by 2 and undisturbed denoted by2 it includes occupied 1 and empty 0 states in order to better construct the relevant dynamic equations we use the ρi i 0 1 2 to represent the density of each type of lattice in the overall habitat in addition ρij i j 0 1 2 represents the probability of any pair of lattices in the habitat one of which is i and the other is j and ρi j i j 0 1 2 represents the conditional probability that the neighbor of i lattice is just j lattice according to liao et al 2013a if qi i ρi i lattice is excessively dispersed low spatial correlation a lot of isolated i lattice will be generated if qi i ρi i lattice is randomly distributed random spatial correlation if qi i ρi i lattice will appear together most of the time high spatial correlation showing a high degree of aggregation according to hiebeler s inference hiebeler 2000 the qi i range is as follows 2 1 1 2 1 ρ i q i i 1 combined with the parameter description in table 2 we can make some assumptions about the model as follows 1 each lattice has one and only one state 2 individuals colonize in two ways they can only colonize the nearest neighbor s empty lattice local dispersal with a rate α1 or they can colonize any empty lattice in the habitat global dispersal with a rate α2 if all the individuals in a population are global local dispersal the population is called global local dispersal population 3 the area hit by disturbance is random 4 the species in the disturbed area die instantly and the lattice in the area becomes unsuitable lattice and then the unsuitable lattice recovers with rate r at a certain speed to an empty lattice which is suitable for the population s growth 5 individuals die with a fixed probability denoted by d and the existence of competition with a rate γ will increase individual mortality 6 the above paired lattices have rotational symmetry hiebeler 2000 i e ρ 0 1 ρ 1 0 ρ 0 1 ρ 1 0 2 2 pair approximation model pa 2 2 1 phase i free growth without disturbance for the first stage population grows freely in the environment without interference according to the description of the above model and the corresponding assumptions and patch dynamic model based on pa structure liao et al 2013b we can construct the equation of ρ1 2 2 1 d ρ 1 d t d γ q 1 1 ρ 1 k α 1 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 in formula 2 2 1 dρ1 and γq1 1ρ1 in the first part represent the reduction of population due to inherent death and competition the remaining two parts represent the population increase caused by different dispersal modes of the population 1 q1 1 q0 1 represents the probability that the occupied lattice neighbor is an empty lattice so kα1 1 q1 1 represents the population increase due to local dispersal 1 ρ1 ρ0 represents the probability of habitat unoccupied lattice and 1 k α2ρ1 1 ρ1 represents the population growth caused by global dispersal through some research results of relevant models liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 we can know that we also need to know the changes of paired lattice ρ11 in order to build a closed system 2 2 2 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 1 ρ 11 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ ρ 11 ρ 1 refer to appendix a for detailed process on the equation building therefore through the probability formula ρij qi jρj the closed system ρ11 and ρ1 of the first stage can be formed by formulas 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 2 disturbance according to the above assumptions if a disturbance occurs at time t all the lattices in the disturbed area will become unsuitable type 2 lattices while the areas 1 ρ2 not covered by the disturbed area will not change liao et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 i ii therefore the formula of population density and disturbance area change after disturbance can be obtained 2 2 3a ρ 1 t ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 2 2 3b ρ 2 t ρ 2 where ρ1 t represents the population density before the disturbance at time t similarly for the pair lattice ρij i j 0 1 it will not change in the areas ρ2 2 which are not covered by the disturbance so we have 2 2 4 ρ i j t ρ i j t ρ 2 2 where ρ2 2 represents the pair lattice density without disturbance and ρ2 ρ2 1 according to the description and probability formula of pair lattice we have 2 2 5 i ρ i j ρ j therefore after the disturbance occurs the pair lattice ρ12 t ρ1 t ρ01 t ρ11 t and the density formula of ρ12 t can be obtained according to formula 2 2 3a and 2 2 4 2 2 6 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t ρ 01 t ρ 2 2 ρ 11 t ρ 2 2 ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 01 t ρ 11 t ρ 2 2 in formula 2 2 6 since ρ01 t and ρ11 t represent the density of two types of pair lattice before being disturbed at time t there are only two types of lattices 0 and 1 in the habitat and ρ1 t ρ01 t ρ11 t can be obtained according to formula 2 2 5 so formula 2 2 6 can be further simplified to 2 2 7 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 2 combined with the above conditional probability formula ρij qi jρj and some derivation processes liao et al 2016 we can get 2 2 8 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 q 2 2 1 q 2 2 q 2 2 1 ρ 2 2 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 in addition since the occurrence of disturbance has nothing to do with other types of lattices therefore according to formula 2 2 4 2 2 7 and 2 2 8 we can obtain the density formulas of lattice ρ12 t andρ22 t after disturbance 2 2 9 ρ 22 t ρ 2 q 2 2 ρ 11 t ρ 11 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t ρ 2 1 q 2 2 2 2 3 phase ii gradual restoration of disturbance after the disturbance all kinds of lattice changes in the habitat enter the second stage in which the disturbed lattice will continue to restore and the population will gradually grow to the original level as shown in fig 1 ii to v therefore we have 2 2 10a d ρ 1 d t d γ q 1 1 ρ 1 k α 1 ρ 1 q 0 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 2 2 10b d ρ 2 d t r ρ 2 for formula 2 2 10a the first part d γq1 1 ρ1 is the population reduction caused by competition and inherent death in the latter next two parts q0 1 represents the appropriate empty lattice 0 probability next to the occupied lattice 1 therefore the first part kα1ρ1q0 1 represents the population growth caused by local dispersal and the second part 1 k α2ρ1 1 ρ1 ρ2 represents the population growth caused by global dispersal here ρ0 1 ρ1 ρ2 represents the probability of habitat as hollow lattice formula 2 2 10b indicates that the unsuitable lattice 2 due to the influence of disturbance decreases gradually at rate r like the previous equation derivation process on ρ11 combined with some research results liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 we can get the dynamic formulas of ρ11 ρ12 and ρ22 in the second stage 2 2 11a d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 1 ρ 12 ρ 11 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 12 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ ρ 11 ρ 1 2 2 11b d ρ 12 d t ρ 2 ρ 12 ρ 22 k α 1 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 12 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 1 k α 2 ρ 1 ρ 12 d r z 1 z γ ρ 11 ρ 1 2 2 11c d ρ 22 d t 2 r ρ 22 from formula 2 2 10a b and 2 2 11a b c above the closed equation of second stage can be formed by ρ1 ρ2 ρ11 ρ12 ρ22 refer to appendix a for detailed process 2 3 numerical simulation because it is very difficult to analytically solve the differential equations above we use the computer program for numerical simulation matlab2018a to further explore the time spent by population s self healing in our hypothetical habitat in the simulation process for the system in the phase i before disturbance we use ode45 to simulate set the corresponding parameters and run until the system is stable by continuously adjusting the running time we find that when the time is 200 the population density in the phase i has reached stable as shown in appendix b fig s4 record the population density ρ1 recorded as equilibrium value at this time and calculate the initial value of the phase ii after disturbance through formulas 2 2 3 and 2 2 9 in order to ensure that the population takes the same time to produce offspring we use the euler method botsaris 1978 to simulate the phase ii and set the step of time t as 1 when the change of corresponding numerical is less than 10 7 and the population density basically reaches the size when the phase i is stable the error between ρ1 and equilibrium value is less than10 3 in this way the system stop caused by small change before reaching the equilibrium density can be avoided we think that the phase ii system has reached stable record the t as the time consumed by the population to complete self healing in addition in order to reduce the stochastic influence the process will run 100 times and take its average value as the self healing time when the operation time of the phase ii reaches the maximum 2000 we believe that the population cannot recover due to too serious disturbance at the same time in order to avoid the phenomenon that population cannot survive under normal conditions we first run the above equation to get equilibrium without using disturbance to explore the range of birth rate and mortality appendix b fig s3 and finally a set of values of birth rate and mortality is selected as the parameters in further numerical simulation 3 results we first explored the impact of disturbance restoration rates at high r 0 9 medium r 0 5 and low r 0 1 levels on the completion time of population s self healing under the joint action of disturbance extent ρ2 and disturbance spatial correlation q2 2 without competition fig 2 as the same as our intuition the greater the disturbance extent the longer the self healing time in addition when no competition exists from the upper three subfigures of local dispersal fig 2a1 a3 under the condition of low restoration rate the self healing completion time t is hardly affected by the disturbance spatial correlation fig 2a1 but with the increase of restoration rate the self healing time is affected by the disturbance spatial correlation fig 2a3 however the global dispersal will not have a similar phenomenon the self healing time will not be affected by the disturbance spatial correlation regardless of the disturbance restoration rate fig 2b1 b3 when competition exists the self healing time of global dispersal population and local dispersal population at lower disturbance restoration rate is not affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance but at higher disturbance restoration rate the self healing time will increase due to the increase of disturbance spatial correlation fig 3 a2 b2 and appendix b fig s1 it can be seen from fig 3 that although the lower disturbance restoration rate offsets the impact of disturbance spatial correlation on population self healing it greatly increases the time of population self healing as can be seen from fig 4 a1 a2 for local dispersal population with the continuous increase of disturbance restoration rate r whether competition γ exists the self healing time of population first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally increases rapidly moreover sensitivity to disturbance spatial correlation will appear only when the restoration rate is greater than a certain value fig 4 a1 2 3 a2 2 3 and this result is consistent with the conclusions of figs 2 and 3 however for the global dispersal population when competition does not exist the self healing time first decreases rapidly with the increase of disturbance restoration rate and then tends to be stable there will be no rapid increase and will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance fig 4b1 when competition exists same situation can be found in the local dispersal population with the increase of disturbance restoration rate the self healing time of population first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally increases rapidly fig 4b2 in the mixed dispersal model we analyzed the population s self healing time under different disturbance restoration rates in the presence of competition fig 5 it is not difficult to find that only under the medium r 0 5 restoration rate the self healing time increases significantly with the increase of the fraction of local dispersal while under the high r 0 9 and low r 0 1 levels of disturbance restoration rates the self healing time of population basically remains unchanged and this phenomenon will not change with the increase of disturbance degree and spatial correlation even if competition does not exist this phenomenon will not disappear appendix b fig s2 4 discussions through numerical simulation it is not difficult to find that regardless of any dispersal mode whether competition exists the greater the extent of disturbance is the longer population s self healing time fig 2 as we expected the large disturbance led to a sharp decline in the number of populations increasing the difficulty of self healing in addition some early studies believe that when the spatial correlation of disturbance is high it takes a long time for the disturbed area to form a resettlement gap cozzuol et al 2009 miller et al 2012 so the spatial correlation of the disturbance has a great impact on the persistence of local dispersal population and has little impact on the global dispersal liao et al 2013b but our result shows that at a lower disturbance restoration rate no matter how population dispersal whether competition exists the self healing time will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance fig 2a1 b1 and appendix b fig s1a1 b1 this may be because the disturbance restoration rate is low it takes a long time for the disturbed area to become a suitable area even if the spatial correlation of disturbance is very low it still takes a long time for the population to complete self healing at a higher disturbance restoration rate whether competition exists or not the self healing time of local dispersal population will be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance figs 2a3 3a2 and appendix fig s1a3 this is consistent with the study of considering disturbance as pulse property liao et al 2013b and the reason may be that although it will not take long time for the disturbed areas to become suitable areas at a higher disturbance restoration rate as mentioned in previous studies when the spatial correlation of disturbance is higher the time for the whole disturbed areas to form a resettable gap will increase cozzuol et al 2009 hence whether competition exists the self healing time will be prolonged for local dispersal population however when competition does not exist global dispersal population can get rid of the influence of disturbance spatial correlation by virtue of the advantage of dispersal distance fig 2b3 when competition exists fig 3b2 appendix b and fig s1b3 under the low disturbance spatial correlation the disturbed areas are scattered among individuals which greatly reduces the contact between individuals and weakens the influence of the competition liao et al 2013a the self healing of global dispersal population will be accelerated the colonization of the population may be severely restricted due to the low disturbance restoration rate therefore regardless of any dispersal mode whether competition exists when the lower disturbance restoration rate increases the restrictions on population colonization will gradually be weak and the self healing time will quickly decrease fig 4 a1 a2 1 b1 b2 1 under the medium disturbance restoration rate the restrictions on population colonization have not completely disappeared and the disturbed lattices among individuals will not restore soon therefore the contact probability between individuals will be reduced which effectively reduces the crowding effect especially in the presence of the competition so there will be small changes in self healing time of populations with local dispersal and global dispersal when continue to improve the restoration rate of disturbance fig 4a2 2 b2 2 under the higher disturbance restoration rate although many disturbed lattices will become empty in a short time the complete release of populations colonization makes these lattices can be occupied quickly which greatly increases the probability of contact between individuals therefore no matter what kind of dispersal mode it is when competition exists the self healing time increases significantly due crowding effect fig 4a2 3 b2 3 this is consistent with the conclusion of allee effect stephens and sutherland 1999 in addition when there is no competition and the disturbance restoration rate is higher the colonization of local dispersal populations is not limited so the local dispersal population are easier to form a small aggregation group in a short time due to the limited dispersal distance only the individuals at the outermost of the group can spread out the offspring so the self healing time is prolonged fig 4a1 in contrast the global dispersal population will not face this problem therefore the self healing time will not increase fig 4b1 3 in the case of mixed dispersal when competition exists why is the self healing time of population most affected by the proportion of local dispersal mode only at the medium disturbance restoration rate fig 5 under a higher disturbance restoration rate many disturbed lattices become empty per unit time and the connectivity of habitat will increase rapidly the self healing of local dispersal is not much worse than that of global dispersal population under a low disturbance restoration rate regardless of any dispersal method the colonization of population will be greatly limited and the self healing time will be greatly increased there is almost no difference between the two dispersal modes under the medium restoration rate although the population colonization restrictions are small the number of disturbed lattices is limited some unsuitable lattices between individuals hinder the colonization of local dispersal population while global dispersal population can colonize across these unsuitable lattices especially when the spatial correlation of disturbance is high the self healing time of local dispersal population will be longer fig 2 but the global dispersal population will not be affected therefore the global dispersal has obvious advantages over the local dispersal based on the pa model we build a new framework to explore how long it takes for population to self healing after habitat is disturbed by restorability in order to control the influence of the time of adding disturbance on the results we divide the model into two stages before disturbance and after disturbance to ensure that the application of disturbance is always after the first stage reaches equilibrium at this time the population has reached equilibrium same as previous disturbance models liao et al 2013b matsuda et al 1992 ying et al 2014 we also ignore the interaction between more neighbors harada and iwasa 1994 matsuda et al 1992 but compared with these models we not only consider the spatial correlation of the disturbance but also consider that the disturbance has the characteristics of gradual restoration so that we can better simulate the self healing time of the ecological system in practice in addition for the euler method used in the article to conduct numerical simulation although its accurate value has a certain error compared with the reality in this paper we do not care about the specific density of population balance but explore the change trend of population s self healing time t value of the system reaching equilibrium again under the influence of some factors therefore euler method not only can reduce the operation time but also effectively solve the corresponding problems similarly the selection of species birth rate and mortality will only affect the final population density and will not affect the corresponding results of course for the model in this paper we only consider two extreme dispersal modes and their simple combination in practice the dispersal modes of species are diverse and complex such as the dispersal mode conforming to gaussian distribution liao et al 2015 but these two dispersal modes are of great significance for analyzing the impact of dispersal on ecology bertuzzo et al 2011 hastings and harrison 1994 tilman and kareiva 1997 so they are widely used in many ecological models liao et al 2015 therefore our model also has certain significance for ecological protection especially in ecological restoration when the environment is damaged differently such as fire flood overgrazing and pollution the restoration rate of disturbance can be changed through manual intervention to realize rapid self healing and realize some other benefits for example the rapid restoration of grassland will help to increase the output value of pasture rational use of pesticides to eliminate pests hiebeler et al 2016 hiebeler and hill 2016 etc at the same time the experiment also shows that the rapid restoration of invasive species can be inhibited and dominated by changing the damage degree and spatial correlation for example shea r z controls the correlation of disturbance through experiment to prevent the invasion of thistle zhang and shea 2012 therefore the conclusion of this paper gives some insights for ecological

ρ11 in the first stage a1 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 01 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z q 1 01 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ q 1 11 in formula a1 the first part represents the process that the lattice changes from 01 or 10 to 11 that is the empty lattice is occupied by colonization at this time for local dispersal it can be formed by two situations the first is that the offspring generated by its neighbor 1 occupies the 0 lattice expressed as 2ρ01kα1 z and the second case is occupied by the offspring formed by the occupied lattice in the other z 1 neighbors of the 0 lattice expressed as 2ρ01kα1 1 1 z q1 01 it is relatively simple for global dispersal the 0 lattice can be occupied by any offspring so it can be represented by 2ρ01 1 k α2ρ1 the second part of the formula represents the process that the lattice changes from 11 to 10 or 01 that is the lattice changes due to death this process consists of two cases the first is caused by the inherent mortality of species 2ρ11d and the second is caused by competition it can be divided into two cases one is caused by the competition between 11 neighbors expressed as 2ρ11γ z the other is the death caused by competition with the lattice occupied by other z 1 neighbors expressed as 2ρ11γq1 11 z 1 z qi jk qi j can be guided by the even pair approximation method so formula a1 can be simplified as follows a2 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 01 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z q 1 0 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ q 1 1 in addition we also know the following formula a3 q i j ρ i j ρ j i ρ i j ρ j therefore formula a2 can be changed into the following formula formula 2 2 2 a4 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 1 ρ 11 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ ρ 11 ρ 1 next let s construct the dynamic equations of ρ11 ρ12 and ρ22 in the second stage firstly ρ11 has no change compared with the equation in the first stage so the corresponding formula can refer to formula a1 a4 secondly ρ12 dynamic equation is a5 d ρ 12 d t ρ 02 k α 1 1 1 z q 1 02 1 k α 2 ρ 1 ρ 12 r d z 1 z γ q 1 12 in formula a5 the first part represents the process that lattice 02 becomes 12 that is the process that 0 lattice is occupied due to reproduction therefore for local dispersal it is occupied by the generation offspring of type 1 lattice in the other z 1 neighbors expressed as ρ02kα1 1 1 z q1 02 while for global dispersal the generation offspring generated globally can occupy the lattice so it is recorded as ρ02 1 k α2ρ1 the second part of the formula represents the process of lattice 12 becoming 02 or 10 in which the former case is a change caused by death so it can be divided into death caused by inherent mortality of species ρ12d and death caused by intraspecific competition ρ12γq1 12 z 1 z for the latter case it is the process that the disturbed lattice becomes a normal lattice which is recorded as ρ12r finally the dynamic equation of ρ22 a6 d ρ 22 d t 2 r ρ 22 relatively simple the lattice 22 becomes 20 or 02 due to the restoration of disturbance in combination with formula

24413,the stability of ecological system is inseparable from the self healing ability of population therefore exploring the self healing of population after disturbance is of great significance to deeply understand the ecological stability by constructing a pair approximation model the special explicit dynamics of one population on disturbance is studied in this paper in which dynamic disturbance which can be gradually restored is used and the self healing time of the population is investigated through a mass of simulations some interesting results are obtained at a lower disturbance restoration rate the population self healing time will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance regardless of the dispersal mode of population and the existence of competition compared with local dispersal global dispersal has more obvious advantages at medium disturbance restoration rate the increase of disturbance restoration rate is not always conducive to the self healing of population and a higher disturbance restoration rate will increase the self healing time the results can give us some insights on ecological conservation keywords pair approximation self healing dynamic disturbance dispersal competition 1 introduction with the development of global climate change and industrialization the habitats of many species are under serious threats the disturbances such as natural disasters flooding fires drought etc and human influence grazing trampling sewage discharge etc liao et al 2015 will have reversible or irreversible impact on the habitat they are important factors affecting population persistence ehrlich 1995 fahrig 2001 many studies have shown that habitat destruction has a great impact not only on species persistence but also on species diversity in ecosystems hill and caswell 1999 melián and bascompte 2002 vicente et al 2006 however many studies connell and j 1978 white et al 1985 roy et al 2004 mcinerny et al 2007 have focused on the relationship between disturbance and population persistence the relationship between disturbance and population s self healing is ignored therefore we know little about the effects of different disturbances on population s self healing in fact the disturbance not only has a certain scale but also has a certain spatial correlation liao et al 2015 the autocorrelation of disturbance has a great impact on populations and communities limberger and wickham 2012 ripa and ives 2003 in addition the dispersal distance will also have a certain impact on the population schooley and branch 2007 this is something we can t ignore so we need a model considering spatial structure to simulate these conditions it enables us to deeply understand the relationship between different populations and disturbance since the pair approximation pa model was proposed by matsuda et al 1992 it has gradually attracted more and more attention and it has been used on investigating the spatial structure of species pa can take into accounts the relationship between individuals in space and can construct closed autonomous differential equation for numerical simulation therefore it has great potential on wider application nie and li 2020 in recent years some researchers improved the pa model and applied it to the field of biology bunwong 2010 hiebeler 2005 takenaka et al 1997 and many useful theoretical findings have been reached at present in exploring habitat fragmentation and species coexistence the model based on pa has obtained many good results such as investigating the impact of spatial disturbance on species persistence liao et al 2015 the coexistence of prey and predator alwan 2017 intraspecific characteristics and the impact of habitat fragmentation on species persistence ying et al 2014 but the above results are based on the instantaneous emergence and disappearance of disturbance pulse nature however in practice we know that the impact of some disturbances will not disappear instantly for example industrial pollution can destroy the habitat of population in a short time but after the pollution occurs the corresponding area needs a certain period of restoration to become a suitable area for growth again some studies also have shown that the dynamic change of habitat will have a great impact on the persistence of population dewoody et al 2005 keymer et al 2000 and the change of spatial heterogeneity over time provides useful information for management strategies munguia et al 2011 so relevant models need to be further explored in this paper we will study the self healing time of a population after gradual restoration disturbance not only study the extent and spatial correlation of disturbance but also consider the competition and different dispersal modes of population in addition in order to eliminate the influence of disturbance adding time on the results we establish a two stage pair approximation model with only once disturbance compared with the previous work table 1 the restoration of disturbance is a gradual process and self healing time of the population is concerned whether the self healing of population is successful and how long it will take are of great significance to whether manual intervention is needed in the process of ecological protection and how to quickly repair the damaged ecosystem 2 methods 2 1 model description we consider a two dimensional rectangular network composed of l l 100 100 lattices as a habitat and in order to avoid the influence of marginal effect we assume that the structure is a torus connected head to tail in order to better describe the population self healing we constructed a patch dynamic model in two stages before and after the disturbance therefore before disturbance occurs each lattice is suitable for growth there are two possible states occupied denoted by 1 or empty denoted by 0 when disturbance occurs all lattices are divided into two categories disturbed denoted by 2 and undisturbed denoted by2 it includes occupied 1 and empty 0 states in order to better construct the relevant dynamic equations we use the ρi i 0 1 2 to represent the density of each type of lattice in the overall habitat in addition ρij i j 0 1 2 represents the probability of any pair of lattices in the habitat one of which is i and the other is j and ρi j i j 0 1 2 represents the conditional probability that the neighbor of i lattice is just j lattice according to liao et al 2013a if qi i ρi i lattice is excessively dispersed low spatial correlation a lot of isolated i lattice will be generated if qi i ρi i lattice is randomly distributed random spatial correlation if qi i ρi i lattice will appear together most of the time high spatial correlation showing a high degree of aggregation according to hiebeler s inference hiebeler 2000 the qi i range is as follows 2 1 1 2 1 ρ i q i i 1 combined with the parameter description in table 2 we can make some assumptions about the model as follows 1 each lattice has one and only one state 2 individuals colonize in two ways they can only colonize the nearest neighbor s empty lattice local dispersal with a rate α1 or they can colonize any empty lattice in the habitat global dispersal with a rate α2 if all the individuals in a population are global local dispersal the population is called global local dispersal population 3 the area hit by disturbance is random 4 the species in the disturbed area die instantly and the lattice in the area becomes unsuitable lattice and then the unsuitable lattice recovers with rate r at a certain speed to an empty lattice which is suitable for the population s growth 5 individuals die with a fixed probability denoted by d and the existence of competition with a rate γ will increase individual mortality 6 the above paired lattices have rotational symmetry hiebeler 2000 i e ρ 0 1 ρ 1 0 ρ 0 1 ρ 1 0 2 2 pair approximation model pa 2 2 1 phase i free growth without disturbance for the first stage population grows freely in the environment without interference according to the description of the above model and the corresponding assumptions and patch dynamic model based on pa structure liao et al 2013b we can construct the equation of ρ1 2 2 1 d ρ 1 d t d γ q 1 1 ρ 1 k α 1 ρ 1 1 q 1 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 in formula 2 2 1 dρ1 and γq1 1ρ1 in the first part represent the reduction of population due to inherent death and competition the remaining two parts represent the population increase caused by different dispersal modes of the population 1 q1 1 q0 1 represents the probability that the occupied lattice neighbor is an empty lattice so kα1 1 q1 1 represents the population increase due to local dispersal 1 ρ1 ρ0 represents the probability of habitat unoccupied lattice and 1 k α2ρ1 1 ρ1 represents the population growth caused by global dispersal through some research results of relevant models liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 we can know that we also need to know the changes of paired lattice ρ11 in order to build a closed system 2 2 2 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 1 ρ 11 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 2 ρ 11 d γ z z 1 z γ ρ 11 ρ 1 refer to appendix a for detailed process on the equation building therefore through the probability formula ρij qi jρj the closed system ρ11 and ρ1 of the first stage can be formed by formulas 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 2 2 2 disturbance according to the above assumptions if a disturbance occurs at time t all the lattices in the disturbed area will become unsuitable type 2 lattices while the areas 1 ρ2 not covered by the disturbed area will not change liao et al 2016 as shown in fig 1 i ii therefore the formula of population density and disturbance area change after disturbance can be obtained 2 2 3a ρ 1 t ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 2 2 3b ρ 2 t ρ 2 where ρ1 t represents the population density before the disturbance at time t similarly for the pair lattice ρij i j 0 1 it will not change in the areas ρ2 2 which are not covered by the disturbance so we have 2 2 4 ρ i j t ρ i j t ρ 2 2 where ρ2 2 represents the pair lattice density without disturbance and ρ2 ρ2 1 according to the description and probability formula of pair lattice we have 2 2 5 i ρ i j ρ j therefore after the disturbance occurs the pair lattice ρ12 t ρ1 t ρ01 t ρ11 t and the density formula of ρ12 t can be obtained according to formula 2 2 3a and 2 2 4 2 2 6 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t ρ 01 t ρ 2 2 ρ 11 t ρ 2 2 ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 01 t ρ 11 t ρ 2 2 in formula 2 2 6 since ρ01 t and ρ11 t represent the density of two types of pair lattice before being disturbed at time t there are only two types of lattices 0 and 1 in the habitat and ρ1 t ρ01 t ρ11 t can be obtained according to formula 2 2 5 so formula 2 2 6 can be further simplified to 2 2 7 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 2 combined with the above conditional probability formula ρij qi jρj and some derivation processes liao et al 2016 we can get 2 2 8 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 q 2 2 1 q 2 2 q 2 2 1 ρ 2 2 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 in addition since the occurrence of disturbance has nothing to do with other types of lattices therefore according to formula 2 2 4 2 2 7 and 2 2 8 we can obtain the density formulas of lattice ρ12 t andρ22 t after disturbance 2 2 9 ρ 22 t ρ 2 q 2 2 ρ 11 t ρ 11 t 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 1 q 2 2 ρ 12 t ρ 1 t ρ 2 1 q 2 2 2 2 3 phase ii gradual restoration of disturbance after the disturbance all kinds of lattice changes in the habitat enter the second stage in which the disturbed lattice will continue to restore and the population will gradually grow to the original level as shown in fig 1 ii to v therefore we have 2 2 10a d ρ 1 d t d γ q 1 1 ρ 1 k α 1 ρ 1 q 0 1 1 k α 2 ρ 1 1 ρ 1 ρ 2 2 2 10b d ρ 2 d t r ρ 2 for formula 2 2 10a the first part d γq1 1 ρ1 is the population reduction caused by competition and inherent death in the latter next two parts q0 1 represents the appropriate empty lattice 0 probability next to the occupied lattice 1 therefore the first part kα1ρ1q0 1 represents the population growth caused by local dispersal and the second part 1 k α2ρ1 1 ρ1 ρ2 represents the population growth caused by global dispersal here ρ0 1 ρ1 ρ2 represents the probability of habitat as hollow lattice formula 2 2 10b indicates that the unsuitable lattice 2 due to the influence of disturbance decreases gradually at rate r like the previous equation derivation process on ρ11 combined with some research results liao et al 2013b ying et al 2014 we can get the dynamic formulas of ρ11 ρ12 and ρ22 in the second stage 2 2 11a d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 1 ρ 12 ρ 11 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z ρ 1 ρ 12 ρ 11 1 ρ 1 ρ 2

and 2 2 11a b c above the closed equation of second stage can be formed by ρ1 ρ2 ρ11 ρ12 ρ22 refer to appendix a for detailed process 2 3 numerical simulation because it is very difficult to analytically solve the differential equations above we use the computer program for numerical simulation matlab2018a to further explore the time spent by population s self healing in our hypothetical habitat in the simulation process for the system in the phase i before disturbance we use ode45 to simulate set the corresponding parameters and run until the system is stable by continuously adjusting the running time we find that when the time is 200 the population density in the phase i has reached stable as shown in appendix b fig s4 record the population density ρ1 recorded as equilibrium value at this time and calculate the initial value of the phase ii after disturbance through formulas 2 2 3 and 2 2 9 in order to ensure that the population takes the same time to produce offspring we use the euler method botsaris 1978 to simulate the phase ii and set the step of time t as 1 when the change of corresponding numerical is less than 10 7 and the population density basically reaches the size when the phase i is stable the error between ρ1 and equilibrium value is less than10 3 in this way the system stop caused by small change before reaching the equilibrium density can be avoided we think that the phase ii system has reached stable record the t as the time consumed by the population to complete self healing in addition in order to reduce the stochastic influence the process will run 100 times and take its average value as the self healing time when the operation time of the phase ii reaches the maximum 2000 we believe that the population cannot recover due to too serious disturbance at the same time in order to avoid the phenomenon that population cannot survive under normal conditions we first run the above equation to get equilibrium without using disturbance to explore the range of birth rate and mortality appendix b fig s3 and finally a set of values of birth rate and mortality is selected as the parameters in further numerical simulation 3 results we first explored the impact of disturbance restoration rates at high r 0 9 medium r 0 5 and low r 0 1 levels on the completion time of population s self healing under the joint action of disturbance extent ρ2 and disturbance spatial correlation q2 2 without competition fig 2 as the same as our intuition the greater the disturbance extent the longer the self healing time in addition when no competition exists from the upper three subfigures of local dispersal fig 2a1 a3 under the condition of low restoration rate the self healing completion time t is hardly affected by the disturbance spatial correlation fig 2a1 but with the increase of restoration rate the self healing time is affected by the disturbance spatial correlation fig 2a3 however the global dispersal will not have a similar phenomenon the self healing time will not be affected by the disturbance spatial correlation regardless of the disturbance restoration rate fig 2b1 b3 when competition exists the self healing time of global dispersal population and local dispersal population at lower disturbance restoration rate is not affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance but at higher disturbance restoration rate the self healing time will increase due to the increase of disturbance spatial correlation fig 3 a2 b2 and appendix b fig s1 it can be seen from fig 3 that although the lower disturbance restoration rate offsets the impact of disturbance spatial correlation on population self healing it greatly increases the time of population self healing as can be seen from fig 4 a1 a2 for local dispersal population with the continuous increase of disturbance restoration rate r whether competition γ exists the self healing time of population first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally increases rapidly moreover sensitivity to disturbance spatial correlation will appear only when the restoration rate is greater than a certain value fig 4 a1 2 3 a2 2 3 and this result is consistent with the conclusions of figs 2 and 3 however for the global dispersal population when competition does not exist the self healing time first decreases rapidly with the increase of disturbance restoration rate and then tends to be stable there will be no rapid increase and will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance fig 4b1 when competition exists same situation can be found in the local dispersal population with the increase of disturbance restoration rate the self healing time of population first decreases rapidly then decreases slowly and finally increases rapidly fig 4b2 in the mixed dispersal model we analyzed the population s self healing time under different disturbance restoration rates in the presence of competition fig 5 it is not difficult to find that only under the medium r 0 5 restoration rate the self healing time increases significantly with the increase of the fraction of local dispersal while under the high r 0 9 and low r 0 1 levels of disturbance restoration rates the self healing time of population basically remains unchanged and this phenomenon will not change with the increase of disturbance degree and spatial correlation even if competition does not exist this phenomenon will not disappear appendix b fig s2 4 discussions through numerical simulation it is not difficult to find that regardless of any dispersal mode whether competition exists the greater the extent of disturbance is the longer population s self healing time fig 2 as we expected the large disturbance led to a sharp decline in the number of populations increasing the difficulty of self healing in addition some early studies believe that when the spatial correlation of disturbance is high it takes a long time for the disturbed area to form a resettlement gap cozzuol et al 2009 miller et al 2012 so the spatial correlation of the disturbance has a great impact on the persistence of local dispersal population and has little impact on the global dispersal liao et al 2013b but our result shows that at a lower disturbance restoration rate no matter how population dispersal whether competition exists the self healing time will not be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance fig 2a1 b1 and appendix b fig s1a1 b1 this may be because the disturbance restoration rate is low it takes a long time for the disturbed area to become a suitable area even if the spatial correlation of disturbance is very low it still takes a long time for the population to complete self healing at a higher disturbance restoration rate whether competition exists or not the self healing time of local dispersal population will be affected by the spatial correlation of disturbance figs 2a3 3a2 and appendix fig s1a3 this is consistent with the study of considering disturbance as pulse property liao et al 2013b and the reason may be that although it will not take long time for the disturbed areas to become suitable areas at a higher disturbance restoration rate as mentioned in previous studies when the spatial correlation of disturbance is higher the time for the whole disturbed areas to form a resettable gap will increase cozzuol et al 2009 hence whether competition exists the self healing time will be prolonged for local dispersal population however when competition does not exist global dispersal population can get rid of the influence of disturbance spatial correlation by virtue of the advantage of dispersal distance fig 2b3 when competition exists fig 3b2 appendix b and fig s1b3 under the low disturbance spatial correlation the disturbed areas are scattered among individuals which greatly reduces the contact between individuals and weakens the influence of the competition liao et al 2013a the self healing of global dispersal population will be accelerated the colonization of the population may be severely restricted due to the low disturbance restoration rate therefore regardless of any dispersal mode whether competition exists when the lower disturbance restoration rate increases the restrictions on population colonization will gradually be weak and the self healing time will quickly decrease fig 4 a1 a2 1 b1 b2 1 under the medium disturbance restoration rate the restrictions on population colonization have not completely disappeared and the disturbed lattices among individuals will not restore soon therefore the contact probability between individuals will be reduced which effectively reduces the crowding effect especially in the presence of the competition so there will be small changes in self healing time of populations with local dispersal and global dispersal when continue to improve the restoration rate of disturbance fig 4a2 2 b2 2 under the higher disturbance restoration rate although many disturbed lattices will become empty in a short time the complete release of populations colonization makes these lattices can be occupied quickly which greatly increases the probability of contact between individuals therefore no matter what kind of dispersal mode it is when competition exists the self healing time increases significantly due crowding effect fig 4a2 3 b2 3 this is consistent with the conclusion of allee effect stephens and sutherland 1999 in addition when there is no competition and the disturbance restoration rate is higher the colonization of local dispersal populations is not limited so the local dispersal population are easier to form a small aggregation group in a short time due to the limited dispersal distance only the individuals at the outermost of the group can spread out the offspring so the self healing time is prolonged fig 4a1 in contrast the global dispersal population will not face this problem therefore the self healing time will not increase fig 4b1 3 in the case of mixed dispersal when competition exists why is the self healing time of population most affected by the proportion of local dispersal mode only at the medium disturbance restoration rate fig 5 under a higher disturbance restoration rate many disturbed lattices become empty per unit time and the connectivity of habitat will increase rapidly the self healing of local dispersal is not much worse than that of global dispersal population under a low disturbance restoration rate regardless of any dispersal method the colonization of population will be greatly limited and the self healing time will be greatly increased there is almost no difference between the two dispersal modes under the medium restoration rate although the population colonization restrictions are small the number of disturbed lattices is limited some unsuitable lattices between individuals hinder the colonization of local dispersal population while global dispersal population can colonize across these unsuitable lattices especially when the spatial correlation of disturbance is high the self healing time of local dispersal population will be longer fig 2 but the global dispersal population will not be affected therefore the global dispersal has obvious advantages over the local dispersal based on the pa model we build a new framework to explore how long it takes for population to self healing after habitat is disturbed by restorability in order to control the influence of the time of adding disturbance on the results we divide the model into two stages before disturbance and after disturbance to ensure that the application of disturbance is always after the first stage reaches equilibrium at this time the population has reached equilibrium same as previous disturbance models liao et al 2013b matsuda et al 1992 ying et al 2014 we also ignore the interaction between more neighbors harada and iwasa 1994 matsuda et al 1992 but compared with these models we not only consider the spatial correlation of the disturbance but also consider that the disturbance has the characteristics of gradual restoration so that we can better simulate the self healing time of the ecological system in practice in addition for the euler method used in the article to conduct numerical simulation although its accurate value has a certain error compared with the reality in this paper we do not care about the specific density of population balance but explore the change trend of population s self healing time t value of the system reaching equilibrium again under the influence of some factors therefore euler method not only can reduce the operation time but also effectively solve the corresponding problems similarly the selection of species birth rate and mortality will only affect the final population density and will not affect the corresponding results of course for the model in this paper we only consider two extreme dispersal modes and their simple combination in practice the dispersal modes of species are diverse and complex such as the dispersal mode conforming to gaussian distribution liao et al 2015 but these two dispersal modes are of great significance for analyzing the impact of dispersal on ecology bertuzzo et al 2011 hastings and harrison 1994 tilman and kareiva 1997 so they are widely used in many ecological models liao et al 2015 therefore our model also has certain significance for ecological protection especially in ecological restoration when the environment is damaged differently such as fire flood overgrazing and pollution the restoration rate of disturbance can be changed through manual intervention to realize rapid self healing and realize some other benefits for example the rapid restoration of grassland will help to increase the output value of pasture rational use of pesticides to eliminate pests hiebeler et al 2016 hiebeler and hill 2016 etc at the same time the experiment also shows that the rapid restoration of invasive species can be inhibited and dominated by changing the damage degree and spatial correlation for example shea r z controls the correlation of disturbance through experiment to prevent the invasion of thistle zhang and shea 2012 therefore the conclusion of this paper gives some insights for ecological

11 that is the empty lattice is occupied by colonization at this time for local dispersal it can be formed by two situations the first is that the offspring generated by its neighbor 1 occupies the 0 lattice expressed as 2ρ01kα1 z and the second case is occupied by the offspring formed by the occupied lattice in the other z 1 neighbors of the 0 lattice expressed as 2ρ01kα1 1 1 z q1 01 it is relatively simple for global dispersal the 0 lattice can be occupied by any offspring so it can be represented by 2ρ01 1 k α2ρ1 the second part of the formula represents the process that the lattice changes from 11 to 10 or 01 that is the lattice changes due to death this process consists of two cases the first is caused by the inherent mortality of species 2ρ11d and the second is caused by competition it can be divided into two cases one is caused by the competition between 11 neighbors expressed as 2ρ11γ z the other is the death caused by competition with the lattice occupied by other z 1 neighbors expressed as 2ρ11γq1 11 z 1 z qi jk qi j can be guided by the even pair approximation method so formula a1 can be simplified as follows a2 d ρ 11 d t 2 ρ 01 k α 1 1 z 1 1 z q 1 0 1 k α 2

in formula a5 the first part represents the process that lattice 02 becomes 12 that is the process that 0 lattice is occupied due to reproduction therefore for local dispersal it is occupied by the generation offspring of type 1 lattice in the other z 1 neighbors expressed as ρ02kα1 1 1 z q1 02 while for global dispersal the generation offspring generated globally can occupy the lattice so it is recorded as ρ02 1 k α2ρ1 the second part of the formula represents the process of lattice 12 becoming 02 or 10 in which the former case is a change caused by death so it can be divided into death caused by inherent mortality of species ρ12d and death caused by intraspecific competition ρ12γq1 12 z 1 z for the latter case it is the process that the disturbed lattice becomes a normal lattice which is recorded as ρ12r finally the dynamic equation of ρ22 a6 d ρ 22 d t 2 r ρ 22 relatively simple the lattice 22 becomes 20 or 02 due to the restoration of disturbance in combination with formula

24414,demographic processes have long been known to critically impact population level epidemic dynamics within a single ecosystem a novel pathogen may circulate among multiple species each with different seasonal demographic patterns we investigate the synergy between these different seasonal demographic processes and epidemic dynamics in a two host disease system while differences in disease burden between hosts are often explained by immunological differences behavior or social contact structures we find that different demographic patterns alone can also drive differences in disease burden over time even with only two host species most importantly we show how the timing of disease introduction relative to annual birth cycles in one species can profoundly and potentially unpredictably or unexpectedly influence disease dynamics in both host species keywords wildlife demography disease ecology invasion ecology wildlife epidemiology 1 introduction when a disease can infect multiple species within a single ecosystem exploring the coupled dynamics of processes that drive both the within and across population disease dynamics may be critical to understanding the emerging patterns in whole system level disease ecology species level variation can drive zoonotic disease emergence daszak et al 2000 dobson 2004 taylor et al 2001 affect the persistence of endangered populations experiencing pathogen invasion kat et al 1995 kock et al 1999 kennedy et al 2000 and ultimately even impact ecosystem stability holdo et al 2009 a broad variety of important factors contribute to the observed differences in host responses to generalist pathogens at both the individual and population levels fenton et al 2015 lembo et al 2008 nishiura et al 2009 johnson and hartson 2009 species level differences in population level disease burden are usually attributed to factors such as differences in between and within species contact structure craft et al 2008 behavior kat et al 1995 and physiological immune defense johnson and hartson 2009 gervasi et al 2017 however these are not the only epidemiologically relevant differences between species that may affect distribution of disease burden in multi host communities demographic patterns are known to affect disease dynamics within a single population keeling and rohani 2008 inclusion of demographic vital rates birth and death in simple epidemic models is necessary for the investigation of systems with endemic disease which would not be possible in the absence of births to produce new susceptible individuals demography is a key consideration for understanding long term disease dynamics unless the focus of specific study is on demographic factors themselves birth and death are usually modeled assuming constant values that are set equal to provide constant population size keeling and rohani 2008 critically however the assumption that vital rates are constant over time does not reflect the majority of populations in most natural ecosystems a diversity of taxa experience seasonal patterns in both births and deaths this is likely to result in significantly different predictions of disease dynamics than result from models using non seasonal constant demographic parameters altizer et al 2006 seasonality is characteristic of many disease relevant host processes in animal populations including demography behavior and immunology altizer et al 2006 it is commonly included in infection transmission terms by introducing a time dependent sinusoidal or pulsed transmission function which produces oscillatory or chaotic disease dynamics keeling and rohani 2008 instead of seasonal transmission we will focus on understanding the effects of seasonality in birth processes of host populations seasonality in birth processes is important because in scenarios in which there is no vertical transmission or maternal immunity all newborns arrive as part of the susceptible class this periodic shift in the abundance of available susceptible individuals changes the effective reproduction number r e f f anderson and may 1991 and can drop the population below its herd immunity threshold altizer et al 2006 previous modeling studies that include seasonal birth processes have either focused on single host single pathogen models ireland et al 2007 peel et al 2014 included additional seasonal processes hosseini et al 2004 or included additional differences between species bolzoni et al 2008 the disease dynamics of a one host disease model with seasonal birth are known as are the disease dynamics of models with multiple hosts and constant birth however to our knowledge seasonal host birth has not been investigated as a potential mechanism of differential disease burden in a multi host context by considering the effects of species level interactions between host populations with different demographic processes we can better understand the potential for diverse demographic patterns to themselves act as drivers of disease dynamics between species beyond differences in burden among species the timing of initial introduction of novel pathogen into a system relative to seasonal demographic processes may well influence both transient and long term disease dynamics jiao and fefferman 2021 it may be that an outbreak beginning during the lowest point in an annual birth cycle would lead to dampening of infections e g due to infection related deaths which may carry forward to reduce the severity of disease in the next demographic cycle conversely if a novel pathogen is introduced as births are increasing we may get an initial amplification of infections ultimately resulting in longer periods of transient dynamics before achieving epidemiological and consequent ecological stability characterizing the influence of relative timing of disease introduction and seasonal demographic patterns may help explain why seemingly similar multi host systems exhibit drastically different behaviors in response to novel pathogens the dilution effect hypothesis suggests that increased biodiversity may affect disease risk due to interactions between one or more host species or between host species and the pathogen keesing et al 2006 however current discussion of these effects rely on differences in ecology and immuno physiology among hosts lafferty and wood 2013 ostfeld and keesing 2013 wood and lafferty 2013 rohr et al 2019 cortez and duffy 2021 we here extend exploration of the dilution effect to consider whether differences in seasonal demography could also impact dynamics either by diluting or amplifying ecosystem level disease risk we consider a two host sir ordinary differential equation epidemic model with demography keeling and rohani 2008 anderson and may 1991 for simplicity in this initial consideration we assume only two representative demographic patterns constant birth and death rates versus seasonal birth and constant death rates we investigate the effects of species interaction between two such species on species specific disease burden for this initial exploration we eliminate any additional differences between the host species e g individual physiology immunology and or behavior and social contact patterns which have typically been considered necessary in producing and maintaining long term differences in observed patterns of disease burdens in this way we isolate the effects of differences in seasonality among population demographies in multi host systems the model system considered is clearly a drastic oversimplification of species interactions within ecosystems however only by first considering the simplest cases can we then begin to later tease apart the impact of more fully realistic diversity in demographic and etiological characteristics we therefore present this analysis as a first step towards understanding the impact diverse life histories and population demographies may have among disease hosts at driving ecosystem level disease dynamics 2 methods we consider a deterministic two host sir model with cross species infection 1 d s 1 d t a t n 1 β 11 i 1 β 21 i 2 s 1 ω 1 s 1

i 2 ω 2 r 2 our model makes the assumptions of a standard sir model with constant demography keeling and rohani 2008 anderson and may 1991 see fig 1 we assume that births occur in the susceptible class at an average per capita rate α i to population size n i and that there is no vertical transmission of disease from parents to offspring we also assume that host population 1 exhibits annual dynamics with a seasonally varying birth rate of the form 2 a t α 1 1 ε sin 2 π t ϕ where ε and ϕ are shape parameters see table 1 real world animal populations exhibit a diversity of demographic patterns and this choice of function was not intended to be globally representative but rather as a reasonable way to approximate one such pattern observed in real world populations keeling and rohani 2008 in addition to the standard sir dynamics our model incorporates cross interaction terms β 12 s 2 i 1 and β 21 s 1 i 2 to capture the effective rates of contact and disease transmission between species our model was implemented in both mathematica wolfram research 2016 and r using the epimodel package jenness et al 2015 brief descriptions of host classes and model parameters are shown in table 1 mathematical analysis to isolate the effects of differences in demographic patterns and form a baseline understanding for future work on demographic ecological and epidemiological synergies we assumed that the intra specific transmission rates were β 11 β 22 β and the inter specific cross transmission rates β 12 β 21 β c this assumption is consistent with previous multi host disease system models e g roche et al 2012 proceeding with this simplification we performed a standard qualitative analysis to answer the following questions a under what conditions might an introduced disease persist in one or both hosts and b what effect if any do seasonal birth rates have on the long term dynamics of disease simulation analysis to investigate how outbreaks shape disease patterns in seasonally varying populations we performed a simulation study of model 1 using values shown in table 1 we specifically explore how the relative timing of an outbreak can affect disease burden across populations for each set of parameter values we ran two simulations a control simulation with constant births in both populations ε 0 in eq 2 and a treatment simulation with a seasonal birth rate in population 1 ε 0 in eq 2 this ensured that there was an appropriate baseline case to use as a reference isolating the outcome for each explored scenario in the case that the average birth and death rates were equal α i ω i this also ensured that the population was in equilibrium over a single year in the absence of external factors the population size would return to its initial value during each simulation we recorded three metrics of disease burden each of which provides a different gauge of the severity of the outbreak note to avoid possible confusion arising from unequal population sizes between hosts 1 and 2 due to seasonal forcing in the births for host 1 output metrics are calculated and reported as proportions metric 1 maximum disease incidence where disease incidence is defined for population i as the number of new cases per individual per year evaluated instantaneously over the course of the simulated time interval max t 0 t max β s i t i i t β c s i t i j t n i t i

max 1 t max s i t max n i t max i i t max n i t max r i t max n i t max simulations were run with t max 100 years using time steps of 0 01 years and metrics were evaluated over the entire interval though one could also restrict these metrics to the time intervals containing only the transient or stable behavior 3 analytical results in this section we present some analytical results for our model under a few special cases first we examine a scenario in which both species have constant birth rates ε 0 with balanced demography α i ω i we show that the occurrence of disease in either population can be characterized by simple threshold r 0 which depends both on host interaction rates and demographic parameters next we examine the effects of seasonally varying birth rates on endemicity using a similar arguments as ireland et al 2007 we find that a population size can be bounded by considering the average value of the seasonal term and infection related mortalities and b disease persists in both populations whenever r 0 1 dynamics without seasonality ε 0 when ε 0 model 1 corresponds to a two host sir model with constant demography the dynamics of this model have been well studied keeling and rohani 2008 hethcote 2009 suppose that each host i starts with a positive population of susceptible individuals s i 0 s 0 0 i i 0 r i 0 0 i 1 2 summing up the equations of 1 it is easy to see that the population grows or declines exponentially whenever birth and death rates are unequal assuming that birth rates exceed death rates it is also easy to show that population can be controlled by infection related mortalities importantly model 1 has a unique endemic equilibrium s i i i r i s i i i r i under the condition that ω i α i ω i γ ω i ω i γ ω i for i 1 2 if α i exceeds its upper bound then host i experiences exponential growth with either the infection dying out or else an exponentially growing number of infected individuals keeling and rohani 2008 invasion thresholds consider the dynamics of an infection introduced into a susceptible population of 1 for notational convenience let δ i γ i ω i ω i i 1 2 assuming hosts are functionally isolated β c 0 it is easy to see that infections will increase in population i provided that 3 r ˆ 0 β s i 0 δ i β s 0 γ i ω i ω i 1 for i 1 2 this threshold r ˆ 0 is known as the basic reproduction number which reflects the average number of secondary infections being produced by an infected host in a susceptible population hethcote 2009 we can also assess the invasion potential of an infection as time varying value r ˆ e f f s i known as the effective reproduction number hethcote 2009 in general r ˆ 0 r ˆ e f f s i with equality usually occurring at the beginning of an outbreak hethcote 2009 under this interpretation an infection will continue to spread if r ˆ e f f 1 until an equilibrium is reached where the following endemicity conditions hold r ˆ e f f 1 and s i 1 r ˆ e f f endemicity in a multi host setting assuming that host interactions occur β c 0 then it is possible for a disease introduced in one population to spread to both populations to assess conditions under which this might occur we compute an average reproduction number for system 1 using the next generation operator diekmann et al 2010 following the approach of diekmann et al 2010 we find that 4 r e f f 1 2 β s 1 δ 1 β s 2 δ 2 1 2 4 β c 2 s 1 s 2 δ 1 δ 2 β s 1 δ 1 β s 2 δ 2 2 it is easy to see from 4 that r e f f is determined by the weighted contribution of infections produced by interactions among individuals from the same host class and those produced by interactions among individuals from different host classes additionally when β c 0 r e f f is multivalued and is either β s 1 δ 1 or β s 2 δ 2 thus for small values of β c this expression for r e f f interpolates between the critical values for populations 1 and 2 as expected dynamics with seasonality ε 0 in the absence of disease s i s 0 0 and i i r i 0 i 1 2 the seasonal model can be solved analytically with ε 0 for host 1 we get that 5 s 1 t s 0 e a t ω 1 t a t α 1 1 ε sin 2 π t ϕ since a t is continuous and bounded we may consider its average value a ˆ which can be shown to converge uniformly to α 1 over successively smaller intervals see discussion by ireland et al 2007 on analysis of sinusoidal rates in epidemic models based on this observation we can conclude that if α 1 ω 1 then s 1 t 0 alternatively if α 1 ω 1 then s 1 t 0 and exhibits regular seasonal cycles the seasonal model is more difficult to analyze in the presence of disease under the endemicity condition α 1 ω 1 γ 1 ω 1 ω 1 γ 1 ω 1 simulations suggest infections tend to fluctuate around a small seasonal average however the extent of seasonal variability in numbers of infectious appears to differ significantly between host populations that are otherwise nearly identical fig 2 b c one way to understand this result is by looking at the effects of between host interactions on the reproduction number r e f f in 4 although r e f f is not explicitly dependent on birth rates it is expected to vary seasonally due to changes in the number of susceptible in host 1 we can isolate the effects of between host interactions by setting β 0 in 4 under this condition we find that r e f f β c s 1 s 2 δ 1 δ 2 which corresponds to a geometric rather than arithmetic average of infections produced by individuals in either host class every generation diekmann et al 2010 thus large seasonal differences in the number of susceptible hosts may not drastically impact infection rates over the longer term 4 simulation results in this section we present results of simulations designed to evaluate how the timing of a disease outbreak influences the transient dynamics of the seasonal model when birth rates were constant the system is symmetric in both populations 1 and 2 so the disease patterns remain identical no differential disease burden when seasonality was introduced into population 1 table 2 column 2 the burden of disease in both populations increased with population 1 exhibiting the largest increase for all metrics there was only marginal difference in disease burden across populations based on our metrics tables 2 3 when the timing of the initial outbreak was changed from ϕ 0 to ϕ π the burden of disease in both populations decreased relative to the reference metrics again population 1 exhibited the largest change in disease burden we summarize these results in tables 2 and 3 to illustrate the effect of seasonality in host 1 on infection dynamics in host 2 we display the graphs of the numbers of infected individuals in the first fifteen years of the epidemic with ω i 0 fig 2 b c provides a qualitative assessment of the severity of the outbreak note the significant decrease in the disease burden in host 1 with ϕ π instead of ϕ 0 we then compute our three metrics against the entire range of possible values of ϕ and see some erratic behavior in the maximal incidence with respect to ϕ figs 3 4 we find irregular behavior in metrics 1 and 2 and it is important to note that these metrics locate maximal points in some composite function of the population data those maxima occur in the transient behavior of the system the erratic cusps occurring in fig 3 exist because as the phase varies the maximum that the metric has found decreases and a different peak in the quantity in question becomes the new maximum and that peak is rising steadily as the previous maximum falls the steady state behavior shows no such irregularity in those metrics if restricted to something like t 50 because peaks that are driven by the phase are a part of the initial transient behavior of the system the phase still has an impact on the long term population distribution fig 4 the effect of modulating the amplitude e of the birth rate α t is to amplify the effect of the phase ϕ whatever that effect is for values of ϕ that we observed with greater incidence for e 1 fixing ϕ at that value and varying e will show an increase in this incidence as e increases likewise for ϕ that showed less incidence increasing e decreases the incidence further in other words whatever the effect of ϕ increasing e will exaggerate this effect this is visible in fig 3 5 discussion the introduction of a non zero disease attributable mortality ω i was expected to qualitatively change the long term disease dynamics since it ensured that the introduction of disease perturbed the populations from their pre disease equilibrium states instead since prior to the introduction of infection the populations were demographically stable ongoing disease transmission should push the populations into decline and lead to long term extinction for both hosts however no qualitative differences were observed as expected disease prevalence increases after the swell in number of susceptible individuals produced by seasonal birth altizer et al 2006 also as predicted but of critical importance this seasonal fluctuation in disease burden in host 1 also results in seasonal oscillations in infection in the interacting host 2 population although the oscillations are not stable and decay to steady state after the single introduction the timing of introduction of infection into the host population relative to the oscillating birth cycle was also seen to be important initial infection at the beginning of the birth cycle ϕ 0 resulted in higher peak prevalence and final prevalence in host 2 amplification because the pathogen caught the up swell of susceptible individuals in host 1 increasing the magnitude of the outbreak and the endemic prevalence the difference in peak prevalence was thirty percent greater relative to when host 1 had constant demography 0142 relative to 0117 this was due to a boom in both the susceptible and infected populations in host 1 which led to increases in infection in host 2 due to cross infection conversely introducing infection at the end of host 1 s birth cycle resulted in negligible maximal disease incidence relative to when host 1 had constant demography birth and death rates constant and still equal which corresponds to a dampening effect of seasonality in host 1 that reduces disease burden in host 2 in general dampening effects resulted in lower disease burdens across both populations relative to simulations with a constant birth rate amplifying effects resulted in higher disease burdens across both populations relative to simulations with constant birth rates in both cases however there were differences in the disease burden between populations 1 and 2 that were not present with constant birth rates this means that relatively early in the transient dynamics of the system when the infection is spreading most quickly the birth rate can strongly impact the overall dynamics this finding has implications for the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystem wide disease depending then not only on ecological and physiological differences among species but also on demographic diversity represented in the ecosystem in some special cases this amplifying or dampening effect can even qualitatively change the patterns of pathogen spreading i e the transient dynamics of the system which may impact the appropriate potential intervention for instance if the pathogen invasion coincides with a higher birth rate an effective r 0 that would otherwise be somewhere below 1 in a constant birth rate scenario may instead end up greater than 1 more able to spread through the host population due to the greater number of susceptibles e g 5 this increases overall disease burden and would require more substantial intervention to mitigate conversely if the pathogen arrives during a period of lower birth rate we would expect the opposite a disease with r 0 1 under a constant birth rate might see its effective r 0 be less than 1 during this critical initial period of time due to the seasonally low number of susceptibles in this case fewer or lesser interventions may be effective from these cases we see that the strengths of amplifying and dampening effects can directly influence the necessity and strength of the appropriate disease control intervention fisman 2007 in the future additional real time disease assessments and corresponding control strategies may benefit by taking demographic timing into consideration thompson et al 2019 cauchemez et al 2006 the timing of pathogen introduction into an ecosystem containing species with annual birth cycles can significantly alter outbreak and endemic severity among all species whether the effect is a dampening or amplifying one for secondary hosts depends on time of initial disease introduction relative to birth cycles for the population through which the pathogen is introduced into the ecosystem we have demonstrated that key metrics like incidence and prevalence achieve their maximal values within transient dynamics and that these dynamics are sensitive to the phase the timing of an epidemiological event relative to the seasonal birth rate we see not only the impact of the amplitude and phase but a remarkable irregularity the maximum incidence and prevalence are not simply sinusoidal with respect to the phase they are quite sensitive to even small changes in the phase 5 1 limitations as with all models ours is a simplification of a complicated natural system patterns in observed disease dynamics will be mediated by combinations of these heterogeneities in both demographic ecological and epidemiological characteristics among species depending on the multi host system under consideration in natural multi host systems of interest there are often more than the two hosts considered in this model nishiura et al 2009 there will also be more complex types of seasonality than the annual sinusoidal season implemented in our model the shape of the seasonal birth curve can significantly alter epidemiological outcomes altizer et al 2006 ireland et al 2007 and interactions between multiple species with seasonal dynamics could also include differing periods of seasonality and number of birth pulses per year seasonality in birth rates would also imply seasonality in other processes such as host contacts to facilitate mating immune defenses and recovery that would alter dynamics host pathogen co evolution could easily result in changes in epidemiological parameters during an outbreak kock et al 1999 and affect disease burden over time reservoir populations are important for many multi host systems craft et al 2008 lembo et al 2008 kat et al 1995 kennedy et al 2000 and can result in repeated re seeding of disease into a system power and mitchell 2004 meta population dynamics can occur for both hosts and pathogens which can also alter disease dynamics despite the limitations of our model design our study serves as a proof of concept that seasonality alone can impact disease dynamics and provides qualitative understanding of the effects of species interactions between species with varying seasonality in birth this study is an initial step for further work studying the effects of seasonality in demography in multi host systems 5 2 applicability to real world disease systems extensions of this work might consider a multitude of specific different interacting demographic patterns and epidemiological susceptibilities to understand complicated disease dynamics in ecosystems that include many potential host species each with different demographic patterns however the findings we present in this initial study are most directly applicable to disease systems involving a directly transmitted disease shared between domesticated animals and their wild relatives this is because these host populations are likely to share diseases albery et al 2020 and also have reproductive seasonality consistent with our model since many domesticated mammals have evolved reduced seasonal dependence in or even non seasonal breeding in contrast to the seasonal breeding behavior characteristic of their wild relatives wilkins et al 2014 an example of such a system is that of domesticated and wild pigs since the ecology of this system matches our assumptions about continuous reproduction involving a nonseasonal breeder domestic and seasonal breeder wild or feral and because pigs are a well known source of directly transmitted diseases including zoonoses like swine and avian influenza martin et al 2017 miller et al 2017 according to our modeling results if a novel strain of avian influenza were to be introduced into a feral pig population we would expect a more severe epidemic outcome if this introduction occurred at the beginning of the wild pig population birth cycle relative to other times a more severe epidemic among swine may result in higher likelihood of spillover into humans since passage of avian influenza through pig intermediate hosts may enhance evolution of zoonotic influenza ma et al 2008 while to the best of our knowledge there are no clear examples of this pattern of infection arising in a domestic wild animal system the data that would have been needed to investigate and or describe it from such a perspective is quite specific and unlikely to have been collected analyzed in such a way as to detect this pattern unintentionally our modeling results suggest that empirical study of how seasonal timing affects epidemic severity and potential for spillover is likely to be an important factor in accurate risk estimation and effective disease management 5 3 implications our analysis establishes particularly in application to wildlife epidemiology and conservation that one must take care not to dismiss seasonal effects as negligible or easily predictable a priori the interaction amplification or dampening incidence and prevalence of the disease can all be significantly impacted by small changes in the phase or amplitude of seasonal birth rates as in fig 3 this could be particularly important for understanding multi host disease systems where the focal host species experiences continual re seeding of infections from a reservoir species searle et al 2016 marino jr et al 2019 critically this also means that interventions meant to support ecosystem biodiversity by improving annual reproductive success in managed populations may have cascading impacts beyond the species of concern our results demonstrate that disease dynamics in multi host systems can be complicated even in the absence of differences in behavior contact rates structure or immune defenses among host species seasonal births in one of the interacting species is all that is necessary to alter disease burden across all species the burden of infection in the focal species is dependent on both the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation in birth rates and the timing of invasion within the birth cycles of the interacting population critically we find the timing of disease invasion determines whether dampening or amplification occurs and the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations drives the magnitude of that effect this is certainly not the first time such cascading effects have been considered for example rinderpest infections of ruminants in the serengeti ecosystem holdo et al 2009 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such multi species epidemic models have considered diversity in demography to explore cascading epidemiological dynamics efforts to understand predict and manage ecosystem persistence and stability in response to disease related perturbations should include study of the seasonality of vital rates of all of the present species not only the species of direct concern as our study demonstrates differences in seasonal demographies can dramatically alter community and species level burdens of infection these differences in disease burden can influence outcomes of species interactions and yield dramatic cascading effects across diverse ecological scales gervasi et al 2017 minchella and scott 1991 considering the role of demographic seasonality as a mediator of species differences in disease burden which in turn influences outcomes of ecological interactions may be critical to understanding the links between ecological scales and both the potential and realized effects of disease on ecosystem function and structure especially as global climate change may alter the timing and magnitude of demographic processes in different ways even for co located species predictions of ecosystem level disease dynamics may be compromised if they fail to include explicit examination of host demographies we conclude that explicit study and incorporation of these impacts is critical in both basic understanding of real world ecosystem wide disease dynamics and in designing effective strategies for the management of wildlife outbreaks

24414,demographic processes have long been known to critically impact population level epidemic dynamics within a single ecosystem a novel pathogen may circulate among multiple species each with different seasonal demographic patterns we investigate the synergy between these different seasonal demographic processes and epidemic dynamics in a two host disease system while differences in disease burden between hosts are often explained by immunological differences behavior or social contact structures we find that different demographic patterns alone can also drive differences in disease burden over time even with only two host species most importantly we show how the timing of disease introduction relative to annual birth cycles in one species can profoundly and potentially unpredictably or unexpectedly influence disease dynamics in both host species keywords wildlife demography disease ecology invasion ecology wildlife epidemiology 1 introduction when a disease can infect multiple species within a single ecosystem exploring the coupled dynamics of processes that drive both the within and across population disease dynamics may be critical to understanding the emerging patterns in whole system level disease ecology species level variation can drive zoonotic disease emergence daszak et al 2000 dobson 2004 taylor et al 2001 affect the persistence of endangered populations experiencing pathogen invasion kat et al 1995 kock et al 1999 kennedy et al 2000 and ultimately even impact ecosystem stability holdo et al 2009 a broad variety of important factors contribute to the observed differences in host responses to generalist pathogens at both the individual and population levels fenton et al 2015 lembo et al 2008 nishiura et al 2009 johnson and hartson 2009 species level differences in population level disease burden are usually attributed to factors such as differences in between and within species contact structure craft et al 2008 behavior kat et al 1995 and physiological immune defense johnson and hartson 2009 gervasi et al 2017 however these are not the only epidemiologically relevant differences between species that may affect distribution of disease burden in multi host communities demographic patterns are known to affect disease dynamics within a single population keeling and rohani 2008 inclusion of demographic vital rates birth and death in simple epidemic models is necessary for the investigation of systems with endemic disease which would not be possible in the absence of births to produce new susceptible individuals demography is a key consideration for understanding long term disease dynamics unless the focus of specific study is on demographic factors themselves birth and death are usually modeled assuming constant values that are set equal to provide constant population size keeling and rohani 2008 critically however the assumption that vital rates are constant over time does not reflect the majority of populations in most natural ecosystems a diversity of taxa experience seasonal patterns in both births and deaths this is likely to result in significantly different predictions of disease dynamics than result from models using non seasonal constant demographic parameters altizer et al 2006 seasonality is characteristic of many disease relevant host processes in animal populations including demography behavior and immunology altizer et al 2006 it is commonly included in infection transmission terms by introducing a time dependent sinusoidal or pulsed transmission function which produces oscillatory or chaotic disease dynamics keeling and rohani 2008 instead of seasonal transmission we will focus on understanding the effects of seasonality in birth processes of host populations seasonality in birth processes is important because in scenarios in which there is no vertical transmission or maternal immunity all newborns arrive as part of the susceptible class this periodic shift in the abundance of available susceptible individuals changes the effective reproduction number r e f f anderson and may 1991 and can drop the population below its herd immunity threshold altizer et al 2006 previous modeling studies that include seasonal birth processes have either focused on single host single pathogen models ireland et al 2007 peel et al 2014 included additional seasonal processes hosseini et al 2004 or included additional differences between species bolzoni et al 2008 the disease dynamics of a one host disease model with seasonal birth are known as are the disease dynamics of models with multiple hosts and constant birth however to our knowledge seasonal host birth has not been investigated as a potential mechanism of differential disease burden in a multi host context by considering the effects of species level interactions between host populations with different demographic processes we can better understand the potential for diverse demographic patterns to themselves act as drivers of disease dynamics between species beyond differences in burden among species the timing of initial introduction of novel pathogen into a system relative to seasonal demographic processes may well influence both transient and long term disease dynamics jiao and fefferman 2021 it may be that an outbreak beginning during the lowest point in an annual birth cycle would lead to dampening of infections e g due to infection related deaths which may carry forward to reduce the severity of disease in the next demographic cycle conversely if a novel pathogen is introduced as births are increasing we may get an initial amplification of infections ultimately resulting in longer periods of transient dynamics before achieving epidemiological and consequent ecological stability characterizing the influence of relative timing of disease introduction and seasonal demographic patterns may help explain why seemingly similar multi host systems exhibit drastically different behaviors in response to novel pathogens the dilution effect hypothesis suggests that increased biodiversity may affect disease risk due to interactions between one or more host species or between host species and the pathogen keesing et al 2006 however current discussion of these effects rely on differences in ecology and immuno physiology among hosts lafferty and wood 2013 ostfeld and keesing 2013 wood and lafferty 2013 rohr et al 2019 cortez and duffy 2021 we here extend exploration of the dilution effect to consider whether differences in seasonal demography could also impact dynamics either by diluting or amplifying ecosystem level disease risk we consider a two host sir ordinary differential equation epidemic model with demography keeling and rohani 2008 anderson and may 1991 for simplicity in this initial consideration we assume only two representative demographic patterns constant birth and death rates versus seasonal birth and constant death rates we investigate the effects of species interaction between two such species on species specific disease burden for this initial exploration we eliminate any additional differences between the host species e g individual physiology immunology and or behavior and social contact patterns which have typically been considered necessary in producing and maintaining long term differences in observed patterns of disease burdens in this way we isolate the effects of differences in seasonality among population demographies in multi host systems the model system considered is clearly a drastic oversimplification of species interactions within ecosystems however only by first considering the simplest cases can we then begin to later tease apart the impact of more fully realistic diversity in demographic and etiological characteristics we therefore present this analysis as a first step towards understanding the impact diverse life histories and population demographies may have among disease hosts at driving ecosystem level disease dynamics 2 methods we consider a deterministic two host sir model with cross species infection 1 d s 1 d t a t n 1 β 11 i 1 β 21 i 2 s 1 ω 1 s 1 d i 1 d t β 11 i 1 β 21 i 2 s 1 ω 1 i 1 ω 1 i 1 γ 1 i 1 d r 1 d t γ 1 i 1 ω 1 r 1 d s 2 d t α 2 n 2 β 22 i 2 β 12 i 1 s 2 ω 2 s 2 d i 2 d t β 22 i 2 β 12 i 1 s 2 ω 2 i 2 ω 2 i 2 γ 2 i 2 d r 2 d t γ 2 i 2 ω 2 r 2 our model makes the assumptions of a standard sir model with constant demography keeling and rohani 2008 anderson and may 1991 see fig 1 we assume that births occur in the susceptible class at an average per capita rate α i to population size n i and that there is no vertical transmission of disease from parents to offspring we also assume that host population 1 exhibits annual dynamics with a seasonally varying birth rate of the form 2 a t α 1 1 ε sin 2 π t ϕ where ε and ϕ are shape parameters see table 1 real world animal populations exhibit a diversity of demographic patterns and this choice of function was not intended to be globally representative but rather as a reasonable way to approximate one such pattern observed in real world populations keeling and rohani 2008 in addition to the standard sir dynamics our model incorporates cross interaction terms β 12 s 2 i 1 and β 21 s 1 i 2 to capture the effective rates of contact and disease transmission between species our model was implemented in both mathematica wolfram research 2016 and r using the epimodel package jenness et al 2015 brief descriptions of host classes and model parameters are shown in table 1 mathematical analysis to isolate the effects of differences in demographic patterns and form a baseline understanding for future work on demographic ecological and epidemiological synergies we assumed that the intra specific transmission rates were β 11 β 22 β and the inter specific cross transmission rates β 12 β 21 β c this assumption is consistent with previous multi host disease system models e g roche et al 2012 proceeding with this simplification we performed a standard qualitative analysis to answer the following questions a under what conditions might an introduced disease persist in one or both hosts and b what effect if any do seasonal birth rates have on the long term dynamics of disease simulation analysis to investigate how outbreaks shape disease patterns in seasonally varying populations we performed a simulation study of model 1 using values shown in table 1 we specifically explore how the relative timing of an outbreak can affect disease burden across populations for each set of parameter values we ran two simulations a control simulation with constant births in both populations ε 0 in eq 2 and a treatment simulation with a seasonal birth rate in population 1 ε 0 in eq 2 this ensured that there was an appropriate baseline case to use as a reference isolating the outcome for each explored scenario in the case that the average birth and death rates were equal α i ω i this also ensured that the population was in equilibrium over a single year in the absence of external factors the population size would return to its initial value during each simulation we recorded three metrics of disease burden each of which provides a different gauge of the severity of the outbreak note to avoid possible confusion arising from unequal population sizes between hosts 1 and 2 due to seasonal forcing in the births for host 1 output metrics are calculated and reported as proportions metric 1 maximum disease incidence where disease incidence is defined for population i as the number of new cases per individual per year evaluated instantaneously over the course of the simulated time interval max t 0 t max β s i t i i t β c s i t i j t n i t i j for i j 1 2 this quantifies the maximum rate of increase in the number of infections metric 2 maximum instantaneous disease prevalence defined as the percentage of individuals in population i infected at a single time over the course of the simulated time interval max t 0 t max i i t n i t metric 3 distribution of population i in the health stages at the end of the simulation average t t max 1 t max s i t max n i t max i i t max n i t max r i t max n i t max simulations were run with t max 100 years using time steps of 0 01 years and metrics were evaluated over the entire interval though one could also restrict these metrics to the time intervals containing only the transient or stable behavior 3 analytical results in this section we present some analytical results for our model under a few special cases first we examine a scenario in which both species have constant birth rates ε 0 with balanced demography α i ω i we show that the occurrence of disease in either population can be characterized by simple threshold r 0 which depends both on host interaction rates and demographic parameters next we examine the effects of seasonally varying birth rates on endemicity using a similar arguments as ireland et al 2007 we find that a population size can be bounded by considering the average value of the seasonal term and infection related mortalities and b disease persists in both populations whenever r 0 1 dynamics without seasonality ε 0 when ε 0 model 1 corresponds to a two host sir model with constant demography the dynamics of this model have been well studied keeling and rohani 2008 hethcote 2009 suppose that each host i starts with a positive population of susceptible individuals s i 0 s 0 0 i i 0 r i 0 0 i 1 2 summing up the equations of 1 it is easy to see that the population grows or declines exponentially whenever birth and death rates are unequal assuming that birth rates exceed death rates it is also easy to show that population can be controlled by infection related mortalities importantly model 1 has a unique endemic equilibrium s i i i r i s i i i r i under the condition that ω i α i ω i γ ω i ω i γ ω i for i 1 2 if α i exceeds its upper bound then host i experiences exponential growth with either the infection dying out or else an exponentially growing number of infected individuals keeling and rohani 2008 invasion thresholds consider the dynamics of an infection introduced into a susceptible population of 1 for notational convenience let δ i γ i ω i ω i i 1 2 assuming hosts are functionally isolated β c 0 it is easy to see that infections will increase in population i provided that 3 r ˆ 0 β s i 0 δ i β s 0 γ i ω i ω i 1 for i 1 2 this threshold r ˆ 0 is known as the basic reproduction number which reflects the average number of secondary infections being produced by an infected host in a susceptible population hethcote 2009 we can also assess the invasion potential of an infection as time varying value r ˆ e f f s i known as the effective reproduction number hethcote 2009 in general r ˆ 0 r ˆ e f f s i with equality usually occurring at the beginning of an outbreak hethcote 2009 under this interpretation an infection will continue to spread if r ˆ e f f 1 until an equilibrium is reached where the following endemicity conditions hold r ˆ e f f 1 and s i 1 r ˆ e f f endemicity in a multi host setting assuming that host interactions occur β c 0 then it is possible for a disease introduced in one population to spread to both populations to assess conditions under which this might occur we compute an average reproduction number for system 1 using the next generation operator diekmann et al 2010 following the approach of diekmann et al 2010 we find that 4 r e f f 1 2 β s 1 δ 1 β s 2 δ 2 1 2 4 β c 2 s 1 s 2 δ 1 δ 2 β s 1 δ 1 β s 2 δ 2 2 it is easy to see from 4 that r e f f is determined by the weighted contribution of infections produced by interactions among individuals from the same host class and those produced by interactions among individuals from different host classes additionally when β c 0 r e f f is multivalued and is either β s 1 δ 1 or β s 2 δ 2 thus for small values of β c this expression for r e f f interpolates between the critical values for populations 1 and 2 as expected dynamics with seasonality ε 0 in the absence of disease s i s 0 0 and i i r i 0 i 1 2 the seasonal model can be solved analytically with ε 0 for host 1 we get that 5 s 1 t s 0 e a t ω 1 t a t α 1 1 ε sin 2 π t ϕ since a t is continuous and bounded we may consider its average value a ˆ which can be shown to converge uniformly to α 1 over successively smaller intervals see discussion by ireland et al 2007 on analysis of sinusoidal rates in epidemic models based on this observation we can conclude that if α 1 ω 1 then s 1 t 0 alternatively if α 1 ω 1 then s 1 t 0 and exhibits regular seasonal cycles the seasonal model is more difficult to analyze in the presence of disease under the endemicity condition α 1 ω 1 γ 1 ω 1 ω 1 γ 1 ω 1 simulations suggest infections tend to fluctuate around a small seasonal average however the extent of seasonal variability in numbers of infectious appears to differ significantly between host populations that are otherwise nearly identical fig 2 b c one way to understand this result is by looking at the effects of between host interactions on the reproduction number r e f f in 4 although r e f f is not explicitly dependent on birth rates it is expected to vary seasonally due to changes in the number of susceptible in host 1 we can isolate the effects of between host interactions by setting β 0 in 4 under this condition we find that r e f f β c s 1 s 2 δ 1 δ 2 which corresponds to a geometric rather than arithmetic average of infections produced by individuals in either host class every generation diekmann et al 2010 thus large seasonal differences in the number of susceptible hosts may not drastically impact infection rates over the longer term 4 simulation results in this section we present results of simulations designed to evaluate how the timing of a disease outbreak influences the transient dynamics of the seasonal model when birth rates were constant the system is symmetric in both populations 1 and 2 so the disease patterns remain identical no differential disease burden when seasonality was introduced into population 1 table 2 column 2 the burden of disease in both populations increased with population 1 exhibiting the largest increase for all metrics there was only marginal difference in disease burden across populations based on our metrics tables 2 3 when the timing of the initial outbreak was changed from ϕ 0 to ϕ π the burden of disease in both populations decreased relative to the reference metrics again population 1 exhibited the largest change in disease burden we summarize these results in tables 2 and 3 to illustrate the effect of seasonality in host 1 on infection dynamics in host 2 we display the graphs of the numbers of infected individuals in the first fifteen years of the epidemic with ω i 0 fig 2 b c provides a qualitative assessment of the severity of the outbreak note the significant decrease in the disease burden in host 1 with ϕ π instead of ϕ 0 we then compute our three metrics against the entire range of possible values of ϕ and see some erratic behavior in the maximal incidence with respect to ϕ figs 3 4 we find irregular behavior in metrics 1 and 2 and it is important to note that these metrics locate maximal points in some composite function of the population data those maxima occur in the transient behavior of the system the erratic cusps occurring in fig 3 exist because as the phase varies the maximum that the metric has found decreases and a different peak in the quantity in question becomes the new maximum and that peak is rising steadily as the previous maximum falls the steady state behavior shows no such irregularity in those metrics if restricted to something like t 50 because peaks that are driven by the phase are a part of the initial transient behavior of the system the phase still has an impact on the long term population distribution fig 4 the effect of modulating the amplitude e of the birth rate α t is to amplify the effect of the phase ϕ whatever that effect is for values of ϕ that we observed with greater incidence for e 1 fixing ϕ at that value and varying e will show an increase in this incidence as e increases likewise for ϕ that showed less incidence increasing e decreases the incidence further in other words whatever the effect of ϕ increasing e will exaggerate this effect this is visible in fig 3 5 discussion the introduction of a non zero disease attributable mortality ω i was expected to qualitatively change the long term disease dynamics since it ensured that the introduction of disease perturbed the populations from their pre disease equilibrium states instead since prior to the introduction of infection the populations were demographically stable ongoing disease transmission should push the populations into decline and lead to long term extinction for both hosts however no qualitative differences were observed as expected disease prevalence increases after the swell in number of susceptible individuals produced by seasonal birth altizer et al 2006 also as predicted but of critical importance this seasonal fluctuation in disease burden in host 1 also results in seasonal oscillations in infection in the interacting host 2 population although the oscillations are not stable and decay to steady state after the single introduction the timing of introduction of infection into the host population relative to the oscillating birth cycle was also seen to be important initial infection at the beginning of the birth cycle ϕ 0 resulted in higher peak prevalence and final prevalence in host 2 amplification because the pathogen caught the up swell of susceptible individuals in host 1 increasing the magnitude of the outbreak and the endemic prevalence the difference in peak prevalence was thirty percent greater relative to when host 1 had constant demography 0142 relative to 0117 this was due to a boom in both the susceptible and infected populations in host 1 which led to increases in infection in host 2 due to cross infection conversely introducing infection at the end of host 1 s birth cycle resulted in negligible maximal disease incidence relative to when host 1 had constant demography birth and death rates constant and still equal which corresponds to a dampening effect of seasonality in host 1 that reduces disease burden in host 2 in general dampening effects resulted in lower disease burdens across both populations relative to simulations with a constant birth rate amplifying effects resulted in higher disease burdens across both populations relative to simulations with constant birth rates in both cases however there were differences in the disease burden between populations 1 and 2 that were not present with constant birth rates this means that relatively early in the transient dynamics of the system when the infection is spreading most quickly the birth rate can strongly impact the overall dynamics this finding has implications for the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecosystem wide disease depending then not only on ecological and physiological differences among species but also on demographic diversity represented in the ecosystem in some special cases this amplifying or dampening effect can even qualitatively change the patterns of pathogen spreading i e the transient dynamics of the system which may impact the appropriate potential intervention for instance if the pathogen invasion coincides with a higher birth rate an effective r 0 that would otherwise be somewhere below 1 in a constant birth rate scenario may instead end up greater than 1 more able to spread through the host population due to the greater number of susceptibles e g 5 this increases overall disease burden and would require more substantial intervention to mitigate conversely if the pathogen arrives during a period of lower birth rate we would expect the opposite a disease with r 0 1 under a constant birth rate might see its effective r 0 be less than 1 during this critical initial period of time due to the seasonally low number of susceptibles in this case fewer or lesser interventions may be effective from these cases we see that the strengths of amplifying and dampening effects can directly influence the necessity and strength of the appropriate disease control intervention fisman 2007 in the future additional real time disease assessments and corresponding control strategies may benefit by taking demographic timing into consideration thompson et al 2019 cauchemez et al 2006 the timing of pathogen introduction into an ecosystem containing species with annual birth cycles can significantly alter outbreak and endemic severity among all species whether the effect is a dampening or amplifying one for secondary hosts depends on time of initial disease introduction relative to birth cycles for the population through which the pathogen is introduced into the ecosystem we have demonstrated that key metrics like incidence and prevalence achieve their maximal values within transient dynamics and that these dynamics are sensitive to the phase the timing of an epidemiological event relative to the seasonal birth rate we see not only the impact of the amplitude and phase but a remarkable irregularity the maximum incidence and prevalence are not simply sinusoidal with respect to the phase they are quite sensitive to even small changes in the phase 5 1 limitations as with all models ours is a simplification of a complicated natural system patterns in observed disease dynamics will be mediated by combinations of these heterogeneities in both demographic ecological and epidemiological characteristics among species depending on the multi host system under consideration in natural multi host systems of interest there are often more than the two hosts considered in this model nishiura et al 2009 there will also be more complex types of seasonality than the annual sinusoidal season implemented in our model the shape of the seasonal birth curve can significantly alter epidemiological outcomes altizer et al 2006 ireland et al 2007 and interactions between multiple species with seasonal dynamics could also include differing periods of seasonality and number of birth pulses per year seasonality in birth rates would also imply seasonality in other processes such as host contacts to facilitate mating immune defenses and recovery that would alter dynamics host pathogen co evolution could easily result in changes in epidemiological parameters during an outbreak kock et al 1999 and affect disease burden over time reservoir populations are important for many multi host systems craft et al 2008 lembo et al 2008 kat et al 1995 kennedy et al 2000 and can result in repeated re seeding of disease into a system power and mitchell 2004 meta population dynamics can occur for both hosts and pathogens which can also alter disease dynamics despite the limitations of our model design our study serves as a proof of concept that seasonality alone can impact disease dynamics and provides qualitative understanding of the effects of species interactions between species with varying seasonality in birth this study is an initial step for further work studying the effects of seasonality in demography in multi host systems 5 2 applicability to real world disease systems extensions of this work might consider a multitude of specific different interacting demographic patterns and epidemiological susceptibilities to understand complicated disease dynamics in ecosystems that include many potential host species each with different demographic patterns however the findings we present in this initial study are most directly applicable to disease systems involving a directly transmitted disease shared between domesticated animals and their wild relatives this is because these host populations are likely to share diseases albery et al 2020 and also have reproductive seasonality consistent with our model since many domesticated mammals have evolved reduced seasonal dependence in or even non seasonal breeding in contrast to the seasonal breeding behavior characteristic of their wild relatives wilkins et al 2014 an example of such a system is that of domesticated and wild pigs since the ecology of this system matches our assumptions about continuous reproduction involving a nonseasonal breeder domestic and seasonal breeder wild or feral and because pigs are a well known source of directly transmitted diseases including zoonoses like swine and avian influenza martin et al 2017 miller et al 2017 according to our modeling results if a novel strain of avian influenza were to be introduced into a feral pig population we would expect a more severe epidemic outcome if this introduction occurred at the beginning of the wild pig population birth cycle relative to other times a more severe epidemic among swine may result in higher likelihood of spillover into humans since passage of avian influenza through pig intermediate hosts may enhance evolution of zoonotic influenza ma et al 2008 while to the best of our knowledge there are no clear examples of this pattern of infection arising in a domestic wild animal system the data that would have been needed to investigate and or describe it from such a perspective is quite specific and unlikely to have been collected analyzed in such a way as to detect this pattern unintentionally our modeling results suggest that empirical study of how seasonal timing affects epidemic severity and potential for spillover is likely to be an important factor in accurate risk estimation and effective disease management 5 3 implications our analysis establishes particularly in application to wildlife epidemiology and conservation that one must take care not to dismiss seasonal effects as negligible or easily predictable a priori the interaction amplification or dampening incidence and prevalence of the disease can all be significantly impacted by small changes in the phase or amplitude of seasonal birth rates as in fig 3 this could be particularly important for understanding multi host disease systems where the focal host species experiences continual re seeding of infections from a reservoir species searle et al 2016 marino jr et al 2019 critically this also means that interventions meant to support ecosystem biodiversity by improving annual reproductive success in managed populations may have cascading impacts beyond the species of concern our results demonstrate that disease dynamics in multi host systems can be complicated even in the absence of differences in behavior contact rates structure or immune defenses among host species seasonal births in one of the interacting species is all that is necessary to alter disease burden across all species the burden of infection in the focal species is dependent on both the amplitude of seasonal fluctuation in birth rates and the timing of invasion within the birth cycles of the interacting population critically we find the timing of disease invasion determines whether dampening or amplification occurs and the amplitude of seasonal fluctuations drives the magnitude of that effect this is certainly not the first time such cascading effects have been considered for example rinderpest infections of ruminants in the serengeti ecosystem holdo et al 2009 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time such multi species epidemic models have considered diversity in demography to explore cascading epidemiological dynamics efforts to understand predict and manage ecosystem persistence and stability in response to disease related perturbations should include study of the seasonality of vital rates of all of the present species not only the species of direct concern as our study demonstrates differences in seasonal demographies can dramatically alter community and species level burdens of infection these differences in disease burden can influence outcomes of species interactions and yield dramatic cascading effects across diverse ecological scales gervasi et al 2017 minchella and scott 1991 considering the role of demographic seasonality as a mediator of species differences in disease burden which in turn influences outcomes of ecological interactions may be critical to understanding the links between ecological scales and both the potential and realized effects of disease on ecosystem function and structure especially as global climate change may alter the timing and magnitude of demographic processes in different ways even for co located species predictions of ecosystem level disease dynamics may be compromised if they fail to include explicit examination of host demographies we conclude that explicit study and incorporation of these impacts is critical in both basic understanding of real world ecosystem wide disease dynamics and in designing effective strategies for the management of wildlife outbreaks
