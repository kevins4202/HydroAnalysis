agriculture in punjab state of india intensive rice wheat cropping since 1970 s has caused an alarming decline of groundwater levels singh 2011a 2011b due to fast depletion of aquifers maize is one option to diversify from rice wheat system however productivity of maize during rainy season as replacement to rice is low about 5 0 mg ha 1 and is uneconomical spring maize as replacement to wheat has better prospect owing to high yield around 8 0 mg ha 1 due to less probability of pest incidence thereby gaining the attention of growers however the crop has high evapo transpiration et and irrigation needs due to hot and dry weather conditions during a large part of the growing season in this scenario the trade off is to enhance water productivity crop yield per unit of water in a review molden et al 2010 remarked that under water limitations non water factors soil fertility tillage and residues have a significant role to enhance crop water productivity water and nitrogen n have strong synergistic effects on crop yield prihar et al 2000 under water limitations over use of n reduces crop growth and yield due to imbalance between these two factors this necessitates

potential yield and interactive effects of irrigation and n regimes on water use and yield of maize for ludhiana using 16 years 2001 2016 weather data potential yields were simulated for 4 planting dates at two week intervals viz january 17 january 31 february 14 and february 28 combinations of two irrigation regimes i1 0 and i0 5 with two n rates 0 and 150 kg ha 1 were analysed for test soil representing a typical medium textured soil for january 31 and february 14 planted crop these options were also examined under two initial soil water conditions 75 and 25 of available water capacity anticipating water limitations and two initial soil mineral n status 50 and 100 kg ha 1 reflecting residual effects of n in proceeding crop mean and standard deviation were the statistical indices in the scenario analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 field study maize yield response to irrigation and n during the two cropping seasons is given in table 3 mean grain yield was greater in 2015 5 3 mg ha 1 than in 2016 4 7 mg ha 1 that can partly be attributed to weather conditions in terms of lower maximum air temperature 3 4 c during vegetative phase march and april in 2015 than in 2016 season table 2 irrigation and n had significant effects on grain yield mean yield gain with i 1 0 over i0 5 was 1 7 mg ha 1 in 2015 and 0 6 mg ha 1 in 2016 while mean n response was restricted to 100 kg n ha 1 in the two seasons there was a synergism between irrigation and n for effects on grain yield under full irrigation i1 0 regime n had significant effects with increase in n up to 150 kg ha 1 while under limited irrigation i0 5 regime n response was restricted to 50 kg ha 1with little or no gain thereafter these results on n response of maize in relation to irrigation endorse an earlier report from pakistan hammad et al 2011 that increase in n from 150 to 250 kg ha 1 increased maize yield from 5 8 to 8 5 mg ha 1 in no water stress conditions while water stress in vegetative phase caused a gain in maize yield from 4 7 to 5 4 mg ha 1 irrigation and n also had significant effects on water use and n uptake increase in irrigation from i0 5 to i1 0 increased water use by 220 230 mm while the magnitude of n effects on water use was less similar effects of irrigation and n on water use in maize were observed in an arid pandey et al 2000 and semi arid environment lenka et al 2013 greater effect of n on yield than on water use in a given irrigation regime was due to partitioning a greater fraction of water use to transpiration t component as shown in the modeling analysis table 5 grain n uptake was affected by irrigation and n regimes similar to their effects on grain yield significant effects of i1 0 over i0 5 regime on n uptake was realized while n effects were restricted to 100 kg ha 1 3 2 model evaluation the model was evaluated for simulation of harvest time biomass and grain yield and soil water and n use in variable irrigation and n regimes 3 2 1 biomass and grain yield comparison of harvest time simulated and measured above ground biomass at zero moisture for all irrigation and n treatments in the two seasons fig 1 a shows that matching between them was reasonable with data scatter close to 1 1 line the rmsd was 2 6 mg ha 1 and rmsdn was 18 9 for measured values varying between 10 2 to 20 7 mg ha 1 table 4 the trend line indicates a slight over estimation of biomass in lower range of measured data an examination of data showed that for n100 and n150 rates under i0 5 regime in 2016 season the variance in biomass simulation was very high apparently due to imbalance of n and water regime by ignoring these two data points the rmsd and rmsdn were reduced to 1 9 mg ha 1 and 14 2 importantly the trends of simulated response to irrigation and nitrogen were similar to measured responses a scatter of grain yield under different irrigation and nitrogen regime fig 1b also showed a close agreement between simulated and measured values the rmsd was 0 9 mg ha 1 with rmsdn of 19 7 for measured data varying from 3 1 to 7 6 mg ha 1 the trend line had near perfect slope ignoring n100 and n150 in i0 5 regime in 2016 improved the fit with rmsd of 0 7 mg ha 1 and rmsdn of 15 1 suggesting inadequacy of model under stressed environments singh et al 2005 reported that variance in simulation of grain yield was 5 in well watered and was more than 15 in moderately stressed winter maize in the study region nouna et al 2000 observed that performance of the ceres maize model under well watered conditions was adequate with variance less than 10 and mismatch increased variance more than 25 with increasing water stress in a mediterranean environment in another study jagtap et al 1999 reported that simulated grain yield had better correspondence with measured data for 60 than for 120 kg n ha 1in a rain fed environment in nigeria 3 2 2 water use fig 2 a shows comparison of simulated water use et drainage with measured data irrigation rainfall profile water depletion in different irrigation and n regimes in the two cropping seasons the rmsd between the two was 162 mm with rmsdn of 21 7 for measured values varying between 614 to 897 mm there was consistent under estimation of water use as indicated by slope and intercept of the trend line one reason for this could be under estimation of drainage component of water use the model considers downward distribution of soil water until dul of soil layers while under the experimental conditions drainage continues to occur even at water contents below dul arora et al 1987 xevi et al 1996 reported that rmsdn varied between 10 to 15 for soil water content in different layers simulated with ceres maize in drip irrigated maize in nebraska nouna et al 2000 observed that ceres maize simulated et of well watered maize in a mediterranean environment had little variance from measured data while that in stressed treatment had a variation of 8 0 an examination of simulated water use components in our analysis table 5 shows that seasonal et varied between 501 572 mm in 2015 and between 494 543 mm in 2016 suggesting greater effects of treatments particularly variable irrigation in 2015 these effects on et can be attributed to treatment effects on biomass and consequently grain yield table 3 due to more congenial thermal regime in 2015 than in 2016 within a given cropping season irrigation had far greater effect than n on seasonal et increase in irrigation from i0 5 to i1 0 enhanced soil water evaporation e component of et from 144 to 172 mm in n0 and from 118 to 123 mm in n150 in 2015 increase in n from n0 to n150 caused an increase in t component of et from 361 to 449 mm in i1 0 and from 357 to 384 mm in i0 5 in 2015 similar effects on et components were observed in 2016 increase in n caused an increase in t et ratio while irrigation effects on t et ratio were inconsistent greater effects of n on yield table 3 than on et table 5 was due to partitioning a greater component of et into t gajri et al 1993 arora et al 2007 the i1 0 caused 110 140 mm seasonal drainage component of water use against 0 12 mm in i0 5 due to greater irrigation input in i1 0 regime 3 2 3 nitrogen uptake comparison of simulated and measured grain n uptake in different treatments in two cropping seasons fig 2b shows that correspondence between simulated and measured values was poorer with a rmsd of 22 5 kg ha 1 and rmsdn of 30 the trend line had a slope of 1 30 that suggests over estimation more so for data in high value range ignoring n2 and n3 for i0 5 regime in 2016 season improved the fit with rmsd of 18 4 with rmsdn of 24 9 in a study involving a gradient of 20 280 kg n ha 1 in maize with water deficit in united states simulated and measured n uptake had differences to the tune of 70 kg ha 1 for highest n rate pang et al 1997 our analysis suggests that simulation of biomass grain yield soil water and nitrogen use by ceres maize model was reasonable barring few discrepancies with measured data 3 3 scenario analysis simulated potential or climate limited by switching off water and n balance modules grain yield varied across years and planting dates table 6 mean potential yield was greater 10 7 mg ha 1 for january 17 planted crop and decreased as planting was delayed till february 28 7 2 mg ha 1 this decrease can be attributed to shortening of cropping cycle from 136 to 107 day there was substantial yearly variation in yield due to climate variability the coefficient of variation cv was less in early planted crop and increased as the planting was delayed these simulated responses to planting time endorse field studies of singh 2011b who reported a grain yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 for january 17 against 6 3 mg ha 1 for february 28 crop due to lower soil thermal regime in january than in february crop development was slow that led to longer duration to pm the time to emergence was 13 d for january 17 against 7d for february 28 crop and duration to physiological maturity was 126 and 102 d for the two planted dates a comparison of potential and actual experimental yield indicates a yield gap of 1 0 3 0 mg ha 1 for different planting dates the gap being greater for early planted crop a dig of limited data on spring maize productivity in the region indicates even greater yield gap memon et al 2013 observed a yield gain from 2 8 mg ha 1 with no n to 5 7 mg ha 1 with 150 kg n ha 1 in february planted maize in pakistan similarly singh et al 2015 reported a yield increase from 4 1 mg ha 1 with partial irrigation to 5 1 mg ha 1 with full irrigation in february planted maize in north west india this yield gap can be reduced by optimizing planting time irrigation and n regimes the cumulative probability distribution of simulation grain yield and seasonal et under varying irrigation and nitrogen regimes for maize planted on january 31 and february 14 are given in fig 3 it is seen that grain yield and et probability curves had a considerable spread indicating yearly variability due to weather conditions median yield with 50 probability of exceedance was 3 6 and 3 0 mg ha 1 in i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0 regime while in n3 regime grain yield was 8 0 and 8 9 mg ha 1 in the two irrigation regimes for january 31 planted maize simulated yield was lower for february 14 planted maize the median yield was 3 3 and 2 6 mg ha 1 for i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0 regime and 7 3 and 7 6 mg ha 1 in n3 regime median et was 464 and 496 mm for i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0and 491 and 539 mm in n3 for the two irrigation regimes in january 31 planted maize in february 14 planted crop simulated et was greater than january 31 planted crop for the corresponding irrigation and nitrogen regimes these results show that irrigation and n effects on et and grain yield were synergistic these are reflected in et based water productivity table 7 it is shown that wpet was greater in january 31 than february 14 planted maize this can be attributed to greater yield and lower et for january 31 planted maize the wpet was greater with i0 5 than with i1 0 regime suggesting that increase in yield was less than proportional increase in et with i1 0 regime expectedly increase in n rate enhanced wpet and the increase was more in i1 0 than i0 5regime simulated influence of initial soil water 75 and 25 extractable water ew at 100 kg ha 1 soil mineral n on interactive effects of irrigation and n regimes on grain yield and wpet are given in table 8 it is shown that n response of grain yield for i1 0 and i0 5 regimes were comparable for initial high 75 ew and low 25 ew soil water for example at 150 kg ha 1 grain yield with i1 0 and i0 5 regime was 8 9 and 7 7 mg ha 1 at 75 ew against 8 9 and 7 5 t ha 1 at 25 ew initial wetness this suggests that effects of post sown irrigation regimes on grain yield are greater under low initial soil water the wpet was also greater under low 25 ew than under high 75 ew initial soil water the wpet decreased with increase in irrigation frequency from i0 5 to i1 0 regime the decrease was more under 75 ew than 25 ew the influence of initial soil mineral n 100 and 50 kg ha 1 in 1 5 m deep soil on interaction effects on grain yield and wpet is presented in table 9 it is shown that grain yield with initial mineral n of 100 kg ha 1 and fertilizer n of 100 kg ha 1 was comparable to that with initial mineral n of 50 kg ha 1 and fertilizer n of 150 kg ha 1 more so in i0 5 than i1 0 regime it suggests that fertilizer n should be adjusted in relation to mineral n for a given irrigation scenario the wpet was greater with high initial soil n against low soil n for comparable irrigation and fertilizer n regime 4 summary and conclusions this study has shown synergistic effects of irrigation and n on grain yield water use and n uptake performance of the ceres maize model in simulating biomass water use grain yield and n uptake was reasonable with rmsdn between simulated and measured biomass grain yield and water use of 20 while deviations for grain n uptake was 30 scenario analysis showed that yield and et based water productivity wpet were greater in january 31 than february 14 planted crop the wpet was greater with i0 5 than with i1 0 regime suggesting that increase in yield was less than proportional increase in et with i1 0 regime the wpet responses to n with increase in irrigation were greater at lower than at higher initial soil water status initial soil mineral n affected fertilizer n and irrigation regime to achieve given yield disclaimer there are no potential conflicts of interest

kg ha 1 3 2 model evaluation the model was evaluated for simulation of harvest time biomass and grain yield and soil water and n use in variable irrigation and n regimes 3 2 1 biomass and grain yield comparison of harvest time simulated and measured above ground biomass at zero moisture for all irrigation and n treatments in the two seasons fig 1 a shows that matching between them was reasonable with data scatter close to 1 1 line the rmsd was 2 6 mg ha 1 and rmsdn was 18 9 for measured values varying between 10 2 to 20 7 mg ha 1 table 4 the trend line indicates a slight over estimation of biomass in lower range of measured data an examination of data showed that for n100 and n150 rates under i0 5 regime in 2016 season the variance in biomass simulation was very high apparently due to imbalance of n and water regime by ignoring these two data points the rmsd and rmsdn were reduced to 1 9 mg ha 1 and 14 2 importantly the trends of simulated response to irrigation and nitrogen were similar to measured responses a scatter of grain yield under different irrigation and nitrogen regime fig 1b also showed a close agreement between simulated and measured values the rmsd was 0 9 mg ha 1 with rmsdn of 19 7 for measured data varying from 3 1 to 7 6 mg ha 1 the trend line had near perfect slope ignoring n100 and n150 in i0 5 regime in 2016 improved the fit with rmsd of 0 7 mg ha 1 and rmsdn of 15 1 suggesting inadequacy of model under stressed environments singh et al 2005 reported that variance in simulation of grain yield was 5 in well watered and was more than 15 in moderately stressed winter maize in the study region nouna et al 2000 observed that performance of the ceres maize model under well watered conditions was adequate with variance less than 10 and mismatch increased variance more than 25 with increasing water stress in a mediterranean environment in another study jagtap et al 1999 reported that simulated grain yield had better correspondence with measured data for 60 than for 120 kg n ha 1in a rain fed environment in nigeria 3 2 2 water use fig 2 a shows comparison of simulated water use et drainage with measured data irrigation rainfall profile water depletion in different irrigation and n regimes in the two cropping seasons the rmsd between the two was 162 mm with rmsdn of 21 7 for measured values varying between 614 to 897 mm there was consistent under estimation of water use as indicated by slope and intercept of the trend line one reason for this could be under estimation of drainage component of water use the model considers downward distribution of soil water until dul of soil layers while under the experimental conditions drainage continues to occur even at water contents below dul arora et al 1987 xevi et al 1996 reported that rmsdn varied between 10 to 15 for soil water content in different layers simulated with ceres maize in drip irrigated maize in nebraska nouna et al 2000 observed that ceres maize simulated et of well watered maize in a mediterranean environment had little variance from measured data while that in stressed treatment had a variation of 8 0 an examination of simulated water use components in our analysis table 5 shows that seasonal et varied between 501 572 mm in 2015 and between 494 543 mm in 2016 suggesting greater effects of treatments particularly variable irrigation in 2015 these effects on et can be attributed to treatment effects on biomass and consequently grain yield table 3 due to more congenial thermal regime in 2015 than in 2016 within a given cropping season irrigation had far greater effect than n on seasonal et increase in irrigation from i0 5 to i1 0 enhanced soil water evaporation e component of et from 144 to 172 mm in n0 and from 118 to 123 mm in n150 in 2015 increase in n from n0 to n150 caused an increase in t component of et from 361 to 449 mm in i1 0 and from 357 to 384 mm in i0 5 in 2015 similar effects on et components were observed in 2016 increase in n caused an increase in t et ratio while irrigation effects on t et ratio were inconsistent greater effects of n on yield table 3 than on et table 5 was due to partitioning a greater component of et into t gajri et al 1993 arora et al 2007 the i1 0 caused 110 140 mm seasonal drainage component of water use against 0 12 mm in i0 5 due to greater irrigation input in i1 0 regime 3 2 3 nitrogen uptake comparison of simulated and measured grain n uptake in different treatments in two cropping seasons fig 2b shows that correspondence between simulated and measured values was poorer with a rmsd of 22 5 kg ha 1 and rmsdn of 30 the trend line had a slope of 1 30 that suggests over estimation more so for data in high value range ignoring n2 and n3 for i0 5 regime in 2016 season improved the fit with rmsd of 18 4 with rmsdn of 24 9 in a study involving a gradient of 20 280 kg n ha 1 in maize with water deficit in united states simulated and measured n uptake had differences to the tune of 70 kg ha 1 for highest n rate pang et al 1997 our analysis suggests that simulation of biomass grain yield soil water and nitrogen use by ceres maize model was reasonable barring few discrepancies with measured data 3 3 scenario analysis simulated potential or climate limited by switching off water and n balance modules grain yield varied across years and planting dates table 6 mean potential yield was greater 10 7 mg ha 1 for january 17 planted crop and decreased as planting was delayed till february 28 7 2 mg ha 1 this decrease can be attributed to shortening of cropping cycle from 136 to 107 day there was substantial yearly variation in yield due to climate variability the coefficient of variation cv was less in early planted crop and increased as the planting was delayed these simulated responses to planting time endorse field studies of singh 2011b who reported a grain yield of 7 2 mg ha 1 for january 17 against 6 3 mg ha 1 for february 28 crop due to lower soil thermal regime in january than in february crop development was slow that led to longer duration to pm the time to emergence was 13 d for january 17 against 7d for february 28 crop and duration to physiological maturity was 126 and 102 d for the two planted dates a comparison of potential and actual experimental yield indicates a yield gap of 1 0 3 0 mg ha 1 for different planting dates the gap being greater for early planted crop a dig of limited data on spring maize productivity in the region indicates even greater yield gap memon et al 2013 observed a yield gain from 2 8 mg ha 1 with no n to 5 7 mg ha 1 with 150 kg n ha 1 in february planted maize in pakistan similarly singh et al 2015 reported a yield increase from 4 1 mg ha 1 with partial irrigation to 5 1 mg ha 1 with full irrigation in february planted maize in north west india this yield gap can be reduced by optimizing planting time irrigation and n regimes the cumulative probability distribution of simulation grain yield and seasonal et under varying irrigation and nitrogen regimes for maize planted on january 31 and february 14 are given in fig 3 it is seen that grain yield and et probability curves had a considerable spread indicating yearly variability due to weather conditions median yield with 50 probability of exceedance was 3 6 and 3 0 mg ha 1 in i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0 regime while in n3 regime grain yield was 8 0 and 8 9 mg ha 1 in the two irrigation regimes for january 31 planted maize simulated yield was lower for february 14 planted maize the median yield was 3 3 and 2 6 mg ha 1 for i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0 regime and 7 3 and 7 6 mg ha 1 in n3 regime median et was 464 and 496 mm for i0 5 and i1 0 regime in n0and 491 and 539 mm in n3 for the two irrigation regimes in january 31 planted maize in february 14 planted crop simulated et was greater than january 31 planted crop for the corresponding irrigation and nitrogen regimes these results show that irrigation and n effects on et and grain yield were synergistic these are reflected in et based water productivity table 7 it is shown that wpet was greater in january 31 than february 14 planted maize this can be attributed to greater yield and lower et for january 31 planted maize the wpet was greater with i0 5 than with i1 0 regime suggesting that increase in yield was less than proportional increase in et with i1 0 regime expectedly increase in n rate enhanced wpet and the increase was more in i1 0 than i0 5regime simulated influence of initial soil water 75 and 25 extractable water ew at 100 kg ha 1 soil mineral n on interactive effects of irrigation and n regimes on grain yield and wpet are given in table 8 it is shown that n response of grain yield for i1 0 and i0 5 regimes were comparable for initial high 75 ew and low 25 ew soil water for example at 150 kg ha 1 grain yield with i1 0 and i0 5 regime was 8 9 and 7 7 mg ha 1 at 75 ew against 8 9 and 7 5 t ha 1 at 25 ew initial wetness this suggests that effects of post sown irrigation regimes on grain yield are greater under low initial soil water the wpet was also greater under low 25 ew than under high 75 ew initial soil water the wpet decreased with increase in irrigation frequency from i0 5 to i1 0 regime the decrease was more under 75 ew than 25 ew the influence of initial soil mineral n 100 and 50 kg ha 1 in 1 5 m deep soil on interaction effects on grain yield and wpet is presented in table 9 it is shown that grain yield with initial mineral n of 100 kg ha 1 and fertilizer n of 100 kg ha 1 was comparable to that with initial mineral n of 50 kg ha 1 and fertilizer n of 150 kg ha 1 more so in i0 5 than i1 0 regime it suggests that fertilizer n should be adjusted in relation to mineral n for a given irrigation scenario the wpet was greater with high initial soil n against low soil n for comparable irrigation and fertilizer n regime 4 summary and conclusions this study has shown synergistic effects of irrigation and n on grain yield water use and n uptake performance of the ceres maize model in simulating biomass water use grain yield and n uptake was reasonable with rmsdn between simulated and measured biomass grain yield and water use of 20 while deviations for grain n uptake was 30 scenario analysis showed that yield and et based water productivity wpet were greater in january 31 than february 14 planted crop the wpet was greater with i0 5 than with i1 0 regime suggesting that increase in yield was less than proportional increase in et with i1 0 regime the wpet responses to n with increase in irrigation were greater at lower than at higher initial soil water status initial soil mineral n affected fertilizer n and irrigation regime to achieve given yield disclaimer there are no potential conflicts of interest 
11351,flowering model can accurately simulate the kernel number of maize based on the flowering characteristics and is very suitable for hybrid maize seed production where the number of pollen grain is always the main strain for kernel formation however it isn t suitable for the water deficit condition therefore the water flowering model was built by incorporating the seed set capacity of female plant into flowering model and simulating the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics in the form of water production function the experiment conducted at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university in 2014 and 2015 was used to calibrate and validate the water flowering model respectively the regression coefficient b determination coefficient r 2 relative root mean square error rrmse nash and sutcliff modelling efficiency ef average relative error are and concordance index d of willmott between the measured data and simulated results of 2015 was 0 78 0 78 0 2787 0 29 0 2501 and 0 84 respectively to some extent the model can be used to simulate kernel number in hybrid maize seed production under different water regimes in this area but the key parameter pollen density threshold pdmin is heavily influenced by meteorological factors therefore pdmin should be related to meteorological factors instead of using an average value during the flowering stage to accurately simulate kernel number using water flowering model keywords flowering characteristics water deficit relative evapotranspiration maize pollen density seed set capacity 1 introduction in hybrid maize seed production the pollen supply is always limited by the less ratio of male inbreds fonseca et al 2004 and sometimes the synchrony between pollen shed and silking is disturbed without altering crop growth rate by the unsuitable plant date of male and female inbreds most models for simulating maize yield mainly concentrate on fertilization and kernel formation but they can t take the effect of pollen density and synchrony in floral development into account fonseca et al 2004 lizaso et al 2003 flowering model lizaso et al 2003 can simulate kernel number of maize based on flowering characteristics and is very suitable for hybrid maize seed production however flowering model assumes that all the fertilized ovaries are able to develop into kernels therefore the flowering model has mainly been applied in fields with hybrid maize seed production under no stress conditions fonseca et al 2004 lizaso et al 2003 however if water deficit happens some of the fertilized ovaries will abort and can t develop into kernels alqudah et al 2011 therefore the original flowering model isn t suitable for this circumstance the seed set capacity sc of the female plant indicates the ability of pollinated female flowers to allow for pollen tube germination development and connection with the ovary carpel as well as indicating the ability of fertilized ovaries to set kernels alqudah et al 2011 bassetti and westgate 1993 kiesselbach 1980 westgate and boyer 1986b wang et al 2017 reported that the sc decreased under water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages because of the low water potential of silk and the reduction of assimilate supply therefore the sc needs to be incorporated into the flowering model in order to simulate kernel numbers under different water regimes as flowering characteristics were changing with water conditions wang et al 2017 whenever the water condition changes the flowering characteristics need to be measured all over again to accurately simulate kernel number of maize lizaso et al 2003 the laborious measurement of flowering characteristics makes the flowering model inconvenient to be applied under different water conditions it is therefore necessary to determine the effect of water deficits on the flowering characteristics to simulate kernel number accurately under different water regimes using the flowering model with a unified set of parameters the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics of maize has been studied by many researches for example water deficit at the vegetative stage delayed pollen shed time and decreased pollen shed rate of maize wang et al 2017 and water deficit at both vegetative and flowering stages decreased pollen number alqudah et al 2011 westgate and boyer 1986a delayed silking time dudley et al 1971 schoper et al 1986 and decreased silking rate the number of exposed silks and sc of ear fuad hassan et al 2008 horner and palmer 1995 westgate and boyer 1986b wilson and allison 1978 but these studies about the responses of flowering characteristics to water deficit are all qualitative and to our knowledge there is no quantitative study crop water production functions originally related crop yield with evapotranspiration at different growth stages to quantitatively describe the effects of water deficit at each growth stage on the crop yield blank 1975 jensen 1968 kang et al 2017 minhas et al 1974 stewart et al 1975 çakir 2004 treated the quantitative effects on yield of water deficit in vegetative and reproductive stages of hybrid maize using crop water production function but not in relation to the flowering characteristics recently the forms of crop water production functions were used to quantitatively describe the effects of water deficit at different growth stages on the fruit qualities of tomato chen et al 2014 therefore based on the responses of flowering characteristics to water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages in our previous study wang et al 2017 we can develop the water production function for flowering characteristics of maize inbreds for hybrid seed production to get the water sensitivity indexes and predict flowering characteristics by evapotranspiration thus the objective of this study is to develop calibrate and validate a water flowering model based on the flowering model and the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics to simulate kernel number of maize by the relative evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experiment was conducted at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m in 2014 and 2015 the female inbreds were planted on 15 apr 2014 and 16 apr 2015 six days later the first batch of male inbreds male1 was planted and another six days later the second batch of male inbreds male2 was planted the planting pattern was 5 female rows alternated with 1 male row the row spacing was 40 cm and the plant spacing was 25 cm for the female inbreds and 30 cm for the male inbreds the two batches of male inbreds were planted in the same rows alternating four plants of male1 with four plants of male2 before pollen shedding the female inbreds were detasseled the male inbreds were cut at the early yield formation stage kernel was harvested on 20 sept 2014 and 15 sept 2015 before planting basal fertilizer of 136 kg n ha 1 225 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 300 kg k2o ha 1 was spreaded over the fields top dressing of 364 kg n ha 1 was applied on 5 june 2014 and 9 june 2015 wang et al 2017 the weeds were removed manually and the pest was controlled by pyridaben there were 7 irrigation treatments in 2014 and 9 irrigation treatments in 2015 during the vegetative v from the sixth leaf stage to the tasseling stage and flowering f including tasseling pollen shedding and silking stages there were three irrigation levels i e full irrigation labelled as 2 50 of full irrigation labelled as 1 and no irrigation labelled as 0 at both stages v and f the lower irrigation limit of the full irrigated treatment v2f2 was set at 70 2 fc and upper irrigation limit was set at fc during the whole season except for the vegetative and flowering stages irrigation amount of all the treatments was maintained the same as v2f2 during the rest of season all treatments were irrigated at the same time as v2f2 wang et al 2017 soil water content was measured by trime pico tdr imko germany crop actual evapotranspiration was calculated by water balance method using the average soil moisture changes in the 0 100 cm soil layer kang et al 2000 as groundwater table is deeper than 25 m the contribution of groundwater to the soil water was negligible in the study area no surface runoff and deep drainage occurred during irrigation the irrigation amount and evapotranspiration of vegetative and flowering stages for each treatment were presented in table 1 a brief description to the measurements of the input flowering characteristics was presented in table 2 for the details of the measurement of flowering characteristics and kernel number please refer to wang et al 2017 2 2 description of water flowering model 1 the original flowering model flowering model can simulate kernel number of maize based on the flowering

is the number of measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowering model revising and calibration of pollen density threshold kernel number simulated by the original flowering model was much higher than the measured value in all the water treatments of 2014 fig 1 a with the regression coefﬁcient b of 2 22 the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 37 and the relative root mean square error rrmse of 1 2845 the original flowering model assumed that 96 of pollinated silks develop into kernels but if water deficit happens some of the fertilized ovaries will abort and can t develop into kernels therefore the original flowering model isn t suitable for this circumstance the sc indicates the ability of female flowers which have received viable pollen to set kernels when water deficit occurred at the vegetative and flowering stages the low water potential of silk and the reduction of assimilate supply caused sc decrease wang et al 2017 therefore when simulating kernel numbers under different water regimes using flowering model the sc needs to be considered however the kernel number simulated by the revised flowering model was also higher than the measured value with a b of 1 52 a r2 of 0 89 and a rrmse of 0 5628 for all the treatments of 2014 fig 1b the decrease of pollen viability may lead to an increase in the pdmin and a decrease in the kernel number thus large errors could be expected in the simulation of the kernel number in maize used for seed production under different water conditions as the pdmin was determined without quantitative pollen viability when the flowering model was developed bassetti and wesgate 1994 lizaso et al 2003 the pdmin therefore needed to be calibrated to make it suitable for the current study in which the average pollen viability during 0900 1000 was 0 41 wang et al 2017 after incorporating the sc into the flowering model the pdmin was calibrated as 285 grains cm 2 d 1 based on 7 treatments carried out in 2014 following the method of least squares between the measured and simulated kernel numbers the kernel number of maize inbreds for hybrid seed production under different water conditions in 2014 were well simulated by the revised flowering model when the pdmin was calibrated with a b of 0 98 a r2 of 0 82 and a rrmse of 0 1636 fig 1c bassetti and wesgate 1994 carried out the experiment at morris minnesota usa 45 35 n 95 54 w altitude 345 m in 1990 from 10 july to 10 august when the temperature was highest and maize was at the flowering stage the highest maximum temperature was 32 8 and there was only one day when temperature was higher than 32 in our experiments from 10 july to 10 august when the temperature was highest and maize was at the flowering stage the highest maximum temperature was 36 2 and 35 3 there were 11 and 13 days when temperature was higher than 32 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2 herrero and johnson 1980 indicated that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 32 can reduce pollen germination of many genotypes to levels near zero even though the rainfall from 10 july to 10 august was higher at wuwei in 2014 and 2015 than at morris in 1990 there was no rain when temperature was higher than 30 resulting in a higher vapor pressure deficit therefore the pollen viability of our research was lower than that in bassetti and wesgate 1994 differences in maize varieties also lead to differences in pollen viability fonseca and westgate 2005 herrero and johnson 1981 moreover the sterile pollen grains occupying the position on silks might make the fertile pollen grains hard to fall on silks thus the pdmin needed to achieve 96 kernel set was higher in our research than in bassetti and wesgate 1994 3 2 water sensitivity index of flowering characteristics the water sensitivity indexes of kf tf ke snx sc and tpd at the vegetative and flowering stages for the jensen model minhas model blank model and stewart model eq 8 11 calibrated by 7 irrigation treatments of 2014 are given in table 3 with r2 of 0 70 0 99 and rrmse of 0 0014 0 1188 the r2 of jensen model and stewart model was always at a relative high level and the rrmse was always at a relative low level the water sensitivity indexes of startshed maxshed and endshed rate and time of the two batches of male population kjg and tjg calibrated by 7 irrigation treatments of 2014 are given in table 4 with r2 of 0 57 0 96 and rrmse of 0 0015 0 0504 the ﬁeld experimental data obtained in 2015 was used to validate the water sensitivity indexes calibrated by the ﬁeld data of 2014 fig 3 shows the comparisons between the measured kf a tf b ke c snx d sc e and tpd f and the predicted values obtained from jensen minhas blank and stewart models for jensen model b was 0 95 1 03 r2 was 0 50 0 85 rrmse was 0 0047 0 1100

rrmse was 0 0095 0 4250 the performance of jensen model in predicting flowering characteristics kf tf ke snx sc and tpd was better than other three models the predicted kf tf ke snx sc and tpd were

vegetative and flowering stages on flowering characteristics kf tf ke snx sc and tpd and the water sensitivity index derived from jensen model with the experiment data of 2014 was used for predicting the kernel number of 2015 fig 4 shows the comparisons between the measured kjg and tjg and the predicted values with b of 1 00 1 07 r2 of 0 52 0 79 and rrmse of 0 0020 0 1273 the predicted values were close to the measured ones and most of the variation of the measured values was explained by the model therefore eq 12 can be used for simulating the effect of water deficit at vegetative stage on flowering characteristics kjg and tjg and the water sensitivity index derived from eq 12 with the experiment data of 2014 was used for predicting the kernel number of 2015 3 3 water flowering model validation the pdmin was calibrated as 285 grains cm 2 d 1 by the experiment data of 2014 and the water sensitivity indexes of flowering characteristics in jensen model and eq 12 were also calibrated by the experiment data of 2014 with these calibrated parameters and the measured evapotranspiration the kernel number of different water treatments in 2015 were predicted by water flowering model comparison between the measured kernel number of different irrigation treatments in 2015 and the values predicted by water flowering model was shown in fig 5 with a b of 0 78 r2 of 0 78 rrmse of 0 2787 ef of 0 29 are of 0 2501 and d of 0 84 the result was just satisfied and the proposed water flowering model can be adapted readily to accommodate a range of water conditions altering flower development and function but the model underestimated kernel number in most irrigation treatments of 2015 the main reason for the underestimated kernel number may be the unsuitable pdmin then we decreased the pdmin to predict kernel numbers of 2015 and found that when pdmin 240 grains cm 2 d 1 the performance of the model was better with b of 0 88 r2 of 0 78 rrmse of 0 2096 ef of 0 60 are of

value of 0 41 was the pollen viability during 0900 1000 of one day pollen viability was not affected by water deficit but it would decrease with increasing temperature schoper et al 1986 and decreasing humidity fonseca and westgate 2005 therefore pollen viability might be lower during midday and afternoon and would change with different meteorological conditions in other days the pdmin we got from calibration was an average value during flowering stage therefore some efforts should be taken in the future to study the relationship between the pdmin and the meteorological condition 4 conclusion when simulate kernel number under different water regimes in hybrid maize seed production the sc should be incorporated into the flowering model the kf tf ke snx sc and tpd can be predicted by the evapotranspiration of vegetative and flowering stages using jensen model and the kjg and tjg can be predicted by evapotranspiration of vegetative stage combining the above models the water flowering model was proposed to some extent it was validated but it is important to emphasize that the pdmin was based on the meteorological condition and the quantitative relationship between pdmin and meteorological factors should be developed to accurately predict kernel number using water flowering model in hybrid maize seed production acknowledgements we are grateful for financial support

11351,flowering model can accurately simulate the kernel number of maize based on the flowering characteristics and is very suitable for hybrid maize seed production where the number of pollen grain is always the main strain for kernel formation however it isn t suitable for the water deficit condition therefore the water flowering model was built by incorporating the seed set capacity of female plant into flowering model and simulating the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics in the form of water production function the experiment conducted at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university in 2014 and 2015 was used to calibrate and validate the water flowering model respectively the regression coefficient b determination coefficient r 2 relative root mean square error rrmse nash and sutcliff modelling efficiency ef average relative error are and concordance index d of willmott between the measured data and simulated results of 2015 was 0 78 0 78 0 2787 0 29 0 2501 and 0 84 respectively to some extent the model can be used to simulate kernel number in hybrid maize seed production under different water regimes in this area but the key parameter pollen density threshold pdmin is heavily influenced by meteorological factors therefore pdmin should be related to meteorological factors instead of using an average value during the flowering stage to accurately simulate kernel number using water flowering model keywords flowering characteristics water deficit relative evapotranspiration maize pollen density seed set capacity 1 introduction in hybrid maize seed production the pollen supply is always limited by the less ratio of male inbreds fonseca et al 2004 and sometimes the synchrony between pollen shed and silking is disturbed without altering crop growth rate by the unsuitable plant date of male and female inbreds most models for simulating maize yield mainly concentrate on fertilization and kernel formation but they can t take the effect of pollen density and synchrony in floral development into account fonseca et al 2004 lizaso et al 2003 flowering model lizaso et al 2003 can simulate kernel number of maize based on flowering characteristics and is very suitable for hybrid maize seed production however flowering model assumes that all the fertilized ovaries are able to develop into kernels therefore the flowering model has mainly been applied in fields with hybrid maize seed production under no stress conditions fonseca et al 2004 lizaso et al 2003 however if water deficit happens some of the fertilized ovaries will abort and can t develop into kernels alqudah et al 2011 therefore the original flowering model isn t suitable for this circumstance the seed set capacity sc of the female plant indicates the ability of pollinated female flowers to allow for pollen tube germination development and connection with the ovary carpel as well as indicating the ability of fertilized ovaries to set kernels alqudah et al 2011 bassetti and westgate 1993 kiesselbach 1980 westgate and boyer 1986b wang et al 2017 reported that the sc decreased under water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages because of the low water potential of silk and the reduction of assimilate supply therefore the sc needs to be incorporated into the flowering model in order to simulate kernel numbers under different water regimes as flowering characteristics were changing with water conditions wang et al 2017 whenever the water condition changes the flowering characteristics need to be measured all over again to accurately simulate kernel number of maize lizaso et al 2003 the laborious measurement of flowering characteristics makes the flowering model inconvenient to be applied under different water conditions it is therefore necessary to determine the effect of water deficits on the flowering characteristics to simulate kernel number accurately under different water regimes using the flowering model with a unified set of parameters the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics of maize has been studied by many researches for example water deficit at the vegetative stage delayed pollen shed time and decreased pollen shed rate of maize wang et al 2017 and water deficit at both vegetative and flowering stages decreased pollen number alqudah et al 2011 westgate and boyer 1986a delayed silking time dudley et al 1971 schoper et al 1986 and decreased silking rate the number of exposed silks and sc of ear fuad hassan et al 2008 horner and palmer 1995 westgate and boyer 1986b wilson and allison 1978 but these studies about the responses of flowering characteristics to water deficit are all qualitative and to our knowledge there is no quantitative study crop water production functions originally related crop yield with evapotranspiration at different growth stages to quantitatively describe the effects of water deficit at each growth stage on the crop yield blank 1975 jensen 1968 kang et al 2017 minhas et al 1974 stewart et al 1975 çakir 2004 treated the quantitative effects on yield of water deficit in vegetative and reproductive stages of hybrid maize using crop water production function but not in relation to the flowering characteristics recently the forms of crop water production functions were used to quantitatively describe the effects of water deficit at different growth stages on the fruit qualities of tomato chen et al 2014 therefore based on the responses of flowering characteristics to water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages in our previous study wang et al 2017 we can develop the water production function for flowering characteristics of maize inbreds for hybrid seed production to get the water sensitivity indexes and predict flowering characteristics by evapotranspiration thus the objective of this study is to develop calibrate and validate a water flowering model based on the flowering model and the effect of water deficit on flowering characteristics to simulate kernel number of maize by the relative evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment the experiment was conducted at shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city gansu province of northwest china 37 52 n 102 50 e altitude 1581 m in 2014 and 2015 the female inbreds were planted on 15

female rows alternated with 1 male row the row spacing was 40 cm and the plant spacing was 25 cm for the female inbreds and 30 cm for the male inbreds the two batches of male inbreds were planted in the same rows alternating four plants of male1 with four plants of male2 before pollen shedding the female inbreds were detasseled the male inbreds were cut at the early yield formation stage kernel

applied on 5 june 2014 and 9 june 2015 wang et al 2017 the weeds were removed manually and the pest was controlled by pyridaben there were 7 irrigation treatments in 2014 and 9 irrigation treatments in 2015 during the vegetative v from the sixth leaf stage to the tasseling stage and flowering f including tasseling pollen shedding and silking stages there were three irrigation levels i e full irrigation labelled as 2 50 of full irrigation labelled as 1 and no irrigation labelled as 0 at both stages v and f the lower irrigation limit of the full irrigated treatment v2f2 was set at 70 2 fc and upper irrigation limit was set at fc during the whole season except for the vegetative and flowering stages irrigation amount of all the treatments was maintained the same as v2f2 during the rest of season all treatments were irrigated at the same time as v2f2 wang et al 2017 soil water content was measured by trime pico tdr imko germany crop actual evapotranspiration was calculated by water balance method using the average soil moisture changes in the 0 100 cm soil layer kang et al 2000 as groundwater table is deeper than 25 m the contribution of groundwater to the soil water was negligible in the study area no surface runoff and deep drainage occurred during irrigation the irrigation amount and evapotranspiration of vegetative and flowering stages for each treatment were presented in table 1 a brief description to the measurements of the input flowering characteristics was presented in table 2 for the details of the measurement of flowering characteristics and kernel number please refer to wang et al 2017 2 2 description of water flowering model 1 the original flowering model flowering model can simulate kernel number of maize based on the flowering

is the number of measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 flowering model revising and calibration of pollen density threshold kernel number simulated by the original flowering model was much higher than the measured value in all the water treatments of 2014 fig 1 a with the regression coefﬁcient b of 2 22 the coefficient of determination r2 of 0 37 and the relative root mean square error rrmse of 1 2845 the original flowering model assumed that 96 of pollinated silks develop into kernels but if water deficit happens some of the fertilized ovaries will abort and can t develop into kernels therefore the original flowering model isn t suitable for this circumstance the sc indicates the ability of female flowers which have received viable pollen to set kernels when water deficit occurred at the vegetative and flowering stages the low water potential of silk and the reduction of assimilate supply caused sc decrease wang et al 2017 therefore when simulating kernel numbers under different water regimes using flowering model the sc needs to be considered however the kernel number simulated by the revised flowering model was also higher than the measured value with a b of 1 52 a r2 of 0 89 and a rrmse of 0 5628 for all the treatments of 2014 fig 1b the decrease of pollen viability may lead to an increase in the pdmin and a decrease in the kernel number thus large errors could be expected in the simulation of the kernel number in maize used for seed production under different water conditions as the pdmin was determined without quantitative pollen viability when the flowering model was developed bassetti and wesgate 1994 lizaso et al 2003 the pdmin therefore needed to be calibrated to make it suitable for the current study in which the average pollen viability during 0900 1000 was 0 41 wang et al 2017 after incorporating the sc into the flowering model the pdmin was calibrated as 285 grains cm 2 d 1 based on 7 treatments carried out in 2014 following the method of least squares between the measured and simulated kernel numbers the kernel number of maize inbreds for hybrid seed production under different water conditions in 2014 were well simulated by the revised flowering model when the pdmin was calibrated with a b of 0 98 a r2 of 0 82 and a rrmse of 0 1636 fig 1c bassetti and wesgate 1994 carried out the experiment at morris minnesota usa 45 35 n 95 54 w altitude 345 m in 1990 from 10 july to 10 august when the temperature was highest and maize was at the flowering stage the highest maximum temperature was 32 8 and there was only one day when temperature was higher than 32 in our experiments from 10 july to 10 august when the temperature was highest and maize was at the flowering stage the highest maximum temperature was 36 2 and 35 3 there were 11 and 13 days when temperature was higher than 32 in 2014 and 2015 respectively fig 2 herrero and johnson 1980 indicated that prolonged exposure to temperatures above 32 can reduce pollen germination of many genotypes to levels near zero even though the rainfall from 10 july to 10 august was higher at wuwei in 2014 and 2015 than at morris in 1990 there was no rain when temperature was higher than 30 resulting in a higher vapor pressure deficit therefore the pollen viability of our research was lower than that in bassetti and wesgate 1994 differences in maize varieties also lead to differences in pollen viability fonseca and westgate 2005 herrero and johnson 1981 moreover the sterile pollen grains occupying the position on silks might make the fertile pollen grains hard to fall on silks thus the pdmin needed to achieve 96 kernel set was higher in our research than in bassetti and wesgate 1994 3 2 water sensitivity index of flowering characteristics the water sensitivity

rrmse was 0 0095 0 4250 the performance of jensen model in predicting flowering characteristics kf tf ke snx sc and tpd was better than other three models the predicted kf tf ke snx sc and tpd were close to the measured ones and most of the variation of the measured values was explained by jensen model therefore jensen model can be used for simulating the effect of water deficit at the vegetative and flowering stages on flowering characteristics kf tf ke snx sc and tpd and the water sensitivity index derived from jensen model with the experiment data of 2014 was used for predicting the kernel number of 2015 fig 4 shows the comparisons between the measured kjg and tjg and the predicted values with b of 1 00 1 07 r2 of 0 52 0 79 and rrmse of 0 0020 0 1273 the predicted values were close to the measured ones and most of the variation of the measured values was explained by the model therefore eq 12 can be used for simulating the effect of water deficit at vegetative stage on flowering characteristics kjg and tjg and the water sensitivity index derived from eq 12 with the experiment data of 2014 was used for predicting the kernel number of 2015 3 3 water flowering model validation the pdmin was calibrated as 285 grains cm 2 d 1 by the experiment data of 2014 and the water sensitivity indexes of flowering characteristics in jensen model and eq 12 were also calibrated by the experiment data of 2014 with these calibrated parameters and the measured evapotranspiration the kernel number of different water treatments in 2015 were predicted by water flowering model

development and function but the model underestimated kernel number in most irrigation treatments of 2015 the main reason for the underestimated kernel number may be the unsuitable pdmin then we decreased the pdmin to predict kernel numbers of 2015 and found that when pdmin 240 grains cm 2 d 1 the performance of the model was better with b of 0 88 r2 of 0 78 rrmse of 0 2096 ef of 0 60 are of

value of 0 41 was the pollen viability during 0900 1000 of one day pollen viability was not affected by water deficit but it would decrease with increasing temperature schoper et al 1986 and decreasing humidity fonseca and westgate 2005 therefore pollen viability might be lower during midday and afternoon and would change with different meteorological conditions in other days the pdmin we got from calibration was an average value during flowering stage therefore some efforts should be taken in the future to study the relationship between the pdmin and the meteorological condition 4

11352,efficient agricultural water demand management in arid and semi arid regions is key in continuing crop production in a changing climate as such there s a need for further investigation on various crops to identify the optimum water requirements to avoid water wasting in regions that are already facing water shortage the focus of this work is to determine water requirement maize farming mazandaran province in northern iran located on the southern side of the caspian sea using landsat satellite data in order to use sebal algorithm the images were atmospheric calibrated evapotranspiration maps with rmse values equals to 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day were produced and compared to reference book rb national water document nwd and fao56 values furthermore by computing reference evapotranspiration crop coefficient curve was evaluated in order to prepare maize water requirement maps et0 in 58 weather stations throughout the province were computed and interpolated by using the daily et0 maps and resulted kc values maize water requirement maps for the cultivated area of the province were 345 16 383 99 mm the maize water requirement in the observation station of sari compared to rb and nwd values showed 20 and 41 differences and rmse was 76 and 156 mm respectively keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficient landsat gis interpolation 1 introduction irrigation of agricultural land consumes a great amount of water meanwhile more than half of that on average goes to waste due to lack of proper water management and unsound water transfer technologies in the recent years dispute over water rights has highlighted the demand for an accurate estimation method of irrigation water requirement for various crops in different regions with changing climate two main strategies can be used to improve water use in the agricultural sector 1 upgrading irrigation systems 2 improving irrigation planning and management upgrading irrigation systems and increasing irrigation efficiency is one of the most effective methods however this solution requires a lot of initial investment and government support therefore improving irrigation planning and management can be an effective useful way to improve water consumption in agriculture that the accurate water requirement value is essential for it there are two national references in iran that present crops water requirement including national water document nwd anon 1999 and reference book rb farshi et al 1997 although both of them used climatic data and fao 56 method allen et al 1990 to compute reference evapotranspiration et0 in approximately the same period 30 year data until 1997 and 1999 respectively crop evapotranspiration etc values are different for many crops such as maize in mazandaran it was found that kc values and growth period are different in some cases also in using fao 56 method to compute etc kc values are still needed so as the first step it is important to find the certain values of kc accompanied with the appropriate growth period on the other side all mentioned references are for long years ago a study in khorasan iran has shown 47 difference for et0 compared to nwd erfanian et al 2011 also a study in fars iran has shown that the water requirement for wheat oat maize sugar beet sunflower beans tomatoes and potatoes have changed significantly compared to nwd fooladmand 2012 therefore the mentioned reasons convinced us that crops water requirement must be updated water requirement is one of the water balance components and equals to crop evapotranspiration et allen et al 1990 et is soil evaporation plus plant transpiration which is the initially process of water transfer in the hydrological cycle overestimation of crop water requirement leads to waste water water logging nutrient leaching in the soil and polluting the groundwater resources underestimation of crop water requirement causes to water tension for crop which decreases the yield therefore the crops water requirement must be determined accurately the crop water requirement is determined by a couple main methods however there are other methods such as eddy covariance bowen ratio pan evaporation and so forth 1 measurement in this method et is determined by measuring the incoming and outgoing water flux into the soil such as soil water balance method or et is determined in an irrigated lysimeter by isolating the crop and assessing the water flow and putting up water balance 2 calculation in this method et is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 to the crop coefficient kc allen et al 1990 whereby et0 indicates the climatic conditions effects on the crop water requirement and is related to the vapor pressure gradient between the plant leaf stomata and that of the surrounding atmosphere also the kc serves the difference for the considered crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance related to the reference crop each one of these methods has different limitations the measurement method is time consuming and expensive furthermore the results are local based and it should be repeated in several years to be reliable the calculation method computes the potential et which is the maximum value of the actual et in addition the crops coefficients should be determined by local experiments on the other side et varies in different location and time due to variation of climatic characteristics and farmers or water managers need to have a thorough spatial and temporal understanding of its variation the mentioned methods are local based and due to variation of climatic characteristics has limitations at large area these problems have caused to develop remote sensing techniques remote sensing data currently presents a capable tool to find crops actual et at large area by spending less time and cost so that if the soil and water condition have no limitation for crop growth it equals to crop water requirement remote sensing uses the albedo ground surface temperature and infrared bands values in order to calculate spatial variations of short and long wave radiations which lead to calculate et for each pixel of images on the other side one of the most important and high yielding cereals is maize which supplies high energy and protein since the growth period of this plant is in the dry months of the year the main issue in its cultivation is water supply therefore its water requirement should be estimated accurately in order to increase its cultivated area and yield in this regard bastiaanssen et al 1998 compared the et resulted from remote sensing and sebal algorithm in china india spain and pakistan to the field measurements results showed that in 85 of the cases the resulted et from the sebal were compatible with the field measurements without any calibration also ramos et al 2009 obtained the daily et for wheat maize and grass in flumen spain using sebal the results showed that the grass et had 0 3 and 0 36 mm day difference compared to lysimetric measurements and penman monteith method respectively furthermore the et for wheat and maize had 0 6 mm day difference compared to lysimetric measurements omidvar et al 2013 compared sebal and metric algorithm on the determination of et in cultivation area in mashhad iran using aster images their results showed that both algorithms estimated the spatial distribution of et properly according to the topographic conditions and vegetation cover soheylifar et al 2013 estimated the sugarcane et in khouzestan iran using modis images and sebal algorithm resulted showed rmse 0 66 mm day and r2 0 87 compared to fao penman monteith method wheat evapotranspiration was calculated in bilevar plain iran using sebal and compared to the penman montieth method and showed a high correlation 0 83 between results qamarnia and rezvani 2015 bala et al 2016 obtained the daily et using landsat7 and sebal algorithm in india and compared to lysimetric measurements the results had rmse 0 51 mm day and mae mean absolute error 0 19 the maize et in mahidasht iran was determined using sebal and sebs algorithms and landsat tm images farhadi bansouleh et al 2015 the results compared to the lysimeter measurements showed at most 9 8 and 4 6 differences for sebal and sebs respectively actual wheat evapotranspiration was estimated by sebal and was compared to lysimetric and fao penman monteith method results sebal results had a significant correlation with lysimetric data r2 0 85 and good agreement with fao penman monteith etc rmse 0 56 rawat et al 2017 according to the studied researches landsat results are more appropriate than some other satellite results such as modis so that simaie et al 2013 indicated that crop et derived from landsat images are 2 5 times more accurate than modis images it is because the spatial resolution for modis images is 1000 m that leads to the pixel size 100 ha however the spatial resolution for landsat images are 30 m that leads to the pixel size 900 m on the other side for using modis a farm which covers at least 100 ha and having the same planting date is needed that is difficult therefore in the current study the determination of et and kc for maize using landsat images and sebal algorithm was aimed landsat8 is the latest version of the landsat satellite series and was launched in 2013 this satellite takes about 400 images a day which has a significant increase over 250 images per day by landsat 7 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was conducted in mazandaran province which is located in the north of iran fig 1 the eastern part of mazandaran province has arable land for maize cultivating which covers more than 310 000 ha and is located in 36 61 36 74 n and 52 47 53 82 it has mediterranean climate based on de martounne method although maize is mostly cultivated for silage in mazandaran this province annually faces a shortage of more than 2 million tons of silage that the major need is maize anon 2015 in this study the maize water requirement and kc values were determined for a big farm and then maize water requirement was calculated for the eastern part of mazandaran province the studied farm has a total area of 300 ha it is located in 36 36 36 40 n and 52 52 52 53 e fig 1 the studied farm has a suitable potential for maize production the average temperature and precipitation of the studied farm are 17 3 and 640 mm even though the precipitation is non uniform the needed water is obtained from groundwater resources maize is cultivated in different blocks this study was conducted in 3 consecutive years including 2014 2016 because the planting date varies in different blocks a block with the same planting date in the studied years was selected for sebal analysis it was a block covers 22 ha with clay soil texture and soil electrical conductivity equals 0 67 ds m for 2014 and 2016 and a block covers 25 ha with clay soil texture and soil electrical conductivity equals 0 85 ds m for 2015 the considered growth period was may 11 august 10 2 2 landsat images the studied images in this research were landsat 8 images during the maize growth period in 3 years 2014 2016 which were not cloudy the time series for landsat 8 is 16 days and the spatial resolution is 30 m some of the images were not usable due to cloudiness and finally 8 images were available for this study in addition to our main objective which was the determination of maize et we aimed to evaluate landsat 7 images accuracy since 2003 landsat 7 has had stripping error we used gapfill extension and triangulation method in envi package to solve this problem and then used the images the studied images characteristics are presented in table 1 2 3 estimation of crop evapotranspiration using sebal the surface energy balance algorithms for land sebal is an algorithm which estimates instantaneous and daily crop et based on experimental and physical relationships with minimal observation data which has shown appropriate results bastiaanssen et al 1998 this algorithm calculates the energy balance process based on the amount of heat flux and transmitted water vapor in each pixel for using sebal firstly the spectral radiance lλ and reflectivity ρλ should be computed for each band the spectral radiance is the outgoing radiation energy of the band that the satellite observed at the top of the atmosphere the reflectivity of a surface is the ratio of the reflected radiation flux to the incident radiation flux they are calculated using eqs 1 and 2 for landsat 8 and eqs 3 and 4 for landsat 7 anon 2016 allen et al 2002 1 lλ ml x qcal al 2 ρ λ m p q cal a p cos θ 3 lλ gain dn bias 4 ρ λ π l λ e s u n λ cos θ d r where ml al mp ap are the calibration coefficients qcal is digital number gain and bias are the calibration coefficients which refer to the values given in the header file dn is digital number esunλ is the mean solar exo atmospheric irradiance for each band θ is the solar incidence angle where θ 90 β and β is sun elevation angle and dr is the inverse squared relative earth sun distance then the main sebal equation was considered as follows bastiaanssen et al 1998 5 rn λet h g where rn is the net radiation flux at the surface λet is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat flux to the air g is the soil heat flux for finding λet the other parameters should be calculated 2 4 net radiation flux at the ground surface rn rn is computed by subtracting all outgoing radiant fluxes from all incoming radiant fluxes as eq 6 allen et al 2002 6 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo r s is the incoming shortwave radiation r l the incoming longwave radiation r l is the outgoing longwave radiation and ε

which is computed using the stefan boltzmann equation allen et al 2002 8 r l ε a σ t a 4 where εa is the atmospheric emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and ta is the near surface air temperature r l is the thermal radiation flux emitted from the earth s surface to the atmosphere allen et al 2002 9 r l ε 0 σ t s 4 where ε0 is the broad band surface emissivity σ is the stefan boltzmann constant and ts is the surface temperature which is calculated as follows 10 t s k 2 l n ε n b k 1 l 1 where k1and k2 are constants for landsat images εnb is the emissivity representing surface behavior for thermal emission in the relatively narrow band and l is the spectral radiance of thermal bands for determining ε0 and εnb three vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and leaf area index lai were calculated as follows allen et al 2002 2014 11 ndvi ρ5 ρ4 ρ5 ρ4 12 savi 1 l ρ5 ρ4 l ρ5 ρ4 13 lai 11 savi 3 for savi 0 817 14 lai 6 for savi 0 817 l is a constant for savi and ρ4 and ρ5 are reflections for bands 4 and 5 2 5 soil heat flux g soil heat flux is the heat storage into the soil due to conduction which is calculated as follows bastiaanssen 2000 15 g r n t s α 0 0032 α 0 0062 α 2 1 0 98 n d v i 4 where ts is the surface temperature α is the surface albedo and ndvi is the normalized difference vegetation index if ndvi 0 assume surface is water and if ts 4 oc and α 0 45 assume surface is snow and for these both circumstances g r n 0 5 2 6 sensible heat flux h sensible heat flux is the heat loss to the air by convection and conduction due to a temperature difference it is computed as follows allen et al 2002 16 h ρ a i r c p d t r a h where ρair is air density cp is air specific heat dt is the temperature difference between two heights that sebal consider 0 1 and 2 m and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport there are two unknown parameters rah and dt for finding h that makes this equation difficult to solve sebal uses two anchor pixels cold pixel and hot pixel for fixing boundary conditions accompanied with wind speed at a given height to facilitate this problem these two pixels have to be located in the studied area which produces reliable h and then dt the hot pixel includes dry and uncultivated agricultural land et is assumed to be zero in hot pixel the cold pixel should be selected in agricultural fields that are well irrigated and fully vegetated the composition of aerodynamic resistance with maximum and minimum sensible heat fluxes at these pixels makes possible an assessment of a range of air temperature differences near the ground surface then the surface temperature with the assumption of the linear relationship between the surface temperature and vertically heat transport slope in surface boundary layer is used to find vertical variation of temperature by determining the boundary condition rah firstly is computed for the neutral stability condition of the atmosphere and finally is corrected by considering the atmosphere stability condition as follows 17 r a h ln z 2 z 1 ψ h z 2 ψ h z 1 u k 18 u k u 200 ln 200 z o m ψ

karman s constant u200 is wind speed at 200 m height zom is the momentum roughness length 2 7 maize evapotranspiration et to find et firstly λet is calculated for each pixel as follows which is the latent heat loss from the surface due to et allen et al 2002 19 λet rn g h by this equation we find an instantaneous value of λet for the time of the satellite overpass to find instantaneous value of et the eq 20 is used as follows allen et al 2002 20 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ where etinst is the instantaneous et and λ is the latent heat of vaporization in the studies related to et the daily values of et are more useful than instantaneous values sebal uses the reference et fraction etrf as the ratio of the computed instantaneous et etinst to the reference et for alfalfa etr for the time of the satellite overpass computed by climatic data to find it the actual daily et etact 24 is finally obtained by multiplying etrf to daily reference et etr 24 as follows by considering that etrf has no variation during the day allen et al 2002 etr is determined by using the local climatic data and based on fao penman monteith method 21 e t a c t 24 e t r 24 e t i n s t e t r i n s t the results were compared to the available references the planting date is different in the available references and therefore to evaluate the results et0 for the time of the satellite overpass was calculated using climatic data and fao penman monteith method then by using rb nwd and fao56 recommended kc values the maize water requirement for these references were determined the difference was expressed by rmse as follows 22 rmse 1 n i 1 n et c i et c i 2 0 5 where etci is the maize et computed by sebal algorithm and etci is the maize et calculated by using et0 and recommended kc values of rb nwd and fao56 since in the current study the planting date was different in the different blocks a block was selected in each year for analyzing the selected blocks in 3 studied years had the same irrigation and agricultural management the same soil texture no water tension no salinity tension and no limitation for plant growth furthermore since the maize et varied in the different pixels their frequency distribution graph in the selected block was determined and the mean water requirement was calculated as follows 23 e t c m e a n i 1 n e t c i f i i 1 n f i where etci is water requirement for each pixel and fi is its frequency 2 8 maize crop coefficient to find maize crop coefficient the resulted maize et is divided to et0 and then crop coefficient curve was obtained based on fao56 instructions the difference between the resulted kc in this study and recommended kc values of rb nwd and fao56 were expressed by difference percentage and rmse 2 9 maize water requirement maps the resulted kc values can be used for finding water requirement in the area with the same climatic conditions therefore producing the daily maize water requirement map in the eastern part of mazandaran province was aimed thus the daily climatic data for 15 years 2001 2016 for 58 weather stations were collected et0 was calculated using fao penman monteith method in the weather stations then they were interpolated using deterministic and geostatistical methods and et0 maps were produced the deterministic methods include global polynomial interpolator gpi local polynomial interpolator lpi and inverse distance weighting idw and the geostatistical method includes ordinary kriging since to use the ordinary kriging the data should have the normal frequency distribution webster and oliver 2001 it was checked using spss software and kolmogorov smirnov method then trend was checked on the data trend shows a three dimensional perspective of the data if trend exists on the data the detrended data residual were used for the rest analyzing the semivariance for the data was calculated using gs software as follows matheron 1965 24 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where z xi is the variable value at xi z xi h is the variable value at xi h n h is the number of pair data with distance h and γ h is semivariance by drawing semivariances versus distances the experimental semivariogram was obtained the different semivariogram models such as spherical gaussian exponential and linear were fitted on them and the best model was selected based on the least amount of residual sums of squares rss as follows 25 r s s i 1 n z x i z x i i 1 n where z xi is the predicted value by the semivariogram model for z xi in addition the data anisotropy was also investigated anisotropy is range or sill variation in different direction sill is the semivariance value when semivariogram levels off and the distance for sill is range the range determines an area whose observation data can be used to estimate the variable where it is unknown to investigate anisotropy the semivariogram is considered in the different directions then the data got interpolated cross validation was used for determining the prediction error and was expressed by root mean square error rmse as follows 26 rmse 1 n j 1 n z x j z x j 2 0 5 where z xj is the predicted value for z xj by using the sinterpolation method the closer the error is to zero the better the prediction in addition ordinary kriging method can determine if the prediction is underestimated or overestimated by using room mean square standardized error rmsse as follows 27 rmsse 1 n j 1 n z x j z x j σ x j 2 0 5 where z xj is the predicted value for z xj with standard deviation ϭ xi the closer rmsse is to one the better the prediction if rmsse is more than 1 the prediction is underestimated and if the prediction is lower than 1 the prediction is overestimated to evaluate resulted maps their values in different growth stages were compared to the studied station sari station in rb and nwd and the difference was expressed by difference percentage as follows and rmse 28 d i f f e r e n c e e t r s e t e t r s 100 where etrs is et computed in this study and et is et computed in rb or nwd in this study the images processing and sebal processes were conducted by programming in envi and erdas software computing the reference et was conducted by cropwat and ref et software the geostatistical processing was conducted by gs and maps were produced by arcgis 3 results 3 1 maize evapotranspiration using sebal according to fao56 the crop growth period is divided to four stages including initial development mid and end in the studied area maize is cultivated for silage therefore it is harvested around 30 days sooner than grain harvesting then in the current study maize does not include the end stage furthermore according to the farmer and agronomy experts the best planting date of maize in the studied area is may 11 with the growth period around 90 days for silage in addition the growth periods for initial development and mid stages are 20 40 and 30 days respectively after using sebal the mean et of the selected blocks was determined fig 2 to evaluate these maize et values et0 for the time of the satellite overpass was calculated using climatic data and fao penman monteith method then by using rb nwd and fao56 recommended kc values the maize water requirement of the available references were determined the differences were expressed by rmse in table 2 gholami et al 2010 resulted rmse equals to 18 mm for finding cumulative wheat water requirement in gorganrood watershed using modis images compared to fao penman monteith method also soheylifar et al 2013 predicted sugar cane water requirement using modis images and found rmse 0 66 mm day compared to fao penman monteith method 3 2 maize crop coefficient by dividing maize et to et0 kc value for maize was obtained that its curve and its comparison to the recommended kc values by rb nwd and fao are shown in fig 3 as it is shown in the fig 3 there are 3 values in jun 7 jun 15 and july 25 which are not compatible well to the neighbor s values these points were investigated according to the satellite type symmetry with precipitation and symmetry with irrigation the investigation showed that for two values 7 jun and 25 jul the studied images were landsat 7 the landsat 7 images have stripping error and it was solved by recommended methods in gapfill extension in envi package in this study we wanted to investigate if these images can be used for our aim and since the resulted kc values from landsat 7 were not compatible well to the neighbors values they were removed for the rest analyzing also we found that the day before 15 jun was raining in the studied area about 30 mm since water affects the et process this value was omitted as well by removing the outlier values rmse for maize et compared to rb nwd and fao values table 2 decreased to 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day respectively in addition according to fao56 the growth period for the initial stage runs from the planting date to 10 ground vegetation cover that based on the local agronomy experts and farmers is around 20 days the resulted curve showed that the kc value is not constant in this stage and is 0 1 for the first 10 days of the growth period and 0 4 for the second 10 days for the development kc a linear graph was fitted on the obtained values during this stage 5 values that the resulted equation is as follows 29 kc 0 0195t 0 4537 r² 0 96 where t is the number of passed days from the beginning of the development period for the mid stage 3 values were obtained with insignificant difference so their average was selected as kc for this stage which was 1 22 finally the resulted kc curve for maize is shown in fig 4 in other references the planting date is different from the current study therefore the resulted kc curve compared to the other recommended curves in both our mentioned growth period and their growth period were shown in figs 4 and 5 these curves show a sharp increase on may10 it does not mean that the kc value in the day before and after may 10 are different this much on the other hand the kc curve in the initial stage is not a trend it only indicates that if we want to measure maize water requirement in the first 10 day as a whole 0 1 is appropriate as kc value and in the second 10 day as a whole 0 4 is suitable besides there is a short increase in the beginning of development stage it happened due to fitting a graph on the obtained values it is around 0 05 and does not affect significantly the kc values in this stage on the other side kc values for the different 10 day are presented in table 3 that rmse for them compared to rb nwd and fao values are 0 15 0 25 and 0 10 respectively it proves that fao values were more compatible to the current study the high difference of rb and nwd values are because of high difference in the initial stage the local farmers approved that for the initial stage high amount of irrigation water is not needed 3 3 evapotranspiration maps to produce et0 maps et0 were computed using fao penman monteith method their frequency distribution was checked and showed that they have normal frequency distribution trend analysis was conducted by plotting the data on xz and yz planes which showed there was a trend on the data the east west and north south trends showed that et0 values have increasingly trend from west to east and north to south the studied province is limited in north to caspian sea and south to alborz mountain and the distance between the sea and the mountain in the eastern part of the province is wider compared to the western part as this distance decreases the air humidity increases which causes the lower et0 therefore this trend can be acceptable for the semivariogram analysis the detrended residual data were used then semivariance were calculated and different semivariogram models were fitted on them in addition anisotropy was checked the spatial analysis results for et0 are presented in table 4 the data interpolation was conducted by global polynomial interpolator gpi local polynomial interpolator lpi inverse distance weighting idw and ordinary kriging methods the interpolation results were compared based on rmse table 5 and showed that ordinary kriging method had better results however had no significant difference related to the other methods rather than gpi on the basis of rmsse the predictions were underestimated table 5 et0 maps showed that the cumulative et0 in the province was 407 19 450 40 mm during maize growth period 4 maize water requirement maps to find the daily maize water requirement maps et0 maps were multiplied by resulted kc values in gis fig 6 maps showed that the cumulative maize water requirement in the studied area is 345 16 383 99 mm the resulted maize water requirement in the different growth stages in the observation station sari station compared to rb and nwd values is shown in table 6 that have 20 and 41 difference and rmse equals to 76 and 156 mm respectively the reasons for this difference are different growth period and climate change so that the growth period for this study was 93 days according to local farmers and agronomy experts opinions meanwhile rb and nwd had considered 105 and 82 days respectively 5 conclusion in the current study maize water requirement was determined using landsat 8 images and sebal algorithm rmse for results from sebal process was 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day compared to rb nwd and fao values landsat 7 images were also evaluated after correction that resulted they are not precise enough to measure evapotranspiration using sebal in addition by computing et0 kc value was calculated in the different stages that was 0 1 0 4 and 0 22 for the first 10 day second 10 day and mid stage respectively it approves that it is more appropriate to avoid considering a constant crop coefficient for the whole initial stage as fao recommended however it does not mean that the kc value in the day before and after tenth day are different this much it only indicates that if we want to measure maize water requirement for the first 10 day as a whole 0 1 value is appropriate for kc and for the second 10 day as a whole 0 4 is suitable since in the studied area maize is harvested for silage it is not included late stage the resulted kc values in 10 day periods have rmse equals to 0 15 0 25 and 0 10 compared to rb nwd and fao recommended values respectively the crop coefficient curve showed that for the initial stage nwd values for the developing stage rb values and for the mid stage fao values are closer to the current results to produce spatial distribution maps of maize water requirement different interpolation methods were used and results showed that ordinary kriging is the appropriate method for et0 interpolation the cumulative et0 in the maize growth period and maize water requirement were 407 1 450 4 mm and 345 16 383 99 mm in arable land of mazandaran province the resulted maize water requirement in the observation station sari was 378 mm that had 20 and 41 difference and rmse equals to 76 and 156 mm compared to rb and nwd respectively this difference is due to different cultivating date different growth period and climate change the resulted maps are produced using latest climatic data 6 discussion according to our results in the current study the presented values of crops water requirement in available references in iran must be updated it is expensive and time consuming if it is conducted by measurement method such as using lysimeter remote sensing data can be a useful tool to do so which is in consistent with the results of farhadi bansouleh et al 2015 and ramos et al 2009 if the temporal resolution of the images is not proper enough calculating the crop coefficient by remote sensing data and then computing evapotranspiration by fao 56 method would be useful we can use this way to evaluate crop coefficient curves which is recommended by tasumi et al 2003 however we should be careful about using this way in humid weather because we may face cloudy weather and clouds affects the results results of landsat7 data with stripping errors are not recommended this error was solved in this study by triangulation method involved in gapfill extension however the results were not accurate enough our current results and field study convince us that the crop coefficient value for the initial 10 day of maize growth period can be lower than the presented value of fao 56 however some other studies are required to prove it on the other hand by preparing the spatial distribution maps of crops water requirement water supply can be managed in addition the cumulative value of needed water based on copping pattern helps us to allocate water to different plains or cities properly to interpolate data anisotropy affects the results it has to be checked and in case of need it should be considered for fitting variogram model on experimental variogram there was no lysimetric data in the studied area and we still recommend that lysimetric data should be used at least in the few locations to evaluate the remote sensing data 
11352,efficient agricultural water demand management in arid and semi arid regions is key in continuing crop production in a changing climate as such there s a need for further investigation on various crops to identify the optimum water requirements to avoid water wasting in regions that are already facing water shortage the focus of this work is to determine water requirement maize farming mazandaran province in northern iran located on the southern side of the caspian sea using landsat satellite data in order to use sebal algorithm the images were atmospheric calibrated evapotranspiration maps with rmse values equals to 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day were produced and compared to reference book rb national water document nwd and fao56 values furthermore by computing reference evapotranspiration crop coefficient curve was evaluated in order to prepare maize water requirement maps et0 in 58 weather stations throughout the province were computed and interpolated by using the daily et0 maps and resulted kc values maize water requirement maps for the cultivated area of the province were 345 16 383 99 mm the maize water requirement in the observation station of sari compared to rb and nwd values showed 20 and 41 differences and rmse was 76 and 156 mm respectively keywords evapotranspiration crop coefficient landsat gis interpolation 1 introduction irrigation of agricultural land consumes a great amount of water meanwhile more than half of that on average goes to waste due to lack of proper water management and unsound water transfer technologies in the recent years dispute over water rights has highlighted the demand for an accurate estimation method of irrigation water requirement for various crops in different regions with changing climate two main strategies can be used to improve water use in the agricultural sector 1 upgrading irrigation systems 2 improving irrigation planning and management upgrading irrigation systems and increasing irrigation efficiency is one of the most effective methods however this solution requires a lot of initial investment and government support therefore improving irrigation planning and management can be an effective useful way to improve water consumption in agriculture that the accurate water requirement value is essential for it there are two national references in iran that present crops water requirement including national water document nwd anon 1999 and reference book rb farshi et al 1997 although both of them used climatic data and fao 56 method allen et al 1990 to compute reference evapotranspiration et0 in approximately the same period 30 year data until 1997 and 1999 respectively crop evapotranspiration etc values are different for many crops such as maize in mazandaran it was found that kc values and growth period are different in some cases also in using fao 56 method to compute etc kc values are still needed so as the first step it is important to find the certain values of kc accompanied with the appropriate growth period on the other side all mentioned references are for long years ago a study in khorasan iran has shown 47 difference for et0 compared to nwd erfanian et al 2011 also a study in fars iran has shown that the water requirement for wheat oat maize sugar beet sunflower beans tomatoes and potatoes have changed significantly compared to nwd fooladmand 2012 therefore the mentioned reasons convinced us that crops water requirement must be updated water requirement is one of the water balance components and equals to crop evapotranspiration et allen et al 1990 et is soil evaporation plus plant transpiration which is the initially process of water transfer in the hydrological cycle overestimation of crop water requirement leads to waste water water logging nutrient leaching in the soil and polluting the groundwater resources underestimation of crop water requirement causes to water tension for crop which decreases the yield therefore the crops water requirement must be determined accurately the crop water requirement is determined by a couple main methods however there are other methods such as eddy covariance bowen ratio pan evaporation and so forth 1 measurement in this method et is determined by measuring the incoming and outgoing water flux into the soil such as soil water balance method or et is determined in an irrigated lysimeter by isolating the crop and assessing the water flow and putting up water balance 2 calculation in this method et is calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 to the crop coefficient kc allen et al 1990 whereby et0 indicates the climatic conditions effects on the crop water requirement and is related to the vapor pressure gradient between the plant leaf stomata and that of the surrounding atmosphere also the kc serves the difference for the considered crop canopy and aerodynamic resistance related to the reference crop each one of these methods has different limitations the measurement method is time consuming and expensive furthermore the results are local based and it should be repeated in several years to be reliable the calculation method computes the potential et which is the maximum value of the actual et in addition the crops coefficients should be determined by local experiments on the other side et varies in different location and time due to variation of climatic characteristics and farmers or water managers need to have a thorough spatial and temporal understanding of its variation the mentioned methods are local based and due to variation of climatic characteristics has limitations at large area these problems have caused to develop remote sensing techniques remote sensing data currently presents a capable tool to find crops actual et at large area by spending less time and cost so that if the soil and water condition have no limitation for crop growth it equals to crop water requirement remote sensing uses the albedo ground surface temperature and infrared bands values in order to calculate spatial variations of short and long wave radiations which lead to calculate et for each pixel of images on the other side one of the most important and high yielding cereals is maize which supplies high energy and protein since the growth period of this plant is in the dry months of the year the main issue in its cultivation is water supply therefore its water requirement should be estimated accurately in order to increase its cultivated area and yield in this regard bastiaanssen et al 1998 compared the et resulted from remote sensing and sebal algorithm in china india spain and pakistan to the field measurements results showed that in 85 of the cases the resulted et from the sebal were compatible with the field measurements without any calibration also ramos et al 2009 obtained the daily et for wheat maize and grass in flumen spain using sebal the results showed that the grass et had 0 3 and 0 36 mm day difference compared to lysimetric measurements and penman monteith method respectively furthermore the et for wheat and maize had 0 6 mm day difference compared to lysimetric measurements omidvar et al 2013 compared sebal and metric algorithm on the determination of et in cultivation area in mashhad iran using aster images their results showed that both algorithms estimated the spatial distribution of et properly according to the topographic conditions and vegetation cover soheylifar et al 2013 estimated the sugarcane et in khouzestan iran using modis images and sebal algorithm resulted showed rmse 0 66 mm day and r2 0 87 compared to fao penman monteith method wheat evapotranspiration was calculated in bilevar plain iran using sebal and compared to the penman montieth method and showed a high correlation 0 83 between results qamarnia and rezvani 2015 bala et al 2016 obtained the daily et using landsat7 and sebal algorithm in india and compared to lysimetric measurements the results had rmse 0 51 mm day and mae mean absolute error 0 19 the maize et in mahidasht iran was determined using sebal and sebs algorithms and landsat tm images farhadi bansouleh et al 2015 the results compared to the lysimeter measurements showed at most 9 8 and 4 6 differences for sebal and sebs respectively actual wheat evapotranspiration was estimated by sebal and was compared to lysimetric and fao penman monteith method results sebal results had a significant correlation with lysimetric data r2 0 85 and good agreement with fao penman monteith etc rmse 0 56 rawat et al 2017 according to the studied researches landsat results are more appropriate than some other satellite results such as modis so that simaie et al 2013 indicated that crop et derived from landsat images are 2 5 times more accurate than modis images it is because the spatial resolution for modis images is 1000 m that leads to the pixel size 100 ha however the spatial resolution for landsat images are 30 m that leads to the pixel size 900 m on the other side for using modis a farm which covers at least 100 ha and having the same planting date is needed that is difficult therefore in the current study the determination of et and kc for maize using landsat images and sebal algorithm was aimed landsat8 is the latest version of the landsat satellite series and was launched in 2013 this satellite takes about 400 images a day which has a significant increase over 250 images per day by landsat 7 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current study was conducted in mazandaran province which is located in the north of iran fig 1 the eastern part of mazandaran province has arable land for maize cultivating which covers more than 310 000 ha and is located in 36 61 36 74 n and 52 47 53 82 it has mediterranean climate based on de martounne method although maize is mostly cultivated for silage in mazandaran this province annually faces a shortage of more than 2 million tons of silage that the major need is maize anon 2015 in this study the maize water requirement and kc values were determined for a big farm and then maize water requirement was calculated for the eastern part of mazandaran province the studied farm has a total area of 300 ha it is located in 36 36 36 40 n and 52 52 52 53 e fig 1 the studied farm has a suitable potential for maize production the average temperature and precipitation of the studied farm are 17 3 and 640 mm even though the precipitation is non uniform the needed water is obtained from groundwater resources maize is cultivated in different blocks this study was conducted in 3 consecutive years including 2014 2016 because the planting date varies in different blocks a block with the same planting date in the studied years was selected for sebal analysis it was a block covers 22 ha with clay soil texture and soil electrical conductivity equals 0 67 ds m for 2014 and 2016 and a block covers 25 ha with clay soil texture and soil electrical conductivity equals 0 85 ds m for 2015 the considered growth period was may 11 august 10 2 2 landsat images the studied images in this research were landsat 8 images during the maize growth period in 3 years 2014 2016 which were not cloudy the time series for landsat 8 is 16 days and the spatial resolution is 30 m some of the images were not usable due to cloudiness and finally 8 images were available for this study in addition to our main objective which was the determination of maize et we aimed to evaluate landsat 7 images accuracy since 2003 landsat 7 has had stripping error we used gapfill extension and triangulation method in envi package to solve this problem and then used the images the studied images characteristics are presented in table 1 2 3 estimation of crop evapotranspiration using sebal the surface energy balance algorithms for land sebal is an algorithm which estimates instantaneous and daily crop et based on experimental and physical relationships with minimal observation data which has shown appropriate results bastiaanssen et al 1998 this algorithm calculates the energy balance process based on the amount of heat flux and transmitted water vapor in each pixel for using sebal firstly the spectral radiance lλ and reflectivity ρλ should be computed for each band the spectral radiance is the outgoing radiation energy of the band that the satellite observed at the top of the atmosphere the reflectivity of a surface is the ratio of the reflected radiation flux to the incident radiation flux they are calculated using eqs 1 and 2 for landsat 8 and eqs 3 and 4 for landsat 7 anon 2016 allen et al 2002 1 lλ ml x qcal al 2 ρ λ m p q cal a p cos θ 3 lλ gain dn bias 4 ρ λ π l λ e s u n λ cos θ d r where ml al mp ap are the calibration coefficients qcal is digital number gain and bias are the calibration coefficients which refer to the values given in the header file dn is digital number esunλ is the mean solar exo atmospheric irradiance for each band θ is the solar incidence angle where θ 90 β and β is sun elevation angle and dr is the inverse squared relative earth sun distance then the main sebal equation was considered as follows bastiaanssen et al 1998 5 rn λet h g where rn is the net radiation flux at the surface λet is the latent heat flux h is the sensible heat flux to the air g is the soil heat flux for finding λet the other parameters should be calculated 2 4 net radiation flux at the ground surface rn rn is computed by subtracting all outgoing radiant fluxes from all incoming radiant fluxes as eq 6 allen et al 2002 6 r n 1 α r s r l r l 1 ε 0 r l where α is surface albedo r s is the incoming shortwave radiation r l the incoming longwave radiation r l is the outgoing longwave radiation and ε

boltzmann constant and ts is the surface temperature which is calculated as follows 10 t s k 2 l n ε n b k 1 l 1 where k1and k2 are constants for landsat images εnb is the emissivity representing surface behavior for thermal emission in the relatively narrow band and l is the spectral radiance of thermal bands for determining ε0 and εnb three vegetation indices including normalized difference vegetation index ndvi soil adjusted vegetation index savi and leaf area index lai were calculated as follows allen et al 2002 2014 11 ndvi ρ5 ρ4 ρ5 ρ4 12 savi 1 l ρ5 ρ4 l ρ5 ρ4 13 lai 11 savi 3 for

vegetation index if ndvi 0 assume surface is water and if ts 4 oc and α 0 45 assume surface is snow and for these both circumstances g r n 0 5 2 6 sensible heat flux h sensible heat flux is the heat loss to the air by convection and conduction due to a temperature difference it is computed as follows allen et al 2002 16 h ρ a i r c p d t r a h where ρair is air density cp is air specific heat dt is the temperature difference between two heights that sebal consider 0 1 and 2 m and rah is the aerodynamic resistance to heat transport there are two unknown parameters rah and dt for finding h that makes this equation difficult to solve sebal uses two anchor pixels cold pixel and hot pixel for fixing boundary conditions accompanied with wind speed at a given height to facilitate this problem these two pixels have to be located in the studied area which produces reliable h and then dt the hot pixel includes dry and uncultivated agricultural land et is assumed to be zero in hot pixel the cold pixel should be selected in agricultural fields that are well irrigated and fully vegetated the composition of aerodynamic resistance with maximum and minimum sensible heat fluxes at these pixels makes possible an assessment of a range of air temperature differences near the ground surface then the surface temperature with the assumption of the linear relationship between the surface temperature and vertically heat transport slope in surface boundary layer is used to find vertical variation of temperature by determining the boundary condition rah firstly is computed for the neutral stability condition of the atmosphere and finally is corrected by considering the atmosphere stability condition as follows 17 r a h ln z 2 z 1 ψ h z 2 ψ h z 1 u k 18 u k u 200 ln 200 z o m ψ

karman s constant u200 is wind speed at 200 m height zom is the momentum roughness length 2 7 maize evapotranspiration et to find et firstly λet is calculated for each pixel as follows which is the latent heat loss from the surface due to et allen et al 2002 19 λet rn g h by this equation we find an instantaneous value of λet for the time of the satellite overpass to find instantaneous value of et the eq 20 is used as follows allen et al 2002 20 e t i n s t 3600 λ e t λ where etinst is the instantaneous et and λ is the latent heat of vaporization in the studies related to et the daily values of et are more useful than instantaneous values sebal uses the reference et fraction etrf as the ratio of the computed instantaneous et etinst to the reference et for alfalfa etr for the time of the satellite overpass computed by climatic data to find it the actual daily et etact 24 is finally obtained by multiplying etrf to daily reference et etr 24 as follows by considering that etrf has no variation during the day allen et al 2002 etr is determined by using the local climatic data and based on fao penman monteith method 21 e t a c t 24 e t r 24 e t i n s t e t r i n s t the results were compared to the available references the planting date is different in the available references and therefore to evaluate the results et0 for the time of the satellite overpass was calculated using climatic data and fao penman monteith method then by using rb nwd and fao56 recommended kc values the maize water requirement for these references were determined the difference was expressed by rmse as follows 22 rmse 1 n i 1 n et c i et c i 2 0 5 where etci is the maize et computed by sebal algorithm and etci is the maize et calculated by using et0 and recommended kc values of rb nwd and fao56 since in the current study the planting date was different in the different blocks a block was selected in each year for analyzing the selected blocks in 3 studied years had the same irrigation and agricultural management the same soil texture no water tension no salinity tension and no limitation for plant growth furthermore since the maize et varied in the different pixels their frequency distribution graph in the selected block was determined and the mean water requirement was calculated as follows 23 e t c m e a n i 1 n e t c i f i i 1 n f i where etci is water requirement for each pixel and fi is its frequency 2 8 maize crop coefficient to find maize crop coefficient the resulted maize et is divided to et0 and then crop coefficient curve was obtained based on fao56 instructions the difference between the resulted kc in this study and recommended kc values of rb nwd and fao56 were expressed by difference percentage and rmse 2 9 maize water requirement maps the resulted kc values can be used for finding water requirement in the area with the same climatic conditions therefore producing the daily maize water requirement map in the eastern part of mazandaran province was aimed thus the daily climatic data for 15 years 2001 2016 for 58 weather stations were collected et0 was calculated using fao penman monteith method in the weather stations then they were interpolated using deterministic and geostatistical methods and et0 maps were produced the deterministic methods include global polynomial interpolator gpi local polynomial interpolator lpi and inverse distance weighting idw and the geostatistical method includes ordinary kriging since to use the ordinary kriging the data should have the normal frequency distribution webster and oliver 2001 it was checked using spss software and kolmogorov smirnov method then trend was checked on the data trend shows a three dimensional perspective of the data if trend exists on the data the detrended data residual were used for the rest analyzing the semivariance for the data was calculated using gs software as follows matheron 1965 24 γ h 1 2 n h i 1 n h z x i z x i h 2 where z xi is the variable value at xi z xi h is the variable value at xi h n h is the number of pair data with distance h and γ h is semivariance by drawing semivariances versus distances the experimental semivariogram was obtained the different semivariogram models such as spherical gaussian exponential and linear were fitted on them and the best model was selected based on the least amount of residual sums of squares rss as follows 25 r s s i 1 n z x i z x i i 1 n where z xi is the predicted value by the semivariogram model for z xi in addition the data anisotropy was also investigated anisotropy is range or sill variation in different direction sill is the semivariance value when semivariogram levels off and the distance for sill is range the range determines an area whose observation data can be used to estimate the variable where it is unknown to investigate anisotropy the semivariogram is considered in the different directions then the data got interpolated cross validation was used for determining the prediction error and was expressed by root mean square error rmse as follows 26 rmse 1 n j 1 n z x j z x j 2 0 5 where z xj is the predicted value for z xj by using the sinterpolation method the closer the error is to zero the better the prediction in addition ordinary kriging method can determine if the prediction is underestimated or overestimated by using room mean square standardized error rmsse as follows 27 rmsse 1 n j 1 n z x j z x j σ x j 2 0 5 where z xj is the predicted value for z xj with standard deviation ϭ xi the closer rmsse is to one the better the prediction if rmsse is more than 1 the prediction is underestimated and if the prediction is lower than 1 the prediction is overestimated to evaluate resulted maps their values in different growth stages were compared to the studied station sari station in rb and nwd and the difference was expressed by difference percentage as follows and rmse 28 d i f f e r e n c e e t r s e t e t r s 100 where etrs is et computed in this study and et is et computed in rb or nwd in this study the images processing and sebal processes were conducted by programming in envi and erdas software computing the reference et was conducted by cropwat and ref et software the geostatistical processing was conducted by gs and maps were produced by arcgis 3 results 3 1 maize evapotranspiration using sebal according to fao56 the crop growth period is divided to four stages including initial development mid and end in the studied area maize is cultivated for silage therefore it is harvested around 30 days sooner than grain harvesting then in the current study maize does not include the end stage furthermore according to the farmer and agronomy experts the best planting date of maize in the studied area is may 11 with the growth period around 90 days for silage in addition the growth periods for initial development and mid stages are 20 40 and 30 days respectively after using sebal the mean et of the selected blocks was determined fig 2 to evaluate these maize et values et0 for the time of the satellite overpass was calculated using climatic data and fao penman monteith method then by using rb nwd and fao56 recommended kc values the maize water requirement of the available references were determined the differences were expressed by rmse in table 2 gholami et al 2010 resulted rmse equals to 18 mm for finding cumulative wheat water requirement in gorganrood watershed using modis images compared to fao penman monteith method also soheylifar et al 2013 predicted sugar cane water requirement using modis images and found rmse 0 66 mm day compared to fao penman monteith method 3 2 maize crop coefficient by dividing maize et to et0 kc value for maize was obtained that its curve and its comparison to the recommended kc values by rb nwd and fao are shown in fig 3 as it is shown in the fig 3 there are 3 values in jun 7 jun 15 and july 25 which are not compatible well to the neighbor s values these points were investigated according to the satellite type symmetry with precipitation and symmetry with irrigation the investigation showed that for two values 7 jun and 25 jul the studied images were landsat 7 the landsat 7 images have stripping error and it was solved by recommended methods in gapfill extension in envi package in this study we wanted to investigate if these images can be used for our aim and since the resulted kc values from landsat 7 were not compatible well to the neighbors values they were removed for the rest analyzing also we found that the day before 15 jun was raining in the studied area about 30 mm since water affects the et process this value was omitted as well by removing the outlier values rmse for maize et compared to rb nwd and fao values table 2 decreased to 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day respectively in addition according to fao56 the growth period for the initial stage runs from the planting date to 10 ground vegetation cover that based on the local agronomy experts and farmers is around 20 days the resulted curve showed that the kc value is not constant in this stage and is 0 1 for the first 10 days of the growth period and 0 4 for the second 10 days for the development kc a linear graph was fitted on the obtained values during this stage 5 values that the resulted equation is as follows 29 kc 0 0195t 0 4537 r² 0 96 where t is the number of passed days from the beginning of the development period for the mid stage 3 values were obtained with insignificant difference so their average was selected as kc for this stage which was 1 22 finally the resulted kc curve for maize is shown in fig 4 in other references the planting date is different from the current study therefore the resulted kc curve compared to the other recommended curves in both our mentioned growth period and their growth period were shown in figs 4 and 5 these curves show a sharp increase on may10 it does not mean that the kc value in the day before and after may 10 are different this much on the other hand the kc curve in the initial stage is not a trend it only indicates that if we want to measure maize water requirement in the first 10 day as a whole 0 1 is appropriate as kc value and in the second 10 day as a whole 0 4 is suitable besides there is a short increase in the beginning of development stage it happened due to fitting a graph on the obtained values it is around 0 05 and does not affect significantly the kc values in this stage on the other side kc values for the different 10 day are presented in table 3 that rmse for them compared to rb nwd and fao values are 0 15 0 25 and 0 10 respectively it proves that fao values were more compatible to the current study the high difference of rb and nwd values are because of high difference in the initial stage the local farmers approved that for the initial stage high amount of irrigation water is not needed 3 3 evapotranspiration maps to produce et0 maps et0 were computed using fao penman monteith method their frequency distribution was checked and showed that they have normal frequency distribution trend analysis was conducted by plotting the data on xz and yz planes which showed there was a trend on the data the east west and north south trends showed that et0 values have increasingly trend from west to east and north to south the studied province is limited in north to caspian sea and south to alborz mountain and the distance between the sea and the mountain in the eastern part of the province is wider compared to the western part as this distance decreases the air humidity increases which causes the lower et0 therefore this trend can be acceptable for the semivariogram analysis the detrended residual data were used then semivariance were calculated and different semivariogram models were fitted on them in addition anisotropy was checked the spatial analysis results for et0 are presented in table 4 the data interpolation was conducted by global polynomial interpolator gpi local polynomial interpolator lpi inverse distance weighting idw and ordinary kriging methods the interpolation results were compared based on rmse table 5 and showed that ordinary kriging method had better results however had no significant difference related to the other methods rather than gpi on the basis of rmsse the predictions were underestimated table 5 et0 maps showed that the cumulative et0 in the province was 407 19 450 40 mm during maize growth period 4 maize water requirement maps to find the daily maize water requirement maps et0 maps were multiplied by resulted kc values in gis fig 6 maps showed that the cumulative maize water requirement in the studied area is 345 16 383 99 mm the resulted maize water requirement in the different growth stages in the observation station sari station compared to rb and nwd values is shown in table 6 that have 20 and 41 difference and rmse equals to 76 and 156 mm respectively the reasons for this difference are different growth period and climate change so that the growth period for this study was 93 days according to local farmers and agronomy experts opinions meanwhile rb and nwd had considered 105 and 82 days respectively 5 conclusion in the current study maize water requirement was determined using landsat 8 images and sebal algorithm rmse for results from sebal process was 0 73 1 38 and 0 74 mm day compared to rb nwd and fao values landsat 7 images were also evaluated after correction that resulted they are not precise enough to measure evapotranspiration using sebal in addition by computing et0 kc value was calculated in the different stages that was 0 1 0 4 and 0 22 for the first 10 day second 10 day and mid stage respectively it approves that it is more appropriate to avoid considering a constant crop coefficient for the whole initial stage as fao recommended however it does not mean that the kc value in the day before and after tenth day are different this much it only indicates that if we want to measure maize water requirement for the first 10 day as a whole 0 1 value is appropriate for kc and for the second 10 day as a whole 0 4 is suitable since in the studied area maize is harvested for silage it is not included late stage the resulted kc values in 10 day periods have rmse equals to 0 15 0 25 and 0 10 compared to rb nwd and fao recommended values respectively the crop coefficient curve showed that for the initial stage nwd values for the developing stage rb values and for the mid stage fao values are closer to the current results to produce spatial distribution maps of maize water requirement different interpolation methods were used and results showed that ordinary kriging is the appropriate method for et0 interpolation the cumulative et0 in the maize growth period and maize water requirement were 407 1 450 4 mm and 345 16 383 99 mm in arable land of mazandaran province the resulted maize water requirement in the observation station sari was 378 mm that had 20 and 41 difference and rmse equals to 76 and 156 mm compared to rb and nwd respectively this difference is due to different cultivating date different growth period and climate change the resulted maps are produced using latest climatic data 6 discussion according to our results in the current study the presented values of crops water requirement in available references in iran must be updated it is expensive and time consuming if it is conducted by measurement method such as using lysimeter remote sensing data can be a useful tool to do so which is in consistent with the results of farhadi bansouleh et al 2015 and ramos et al 2009 if the temporal resolution of the images is not proper enough calculating the crop coefficient by remote sensing data and then computing evapotranspiration by fao 56 method would be useful we can use this way to evaluate crop coefficient curves which is recommended by tasumi et al 2003 however we should be careful about using this way in humid weather because we may face cloudy weather and clouds affects the results results of landsat7 data with stripping errors are not recommended this error was solved in this study by triangulation method involved in gapfill extension however the results were not accurate enough our current results and field study convince us that the crop coefficient value for the initial 10 day of maize growth period can be lower than the presented value of fao 56 however some other studies are required to prove it on the other hand by preparing the spatial distribution maps of crops water requirement water supply can be managed in addition the cumulative value of needed water based on copping pattern helps us to allocate water to different plains or cities properly to interpolate data anisotropy affects the results it has to be checked and in case of need it should be considered for fitting variogram model on experimental variogram there was no lysimetric data in the studied area and we still recommend that lysimetric data should be used at least in the few locations to evaluate the remote sensing data

change dragoni 1998 labat et al 2004 huntington 2006 ipcc 2007 seager et al 2007 fagre et al 2009 sheng 2013 ahn et al 2016 ahn and kim 2016 and human activities such as irrigated agriculture and urban development especially in arid and semi arid regions zektser et al 2004 ma et al 2005 barnett et al 2008 kim et al 2017 these changes are particularly evident in the southwestern u s where climatic variations are affecting water availability through changing the watershed scale hydrologic budget and water balance e g garfin et al 2013 a number of recent studies have assessed water

availability and water management using a daily water balance in a semi arid region in queretaro river basin mexico guo and shen 2016 estimated water availability and agricultural water demand and proposed effective adaptation strategies to cope with severe water shortages under possible climate change trends in the arid region of northwestern china the upper rio grande basin is an arid semi arid river basin relying on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater to sustain irrigated agriculture with increasing uncertainty of surface water availability and consequent increase in groundwater extraction under variable climates there has been growing interest in better understanding how these resources can be managed to meet urban agricultural and environmental water demands due to increasingly frequent extended periods of severe drought the rio grande river alone no longer meets regional water needs thus it is critical to account for interactions of surface water with groundwater in the assessment of water availability in this region liu and sheng 2011 unlike river basins in humid regions arid semi arid river basins typically exhibit reduced flow in the downstream direction as a result of transmission losses which include seepage of streamflow into the underlying aquifer open water evaporation and riparian plants transpiration moreover reduced precipitation in dry regions could trigger disproportionately large drops in groundwater levels as a result of groundwater mining for irrigation dragoni and sukhija 2008 therefore much remains to be learned about the exchange between surface water and groundwater in these landscapes through long term hydrologic modeling analyses especially in terms of spatial and temporal water variability nanson et al 2002

the irrigation district the results provide detailed information on hydrologic components over time and space offering insights about surface water groundwater exchange in climatically similar areas where water and land management to sustain irrigated agriculture is a primary goal the study has important implications for regulating irrigation water use and enabling agricultural water users to devise adaptation plans taking into account plausible impacts of increasing aridity on the hydrologic components 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the watershed 36 990 km2 from elephant butte reservoir to the confluence of the rio conchos from mexico is a highly managed system for irrigated agriculture in the upper rio grande the rincon valley 2466 km2 in new mexico is one of the sub watersheds in the upper rio grande basin located within the latitude range of 32 88 n 32 39 n and the longitude range of 107 78 w 106 83 w fig 1 within the rincon valley rio grande water is released from the caballo reservoir then diverted at percha dam and eventually distributed through an irrigation network including arrey garfield hatch and rincon canals of elephant butte irrigation district

and september 2 2 swat model swat is a physically based continuous long term semi distributed watershed model designed to simulate the effects of water and land management practices on watershed hydrology and water quality arnold et al 1998 it is based on the concept of hydrologic response units hrus which are proportions of a sub basin with unique land use management and soil attributes runoff sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru calculated separately based on weather soil properties topography vegetation and land management are summed to determine sub basin scale values

evaluate the impacts of cropping change 2 spatial crop coverages for normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were prepared including 14 crops the 2008 and 2011 cdls have ground resolutions of 56 and 30 m respectively we also used the usgs national land cover database nlcd 2011 for non agricultural land cover including 13 classes the land cover maps and the distribution of crop areas within the watershed are shown in fig 4 irrigated agricultural area is the dominant land use around the river the agricultural areas of normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were 87 3 3 5 and 82 6 km2 3 3 respectively of the total watershed the remaining land cover types are 90 scrubland and 4 forested 2 3 3 meteorological and hydrological data daily meteorological data 1993 2013 were collected from 7 weather stations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the measured maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were used to set up the swat model in addition continuous daily outflow data below caballo dam at the head of the watershed were used an inlet flow boundary condition the flow data were obtained from the u s bureau of reclamation usbr and cover the period 1993 2013 for model calibration and validation 6 years 2000 2005 of daily streamflow data were obtained from leasburg gauge station at the watershed outlet monitored by the usbr furthermore 6 years 2000 2005 of monthly crop irrigation requirement data were prepared to verify evapotranspiration simulation of the swat model the crop irrigation requirement data were calculated from the food agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 4 canal discharge and irrigation data usbr daily discharge data of arrey canal diverted from the rio grande at percha dam near the head of the watershed were input as an irrigation source the average discharge volume of the arrey canal was 1305 mm year 4 3 ft during the past 20 years 1993 2013 which was used exclusively for agricultural purposes discharge data helped to understand the water use in depth over the agricultural area alone and estimate the irrigation amount mm for the different crops in the study area in the swat model irrigation operations are modeled based on manual and auto application of irrigation in this study the auto irrigation scheduled by heat units was applied to each crop the planting date planting period and heat unit data for each crop were obtained from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 table 1 irrigation water amount mm for each crop can be supplied from the reach specified irrigation source at percha dam 2 4 swat model implementation the swat model was calibrated for the period of 2000 2002 and validated for the period of 2003 2005 considering auto irrigation the calibration and validation were conducted upstream from leasburg dam at the downstream end of rincon valley at the lower end of seldon canyon the irrigation water amount verification by comparing quantities of auto irrigation and observed irrigation diversion significantly improved model calibration the irrigation based calibration was critical in the current swat model application because the watershed presented spatial variations in hydrological responses due to irrigation the daily streamflow calibration at the watershed outlet was performed in six steps for the entire watershed hydrologic cycle step 1 the evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the whole watershed were controlled using the corresponding parameters step 2 the physical rate of the total runoff for the whole watershed was controlled by parameters related to surface runoff step 3 the baseflow lateral flow and return flow was calibrated using parameters related to both soil water and groundwater step 4 the recession curve and peak runoff were also calibrated step 5 irrigation water volume in the reach which is in the irrigation source was verified using parameters related to auto irrigation step 6 the hru level evapotranspiration for crop area only was calibrated using the parameters related to evapotranspiration soil water groundwater and auto irrigation the values of initial parameters were determined based on the results of sensitivity analysis that was performed by each parameter before calibration the parameters were then calibrated by trial and error until satisfactory modeling performance was achieved the manual calibration of swat consists of changing one parameter at a time and re running the model to obtain an acceptable output the coefficient of determination r² nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias were used to quantitatively assess the model s ability to replicate temporal trends in the observed hydrological data the nse rmse and pbais were calculated as follows 2 n s e 1 t 1 t q e t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed discharges and q e is the estimated discharge q o t is the observed discharge at time t 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e o 2 where n is the number of test points in the arithmetic mean i is the observation being tested e is the estimated output and o is the observed data 4 p b i a s i 1 n q e i i 1 n q o i i 1 n q o i 100 where q o i is the observed discharge on day i and q e i is the estimated discharge on day i n is the number of streamflow days r² values are defined as the square of the coefficient of correlation steel and torrie 1960 the nse ranges from to 1 a value of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the modeled discharge and the observed data a value of 0 nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 denotes that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model result or the model residual variance i e the numerator in the nse equation is larger than the data variance i e the denominator nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias is the deviation of the simulated flow time series from the observed data and expressed as a percentage moriasi et al 2007 for cropping change hydrologic impact assessment the swat model was run for 20 years 1993 2013 daily simulations of annual monthly and irrigation and non irrigation seasons and 2 years normal 2008 and dry 2011 daily simulations of irrigation and non irrigation seasons the normal and dry years were selected based on the outflow of caballo dam crop area and annual precipitation the outflow of caballo dam and crop area were 337 7 mm 105 of the 20 years average and 87 3 km2 21 572 acres for normal year 2008 and 198 5 mm 61 of the 20 years average and 82 6 km2 20 410 acres for dry year 2011 the annual precipitation of normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were 324 9 mm 120 of the 20 years average and 235 7 mm 87 of the 20 years average respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model calibration and validation considering irrigation a total of 22 most influential parameters were selected for

and gw revap and auto irrigation flowmin divmax flowfr auto wstrs irr eff irr mx irr asq and heat unit processes the final values of model parameters were selected based on a statistical evaluation of the performance measures table 2 swat calibration is deemed acceptable if r² is greater than 0 60 and nse is greater than 0 50 santhi et al 2001 furthermore a pbias of up to 25 of the monthly flow is acceptable moriasi et al 2007 comparison of the observed and simulated daily streamflow values at the watershed outlet for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 5 the observed and simulated values agree reasonably well the arrey canal at the head of the watershed of the rincon valley represents significant hydrological controls in the main reach as well as major diversions of water resources for agricultural areas therefore optimizing the swat model accurately simulate discharge at the main reach and canal irrigation diversion is important the statistical results for the daily streamflow for the model calibration and validation are summarized in table 3 the average model efficiency expressed as the r² value was greater than 0 85 the rmse during the calibration and validation periods was 1 53 mm day at the watershed outlet the average nse for the calibration and validation periods was 0 95 and typically greater than 0 94 the pbias range of the calibration and validation periods was 6 9 18 5 these model performance indicators suggest satisfactory simulation the monthly verification results for the diversion qdiv and irrigation qirr water volume for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 6 for the estimation of diversion water in the swat model irrigation source was controlled by the following parameters maximum daily irrigation diversion divmax and a fraction of available flow allowed to be used for irrigation flowfr simulated diversion water was estimated by discharge m3 s at the reach of irrigation source minus discharge m3 s at the next reach then it was converted to volume mm year based on agricultural land area the observed average volume of the arrey canal was 1272 mm year 4 2 ft and simulated average volume of irrigation source was 1262 mm day 4 1 ft during the calibration and validation period 2000 2006 for the agricultural area fig 6a for the estimation of irrigation water auto irrigation was controlled by the following parameters irrigation efficiency irr eff and heat units the irrigation water was simulated for each crop in different hrus and compared to simulated diversion water the diversion water was used 64 71 for crop irrigation during the 6 years within the swat model based on these simulated irrigation efficiencies 64 71 for each year observed diversion water was calculated back to irrigation water because it is difficult to measure how much water was used for irrigation only the calculated irrigation water was 854 mm year 2 8 ft and the irrigation water simulated by the swat model over the agricultural area was 849 mm day 2 8 ft during the calibration and validation period 2000 2006 fig 6b the model tends to overestimate the diversion and irrigation amount from the dry years 2003 and 2004 such overestimation may result from the fact that groundwater was pumped to supplement the surface water shortage and the simulated water volume or artificial outflow does not consider the groundwater component for agricultural areas the verification results of the diversion and irrigation water volume rendered average r2 values of 0 84 and 0 83 nse values of 0 55 and 0 56 and pbias of 21 and 22 respectively the monthly verification results for the evapotranspiration for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 6c the simulated monthly evapotranspiration values were compared to crop irrigation requirement data for agricultural areas only comparison of the swat evapotranspiration with the crop irrigation requirement data shows good agreement the verification results of the evapotranspiration rendered average r2 value of 0 95 nse value of 0 55 and pbias of 15 respectively 3 2 water balance analysis by crop irrigation 3 2 1 surface groundwater interaction and groundwater recharge fig 7 illustrates 20 year average 1994 2013 monthly discharge results at the rincon valley watershed outlet the simulated watershed scale a surface runoff b lateral flow and c return flow proportions of the total discharge were 2 11 and 87 respectively the surface runoff lateral flow and return flow have a significant seasonal periodicity the range and the upper and lower quartiles of the monthly data indicate a high inter annual variability furthermore surface runoff and lateral flows had widely different lag times the monthly surface runoff was characterized by higher discharges 0 2 0 5 mm from april to september compared to the period of a low flow season from october to march however the monthly return flows were characterized by higher discharges 1 6 6 8 mm and 11 2 45 2 mm from july to december and have 3 months lag for high discharge season compared to surface runoff because surface water directly goes to the river while the lateral flows infiltrate into vadose zone and groundwater and finally reach the river which requires longer travel time fig 8 shows the average monthly exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater and groundwater recharge of the entire rincon valley for the simulation period the depicted fluxes represent the net exchange values resulting from surface water infiltration groundwater to shallow and deep aquifer and groundwater exfiltration lateral flow and return flow into the river fig 8a on average the period from april to september irrigation season was characterized by a net flux of infiltration into the groundwater for the period from october to march the proportion of groundwater flow into the river is nearly balanced by a slight increase in groundwater to the shallow and deep aquifer from april to september the simulated groundwater recharge showed a distinct seasonal variability and the same pattern with exchange fluxes fig 8b the net exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater presented above influence the groundwater recharge in the basin krause and bronstert 2007 the net groundwater recharge was positive during the period of average surface water infiltration into the groundwater in the irrigation season from april to september while there is no groundwater recharge from october to march in general there is no water in the canals during this period and the recharge from local precipitation is limited or insignificant comparing the values of the average surface water infiltration 97 2 mm and the simultaneous groundwater recharge 17 4 mm up to 18 of the infiltration during the irrigation season contributes to direct groundwater recharge 3 2 2 vertical water budget and horizontal water transfer the water balance analysis was conducted for 20 years 1994 2013 to quantify the linkages between the surface water and groundwater regime in the rincon valley average period of simulation values of different components of the vertical water budget were analysed at aggregate watershed scale these components include infiltration infilt and evapotranspiration et at the surface percolation percol and soil water storage sw from the unsaturated zone and re evaporation revap and groundwater recharge gr from the shallow aquifer to deep aquifer the horizontal water transfer was evaluated using surface runoff sq lateral flow lq which originates below the surface but above the saturated zone contributing to streamflow and return flow rq from the shallow aquifer to the river the total runoff tq is the sum of the 3 components namely sq lq and rq table 4 summarizes the simulated irrigation season non irrigation season and annual water balance over the simulation period for the whole watershed and for the agricultural area only the annual average ratio of et sq lq and rq to precipitation and irrigation over the period of simulation for the whole watershed were found to be 58 0 5 3 and 21 respectively and 69 4 19 and 16 respectively for the agricultural area only the et values for the irrigation season were estimated to be 64 150 5 mm for the whole watershed and 68 696 1 mm for the agricultural areas higher than 41 34 0 mm for the whole watershed and 79 88 2 mm for the agricultural areas for the non irrigation season the sq and lq for irrigation season were estimated to be 0 6 and 3 respectively for the whole watershed and 4 and 20 respectively for the agricultural area only the irrigation season sq is 0 4 higher than sq during non irrigation season likewise the irrigation season lq is 1 higher than the sq 0 2 whereas during non irrigation season the lq is 2 higher compared to the sq 1 and lq 10 for the non irrigation season for the agricultural area only the watershed scale sq and lq are 3 and 10 higher respectively however the model produces 28 more rq for the non irrigation season 42 than for the irrigation season 14 in the whole watershed and 7 more rq for the non irrigation season 22 than for the irrigation season 15 in agricultural areas over the simulation period these results show that rq is affected by irrigation during the irrigation season and that it continues to increase in the non irrigation season because of lag time e g 3 month lag time for high return flow discharge these results indicate the importance of accounting for rq in water budget analyses in the elephant butte irrigation district in particular the increase in the non irrigation season rq is an important element of the water budget in the rincon valley and a significant driver of vulnerability of water availability to sustain irrigated agriculture in this semi arid region 3 2 3 spatial distributions of hydrologic components at hrus the spatial distributions of the water balance components 1994 2013 at the hru level are shown in fig 9 the period of simulation total average annual et values for the agricultural and non agricultural areas were 695 mm and 145 mm respectively the total average annual soil water values for the agricultural and non agricultural areas were 39 mm and 22 mm respectively over the 20 year period a narrow strip of agricultural lands located along the river in the middle of the watershed received irrigation water and consequently had higher surface runoff and et than non agricultural areas the highest range of groundwater recharge at the hrus level was from 45 to 117 mm average 69 mm this high groundwater recharge was for those hrus with corn and cotton fields urbanized hrus in which built up residential areas are the predominant land use type have almost no groundwater recharge the average groundwater recharge for hrus that partially include urban developments was 6 mm soil type is another factor that affects soil water and groundwater recharge at the hrus level the predominant soil type in the rincon valley s agricultural lands is silty clay loam fig 3b loam soils contain more nutrients moisture and humus and have better drainage and infiltration of water and groundwater recharge as compared to other soil types awan and ismaeel 2014 3 3 assessment of hydrologic responses by weather conditions and crop coverage changes 3 3 1 water budget by different weather condition and crop coverage changes at irrigation units the simulated water balance components irr p et sq sw and gr during a normal year 2008 and a dry year 2011 for 4 irrigation units within the agricultural area are shown in table 5 the crop areas were 66 4 km2 16 408 areas for the normal year and 63 8 km2 15 765areas for the dry year within the boundary of 4 irrigation units fig 1 the precipitation and outflow of caballo dam in the dry year were only 67 and 59 of the normal year respectively despite the low amounts of the local precipitation and dam outflow for the dry year the ratio of et to precipitation and irrigation water was 5 higher than the normal year by the irrigation units however the sq sw and gr for the dry year were 7 17 and 39 lower than the normal year respectively the outlet flow leasburg was around the 90 of the inlet flow caballo dam release and the main reach of rincon valley tended to lose water from upstream to downstream due to irrigation the local precipitation also tended to decrease from upstream to downstream although the natural flow resulting from the local precipitation amounted to only about 10 of the flow at the watershed outlet leasburg hence the evaluation of the water budget demonstrates the critical role of irrigation to sustain agriculture in this semi arid environment as compared to local precipitation furthermore the net water losses from upstream to downstream of the watershed directly affected gr in the normal year there was a sharp fall in the gr in the garfield unit where crop areas are the largest while similar decline was not detected in gr simulations for the hatch and rincon units on the other hand the gr tended to decrease sharply from upstream to downstream in the dry year especially in the arrey unit the irr et and sq for the normal year were much higher than the dry year compared to other units because the water budget of arrey unit is directly affected by the inlet flow from caballo dam which decreased by 40 during the dry year compared to the normal year 2008 additional study is needed to better characterize the performance of the irrigation in this area 3 3 2 spatial distributions of hydrologic components at irrigation units the comparison of spatial distributions of the hydrologic components at the hrus level within the irrigation units during the normal year 2008 and dry year 2011 are shown in fig 10 the amount of irrigation varies in different localities the top water using crops in the watershed ranked in order are alfalfa pecans cotton corn lowe and gereffi 2008 the areas of alfalfa pecans cotton and corn within the boundary of 4 irrigation units were 56 11 17 and 11 respectively for the normal year and 42 10 30 and 6 for the dry year respectively in other words the alfalfa 15 and corn 5 fields were taken out of production in the dry year while the coverage of cotton fields increased by 13 and pecans did not change significantly the total amount of irrigation was not significantly different between the dry year and normal year in the dry year the planted area of alfalfa that is the largest water user in the watershed reduced whereas the planted area of cotton that has a relatively low root length density and higher resilience to short term water stresses when compared to other crop species increased a good understanding of the interaction of the plant with the water supply and the ambient environment dictating water use is essential to proper water and land management krieg 2000 expectedly the soil water storage and groundwater recharge for the dry year were lower than the normal year as a result of groundwater over extraction 4 conclusions this study improves understanding of the hydrologic components of irrigated agriculture in semi arid watersheds by examining drought adaptive cropping change and irrigation operations in rincon valley new mexico swat model was used to characterize hydrologic components at a fine temporal i e daily and spatial resolution i e hru level and irrigation unit scale which help to visualize spatial variability in water fluxes and water availability the use of daily observed canal flows in model calibrations facilitated realistic simulation of irrigation operations simulation results indicated the temporal and spatial variability of hydrologic fluxes in the agricultural area during irrigation and non irrigation seasons namely surface runoff evapotranspiration infiltration percolation baseflow soil moisture and groundwater recharge one limitation of the model is that it does not explicitly represent groundwater withdrawal to meet irrigation demand which introduced flow volume errors when simulating discharge during the calibration period the impact of different weather conditions and cropping change on the water supply at watershed scale depends on a complex set of local factors including rainfall soil types and irrigation related groundwater recharge making it difficult to generalize the most water efficient cropping pattern and locations during a dry year irrigation water supply does not fully cover the entire growing season prompting farmers to reduce crop acreage in order to adapt to higher aridity levels during droughts the soil water storage and groundwater recharge variations became more apparent indicating the need for careful irrigation planning and management taking into account the impact of irrigation on the water budget not only within the irrigated areas but also at the watershed scale attention should be paid to the amount of water being diverted from surface water and groundwater ensuring that the diversion occurs optimally in terms of time location and quantity further research is needed to simulate hydrologic components under plausible future climate projections to inform

2466 km2 a semi arid agricultural area in new mexico u s a using soil and water assessment tool swat the model simulates the vertical water budget and horizontal water transfers during the period 1994 2013 incorporating irrigation of fourteen crops in normal 2008 and dry 2011 years to evaluate the hydrologic impacts of cropping change as a drought adaptive water management strategy it was calibrated 2000 2002 and validated 2003 2005 using daily observed streamflow data furthermore evapotranspiration diversion and irrigation water volume were verified for the period of 2000 2005 using monthly crop irrigation requirement data and canal discharge data results demonstrate the significant role of surface water infiltration providing approximately 18 of the average annual groundwater recharge during the irrigation season watershed scale evapotranspiration et and return flows for the irrigation season were estimated to be 23 and 1 higher than those for the non irrigation season respectively for irrigation units the ratio of et to combined precipitation and irrigation water for the dry year was 5 higher than the normal year whereas surface runoff soil water storage and groundwater recharge were 7 17 and 39 lower than the normal year respectively high groundwater recharge occurs in the hydrologic response units hru where corn and cotton are planted on silty clay loam soil the alfalfa acreage i e the largest water user was reduced by 15 while the cotton acreage was increased by 13 in order to adapt to lower water availability during the dry year quantitative

watershed hydrology water budget irrigation and non irrigation seasons swat irrigated agriculture 1 introduction global changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are expected to alter regional climates and hydrological systems changnon et al 1998 zektser and loaiciga 1993 scibek et al 2007 numerous studies have documented that the hydrological cycle is already being impacted by climate change dragoni 1998 labat et al 2004 huntington 2006 ipcc 2007 seager et al 2007 fagre et al 2009 sheng 2013 ahn et al 2016 ahn and kim 2016 and human activities such as irrigated agriculture and urban development especially in arid and semi arid regions zektser et al 2004 ma et al 2005 barnett et al 2008 kim et al 2017 these changes are particularly evident in the southwestern u s where climatic variations are affecting water availability through changing the watershed scale hydrologic budget and water balance e g garfin et al 2013 a number of recent studies have assessed water availability for effective watershed management in arid regions through hydrologic modeling mcdonald et al 2013 assessed the river stages and groundwater flow paths and predicted hydrologic responses to changes in the timing and magnitude of streamflow of dryland river systems in the pecos river texas awan et al 2013 examined the impacts of improved irrigation efficiency on the rate of groundwater recharge by combining hydrological modeling and gis approaches in the khorezm district of uzbekistan central asia herrera pantoja and hiscock 2015 discussed the impact of future climate on water availability and water management using a daily water balance in a semi arid region in queretaro river basin mexico guo and shen 2016 estimated water availability and agricultural water demand and proposed effective adaptation strategies to cope with severe water shortages under possible climate change trends in the arid region of northwestern china the upper rio grande basin is an arid semi arid river basin relying on the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater to sustain irrigated agriculture with increasing uncertainty of surface water availability and consequent increase in groundwater extraction under variable climates there has been growing interest in better understanding how these resources can be managed to meet urban agricultural and environmental water demands due to increasingly frequent extended periods of severe drought the rio grande river alone no longer meets regional water needs thus it is critical to account for interactions of surface water with groundwater in the assessment of water availability in this region liu and sheng 2011 unlike river basins in humid regions arid semi arid river basins typically exhibit reduced flow in the downstream direction as a result of transmission losses which include seepage of streamflow into the underlying aquifer open water evaporation and riparian plants transpiration moreover reduced precipitation in dry regions could trigger disproportionately large drops in groundwater levels as a result of groundwater mining for irrigation dragoni and sukhija 2008 therefore much remains to be learned about the exchange between surface water and groundwater in these landscapes through long term hydrologic modeling analyses especially in terms of spatial and temporal water variability nanson et al 2002 mcdonald et al 2013 the regional water balance and hydrologic budget can be assessed through systematic modeling using the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 because of the model s robust approach based on the soil water balance at the watershed scale swat has been successfully used to study the temporal and spatial effects of hydrological changes in a number of river basins sun

groundwater exchange in a semi arid irrigated agricultural region by investigating the hydrologic behavior of rincon valley in the upper rio grande basin to this end we applied a watershed scale swat model under different weather conditions and cropping patterns the calibrated swat model was used to analyze the water balance by vertical water budget infiltration evapotranspiration percolation soil water storage re evaporation and groundwater recharge and horizontal water transfer surface runoff lateral flow and return flow for irrigation and non irrigation seasons of the period 1984 2013 then the impacts of surface water and groundwater exchange on the water balance and groundwater recharge were evaluated the spatial crop coverages including normal and dry years were one of the important inputs for the swat model furthermore the effects of different weather conditions and crop coverage change on hydrologic components were simulated at different hydrologic response units hrus within the irrigation district the results provide detailed information on hydrologic components over time and space offering insights about surface water groundwater exchange in climatically similar areas where water and land management to sustain irrigated agriculture is a primary goal the study has important implications for regulating irrigation water use and enabling agricultural water users to devise adaptation plans taking into account plausible impacts of increasing aridity on the hydrologic components 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the watershed 36 990 km2 from elephant butte reservoir to the confluence of the rio conchos from mexico is a highly managed system for irrigated agriculture in the upper rio grande the rincon valley 2466 km2 in new mexico is one of the sub watersheds in the upper rio grande basin located within the latitude range of 32 88 n 32 39 n and the longitude range of 107 78 w 106 83 w fig 1 within the rincon valley rio grande water is released from the caballo reservoir then diverted at percha dam and eventually distributed through an irrigation network including arrey garfield hatch and rincon canals of elephant butte irrigation district the study area boundary gauging stations and the 29 sub watersheds for the swat model and four irrigation units are shown in fig 1 the average discharge rates of the caballo dam and arrey canal are 28 m3 sec and 3 7 m3 sec respectively irrigating around 82 2 km2 of agricultural land the major crops are alfalfa 40 cotton 16 pecans 15 corn 11 onions 6 and peppers 5 this area has a typical arid semi arid climate with annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 24 3 c and 5 8 c respectively and an average annual rainfall of about 270 mm 55 of which occurs during the monsoon months of july august and september 2 2 swat model swat is a physically based continuous long term semi distributed watershed model designed to simulate the effects of water and land management practices on watershed hydrology and water quality arnold et al 1998 it is based on the concept of hydrologic response units hrus which are proportions of a sub basin with unique land use management and soil attributes runoff sediment and nutrient loadings from each hru calculated separately based on weather soil properties topography vegetation and land management are summed to determine sub basin scale values

evaluate the impacts of cropping change 2 spatial crop coverages for normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were prepared including 14 crops the 2008 and 2011 cdls have ground resolutions of 56 and 30 m respectively we also used the usgs national land cover database nlcd 2011 for non agricultural land cover including 13 classes the land cover maps and the distribution of crop areas within the watershed are shown in fig 4 irrigated agricultural area is the dominant land use around the river the agricultural areas of normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were 87 3 3 5 and 82 6 km2 3 3 respectively of the total watershed the remaining land cover types are 90 scrubland and 4 forested 2 3 3 meteorological and hydrological data daily meteorological data 1993 2013 were collected from 7 weather stations of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa the measured maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation were used to set up the swat model in addition continuous daily outflow data below caballo dam at the head of the watershed were used an inlet flow boundary condition the flow data were obtained from the u s bureau of reclamation usbr and cover the period 1993 2013 for model calibration and validation 6 years 2000 2005 of daily streamflow data were obtained from leasburg gauge station at the watershed outlet monitored by the usbr furthermore 6 years 2000 2005 of monthly crop irrigation requirement data were prepared to verify evapotranspiration simulation of the swat model the crop irrigation requirement data were calculated from the food agriculture organization fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 2 3 4 canal discharge and irrigation data usbr daily discharge data of arrey canal diverted from the rio grande at percha dam near the head of the watershed were input as an irrigation source the average discharge volume of the arrey canal was 1305 mm year 4 3 ft during the past 20 years 1993 2013 which was used exclusively for agricultural purposes discharge data helped to understand the water use in depth over the agricultural area alone and estimate the irrigation amount mm for the different crops in the study area in the swat model irrigation operations are modeled based on manual and auto application of irrigation in this study the auto irrigation scheduled by heat units was applied to each crop the planting date planting period and heat unit data for each crop were obtained from the fao irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 table 1 irrigation water amount mm for each crop can be supplied from the reach specified irrigation source at percha dam 2 4 swat model implementation the swat model was calibrated for the period of 2000 2002 and validated for the period of 2003 2005 considering auto irrigation the calibration and validation were conducted upstream from leasburg dam at the downstream end of rincon valley at the lower end of seldon canyon the irrigation water amount verification by comparing quantities of auto irrigation and observed irrigation diversion significantly improved model calibration the irrigation based calibration was critical in the current swat model application because the watershed presented spatial variations in hydrological responses due to irrigation the daily streamflow calibration at the watershed outlet was performed in six steps for the entire watershed hydrologic cycle step 1 the evapotranspiration and soil moisture for the whole watershed were controlled using the corresponding parameters step 2 the physical rate of the total runoff for the whole watershed was controlled by parameters related to surface runoff step 3 the baseflow lateral flow and return flow was calibrated using parameters related to both soil water and groundwater step 4 the recession curve and peak runoff were also calibrated step 5 irrigation water volume in the reach which is in the irrigation source was verified using parameters related to auto irrigation step 6 the hru level evapotranspiration for crop area only was calibrated using the parameters related to evapotranspiration soil water groundwater and auto irrigation the values of initial parameters were determined based on the results of sensitivity analysis that was performed by each parameter before calibration the parameters were then calibrated by trial and error until satisfactory modeling performance was achieved the manual calibration of swat consists of changing one parameter at a time and re running the model to obtain an acceptable output the coefficient of determination r² nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and percent bias pbias were used to quantitatively assess the model s ability to replicate temporal trends in the observed hydrological data the nse rmse and pbais were calculated as follows 2 n s e 1 t 1 t q e t q o t 2 t 1 t q o t q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed discharges and q e is the estimated discharge q o t is the observed discharge at time t 3 r m s e 1 n i 1 n e o 2 where n is the number of test points in the arithmetic mean i is the observation being tested e is the estimated output and o is the observed data 4 p b i a s i 1 n q e i i 1 n q o i i 1 n q o i 100 where q o i is the observed discharge on day i and q e i is the estimated discharge on day i n is the number of streamflow days r² values are defined as the square of the coefficient of correlation steel and torrie 1960 the nse ranges from to 1 a value of 1 nse 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the modeled discharge and the observed data a value of 0 nse 0 indicates that the model predictions are as accurate as the mean of the observed data whereas an efficiency of less than zero nse 0 denotes that the observed mean is a better predictor than the model result or the model residual variance i e the numerator in the nse equation is larger than the data variance i e the denominator nash and sutcliffe 1970 pbias is the deviation of the simulated flow time series from the observed data and expressed as a percentage moriasi et al 2007 for cropping change hydrologic impact assessment the swat model was run for 20 years 1993 2013 daily simulations of annual monthly and irrigation and non irrigation seasons and 2 years normal 2008 and dry 2011 daily simulations of irrigation and non irrigation seasons the normal and dry years were selected based on the outflow of caballo dam crop area and annual precipitation the outflow of caballo dam and crop area were 337 7 mm 105 of the 20 years average and 87 3 km2 21 572 acres for normal year 2008 and 198 5 mm 61 of the 20 years average and 82 6 km2 20 410 acres for dry year 2011 the annual precipitation of normal 2008 and dry 2011 years were 324 9 mm 120 of the 20 years average and 235 7 mm 87 of the 20 years average respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model calibration and validation considering irrigation a total of 22 most influential parameters were selected for

and gw revap and auto irrigation flowmin divmax flowfr auto wstrs irr eff irr mx irr asq and heat unit processes the final values of model parameters were selected based on a statistical evaluation of the performance measures table 2 swat calibration is deemed acceptable if r² is greater than 0 60 and nse is greater than 0 50 santhi et al 2001 furthermore a pbias of up to 25 of the monthly flow is acceptable moriasi et al 2007 comparison of the observed and simulated daily streamflow values at the watershed outlet for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 5 the observed and simulated values agree reasonably well the arrey canal at the head of the watershed of the rincon valley represents significant hydrological controls in the main reach as well as major diversions of water resources for agricultural areas therefore optimizing the swat model accurately simulate discharge at the main reach and canal irrigation diversion is important the statistical results for the daily streamflow for the model calibration and validation are summarized in table 3 the average model efficiency expressed as the r² value was greater than 0 85 the rmse during the calibration and validation periods was 1 53 mm day at the watershed outlet the average nse for the calibration and validation periods was 0 95 and typically greater than 0 94 the pbias range of the calibration and validation periods was 6 9 18 5 these model performance indicators suggest satisfactory simulation the monthly verification results for the diversion qdiv and irrigation qirr water volume for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 6 for the estimation of diversion water in the swat model irrigation source was controlled by the following parameters maximum daily irrigation diversion divmax and a fraction of available flow allowed to be used for irrigation flowfr simulated diversion water was estimated by discharge m3 s at the reach of irrigation source minus discharge m3 s at the next reach then it was converted to volume mm year based on agricultural land area the observed average volume of the arrey canal was 1272 mm year 4 2 ft and simulated average volume of irrigation source was 1262 mm day 4 1 ft during the calibration and validation period 2000 2006 for the agricultural area fig 6a for the estimation of irrigation water auto irrigation was controlled by the following parameters irrigation efficiency irr eff and heat units the irrigation water was simulated for each crop in different hrus and compared to simulated diversion water the diversion water was used 64 71 for crop irrigation during the 6 years within the swat model based on these simulated irrigation efficiencies 64 71 for each year observed diversion water was calculated back to irrigation water because it is difficult to measure how much water was used for irrigation only the calculated irrigation water was 854 mm year 2 8 ft and the irrigation water simulated by the swat model over the agricultural area was 849 mm day 2 8 ft during the calibration and validation period 2000 2006 fig 6b the model tends to overestimate the diversion and irrigation amount from the dry years 2003 and 2004 such overestimation may result from the fact that groundwater was pumped to supplement the surface water shortage and the simulated water volume or artificial outflow does not consider the groundwater component for agricultural areas the verification results of the diversion and irrigation water volume rendered average r2 values of 0 84 and 0 83 nse values of 0 55 and 0 56 and pbias of 21 and 22 respectively the monthly verification results for the evapotranspiration for 6 years 2000 2005 are shown in fig 6c the simulated monthly evapotranspiration values were compared to crop irrigation requirement data for agricultural areas only comparison of the swat evapotranspiration with the crop irrigation requirement data shows good agreement the verification results of the evapotranspiration rendered average r2 value of 0 95 nse value of 0 55 and pbias of 15 respectively 3 2 water balance analysis by crop irrigation 3 2 1 surface groundwater interaction and groundwater recharge fig 7 illustrates 20 year average 1994 2013 monthly discharge results at the rincon valley watershed outlet the simulated watershed scale a surface runoff b lateral flow and c return flow proportions of the total discharge were 2 11 and 87 respectively the surface runoff lateral flow and return flow have a significant seasonal periodicity the range and the upper and lower quartiles of the monthly data indicate a high inter annual variability furthermore surface runoff and lateral flows had widely different lag times the monthly surface runoff was characterized by higher discharges 0 2 0 5 mm from april to september compared to the period of a low flow season from october to march however the monthly return flows were characterized by higher discharges 1 6 6 8 mm and 11 2 45 2 mm from july to december and have 3 months lag for high discharge season compared to surface runoff because surface water directly goes to the river while the lateral flows infiltrate into vadose zone and groundwater and finally reach the river which requires longer travel time fig 8 shows the average monthly exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater and groundwater recharge of the entire rincon valley for the simulation period the depicted fluxes represent the net exchange values resulting from surface water infiltration groundwater to shallow and deep aquifer and groundwater exfiltration lateral flow and return flow into the river fig 8a on average the period from april to september irrigation season was characterized by a net flux of infiltration into the groundwater for the period from october to march the proportion of groundwater flow into the river is nearly balanced by a slight increase in groundwater to the shallow and deep aquifer from april to september the simulated groundwater recharge showed a distinct seasonal variability and the same pattern with exchange fluxes fig 8b the net exchange fluxes between surface water and groundwater presented above influence the groundwater recharge in the basin krause and bronstert 2007 the net groundwater recharge was positive during the period of average surface water infiltration into the groundwater in the irrigation season from april to september while there is no groundwater recharge from october to march in general there is no water in the canals during this period and the recharge from local precipitation is limited or insignificant comparing the values of the average surface water infiltration 97 2 mm and the simultaneous groundwater recharge 17 4 mm up to 18 of the infiltration during the irrigation season contributes to direct groundwater recharge 3 2 2 vertical water budget and horizontal water transfer the water balance analysis was conducted for 20 years 1994 2013 to quantify the linkages between the surface water and groundwater regime in the rincon valley average period of simulation values of different components of the vertical water budget were analysed at aggregate watershed scale these components include infiltration infilt and evapotranspiration et at the surface percolation percol and soil water storage sw from the unsaturated zone and re evaporation revap and groundwater recharge gr from the shallow aquifer to deep aquifer the horizontal water transfer was evaluated using surface runoff sq lateral flow lq which originates below the surface but above the saturated zone contributing to streamflow and return flow rq from the shallow aquifer to the river the total runoff tq is the sum of the 3 components namely sq lq and rq table 4 summarizes the simulated irrigation season non irrigation season and annual water balance over the simulation period for the whole watershed and for the agricultural area only the annual average ratio of et sq lq and rq to precipitation and irrigation over the period of simulation for the whole watershed were found to be 58 0 5 3 and 21 respectively and 69 4 19 and 16 respectively for the agricultural area only the et values for the irrigation season were estimated to be 64 150 5 mm for the whole watershed and 68 696 1 mm for the agricultural areas higher than 41 34 0 mm for the whole watershed and 79 88 2 mm for the agricultural areas for the non irrigation season the sq and lq for irrigation season were estimated to be 0 6 and 3 respectively for the whole watershed and 4 and 20 respectively for the agricultural area only the irrigation season sq is 0 4 higher than sq during non irrigation season likewise the irrigation season lq is 1 higher than the sq 0 2 whereas during non irrigation season the lq is 2 higher compared to the sq 1 and lq 10 for the non irrigation season for the agricultural area only the watershed scale sq and lq are 3 and 10 higher respectively however the model produces 28 more rq for the non irrigation season 42 than for the irrigation season 14 in the whole watershed and 7 more rq for the non irrigation season 22 than for the irrigation season 15 in agricultural areas over the simulation period these results show that rq is affected by irrigation during the irrigation season and that it continues to increase in the non irrigation season because of lag time e g 3 month lag time for high return flow discharge these results indicate the importance of accounting for rq in water budget analyses in the elephant butte irrigation district in particular the increase in the non irrigation season rq is an important element of the water budget in the rincon valley and a significant driver of vulnerability of water availability to sustain irrigated agriculture in this semi arid region 3 2 3 spatial distributions of hydrologic components at hrus the spatial distributions of the water balance components 1994 2013 at the hru level are shown in fig 9 the period of simulation total average annual et values for the agricultural and non agricultural areas were 695 mm and 145 mm respectively the total average annual soil water values for the agricultural and non agricultural areas were 39 mm and 22 mm respectively over the 20 year period a narrow strip of agricultural lands located along the river in the middle of the watershed received irrigation water and consequently had higher surface runoff and et than non agricultural areas the highest range of groundwater recharge at the hrus level was from 45 to 117 mm average 69 mm this high groundwater recharge was for those hrus with corn and cotton fields urbanized hrus in which built up residential areas are the predominant land use type have almost no groundwater recharge the average groundwater recharge for hrus that partially include urban developments was 6 mm soil type is another factor that affects soil water and groundwater recharge at the hrus level the predominant soil type in the rincon valley s agricultural lands is silty clay loam fig 3b loam soils contain more nutrients moisture and humus and have better drainage and infiltration of water and groundwater recharge as compared to other soil types awan and ismaeel 2014 3 3 assessment of hydrologic responses by weather conditions and crop coverage changes 3 3 1 water budget by different weather condition and crop coverage changes at irrigation units the simulated water balance components irr p et sq sw and gr during a normal year 2008 and a dry year 2011 for 4 irrigation units within the agricultural area are shown in table 5 the crop areas were 66 4 km2 16 408 areas for the normal year and 63 8 km2 15 765areas for the dry year within the boundary of 4 irrigation units fig 1 the precipitation and outflow of caballo dam in the dry year were only 67 and 59 of the normal year respectively despite the low amounts of the local precipitation and dam outflow for the dry year the ratio of et to precipitation and irrigation water was 5 higher than the normal year by the irrigation units however the sq sw and gr for the dry year were 7 17 and 39 lower than the normal year respectively the outlet flow leasburg was around the 90 of the inlet flow caballo dam release and the main reach of rincon valley tended to lose water from upstream to downstream due to irrigation the local precipitation also tended to decrease from upstream to downstream although the natural flow resulting from the local precipitation amounted to only about 10 of the flow at the watershed outlet leasburg hence the evaluation of the water budget demonstrates the critical role of irrigation to sustain agriculture in this semi arid environment as compared to local precipitation furthermore the net water losses from upstream to downstream of the watershed directly affected gr in the normal year there was a sharp fall in the gr in the garfield unit where crop areas are the largest while similar decline was not detected in gr simulations for the hatch and rincon units on the other hand the gr tended to decrease sharply from upstream to downstream in the dry year especially in the arrey unit the irr et and sq for the normal year were much higher than the dry year compared to other units because the water budget of arrey unit is directly affected by the inlet flow from caballo dam which decreased by 40 during the dry year compared to the normal year 2008 additional study is needed to better characterize the performance of the irrigation in this area 3 3 2 spatial distributions of hydrologic components at irrigation units the comparison of spatial distributions of the hydrologic components at the hrus level within the irrigation units during the normal year 2008 and dry year 2011 are shown in fig 10 the amount of irrigation varies in different localities the top water using crops in the watershed ranked in order are alfalfa pecans cotton corn lowe and gereffi 2008 the areas of alfalfa pecans cotton and corn within the boundary of 4 irrigation units were 56 11 17 and 11 respectively for the normal year and 42 10 30 and 6 for the dry year respectively in other words the alfalfa 15 and corn 5 fields were taken out of production in the dry year while the coverage of cotton fields increased by 13 and pecans did not change significantly the total amount of irrigation was not significantly different between the dry year and normal year in the dry year the planted area of alfalfa that is the largest water user in the watershed reduced whereas the planted area of cotton that has a relatively low root length density and higher resilience to short term water stresses when compared to other crop species increased a good understanding of the interaction of the plant with the water supply and the ambient environment dictating water use is essential to proper water and land management krieg 2000 expectedly the soil water storage and groundwater recharge for the dry year were lower than the normal year as a result of groundwater over extraction 4 conclusions this study improves understanding of the hydrologic components of irrigated agriculture in semi arid watersheds by examining drought adaptive cropping change and irrigation operations in rincon valley new mexico swat model was used to characterize hydrologic components at a fine temporal i e daily and spatial resolution i e hru level and irrigation unit scale which help to visualize spatial variability in water fluxes and water availability the use of daily observed canal flows in model calibrations facilitated realistic simulation of irrigation operations simulation results indicated the temporal and spatial variability of hydrologic fluxes in the agricultural area during irrigation and non irrigation seasons namely surface runoff evapotranspiration infiltration percolation baseflow soil moisture and groundwater recharge one limitation of the model is that it does not explicitly represent groundwater withdrawal to meet irrigation demand which introduced flow volume errors when simulating discharge during the calibration period the impact of different weather conditions and cropping change on the water supply at watershed scale depends on a complex set of local factors including rainfall soil types and irrigation related groundwater recharge making it difficult to generalize the most water efficient cropping pattern and locations during a dry year irrigation water supply does not fully cover the entire growing season prompting farmers to reduce crop acreage in order to adapt to higher aridity levels during droughts the soil water storage and groundwater recharge variations became more apparent indicating the need for careful irrigation planning and management taking into account the impact of irrigation on the water budget not only within the irrigated areas but also at the watershed scale attention should be paid to the amount of water being diverted from surface water and groundwater ensuring that the diversion occurs optimally in terms of time location and quantity further research is needed to simulate hydrologic components under plausible future climate projections to inform

11354,date palm phoenix dactylifera l fruit wilting disorder caused by the high increase in temperature and decrease in relative humidity of the environment is more prevailing due to climate change over the last decades this has affected negatively the economy of single product palm growers the physiological effects of deficit irrigation on mazafati date palm during four months starting from two months before flowering early january up to two months after flowering which is concomitant with the middle of the kimri stage late april was investigated two irrigation levels of 100 etc and 70 etc at three irrigation intervals of 50 100 and 150 mm cumulative evaporation in two locations with different average daily and annual temperatures in sistan and baluchestan province of iran were compared deficit irrigation at intervals of 100 mm evaporation resulted to the highest bunch weight and yield in two orchards and the highest water use efficiency was obtained in the location 2 warmer area wilting percentage of bunch was not affected by irrigation levels but the irrigation interval at 100 mm evaporation showed the best control the increase in mean weight of fruit was observed only in the location 1 with irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 mm evaporation the highest amount of soluble solids and soluble sugars was obtained in the second location with irrigation interval at 150 mm evaporation total phenolic compounds and fruit starch showed the lowest and highest with full irrigation respectively deficit irrigation at all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in fruits and leaves reduction of calcium and iron of leaf during the disorder was observed with deficit irrigation at different irrigation intervals however reduction in leaf zinc was observed only at 150 mm irrigation interval according to the results irrigation level of 70 with 100 did not show a significant difference in fruit qualitative properties and irrigation at 100 mm evaporation intervals before the disorder risk period is recommended to control the disorder it seems to be a more increasing in percentage or duration of deficit irrigation on date palm in future researches to be promising keywords phoenix dactylifera yield antioxidants enzymes climate water use efficiency 1 introduction date palm phoenix dactylifera l fruit wilting disorder has become the main problem to date growers in the last two decades the reasons for this phenomenon is falling the relative humidity to less than 20 and the increase in temperature to over 45 c accompanied with hot winds occurring during the khalal into the rotab fruit growth stages this will cause the whole fruits of bunch to drop within ten days the bunches and stalks that are not in this phase of fruit growth due to later fertilization are not affected mireei and sadeghi 2013 deficit irrigation di is referred to as water restriction in certain growth periods of the plants and was first used in the 1980s as a way to limit vegetative growth of peaches and save water di reduces mainly the vegetative growth of trees and as a result reduces the competition of vegetative and reproductive growth and significantly reduces the cost of orchard operations this reduction in costs can in some cases offset a reduction in profits due to the reduction in the size of the fruit chalmers 1981 the use of di in controlling diseases and improving the quality of the fruit is less considered for example one of its positive results is the reduction of cadmium in fruits benavides et al 2005 it also controls the physiological disorders of blossom end rot in tomato and bitter pit in apple which are due to calcium deficiency in fruit and also botrytis bunch rot disease in grapes austin and wilcox 2011 mpelasoka et al 2001 zegbe domınguez et al 2003 date bunch wilting disorder have been damaging soft dates for many years if di properly programmed no or less negative effects will occur the sensitivity of flower buds to water deficiency is different during the flowering period and thereafter in peaches due to flower induction and fruit growth early september in the northern hemisphere represents the time of transition from sensitivity and then the sensitivity decreases in the late ripening cultivars of stone fruits the lag phase of fruit growth of pith hardening is a suitable period for reduced irrigation during this period the growth of fruits is slow and with applying di the growth of the shoots will decrease and the fruit content will improve naor 2005 the best results in pistachio achieved when a di equivalent of etc 50 applied in the second stage of fruit growth full shell expansion to the onset of rapid kernel growth and etc 25 after harvest the most stressful period in pistachio begins with the onset of the third stage or rapid kernel growth goldhamer and beede 2004 the induction of persimmon flowers is in the summer of previous year and the differentiation of flower organs will occur the current season until flowering so the effect of di during flowering fruit set and the first half of may beginning of flower induction for next season will affect the yield and the size of the fruit in the current and next season kanety et al 2014 for conference pear complete irrigation until harvest and up to two weeks after harvesting and then di until the stage of leaf fall is recommended because in contrast to the control it maintained yield and fruit quality of the next year by storing marsal et al 2012 reduced irrigation of dates increased water productivity as well as the beneficial effects on early ripening and reducing the contamination by the fungus fusarium proliferratum and reduced fruit dropping gribaa et al 2013 hillel 2013 for this di has been used in the range of 65 75 of full irrigation based on evapotranspiration measurements different cultivars and different stages of date fruit growth have shown different sensitivity to di liebenberg and zaid 1999 during the development of the bunch and its rachis the date fruitlets grow slowly and probably do not require a large volume of water in contrast after the end of the rachis growth 2nd half of april there is a rapid increase in the fruit size so it is expected that di during this phenological stage will lead to small fruits and a decrease in yield hence palm growers should be warned for not limiting water supply during this period gribaa et al 2013 considering the mentioned report in present research di during a four month period was applied for the control of the mazafati date bunch wilting while the physicochemical parameters of fruit and the antioxidants and stress marker changes were considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design during the growing season in 2017 two orchards of 10 12 year old mazafati date 8 8 m with a history of bunch wilting were selected in two regions of sistan and baluchestan province of iran the geographic and climatic characteristics of the two studied locations are shown in table 1 selected palm trees were pollinated with pollen of m003 genotype in both locations and tried to be under uniform orchard operations throughout the season after the fruit set about 4 weeks after pollination the number of bunches was adjusted to 8 per palm tree determination of the amount of water delivered to the plants was estimated according to the penman monteith equation and was distributed to the trees by volume meter the amount of plant evapotranspiration etc in this method is etc eto kc where eto is reference evapotranspiration and kc is crop coefficient and its value was determined according to the values provided for the dates by the fao allen et al 1998 irrigation water was

distilled water and oven dried for 48 h at 65 oc in paper bags samples were ground and wet digested as described by chapman chapman and pratt 1961 nitrogen n was analyzed by micro kjeldahl procedure phosphorus p calcium ca magnesium mn copper cu zinc zn and iron fe elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer 3110 potassium k concentration was determined by emission flame photometer 2 5 statistical analysis of data this research was conducted as a factorial main factors the amount and intervals of irrigation in a randomized complete block design with four replications in two locations combined and comparison of the means were analyzed by sas statistical software version 9 4 using lsd at 0 05 level selahvarzi et al 2017 comparison of the means in terms of variance analysis were in three ways 1 if the interaction of the location irrigation intervals irrigation amount in each parameter was significant all treatments in both locations were compared together in present study this case was not observed with the mean of any parameters 2 if the interaction between the location irrigation intervals irrigation amounts were not significant but the location effect was significant the comparison of the means was done separately for each location finally 3 if the effects of location irrigation intervals irrigation amount as well as location were not significant the means of the two locations were compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 bunch weight yield and water use efficiency the location had a significant effect on bunch weight table 3 therefore analysis of this parameter was done separately for each location as presented in table 4 in l1 the highest bunch weight was obtained by p50v100 but due to the insignificant difference of p100v70 treatment with this treatment p100v70 is considered as superior treatment in terms of water saving and reducing irrigation costs also p100v70 treatment in l2 significantly increased the bunch weight about the yield according to the table of variance analysis and the lack of location effect table 3 the mean of both locations was compared for each treatment and the highest yield per tree was obtained by p100v70 in both locations while treatment of p150v100 produced the lowest bunch weight and yield the location had a significant effect on water use efficiency according to table 4 in l1 different irrigation periods and rates did not have a significant effect but in l2 p100v70 caused a significant increase in water use efficiency compared to other treatments the effect of water availability on plant growth is due to changes in stomatal conductance carbon uptake and turgor pressure potential of plant tissues the effect of di on fruit yield and quality depends on the phenological stage of vegetative and reproductive growth duration and severity of water restriction and difference between the species in stonefruits plant water status has been well documented as a factor affecting the level of tree s yield intrigliolo and castel 2006 but in citrus trees there may not be interactive between the deficit irrigation and tree s yield pérez pérez et al 2008a so needing to examine different species in one season in the lane late navel citrus during four seasons water saving up to 19 was feasible without reducing the yield by applying a daily water stress of 70 mpa and rdi of 50 etc irrigation limitations from july to mid september ballester et al 2013 non irrigation of mango trees in south africa during the winter months development and expansion of flower buds increased production by up to 9 decreased water consumption by 20 and did not have a negative impact on fruit size mostert and hoffman 1996 application of water stress in four different 5 week periods after flowering up to fruit maturation of banana showed that water stress in the first and last 5 week after flowering had the lowest and highest yields respectively hegde and srinivas 1989 in khadravi date soil moisture in the zone of root development during ripening was about 25 of field capacity but no significant decrease was observed in leaf growth and no significant difference was observed between treatments in terms of yield and fruit quality furr et al 1952 3 2 bunch wilting and dropping wilt and drop percentage of fruits at six stages of fruit growth and development were measured in the kimri stage according to table 3 due to the significance of the location effect the analyzes were performed separately for each location there was no significant difference among levels in any of the stages this means that water restriction up to 70 etc did not cause disruption in fruit growth except from the kimri stage in the other stages the wilting percent was significant due to the irrigation intervals so according to table 5 up to the kimri stage and the beginning of the khalal stage the shortest irrigation interval p50 was effective in reducing dropping but after this stage the irrigation interval of p100 controlled the dropping also in total p100v70 treatment showed the highest control of the disorder the p150 treatments at both irrigation levels except the harvest stage caused the highest dropping of fruit while p50 treatment showed the highest wilt and drop at harvest it should be mentioned that the p150v100 treatment was partially close to the amount and interval of the traditional irrigation by the palm growers of the two locations deficit irrigation depending on the time of its application may increase the flower buds in the trees and during flowering and setting the fruit can affect the dropping of young flowers and fruits pérez pérez et al 2008b repeated irrigation in the 3 year period on palm trees of maktum cultivar caused more growth late ripening of fruit and larger fruit production while the amount of damage caused by the black tip and the fruit shrinkage was high sharples and hilgeman 1951 drought stress in persimmon during flowering caused increased fruit dropping and depending on the time of its application reduced the growth of leaves and flower buds increased intake of minerals especially potassium ben arie et al 2008 in persimmon there was no significant difference between the amount of natural dropping among the water stress levels in the advanced stages of fruit development this showed that difference in the number of fruit was probably due to the response to irrigation in the early stages of the reproductive cycle such as flower induction differentiation and fruitset kanety et al 2014 3 3 fruit physical properties according to table 6 the mean fruit weight in two locations was significant so that in l1 irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 compared to irrigation intervals of 150 at both levels of irrigation increased fruit weight but in l2 p50v100 and p150v70 treatments reduced mean weight of fruits table 7 also according to the results of tables 6 and 7 the fruit length was not affected by the location and the mean of the two locations indicated that irrigation intervals of 100 at both levels of irrigation significantly increased the fruit length but p50v100 and p150v70 treatments significantly decreased this parameter according to the mentioned tables the fruit firmness was not affected by the location but irrigation volume had a significant effect such that irrigation level of 70 in different irrigation intervals increased the firmness compared to the irrigation level of 100 however this increase was only significant at 50 irrigation intervals and p50v70 caused the highest fruit firmness while the p50v100 caused the lowest between all treatments deficit irrigation strategies lead to a change in carbon allocation patterns increased fruit growth versus vegetative growth and increased plant productivity the cellular expansion of the fruit is more affected by water stress than its cell division the expansion of the cell can occur only when the turgor pressure is greater than the cell wall resistance the stress threshold of water greatly blocks the cells and cell growth decreases due to the low turgor pressure shao et al 2008 in peach the amount of fruit dry matter increased with low irrigation stress which means that the water flow to the fruit is more limited than carbohydrates low leaf stomatal conductance reduced the peach fruit weight and size in the harvest without affecting the number of fruits per tree water stress increased the concentration of lignin and the firmness of the peach fruit the positive correlation between the firmness of peach fruit and the concentration of cell wall materials confirmed the results of the increase in the fruit firmness rahmati et al 2015 water stress in citrus during the flowering stage and fruit set threatened the yield with decreasing fruit diameter and water limitations during the last stage of fruit growth and maturation reduced the yield by reducing the fruit weight while water limits of 50 etc during the months of july and august allowed to reduce water use without any reduction of yield and fruit size in citrus garcía tejero et al 2010 four di seasons from july to mid september at lane late navel citrus reduced 9 of fruit weight although yields did not decrease and fruits at the end of the year reached 81 of their final size but the nulz clementine mandarin with a shorter growth time gained only about 71 of size so the threshold for irrigation reduction in navel oranges was higher which did not reduce the yield ballester et al 2013 also water limitation in citrus led to the decomposition of cell wall polymers and further decrease in the osmotic potential of the fruit and ultimately the fruit firmness garcía tejero et al 2010 deficit irrigation during early fruit growth over the years reduced the fruit size in leccino olive rapoport et al 2004 3 4 chemical properties according to tables 6 and 7 tss of fruit was affected by the location and it was higher in l2 compared l1 at all treatment combinations in l1 different treatments did not show significant effect on this parameter but in l2 irrigation interval of p150 at both levels of 70 and 100 and p100 at level of 70 showed the highest tss levels different treatments at two locations did not have a significant effect on the amount of fruit acid 0 29 0 27 data not shown in the case of soluble sugars the location had significant effect at 5 level on this parameter so that at l1 soluble sugars was lower than l2 the effect of irrigation intervals was also significant for this parameter and by increasing the irrigation intervals the soluble sugars also increased location did not have a significant effect on the total phenol content of the fruit table 6 therefore the mean of total phenol content in two locations were compared although only p150v100 was significantly different with other treatments but higher water volume v100 resulted to lower total phenols in all treatments table 7 the amount of fruit starch was effected by the location at harvest time the effect of treatments in two locations was largely similar so that the irrigation amount of 100 etc in different irrigation intervals significantly increased this fruit parameter among these treatments p150v70 showed the lowest starch content in fruit tables 6 and 7 the concentration of fruit s non structural compounds is directly affected by water stress the amount of material entering the fruit is affected by the osmotic regulation mild osmosis stress may lead to reduced plant growth and increased concentrations of secondary metabolites under water stress condition and decreased co2 absorption carbon should be allocated to the synthesis of the primary metabolites for the growth of the fruit however the increase and accumulation of polyphenols in response to rdi in peach grape and olive has been reported austin and wilcox 2011 buendía et al 2008 tovar et al 2002 it can be suggested that an active accumulation of sugars accompanied by the lower water potential and higher concentration of solutes would increase the tss of the fruit under lower water condition intrigliolo and castel 2010 the concentration of total carbohydrates and organic acids in peach at intensive water stress during harvest mainly increased by reducing the fruit dilution while the concentration of polyphenols was strongly reduced through metabolic effects rahmati et al 2015 in peach fruit growth reduced under water stress thus by decreasing the use of glucose and fructose in glycolysis their content increased however since water stress caused precocity there was no significant difference with control in glucose and fructose during harvest rahmati et al 2015 water deficit in the final stage of fruit growth in stonefruits reduces fruit yeild but leads to positive aspects of increasing tss and precocity of fruit besset et al 2001 deficit irrigation reduces the growth of peach fruit so the respiration of growth and maintenance should be lower reducing vegetative growth and peach tree load in di caused the product to be more exposed to light and therefor photo oxidation that decreased some of the antioxidant contents of fruits including vitamin c and carotenoids but the content of phenolic compounds mainly anthocyanin and procyanidin increased by ultraviolet radiation to counteract the oxidative damage of tissue buendía et al 2008 during water stress the main chemical components of date fruit including sugars fibers pectin tannins and vitamins were reduced ahmed et al 1995 the total dry matter content of khalas date increased significantly under water stress at once a week irrigation but tss pectin sucrose tannin and ph did not differ significantly between irrigation treatments al yahyai and al kharusi 2012 deficit irrigation of citrus trees on cleopatra rootstock caused reduction of water percentage but increased sugar accumulation and tss due to redistribution of plant photosynthesis towards fruit however intense water stress caused further increase in acids compared with sugars so the quality of the fruit reduced romero et al 2006 irrigation of olive plants with a 60 etc retained the amount of soluble sugars in the leaf similar to the full irrigation treatment but the starch content of the leaves decreased significantly this was explained to be primarily associated with osmotic regulation of tissue bacelar et al 2007 as explained by many researchers in plants after exposure to stress osmotic compounds such as soluble sugars amino acids such as proline aspartic acid and glutamic acid ammonium compounds and hydrophilic proteins accumulate and one of the main sources of these osmolites is starch reserves 3 5 antioxidant enzyme activities according to table 8 activity of different enzymes in leaf and fruit were the same in two locations the irrigation level of 70 etc in all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of pod enzyme in the fruit however in the leaves 100 etc in all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of this enzyme but this increase was significant only in irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 compared to the 150 treatment although it was higher at p100v70 treatment in both leaves and fruits table 9 sod activity was not significantly different in leaves and fruits of different treatments regarding the activity of ppo in fruit 100 irrigation of etc in irrigation intervals 50 and 150 significantly increased the enzyme activity the activity of this enzyme in leaf with irrigation rate of 70 etc was lower than 100 etc at all irrigation intervals also by increasing the irrigation intervals the ppo activity decreased the activity of cat enzyme in fruit significantly increased with 70 irrigation of etc at all irrigation intervals the activity of this enzyme in leaf increased at irrigation intervals of 50 and 150 with irrigation level of 70 but decreased at 100 level the irrigation treatment of p150v70 showed the highest cat activity between the treatments cells are equipped with enzymatic antioxidants to remove the ros and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in plant species is for adaptation to stress however severe stress may lead to damage to the antioxidant system of the cell and reduction of the activity of these enzymes leading to production of more active oxygen species effective degradation of ros requires coordinated action of several antioxidant enzymes to provide good results for stress tolerance water deficit in two cultivars of olive different for tolerance to water stress increased the activity of cat gr and apx but did not have a significant effect on sod activity in both cultivars and in the chemlali olive oxidative damage was less due to the higher activity of these enzymes guerfel et al 2009 in drought stress an increase in aba and apoplastic ph resulted in increased pod activity in tomato and therefore increase of cross linking of cell phenols due to increased enzymatic activity of fruit pericarp also affected the cell growth and ultimately decreased the diameter of the fruit mingo et al 2003 in three olive cultivars exposed to water stress for one year specific antioxidant defense was achieved including increased activity of sod apx and cat in contrast ppo activity was reduced and led to the maintenance of phenols at acceptable levels ahmed et al 2009 3 6 changes of mineral elements in leaves the location had no significant effect on the concentration of macro and micro elements measured in the leaves table 10 also different treatments did not have a significant effect on the concentration of leaf n p k mn and cu at the time of the disorder irrigation level of 70 etc in irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 significantly decreased the ca concentration of leaves table 11 for fe irrigation level of 70 etc only at irrigation interval of 150 significantly reduced the concentration of this element in the leaf also according to these tables irrigation interval of 150 in two levels of irrigation significantly reduced the zn concentration of leaves and in p100 interval the v70 had significantly lower zn than v100 there is a close relation between water availability and minerals absorption because the absorption of soluble minerals depends on the flow of water in the path of soil to the roots the relationship between minerals content and irrigation limitation requires accurate estimation benefits of di include reducing minerals leaching as well as reducing the saturation of minerals and biocides in the root zone excess superoxide in chloroplasts under severe water stress conditions can enhance the concentration of iron catalyzed oh formation and damage to the mechanism of iron absorption control in the roots price and hendry 1991 early season irrigation limitations in pear trees resulted in a decrease of calcium concentration and disruption of its storage in fruits marsal et al 2012 in deficit irrigation of grapes and olives as well as partial root zone drying irrigation of apples and tomatoes the concentration of leaf and fruit minerals including nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium were not affected although their content in soil and commercially irrigated plants were better than di or prd methods nakajima et al 2004 in di of mango during three subsequent seasons only leaf minerals including phosphorus magnesium and manganese were affected zuazo et al 2011 4 conclusion fruit wilting and dropping is part of a highly organized development of a plant in response to stresses the sensitivity of date palms to stress concurrent with the maturity of tree increases due to firstly a relatively high growth rate and secondly the presence of fruits on adult trees there is also evidence that high yield may increase the sensitivity of the plant to possible stress in this research irrigation limitations were applied for the control of vegetative and reproductive growth as a strategy to reduce fruit drying and dropping due to stress under experimental condition of this research when the amount of irrigation decreased yield of date palms did not reduce significantly and stress was not harmful and the best result for the decrease in fruit wilting and dropping was achieved with 70 etc irrigation at 100 mm evaporation interval but this treatment caused significant water use efficiency only in the second orchard location irrigation amount in superior treatment p100v70 for control of the disorder was 1380 to 1480 mm per year which according to the results this amount of irrigation led to an increase of approximately 33 of the minimum yield and a reduction of 30 from the maximum wilting and drying of the fruits the question is whether the amount of water saving 85 to 102 mm in the treatment of maximum product can be further increased according to the non significant effects of applied di new research with a further reduction in the irrigation is required the water saving should be to the extent that the diminishing in the profit resulting from the reduction in yield is compensated by reducing production costs and reducing the dropping disorder 
11354,date palm phoenix dactylifera l fruit wilting disorder caused by the high increase in temperature and decrease in relative humidity of the environment is more prevailing due to climate change over the last decades this has affected negatively the economy of single product palm growers the physiological effects of deficit irrigation on mazafati date palm during four months starting from two months before flowering early january up to two months after flowering which is concomitant with the middle of the kimri stage late april was investigated two irrigation levels of 100 etc and 70 etc at three irrigation intervals of 50 100 and 150 mm cumulative evaporation in two locations with different average daily and annual temperatures in sistan and baluchestan province of iran were compared deficit irrigation at intervals of 100 mm evaporation resulted to the highest bunch weight and yield in two orchards and the highest water use efficiency was obtained in the location 2 warmer area wilting percentage of bunch was not affected by irrigation levels but the irrigation interval at 100 mm evaporation showed the best control the increase in mean weight of fruit was observed only in the location 1 with irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 mm evaporation the highest amount of soluble solids and soluble sugars was obtained in the second location with irrigation interval at 150 mm evaporation total phenolic compounds and fruit starch showed the lowest and highest with full irrigation respectively deficit irrigation at all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in fruits and leaves reduction of calcium and iron of leaf during the disorder was observed with deficit irrigation at different irrigation intervals however reduction in leaf zinc was observed only at 150 mm irrigation interval according to the results irrigation level of 70 with 100 did not show a significant difference in fruit qualitative properties and irrigation at 100 mm evaporation intervals before the disorder risk period is recommended to control the disorder it seems to be a more increasing in percentage or duration of deficit irrigation on date palm in future researches to be promising keywords phoenix dactylifera yield antioxidants enzymes climate water use efficiency 1 introduction date palm phoenix dactylifera l fruit wilting disorder has become the main problem to date growers in the last two decades the reasons for this phenomenon is falling the relative humidity to less than 20 and the increase in temperature to over 45 c accompanied with hot winds occurring during the khalal into the rotab fruit growth stages this will cause the whole fruits of bunch to drop within ten days the bunches and stalks that are not in this phase of fruit growth due to later fertilization are not affected mireei and sadeghi 2013 deficit irrigation di is referred to as water restriction in certain growth periods of the plants and was first used in the 1980s as a way to limit vegetative growth of peaches and save water di reduces mainly the vegetative growth of trees and as a result reduces the competition of vegetative and reproductive growth and significantly reduces the cost of orchard operations this reduction in costs can in some cases offset a reduction in profits due to the reduction in the size of the fruit chalmers 1981 the use of di in controlling diseases and improving the quality of the fruit is less considered for example one of its positive results is the reduction of cadmium in fruits benavides et al 2005 it also controls the physiological disorders of blossom end rot in tomato and bitter pit in apple which are due to calcium deficiency in fruit and also botrytis bunch rot disease in grapes austin and wilcox 2011 mpelasoka et al 2001 zegbe domınguez et al 2003 date bunch wilting disorder have been damaging soft dates for many years if di properly programmed no or less negative effects will occur the sensitivity of flower buds to water deficiency is different during the flowering period and thereafter in peaches due to flower induction and fruit growth early september in the northern hemisphere represents the time of transition from sensitivity and then the sensitivity decreases in the late ripening cultivars of stone fruits the lag phase of fruit growth of pith hardening is a suitable period for reduced irrigation during this period the growth of fruits is slow and with applying di the growth of the shoots will decrease and the fruit content will improve naor 2005 the best results in pistachio achieved when a di equivalent of etc 50 applied in the second stage of fruit growth full shell expansion to the onset of rapid kernel growth and etc 25 after harvest the most stressful period in pistachio begins with the onset of the third stage or rapid kernel growth goldhamer and beede 2004 the induction of persimmon flowers is in the summer of previous year and the differentiation of flower organs will occur the current season until flowering so the effect of di during flowering fruit set and the first half of may beginning of flower induction for next season will affect the yield and the size of the fruit in the current and next season kanety et al 2014 for conference pear complete irrigation until harvest and up to two weeks after harvesting and then di until the stage of leaf fall is recommended because in contrast to the control it maintained yield and fruit quality of the next year by storing marsal et al 2012 reduced irrigation of dates increased water productivity as well as the beneficial effects on early ripening and reducing the contamination by the fungus fusarium proliferratum and reduced fruit dropping gribaa et al 2013 hillel 2013 for this di has been used in the range of 65 75 of full irrigation based on evapotranspiration measurements different cultivars and different stages of date fruit growth have shown different sensitivity to di liebenberg and zaid 1999 during the development of the bunch and its rachis the date fruitlets grow slowly and probably do not require a large volume of water in contrast after the end of the rachis growth 2nd half of april there is a rapid increase in the fruit size so it is expected that di during this phenological stage will lead to small fruits and a decrease in yield hence palm growers should be warned for not limiting water supply during this period gribaa et al 2013 considering the mentioned report in present research di during a four month period was applied for the control of the mazafati date bunch wilting while the physicochemical parameters of fruit and the antioxidants and stress marker changes were considered 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant materials and experimental design during the growing season in 2017 two orchards of 10 12 year old mazafati date 8 8 m with a history of bunch wilting were selected in two regions of sistan and baluchestan province of iran the geographic and climatic characteristics of the two studied locations are shown in table 1 selected palm trees were pollinated with pollen of m003 genotype in both locations and tried to be under uniform orchard operations throughout the season after the fruit set about 4 weeks after pollination the number of bunches was adjusted to 8 per palm tree determination of the amount of water delivered to the plants was estimated according to the penman monteith equation and was distributed to the trees by volume meter the amount of plant evapotranspiration etc in this method is etc eto kc where eto is reference evapotranspiration and kc is crop coefficient and its value was determined according to the values provided for the dates by the fao allen et al 1998 irrigation water was delivered through a babbler system with an average of 4 5 liters per minute around the palms irrigations were applied for intervals of 50 100 and 150 mm cumulative evaporation p50 p100 and p150 at two irrigation levels of 70 v70 and 100 v100 etc for four months from 2 months before bunching up to two months after it mid stage of kimri before and after this period irrigation was carried out with the usual amount and interval of the area 7 10 days in warm months and up to 24 27 days in cool months the amount of water delivered to the plants the applied crop coefficient and the irrigation dates during the mentioned period are given in table 2 at the harvest stage rutab all bunches were harvested from each tree and the total weight of the fruits were recorded water use efficiency wue was calculated as fresh date palm yield in each tree divided by total year irrigation water applied five strands of each brunch from four bunches were randomly assigned in each tree at four directions and the number of fruits after fruit set were recorded in these strands the number of dried and dropping fruits were recorded at each stage of fruit growth till harvest time and expressed as percentage sampling of leaflets from the middle of the leaves around each tree in the stage of disorder 50 drying and dropping during the khalal up to rutab stage was carried out to measure the mineral elements fruit samples 20 fruits of each bunch were collected at the rutab stage to determine the physicochemical parameters fruit samples and leaf samples adjacent to the bunch were collected for measuring enzyme activity collected fruit and leaf samples were frozen immediately and kept at 80 c for the biochemical measurements 2 2 determination of physical and biochemical traits fruit firmness was

distilled water and oven dried for 48 h at 65 oc in paper bags samples were ground and wet digested as described by chapman chapman and pratt 1961 nitrogen n was analyzed by micro kjeldahl procedure phosphorus p calcium ca magnesium mn copper cu zinc zn and iron fe elements were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer perkin elmer 3110 potassium k concentration was determined by emission flame photometer 2 5 statistical analysis of data this research was conducted as a factorial main factors the amount and intervals of irrigation in a randomized complete block design with four replications in two locations combined and comparison of the means were analyzed by sas statistical software version 9 4 using lsd at 0 05 level selahvarzi et al 2017 comparison of the means in terms of variance analysis were in three ways 1 if the interaction of the location irrigation intervals irrigation amount in each parameter was significant all treatments in both locations were compared together in present study this case was not observed with the mean of any parameters 2 if the interaction between the location irrigation intervals irrigation amounts were not significant but the location effect was significant the comparison of the means was done separately for each location finally 3 if the effects of location irrigation intervals irrigation amount as well as location were not significant the means of the two locations were compared 3 results and discussion 3 1 bunch weight yield and water use efficiency the location had a significant effect on bunch weight table 3 therefore analysis of this parameter was done separately for each location as presented in table 4 in l1 the highest bunch weight was obtained by p50v100 but due to the insignificant difference of p100v70 treatment with this treatment p100v70 is considered as superior treatment in terms of water saving and reducing irrigation costs also p100v70 treatment in l2 significantly increased the bunch weight about the yield according to the table of variance analysis and the lack of location effect table 3 the mean of both locations was compared for each treatment and the highest yield per tree was obtained by p100v70 in both locations while treatment of p150v100 produced the lowest bunch weight and yield the location had a significant effect on water use efficiency according to table 4 in l1 different irrigation periods and rates did not have a significant effect but in l2 p100v70 caused a significant increase in water use efficiency compared to other treatments the effect of water availability on plant growth is due to changes in stomatal conductance carbon uptake and turgor pressure potential of plant tissues the effect of di on fruit yield and quality depends on the phenological stage of vegetative and reproductive growth duration and severity of water restriction and difference between the species in stonefruits plant water status has been well documented as a factor affecting the level of tree s yield intrigliolo and castel 2006 but in citrus trees there may not be interactive between the deficit irrigation and tree s yield pérez pérez et al 2008a so needing to examine different species in one season in the lane late navel citrus during four seasons water saving up to 19 was feasible without reducing the yield by applying a daily water stress of 70 mpa and rdi of 50 etc irrigation limitations from july to mid september ballester et al 2013 non irrigation of mango trees in south africa during the winter months development and expansion of flower buds increased production by up to 9 decreased water consumption by 20 and did not have a negative impact on fruit size mostert and hoffman 1996 application of water stress in four different 5 week periods after flowering up to fruit maturation of banana showed that water stress in the first and last 5 week after flowering had the lowest and highest yields respectively hegde and srinivas 1989 in khadravi date soil moisture in the zone of root development during ripening was about 25 of field capacity but no significant decrease was observed in leaf growth and no significant difference was observed between treatments in terms of yield and fruit quality furr et al 1952 3 2 bunch wilting and dropping wilt and drop percentage of fruits at six stages of fruit growth and development were measured in the kimri stage according to table 3 due to the significance of the location effect the analyzes were performed separately for each location there was no significant difference among levels in any of the stages this means that water restriction up to 70 etc did not cause disruption in fruit growth except from the kimri stage in the other stages the wilting percent was significant due to the irrigation intervals so according to table 5 up to the kimri stage and the beginning of the khalal stage the shortest irrigation interval p50 was effective in reducing dropping but after this stage the irrigation interval of p100 controlled the dropping also in total p100v70 treatment showed the highest control of the disorder the p150 treatments at both irrigation levels except the harvest stage caused the highest dropping of fruit while p50 treatment showed the highest wilt and drop at harvest it should be mentioned that the p150v100 treatment was partially close to the amount and interval of the traditional irrigation by the palm growers of the two locations deficit irrigation depending on the time of its application may increase the flower buds in the trees and during flowering and setting the fruit can affect the dropping of young flowers and fruits pérez pérez et al 2008b repeated irrigation in the 3 year period on palm trees of maktum cultivar caused more growth late ripening of fruit and larger fruit production while the amount of damage caused by the black tip and the fruit shrinkage was high sharples and hilgeman 1951 drought stress in persimmon during flowering caused increased fruit dropping and depending on the time of its application reduced the growth of leaves and flower buds increased intake of minerals especially potassium ben arie et al 2008 in persimmon there was no significant difference between the amount of natural dropping among the water stress levels in the advanced stages of fruit development this showed that difference in the number of fruit was probably due to the response to irrigation in the early stages of the reproductive cycle such as flower induction differentiation and fruitset kanety et al 2014 3 3 fruit physical properties according to table 6 the mean fruit weight in two locations was significant so that in l1 irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 compared to irrigation intervals of 150 at both levels of irrigation increased fruit weight but in l2 p50v100 and p150v70 treatments reduced mean weight of fruits table 7 also according to the results of tables 6 and 7 the fruit length was not affected by the location and the mean of the two locations indicated that irrigation intervals of 100 at both levels of irrigation significantly increased the fruit length but p50v100 and p150v70 treatments significantly decreased this parameter according to the mentioned tables the fruit firmness was not affected by the location but irrigation volume had a significant effect such that irrigation level of 70 in different irrigation intervals increased the firmness compared to the irrigation level of 100 however this increase was only significant at 50 irrigation intervals and p50v70 caused the highest fruit firmness while the p50v100 caused the lowest between all treatments deficit irrigation strategies lead to a change in carbon allocation patterns increased fruit growth versus vegetative growth and increased plant productivity the cellular expansion of the fruit is more affected by water stress than its cell division the expansion of the cell can occur only when the turgor pressure is greater than the cell wall resistance the stress threshold of water greatly blocks the cells and cell growth decreases due to the low turgor pressure shao et al 2008 in peach the amount of fruit dry matter increased with low irrigation stress which means that the water flow to the fruit is more limited than carbohydrates low leaf stomatal conductance reduced the peach fruit weight and size in the harvest without affecting the number of fruits per tree water stress increased the concentration of lignin and the firmness of the peach fruit the positive correlation between the firmness of peach fruit and the concentration of cell wall materials confirmed the results of the increase in the fruit firmness rahmati et al 2015 water stress in citrus during the flowering stage and fruit set threatened the yield with decreasing fruit diameter and water limitations during the last stage of fruit growth and maturation reduced the yield by reducing the fruit weight while water limits of 50 etc during the months of july and august allowed to reduce water use without any reduction of yield and fruit size in citrus garcía tejero et al 2010 four di seasons from july to mid september at lane late navel citrus reduced 9 of fruit weight although yields did not decrease and fruits at the end of the year reached 81 of their final size but the nulz clementine mandarin with a shorter growth time gained only about 71 of size so the threshold for irrigation reduction in navel oranges was higher which did not reduce the yield ballester et al 2013 also water limitation in citrus led to the decomposition of cell wall polymers and further decrease in the osmotic potential of the fruit and ultimately the fruit firmness garcía tejero et al 2010 deficit irrigation during early fruit growth over the years reduced the fruit size in leccino olive rapoport et al 2004 3 4 chemical properties according to tables 6 and 7 tss of fruit was affected by the location and it was higher in l2 compared l1 at all treatment combinations in l1 different treatments did not show significant effect on this parameter but in l2 irrigation interval of p150 at both levels of 70 and 100 and p100 at level of 70 showed the highest tss levels different treatments at two locations did not have a significant effect on the amount of fruit acid 0 29 0 27 data not shown in the case of soluble sugars the location had significant effect at 5 level on this parameter so that at l1 soluble sugars was lower than l2 the effect of irrigation intervals was also significant for this parameter and by increasing the irrigation intervals the soluble sugars also increased location did not have a significant effect on the total phenol content of the fruit table 6 therefore the mean of total phenol content in two locations were compared although only p150v100 was significantly different with other treatments but higher water volume v100 resulted to lower total phenols in all treatments table 7 the amount of fruit starch was effected by the location at harvest time the effect of treatments in two locations was largely similar so that the irrigation amount of 100 etc in different irrigation intervals significantly increased this fruit parameter among these treatments p150v70 showed the lowest starch content in fruit tables 6 and 7 the concentration of fruit s non structural compounds is directly affected by water stress the amount of material entering the fruit is affected by the osmotic regulation mild osmosis stress may lead to reduced plant growth and increased concentrations of secondary metabolites under water stress condition and decreased co2 absorption carbon should be allocated to the synthesis of the primary metabolites for the growth of the fruit however the increase and accumulation of polyphenols in response to rdi in peach grape and olive has been reported austin and wilcox 2011 buendía et al 2008 tovar et al 2002 it can be suggested that an active accumulation of sugars accompanied by the lower water potential and higher concentration of solutes would increase the tss of the fruit under lower water condition intrigliolo and castel 2010 the concentration of total carbohydrates and organic acids in peach at intensive water stress during harvest mainly increased by reducing the fruit dilution while the concentration of polyphenols was strongly reduced through metabolic effects rahmati et al 2015 in peach fruit growth reduced under water stress thus by decreasing the use of glucose and fructose in glycolysis their content increased however since water stress caused precocity there was no significant difference with control in glucose and fructose during harvest rahmati et al 2015 water deficit in the final stage of fruit growth in stonefruits reduces fruit yeild but leads to positive aspects of increasing tss and precocity of fruit besset et al 2001 deficit irrigation reduces the growth of peach fruit so the respiration of growth and maintenance should be lower reducing vegetative growth and peach tree load in di caused the product to be more exposed to light and therefor photo oxidation that decreased some of the antioxidant contents of fruits including vitamin c and carotenoids but the content of phenolic compounds mainly anthocyanin and procyanidin increased by ultraviolet radiation to counteract the oxidative damage of tissue buendía et al 2008 during water stress the main chemical components of date fruit including sugars fibers pectin tannins and vitamins were reduced ahmed et al 1995 the total dry matter content of khalas date increased significantly under water stress at once a week irrigation but tss pectin sucrose tannin and ph did not differ significantly between irrigation treatments al yahyai and al kharusi 2012 deficit irrigation of citrus trees on cleopatra rootstock caused reduction of water percentage but increased sugar accumulation and tss due to redistribution of plant photosynthesis towards fruit however intense water stress caused further increase in acids compared with sugars so the quality of the fruit reduced romero et al 2006 irrigation of olive plants with a 60 etc retained the amount of soluble sugars in the leaf similar to the full irrigation treatment but the starch content of the leaves decreased significantly this was explained to be primarily associated with osmotic regulation of tissue bacelar et al 2007 as explained by many researchers in plants after exposure to stress osmotic compounds such as soluble sugars amino acids such as proline aspartic acid and glutamic acid ammonium compounds and hydrophilic proteins accumulate and one of the main sources of these osmolites is starch reserves 3 5 antioxidant enzyme activities according to table 8 activity of different enzymes in leaf and fruit were the same in two locations the irrigation level of 70 etc in all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of pod enzyme in the fruit however in the leaves 100 etc in all three irrigation intervals increased the activity of this enzyme but this increase was significant only in irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 compared to the 150 treatment although it was higher at p100v70 treatment in both leaves and fruits table 9 sod activity was not significantly different in leaves and fruits of different treatments regarding the activity of ppo in fruit 100 irrigation of etc in irrigation intervals 50 and 150 significantly increased the enzyme activity the activity of this enzyme in leaf with irrigation rate of 70 etc was lower than 100 etc at all irrigation intervals also by increasing the irrigation intervals the ppo activity decreased the activity of cat enzyme in fruit significantly increased with 70 irrigation of etc at all irrigation intervals the activity of this enzyme in leaf increased at irrigation intervals of 50 and 150 with irrigation level of 70 but decreased at 100 level the irrigation treatment of p150v70 showed the highest cat activity between the treatments cells are equipped with enzymatic antioxidants to remove the ros and increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes in plant species is for adaptation to stress however severe stress may lead to damage to the antioxidant system of the cell and reduction of the activity of these enzymes leading to production of more active oxygen species effective degradation of ros requires coordinated action of several antioxidant enzymes to provide good results for stress tolerance water deficit in two cultivars of olive different for tolerance to water stress increased the activity of cat gr and apx but did not have a significant effect on sod activity in both cultivars and in the chemlali olive oxidative damage was less due to the higher activity of these enzymes guerfel et al 2009 in drought stress an increase in aba and apoplastic ph resulted in increased pod activity in tomato and therefore increase of cross linking of cell phenols due to increased enzymatic activity of fruit pericarp also affected the cell growth and ultimately decreased the diameter of the fruit mingo et al 2003 in three olive cultivars exposed to water stress for one year specific antioxidant defense was achieved including increased activity of sod apx and cat in contrast ppo activity was reduced and led to the maintenance of phenols at acceptable levels ahmed et al 2009 3 6 changes of mineral elements in leaves the location had no significant effect on the concentration of macro and micro elements measured in the leaves table 10 also different treatments did not have a significant effect on the concentration of leaf n p k mn and cu at the time of the disorder irrigation level of 70 etc in irrigation intervals of 50 and 100 significantly decreased the ca concentration of leaves table 11 for fe irrigation level of 70 etc only at irrigation interval of 150 significantly reduced the concentration of this element in the leaf also according to these tables irrigation interval of 150 in two levels of irrigation significantly reduced the zn concentration of leaves and in p100 interval the v70 had significantly lower zn than v100 there is a close relation between water availability and minerals absorption because the absorption of soluble minerals depends on the flow of water in the path of soil to the roots the relationship between minerals content and irrigation limitation requires accurate estimation benefits of di include reducing minerals leaching as well as reducing the saturation of minerals and biocides in the root zone excess superoxide in chloroplasts under severe water stress conditions can enhance the concentration of iron catalyzed oh formation and damage to the mechanism of iron absorption control in the roots price and hendry 1991 early season irrigation limitations in pear trees resulted in a decrease of calcium concentration and disruption of its storage in fruits marsal et al 2012 in deficit irrigation of grapes and olives as well as partial root zone drying irrigation of apples and tomatoes the concentration of leaf and fruit minerals including nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium and magnesium were not affected although their content in soil and commercially irrigated plants were better than di or prd methods nakajima et al 2004 in di of mango during three subsequent seasons only leaf minerals including phosphorus magnesium and manganese were affected zuazo et al 2011 4 conclusion fruit wilting and dropping is part of a highly organized development of a plant in response to stresses the sensitivity of date palms to stress concurrent with the maturity of tree increases due to firstly a relatively high growth rate and secondly the presence of fruits on adult trees there is also evidence that high yield may increase the sensitivity of the plant to possible stress in this research irrigation limitations were applied for the control of vegetative and reproductive growth as a strategy to reduce fruit drying and dropping due to stress under experimental condition of this research when the amount of irrigation decreased yield of date palms did not reduce significantly and stress was not harmful and the best result for the decrease in fruit wilting and dropping was achieved with 70 etc irrigation at 100 mm evaporation interval but this treatment caused significant water use efficiency only in the second orchard location irrigation amount in superior treatment p100v70 for control of the disorder was 1380 to 1480 mm per year which according to the results this amount of irrigation led to an increase of approximately 33 of the minimum yield and a reduction of 30 from the maximum wilting and drying of the fruits the question is whether the amount of water saving 85 to 102 mm in the treatment of maximum product can be further increased according to the non significant effects of applied di new research with a further reduction in the irrigation is required the water saving should be to the extent that the diminishing in the profit resulting from the reduction in yield is compensated by reducing production costs and reducing the dropping disorder
