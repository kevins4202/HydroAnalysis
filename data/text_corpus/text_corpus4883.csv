24415,fecal pellets are a significant component of total particulate organic carbon poc flux in the ocean and a key component of the biological pump the effect of copepod community structure feeding behavior and diel vertical migration dvm on fecal pellet carbon flux was investigated using an agent based model which was applied to two contrasting open ocean regions an oligotrophic hawaii ocean time series site aloha and a mesotrophic japanese time series site k2 system data from the vertical transport in the global ocean vertigo project was used to parameterize the model and modelled fecal pellet fluxes were compared to field derived neutrally buoyant sediment trap data to examine how community structure and dvm impact fecal pellet carbon flux in the water column the model produces copepod fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with sediment trap data from k2 and aloha and with other modeling studies the vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in a greater magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime distributions communities dominated by omnivores resulted in higher fecal pellet carbon flux and lower poc attenuation than those dominated by carnivores or detritivores incorporating dvm into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet fluxes the relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent based model that uses trait based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean keywords biological carbon pump zooplankton community structure fecal pellet flux trait based model individual based model 1 introduction the oceans act as a significant sink for anthropogenic carbon released into the atmosphere sabine et al 2004 sabine and tanhua 2010 since the start of the industrial era the world s oceans have taken up and stored 25 of total anthropogenic emissions which include both fossil fuel emissions and the effects of land use changes sabine and tanhua 2010 estimates show that of the 9 5 0 5 pg c yr 1 emitted through fossil fuel usage i e energy and cement production between 2009 and 2018 2 5 0 6 pg c yr 1 26 was taken up by the oceans friedlingstein et al 2019 the biological carbon pump bcp plays an important role in the ability of the oceans to take up atmospheric carbon and sequester it or store it long term in the deep ocean the bcp comprises the biologically mediated processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface waters to the deep ocean as particulate organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc ducklow et al 2001 volk and hoffert 1985 estimates of the carbon export flux leaving the surface global ocean range from 5 to 12 pg c yr 1 siegel et al 2016 a range that encompasses estimates of annual fossil fuel emissions the fraction of poc produced in and then exported from surface waters varies regionally for example different oceanic sites examined in buesseler and boyd 2009 showed net primary production npp i e gross production minus respiration ranging between 200 and 1400 mg c m 2 d 1 and those same sites had poc export at the base of the euphotic zone ranging from 20 to almost 500 mg c m 2 d 1 the corresponding ez ratios which is defined as the export flux at the euphotic zone divided by npp also vary between locations with low observations from subtropical and tropical pacific sites 0 02 at the equatorial pacific eqpac sites and 0 08 at aloha and higher values of 0 45 for the north atlantic bloom experiment nabe buesseler and boyd 2009 some of this variability is a result of differences in food web and community structure that can affect the dominant types of particles sinking through the water column legendre and rivkin 2002 passow 2002 turner 2015 the export of organic carbon in the ocean can be broadly divided into two components passive and active flux passive flux consists of sinking particles composed of phytoplankton cells zooplankton and fish fecal pellets aggregates of biological particles marine snow and other forms of biological detritus alldredge and silver 1988 steinberg and landry 2017 turner 2015 zooplankton fecal pellets are readily found in sediment traps and can contribute between 0 and 100 of the total poc flux depending on location season and depth turner 2015 wilson et al 2008 for example the fecal pellet proportion of poc flux at station k2 in the subpolar north pacific decreased with depth with 20 of the flux consisting of fecal pellets at 150 m and only 5 at 500 m whereas the fecal pellet proportion increased with depth at station aloha in the subtropical north pacific from 14 to 35 for 150 m and 500 m respectively wilson et al 2008 the fecal pellet poc flux measured in sediment traps at station k2 was 4 5 times higher than at station aloha and fecal pellets were 2 5 times larger at k2 than at aloha wilson et al 2008 this was thought to be due to differences in zooplankton community structure at the two sites with larger zooplankton size and total biomass at k2 resulting in increased transport efficiency and higher overall flux buesseler et al 2007 steinberg et al 2008a active flux is mediated by zooplankton and fishes that undergo diel vertical migration dvm generally thought of to be an adaptive behavior for predator avoidance hays 1994 but one that serves to move carbon vertically through the water column longhurst et al 1990 animals undergoing dvm feed in the epipelagic zone at night and migrate to the mesopelagic zone where they reside during the day and metabolize their food respiring co2 excreting dissolved organic carbon doc and egesting fecal pellets at depth hays 1994 hernández león and ikeda 2005 steinberg et al 2002 this active carbon flux by dvm is on average equivalent to 15 20 of the passive poc flux and can exceed passive poc flux during seasons or in regions of high migrating biomass longhurst et al 1990 saito et al 2005 steinberg et al 2000 zhang and dam 1997 organic carbon can be considered sequestered in the ocean if it reaches depths 1000 m and is removed from contact with atmosphere for more than 100 years primeau 2005 solomon et al 2007 however the sinking flux of poc exported from the surface ocean is rapidly attenuated before it reaches these depths honjo et al 2008 martin et al 1987 stukel et al 2019 due to a combination of abiotic and biotic processes physical processes such as fragmentation by turbulence alldredge et al 1990 stemmann et al 2004 and zooplankton swimming dilling and alldredge 2000 convert large rapidly settling particles into smaller more slowly settling ones thereby reducing poc export but not the total poc concentration biotic processes such as microbial degradation anderson and tang 2010 mayor et al 2014 ploug 2001 ploug and grossart 1999 and consumption by organisms calbet and saiz 2005 dagg 1993 jackson and checkley jr 2011 van der jagt et al 2020 reduce the amount of sinking poc and so reduce the flux the amount of poc reaching the deep ocean can also be affected by zooplankton feeding which can modify the sinking poc flux especially in the mesopelagic zone because zooplankton can ingest smaller particles and effectively repackage the carbon contained therein into dense faster sinking fecal pellets thereby altering the flux fowler and knauer 1986 lampitt 1992 zooplankton that undergo diel vertical migration effectively short circuit some of these physical and biotic processes that attenuate carbon by consuming carbon in the surface waters and excreting labile carbon deeper in the water column consequently the relative importance of the active flux increases with depth steinberg et al 2000 in regions of high vertically migrating biomass steinberg and landry 2017 or where zooplankton migrate to greater depths in addition the feeding ecology of zooplankton can change with depth with carnivory becoming more important deeper in the water column steinberg et al 2008a vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 for example the proportion of carnivorous zooplankton in the northwest subarctic pacific ocean increases from 25 of the mesozooplankton biomass between 200 m and 300 m to over 50 of the biomass between 500 m and 1000 m vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 at k2 specifically distinct peaks of carnivorous zooplankton have been found in the mesopelagic zone steinberg et al 2008a these zooplankton are likely feeding on either zooplankton resident at those depths or on vertically migrating zooplankton and provide an input of fecal pellets at depth though some of these new pellets may be consumed rapidly wilson et al 2008 models of the bcp and export flux typically combine organisms into functional groups and describe the flow of carbon between them using a system of coupled differential equations while considerable progress has been made using this approach it is not without problems for example the number of functional groups employed varies between models making model comparison harder and the role of grazers tends to be oversimplified dadou et al 2001 jackson and burd 2001 sailley et al 2013 most large scale models do not include an active flux driven by dvm but recent studies that do show that it increases predicted poc export fluxes out of the euphotic zone by 10 30 archibald et al 2019 bianchi et al 2013a putzeys and hernández león 2005 however these models did not resolve zooplankton community composition this is important because zooplankton community structure changes temporally and spatially and is affected by climate change richardson 2008 potentially resulting in changes to carbon export brun et al 2019 here we describe a model of copepod fecal pellet production and export flux that incorporates differences in both copepod community structure and behavior using an agent based model agent based models also known as individual based models explicitly represent individuals and their behavior rather than using differential equations to track the time evolution of the concentration of different functional groups this modeling approach has a long history of use in ecology volker and railsback 2005 and in modeling marine zooplankton including the effects of zooplankton dvm on predation by fish rinke and petzoldt 2008 and the nearshore retention of zooplankton in upwelling systems batchelder et al 2002 while these studies give insight into the role that dvm plays in trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics few studies examine the impact of dvm on biogeochemical processes wallace et al 2013 used an agent based model to show that in high latitude environments dvm by copepods enhanced fecal pellet production in deeper layers of the water column thereby increasing export to depth but their model did not consider the effect on fluxes of changes in zooplankton community composition our model builds on previous work by adding copepod community composition to examine how community composition and dvm affect the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the ocean 2 methods 2 1 description of sites we parameterize our model using data collected during the vertical transport in the global ocean vertigo project on a cruise to the north pacific subtropical gyre station aloha 27 75 n 158 w during 22 june 9 july 2004 and to the subpolar northwest pacific station k2 47 n 160 e during 22 july 11 august 2005 buesseler et al 2007 fig 1 these data sets were chosen as a basis for developing the model because they contained detailed information on zooplankton community structure and dvm i e depth discrete abundance of major taxa during the day and night steinberg et al 2008a and zooplankton fecal pellet fluxes measured using neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed at 150 m 300 m and 500 m wilson et al 2008 as well as the vertical export of poc e g boyd et al 2008 elskens et al 2008 trull et al 2008 the contrasting environments at the two locations also allowed us to develop the model for the different zooplankton communities k2 is a colder 10 c at the surface to 2 c at depths deeper than 150 m fig 1 fresher 32 8 33 6 psu in epipelagic waters mesotrophic system with a shallower summer mixed layer depth 25 m than station aloha which is a warmer 22 26 c at the surface to 10 c at 500 m fig 1 more saline 34 6 35 2 psu oligotrophic system with a deeper summer mixed layer depth 50 m station k2 zooplankton biomass was an order of magnitude higher than that at aloha steinberg et al 2008a leading to higher transport efficiencies buesseler et al 2008 data used in this study are available at the bco dmo data repository for the vertigo project https www bco dmo org project 2050 the model was built using python python software foundation version 3 6 2 2 model description the aim of our model was to investigate the effects of zooplankton specifically copepod community composition and behavior on the sinking flux of fecal pellets in the water column the model represented a 1 m2 column of water that extends from the surface to a depth of 1000 m the water column was subdivided into 9 depth bins 0 50 m 50 100 m 100 150 m 150 200 m 200 300 m 300 400 m 400 500 m 500 750 m and 750 1000 m corresponding to the depth intervals used during vertigo for zooplankton sampling at both aloha and k2 steinberg et al 2008a water column profiles of temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen at the two locations were obtained from data collected during vertigo fig 1 which are used for metabolic calculations described in the following sections 2 3 modeling zooplankton the zooplankton community at both sites were dominated by copepods which made up between 72 74 and 70 86 of the zooplankton abundance in the upper 1000 m for aloha and k2 respectively steinberg et al 2008a in addition the majority of identifiable fecal pellets caught in sediment traps were copepod fecal pellets wilson et al 2008 because of this and the lower availability of quantitative metabolic data for many other taxa we considered only copepods in our model with changes in community structure being reflected in different vertical distributions and feeding preferences agent based models are designed to represent individuals data from day and nighttime net tows show that within a water column of 1 m2 cross sectional area and extending from the surface to 1000 m there would be 46 000 80 000 individual copepods for k2 and 18 000 20 000 for aloha steinberg et al 2008a the range of values at a single site is due to differences between daytime and nighttime field observations and was used to provide lower and upper abundance limits for the model we represented copepods using the concept of a super individual si metz and de roos 1992 scheffer et al 1995 in order to reduce the computational cost of the model while retaining varied community compositions each si represented many real individuals fig s1a all having the same properties and allowed us to represent the large copepod abundances and varied community compositions using far fewer modeled individuals for example at station k2 we used 100 sis table 1 each representing 460 800 individual copepods with the same characteristics such as size swimming behavior metabolic rates etc we investigated the effect that the number of individuals represented by si had on the model results by running the model with 100 1000 and 10 000 individuals being represented by a single si a one way analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the fecal pellet production results not shown when using different numbers of individuals represented by the si f 2 21 1 86 p 0 17 we used three size classes of si in the model following saiz and calbet 2007 small copepods 10 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 0 95 mm medium copepods 10 200 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 0 95 2 4 mm and large copepods 200 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 2 4 mm each si represents individuals of a given size class and is given a pl selected at random from the range of pl corresponding to that size class thus individuals represented by a specific si all have the same pl but different sis representing say small copepods all have different values of the pl within the range specified for that size class the proportion of individuals within each size class was determined from the size based biomass data from steinberg et al 2008a and is shown in table 1 along with the ranges of total water column copepod abundance we used a trait based approach to model copepod processes where organism size served as the master trait because of its impact on fecal pellet flux stamieszkin et al 2015 and other processes litchman et al 2013 prosome length pl was used as a proxy for copepod size andersen et al 2016 with allometric relationships table 2 used to determine copepod properties e g dry weight and relevant rates e g respiration the prosome length was also used to calculate the size µm3 of a full gut and the size µm3 of the fecal pellets see table 2 the amount of carbon associated with the fecal pellets was calculated using a conversion factor of 0 08 mg c mm 3 of fecal pellet wilson et al 2008 see table 2 for equation and further description in the ingestion section three different copepod feeding preferences were considered for the sis as a way of examining the effect of community composition on fecal pellet flux omnivory carnivory and detritivory omnivores in the model fed on both phytoplankton and microzooplankton carnivores fed on microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton and detritivores fed on sinking and suspended detritus sis were randomly allocated a feeding preference so that all individuals within an si had the same feeding preference we used 4 distinct community compositions table 3 chosen in an ad hoc manner but designed to represent a reasonable range of open ocean communities community composition a had equal abundances of all three feeding preferences i e one third of the sis were omnivores one third were carnivores and one third were detritivores community composition b had 60 of sis as omnivores while carnivores and detritivores each made up 20 of the sis similarly community composition c had an abundance ratio of omnivores carnivores detritvores of 20 60 20 and community composition d had an abundance ratio of 20 20 60 the allocation of a feeding preference to a given si was done in conjunction with the size class to maintain these abundance ratios within each size class for example community a consisted of a third each of the small medium and large copepod sis represented as omnivores a third as carnivores and an additional third as detritivores these were assigned in order of created for example in community b 60 each of the small medium and large sis were assigned as omnivores the next 20 were assigned as carnivores and the last 20 were assigned as detritivores we modeled two distinct conditions to examine the effects of dvm on fecal pellet flux in the first a classic dvm scenario a portion of the zooplankton migrated to shallower depths at night retreating to depth during the day in the second zooplankton were not allowed to undertake dvm and remained at the same depth throughout the day and night we used a simplified version of dvm where migrating individuals remained at their daytime depth for 10 h 8am 6pm then migrated to their nighttime depth for 2 h 6pm 8pm remained at that depth for 10 h 8pm 6am and then migrated back to their daytime depth for 2 h 6am 8am this migration time of 2 h falls within the observed values from field acoustic data for vertically migrating zooplankton and micronekton bianchi and mislan 2016 in the dvm scenario the total number of migrating individuals was determined using the zooplankton night day abundance ratios for the upper 150 m from steinberg et al 2008a this resulted in 40 of the total individuals being randomly assigned as migrators at k2 and 25 at aloha the majority of the migrators were omnivores which are considered suspension feeders feeding on phytoplankton and microzooplankton although this number changed slightly if the proportion of omnivores to the total population was less than the number needed as migrators in this case additional individuals in the carnivore and detritivore categories were chosen at random and set as migrators so that when the model was initiated it matched the field data as closely as possible migration swimming speeds for each si were set randomly within the range 3 6 cm s 1 which falls within the range suggested for calanoid copepods hardy and bainbridge 1954 hirche 1987 svetlichny et al 2020 and for migrating zooplankton bianchi and mislan 2016 this means that in the model as in the natural environment swimming speeds were not a function of the size of a copepod copepod sis were distributed throughout the water column at the start of a model run in such a way as to match the distributions seen in vertigo data with the appropriate number of sis in each of the depth bins fig s1b we ran the model using different vertical distributions nighttime daytime and a mixture of the two see table 3 to examine the effects that vertical distribution had on fecal pellet flux once the water column was initialized with the depth distribution of zooplankton sis the model was run using a 1 min time step starting at midnight t 0 at each time step sis in the model are able to migrate only if they are classified as a migrating individual and only in the dvm scenario eat respire allocate carbon to growth excrete fill their gut digest and or egest fecal pellets fig s1c each of these processes are discussed in detail below the model was run for 100 model days allowing it to reach a pseudo steady state condition i e a repeating daily cycle which occurred after 17 days with data taken from the last 10 model days 2 4 ingestion ingestion depends on the food available for an individual at its given depth food concentrations in poc throughout the water column were set using literature data and are shown in fig 2 four food types were considered phytoplankton 5 µm to include sizes typically ingested by copepods hansen et al 1994 microzooplankton zooplankton 200 µm in size which are mostly protozoans small mesozooplankton which includes all mesozooplankton from 0 35 to 1 mm in size and sinking and suspended detritus the concentrations for these were obtained from vertigo data except for microzooplankton concentration at k2 which was obtained from an august and september 2005 subarctic north pacific station near k2 sohrin et al 2010 food profiles were converted from their original values into poc µg poc l 1 as needed phytoplankton food profiles in chl a from boyd et al 2008 were converted to poc using log poc 2 27 0 35log chl from legendre and michaud 1999 small mesozooplankton profiles from steinberg et al 2008a were converted from dry weight mg c m 3 to µg c l 1 using simple unit conversion sinking and suspended detrital poc profiles µm poc from bishop and wood 2008 were converted to µg c l 1 using the molar mass of carbon profiles of detrital poc inevitably include fecal pellets thus we risked double counting fecal pellet flux in the model to avoid this we subtracted the amount of fecal pellet carbon created in the water column in our model from the detrital poc profiles food availability for omnivore sis was calculated using the total concentration of phytoplankton and microzooplankton at the si s current depth likewise the available food for carnivore sis was determined using the total concentration of microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton at the depth of the si detritivores consumed sinking and suspended poc at a rate based on the total concentration of these food sources at the si depth ingestion rates were calculated using the depth associated food availability the dry weight dw of the individual calculated using an allometric relationship based on prosome length table 2 and relationships table 2 compiled from the literature for calanoid copepods saiz and calbet 2007 we created five levels of ingestion to follow a typical type ii functional response of copepod ingestion the lowest level represented a scenario where there was not enough food for ingestion food concentration 5 µg c l 1 the subsequent levels each represented incrementally increasing ranges of food availability each with its own corresponding ingestion rates the first two levels were imposed by this study and the upper three levels were taken from literature values see table 2 we used an assimilation efficiency to determine the amount of ingested carbon used for metabolic processes such as respiration and excretion with the remainder being allocated for fecal pellet production assimilation efficiencies were set to 0 7 0 9 and 0 4 for omnivores carnivores and detritivores respectively valiela 2015 table 2 food availability with depth relative to assimilation efficiency is shown in fig 3 2 5 respiration respiration was calculated from water temperature and individual dry weight using an empirical allometric equation from ikeda et al 2007 that uses copepod size depth in the water column temperature and salinity respiration rates obtained from this equation see table 2 were converted from µl o2 individual 1 h 1 to µl c individual 1 h 1 using the molecular weight for carbon the molar volume of a gas and a respiration quotient rq the ratio of oxygen used to carbon produced of 0 8 an appropriate value for zooplankton al mutairi and landry 2001 hayward 1980 mayzaud et al 2005 2 6 excretion growth excretion was calculated as a percentage 12 of the carbon ingested during a given time step saba et al 2011 carbon was allocated towards growth only when assimilated carbon from ingestion was large enough to support all metabolic processes respiration allocation to growth and excretion in which case the carbon allocated to growth was set to be 18 of ingestion saba et al 2011 our model does not consider zooplankton growth explicitly because we only have data from single cruises and not a time series which would allow for growth to occur consequently growth in the model is used as carbon storage allowing for some carbon to be stored for times when assimilated carbon is insufficient to cover base metabolism for example at depth where food availability is low and ingestion close to zero organisms still respired using carbon stored in the growth compartment which is then reduced accordingly this allows an individual to respire even when no ingestion is taking place 2 7 fecal pellet production ingested carbon remaining after assimilation went directly into the gut the gut size of an individual was related to its body size as previously described an individual in the model that did not have a full gut continued to eat until the gut was full organisms evacuated a full gut after a gut passage time gpt of 30 min which falls within the observed range for calanoid copepods besiktepe and dam 2002 tirelli and mayzaud 2005 at which time the carbon in the gut was egested fully in the form of a fecal pellet the gut was then set to empty or an amount leftover from overfilling the gut in one time step and the individual proceeded to fill its gut again two fecal pellets were assumed to be created in the gut at one time mauchline 1998 setting the amount of carbon of a full gut equal to the amount of carbon of two fecal pellets 2 8 fecal pellet flux once fecal pellets were egested in the model they were assigned to a new type of si distinct from the copepod sis that sinks through the water and was degraded or removed at each time step the fecal pellets produced by a copepod si represent the amount of fecal pellet carbon that would be produced by all the individual copepods represented by that si e g 1 si 800 individuals for k2 and were assigned sinking speeds of 30 50 and 80 m d 1 for small medium and large copepods respectively which are typical values for copepod fecal pellet sinking velocities ploug et al 2008b yoon et al 2001 degradation in our model or the fecal pellet removal rate encompasses several processes that result in the attenuation of fecal pellets including remineralization by coprophagy and microbial degradation we used a range of fecal pellet removal rates between 5 and 40 of fecal pellet carbon per day which falls within the wide range of literature values poulsen and iversen 2008 poulsen and kiørboe 2006 sampei et al 2004 fecal pellets were collected in model sediment traps located at 150 m 300 m and 500 m modeled fecal pellet fluxes from these model sediment traps were compared to literature values from wilson et al 2008 corresponding to the depths of sediment traps used in vertigo buesseler et al 2008 martin curves martin et al 1987 were fitted using a nonlinear least squares routine to the modeled fecal pellet flux data to determine the b parameter f z f z 0 z z 0 b where f z is the fecal pellet flux at depth z and b 0 indicates that flux is attenuated with depth 2 9 setting zooplankton abundance vertical distribution we used zooplankton net tow data taken at stations aloha and k2 as part of the vertigo program steinberg et al 2008a to create a series of copepod vertical distributions that captured a range of realistic depth distributions and that allowed for dvm to be incorporated the two locations had contrasting total zooplankton abundance different vertical distributions of zooplankton abundance and different zooplankton size distributions steinberg et al 2008a for example station k2 had a significantly higher total abundance with a greater proportion of medium and large sized copepods table 1 we set the vertical distribution of copepods using data from day night net tows taken at both sites ascribing changes in zooplankton abundances to dvm can be complicated by daytime net avoidance by some taxa and result in the total number of organisms integrated through the water column to differ between day and night e g ianson et al 2004 consequently we developed several different vertical distributions of copepods for the models table 3 these include 4 non dvm vertical distributions designated d1 d2 n1 and n2 for each location using a mixture of daytime and nighttime total abundances and vertical distributions for these cases copepods maintained their initially assigned depths and did not move vertically the dvm model runs for each location used only the nighttime total copepod abundance for that site and the model was initialized with the nighttime vertical abundance distribution individuals assigned as migrators performed vertical migration as described in the modeling zooplankton section the resulting zooplankton vertical distributions are shown in fig 4 we refer to the two broad classes of simulations as aloha simulations and k2 simulations because the zooplankton depth distributions used to initialize the simulations were based on data from those sites we did not attempt to make predictive simulations of fecal pellet fluxes at these two locations but rather used the derived zooplankton and food distributions as disparate examples of natural systems that can be used to explore the consequences of changes in community composition and zooplankton behavior maximum abundance of copepods in the aloha simulations are in the 0 50 m depth bin which contains approximately 5 103 organisms abundances decrease steadily with depth between the surface and 150 m fig 4 they are then approximately constant between 150 m and 300 m daytime vertical distributions d1 and n1 increase again in the 300 500 m depth bins whereas nighttime vertical distributions d2 and n2 decrease in these depths abundances in the 0 50 m depth bin for the k2 simulations vary from 15 40 103 organisms abundances decrease sharply and remain low between 50 and 200 m before increasing significantly in the 200 300 m depth bin abundances then decrease steadily below 300 m 2 10 model implementation simulation experiments the model was built and run in python python software foundation version 3 6 each model scenario summarized in table 3 was run a total of 6 times and the resulting mean and standard deviations of these repetitions are presented and used for comparison between model scenarios we used two metrics to examine the effect of community composition on fecal pellet flux the feeding preferences of individuals community compositions a b c and d and the vertical distributions of the copepods in the water column abundance modes d1 d2 n1 n2 and dvm first because we are interested in the flux in the mesopelagic zone we concentrated on the modeled fecal pellet flux at 150 300 and 500 m second we calculated the b parameter b value from the martin curve from the model data usually the b value is used as a measure of the average attenuation of flux with depth material produced in surface waters is consumed as it sinks to deeper waters however because we set the value of the fecal pellet removal rate the b value can be interpreted as a measure of where in the water column fecal pellets are produced for example material sinking from the surface to 500 m depth will be consumed during its passage resulting in a lower flux at 500 m fresh material produced at 250 m for example will not be degraded or removed as much by the time it reaches 500 m leading to a lower average attenuation of flux 3 model results the attenuation of fecal pellet flux with depth is determined in part by a free parameter the fecal pellet removal rate we determined values for this parameter by running all model scenarios see table 3 using a range of values for the fecal pellet removal rate our aim was not to determine values that explained the observed vertical attenuation of flux at both sites but rather to obtain values that allowed for a range of model fecal pellet fluxes that compared favorably with those observed in sediment traps at 150 300 and 500 m at the two sites the best agreement between modeled and observed fluxes was obtained with a fecal pellet removal rate of 20 per day for aloha simulations and 30 per day for k2 simulations a comparison of all tested degradation rates 5 40 with field data is available in supplementary material figure s2 for aloha a degradation rate of 20 produced modeled fecal pellet fluxes that fell within the ranges of the sediment trap data at all three depths for station k2 a 30 degradation rate produced modeled fluxes that fell within the range of most of the sediment trap data at that site but produced slightly smaller modeled fluxes than observed fluxes at 300 m in reality the degradation rates most likely vary with depth but this would be hard to examine without including a full ecosystem model that incorporated the degradation pathways in lieu of this we chose a simple constant value of the degradation rate these values produced model results that generally overlapped with the range of field data at all depths for the different model scenarios fig 5 modeled and observed fluxes were larger for k2 than aloha simulations fig 5 because of the greater abundance of copepods in the water column modeled fluxes varied within the range of observed fluxes for each of the three trap depths fig 5 these results gave us confidence that the model could be used to investigate the effects of community composition and behavior on the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the water column 3 1 fecal pellet flux with depth variability in the modeled fecal pellet fluxes follows broadly similar patterns for both the aloha and k2 simulations fig 5 in particular for a given community composition the relative differences between fluxes obtained using different copepod vertical distributions remain approximately the same at all three depths for example community b tends to have higher fluxes and community c tends to have lower fluxes fig 5 these patterns are set by the fecal pellet production rates in the upper 150 m and remain basically the same to 500 m this indicates that fecal pellet production at depths 150 m does not contribute significantly to fecal pellet fluxes for example simulations with the zooplankton vertical distribution n2 nighttime water column abundance and nighttime vertical distribution produce the largest fluxes for all communities for both the aloha and k2 simulations fig 5 this is a consequence of nighttime vertical distributions having more copepods in the upper 100 m of the water column which is where food abundance is highest and to a lesser extent that nighttime total abundances are larger than in daytime thus the model suggests that the magnitude of the flux is sensitive to where individuals reside in the water column not just the total water column abundance aloha simulations with communities c carnivore dominated and d detritivore dominated generally have less fecal pellet flux at all depths than those with communities a evenly mixed and b omnivore dominated fig 5 there is a similar though less pronounced difference for the k2 simulations this is because fecal pellet production rates in the top 150 m were lower for communities c and d fig 6 food available for fecal pellet production by carnivores and detritivores were the lowest at all depths in the aloha simulations fig 4 resulting in low fecal pellet production rates these differences were less pronounced for the k2 simulations largely because of the greater total abundance of zooplankton and smaller relative differences between the food available for omnivores and detritivores fig 4 incorporating dvm into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases for example fluxes with dvm at aloha are the smallest for communities c and d at all trap depths fig 5 the same is true for communities a and b at aloha when comparing it to the fluxes of abundance distributions n1 and n2 which have the same total copepod abundances in the entire water column as the dvm mode but slightly different vertical distributions the majority of migrators in this model are omnivores eating phytoplankton and microzooplankton and although surface nighttime abundances are high fig 4 they are only in this depth bin for 10 h a day in the dvm scenario this results in lower overall fecal pellet fluxes at 150 m production rates of fecal pellets below 150 m are approximately 10 of those at shallower depths fig 6 because of the decrease in food availability with increasing depths fig 4 fluxes with dvm at aloha for communities a and b tend to be slightly higher than the fluxes for d1 and d2 which is mostly due to the difference in overall abundance with d1 and d2 having lower zooplankton abundances than the dvm scenario at k2 fluxes with dvm were smaller than n1 and n2 for communities c and d at all trap depths this is not the same for communities a and b where the flux with the dvm scenario generally falls in between the flux values for n1 and n2 at all depths fig 5 this is a result of the relative contribution of fecal pellet production at depth for these model scenarios where the dvm scenario has lower fecal pellet production than n1 and n2 below 100 m fig 6 for communities a and b compared to communities c and d the relative importance of dvm is greater for the k2 simulations the greater amount of food available for fecal pellet production by omnivores in the upper 50 m leads to a greater flux out of the surface waters than in the aloha simulations fecal pellet production rates are low below 100 m in the k2 simulations but are greater when dvm is incorporated compared to dvm scenarios at aloha fig 6 this leads to a small but significant production of new fecal pellets at depth that results in an increase in the relative importance of dvm deeper in the water column at k2 the modeled flux at 500 m showed broadly similar patterns at both sites as community composition and vertical distribution of zooplankton varied at both sites community composition b omnivore dominated tended to produce the larger flux for each vertical zooplankton distribution fig 5 this is unsurprising since food availability for omnivores is almost always greater than that for both carnivores and detritivores at every depth with the exception for depth intervals between 200 and 500 m at k2 where the food availability for detritivores slightly surpasses that for omnivores see fig 4 simulations that use the nighttime vertical distribution of zooplankton d2 and n2 where there are more individuals in the surface waters than at depth tend to have the largest fecal pellet fluxes at all depths for all community compositions with n2 nighttime abundance simulations having slightly greater fluxes than d1 daytime abundance due to the higher total abundance for n2 fig 5 although the n1 abundance scenario has higher overall water column abundance than d2 the vertical distribution of the total abundance results in fewer individuals in the upper 150 m for n1 scenarios the generally greater fluxes in scenarios n1 and n2 are likely to be the result of greater overall zooplankton abundances especially in the surface waters where there is more available food for fecal pellet production if model results are normalized to total water column zooplankton abundance these differences disappear data not shown 3 2 attenuation coefficient b value the calculated b values were generally 2 fold higher at k2 than at aloha but there was no consistent pattern in b value with differences in community composition fig 7 the b values in the dvm scenario at aloha were within the range for the non dvm scenarios for communities a b and c indicating that dvm does not impact flux attenuation fig 7 at k2 b values in the dvm scenario fell between the b values for n1 and n2 for all community compositions fig 7 reflecting the intermediary nature of the dvm vertical abundance compared to n1 and n2 4 discussion the model results show that copepod vertical distribution feeding preference and migratory behavior all affect the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the water column many current biogeochemical models do not explicitly include zooplankton dvm and those that do e g archibald et al 2019 bianchi et al 2013b use a small number of functional groups e g small zooplankton and large zooplankton to represent the modeled zooplankton populations this does not capture the range of zooplankton dvm behavior and feeding strategies our model while focusing only on copepods explored this range of variation by incorporating feeding preferences omnivores carnivores and detritivores in addition to including a range of copepod sizes differences in vertical distribution of copepods and dvm behavior 4 1 dvm mediated fecal pellet flux the model presented here was not designed to be a predictive model but instead was used to explore the effects of copepod community composition on dvm mediated fecal pellet fluxes however the model yields fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with data from k2 and aloha wilson et al 2008 and that are consistent with other modeling studies for example bianchi et al 2013b calculated annual average dvm mediated fluxes for all zooplankton as opposed to copepods only at the base of the euphotic zone at k2 and aloha as 27 6 and 2 4 mg c m 2 d 1 respectively these are total dvm mediated fluxes i e fecal pellet plus respiration plus excreted dissolved organic carbon and are at shallower depths than our model where fecal pellet fluxes at 150 m range between 2 2 15 6 and 1 0 7 2 at k2 and aloha respectively 4 2 effects of dvm on flux attenuation the value of the b parameter in equation 1 varies spatially and temporally with values in the northeast pacific for total poc rather than just fecal pellet poc as in this study reported to vary between 0 32 and 0 97 martin et al 1987 a global assessment using thorium based particle export measurements and sediment trap data to estimate total poc flux yielded b values that ranged between 0 36 and 1 09 henson et al 2012 and a subsequent study using a global database of particle size spectrum measurements yielded a range of 0 42 1 75 guidi et al 2015 some of this variation comes from the variability in the interactions between sinking particles and zooplankton and bacteria in the mesopelagic zone buesseler and lampitt 2008 including production of sinking fecal pellets at depth the effects of this can be seen for example in the model runs for the k2 simulations using community d abundance distributions d1 n1 and dvm all have lower values of b i e less net attenuation of flux that result from the production of fecal pellets between 200 and 250 m depth fig 6 simulations with abundance distributions d2 and n2 have much lower fecal pellet production rates in this depth bin and a higher overall b value similarly the aloha simulation using community d with dvm has a higher fecal pellet production rate in the 150 200 m depth bin in both cases the co occurrence of zooplankton and available food resources at a given depth is key while calculations based on the martin curve can lead to a misunderstanding of the mechanisms controlling the biological carbon pump between different locations buesseler et al 2020 they are appropriate to use within the same location in this study i e to compare between community compositions within station aloha but not to compare between aloha and k2 a large range of model scenarios resulted in similar attenuation indicating that care must be exercises when interpreting b values derived from field data incorporating dvm into the model produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases compared to the non dvm scenarios while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet flux one explanation for this is that dvm is not necessarily the most effective ecological method to create high flux at depth it is merely a consequence of visual predation and serves primarily as a mechanism to avoid predation while maximizing food availability another method to increase fecal pellet fluxes is to simply have higher zooplankton abundance in the epipelagic which resulted in greater magnitude of fecal pellet production in fact this can be seen when comparing non dvm nighttime scenarios to dvm scenarios and daytime scenarios the vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in higher magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime this was simply because there were more individuals at shallower depths where food availability was higher the fecal pellet flux from dvm scenarios was generally higher than daytime scenarios but lower than nighttime scenarios the vertical distribution of zooplankton abundance in the dvm scenarios most closely matches field data as does the resulting fecal pellet flux compared to other model scenarios 4 3 model complexity considerations we used an agent based approach to represent more details of the copepod community composition in the model however this still oversimplifies zooplankton community composition for example we assume that the zooplankton community was composed entirely of copepods this is a reasonable assumption for k2 and aloha where copepods dominate the zooplankton communities in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones steinberg et al 2008a and where copepod fecal pellets represent the majority of identifiable pellets caught in sediment traps wilson et al 2008 however this would pose a problem for modeling environments where non copepod taxa constitute a large portion of the zooplankton especially if allometric data is lacking for these taxa zooplankton fecal pellets differ in size shape density and hence sinking velocity depending on taxon thus representing the zooplankton community as a single taxon producing fecal pellets with one set of characteristics will affect the fecal pellet flux for example copepods produce small ellipsoidal or ovoid pellets with sinking rates between 26 and 300 m d 1 ploug et al 2008a yoon et al 2001 whereas salps produce larger more rectangular pellets with sinking speeds several hundred to 1000 m d 1 iversen et al 2017 phillips et al 2009 yoon et al 2001 it is thus important for future extensions of the model to include additional zooplankton taxa however while there is a large literature on copepod size metabolism and diet preferences e g benedetti et al 2016 brun et al 2017 corresponding information and allometric relationships for other zooplankton taxa are more limited making model formulation problematic we used a one dimensional model for the water column which we assumed to be static with no vertical mixing or advection into or out of the model one dimensional models are frequently used to examine the behavior of the biological pump e g dadou et al 2001 and although an idealization it was reasonable in this case where we are exploring the effects of changes in copepod community composition on fecal pellet flux although we used field data from k2 and aloha to develop and parameterize this model it is difficult to perform direct comparisons between observations and predictive model results of dvm mediated flux one reason for this is the uncertainty in the data day night zooplankton net tows that are used to quantify dvm tend to yield different total daytime and nighttime zooplankton abundances integrated for the total water column steinberg et al 2008a there can be several reasons for this biophysical interactions can lead to patchiness in zooplankton spatial distributions on a wide range of scales e g prairie et al 2012 also organisms deeper in the water column may be advected away from the sampling track between sampling intervals and so are not counted in the later tow or bathypelagic species may migrate into the mesopelagic zone net avoidance where organisms sense the approaching net and avoid it may also be factor ianson et al 2004 such uncertainties need to be accounted for when comparing models with data we ran the model to a pseudo steady state where the daily cycle was repeated this is because the available data represented a single snapshot of the zooplankton community and fecal pellet flux zooplankton that were consumed by carnivores were re inserted into the model in order to preserve the zooplankton abundances as a result the model did not take into account detailed predator prey dynamics between different zooplankton species such dynamics can lead to decoupling of changes in flux deep in the water column from changes occurring in surface waters jackson and burd 2001 extending the model to run on seasonal or annual timescales will require considering these effects as well as the effects of ontogenetic or life cycle vertical migration on vertical flux which at k2 is equivalent to 9 of the passive poc flux at 1000 m kobari et al 2008 one of the methods we used to change community structure in the model was to vary the proportions of zooplankton using different feeding modes omnivory detritivory and carnivory to simplify the model we held the proportion of copepods in these feeding modes constant with depth however the feeding ecology of zooplankton changes with depth with carnivory becoming more important deeper in the water column steinberg et al 2008b vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 wilson et al 2008 keeping the proportion of copepods of a given feeding mode constant with depth is likely to have a small impact on the model results because modeled fecal pellet production rates are relatively low below 150 m usually 10 of those at 150 m this may change if other zooplankton taxa are included in the model for example chaetognaths made up the third most abundant mesozooplankton taxon at k2 and aloha overall with maximum abundances of 11 2 m 3 and 34 1 m 3 respectively compared to calanoid copepods with maximum abundances of 80 m 3 at aloha and 800 m 3 at k2 steinberg et al 2008a including other such taxa would require modeling additional feeding strategies such as flux feeding jackson 1993 raptorial feeding and ambush feeding kiørboe 2008 where functional relationships between predator and prey are less established a notable limitation to this model is its focus on zooplankton fecal pellet carbon flux and the exclusion of other forms of poc flux given the driving question of this study to investigate the role of zooplankton community structure and behavior on fecal pellet carbon flux this limitation is appropriate however it is important to note that this model would not be able to relate the zooplankton fecal pellet carbon flux to total poc flux in the environment combining this model with more general poc flux models that use a similar modeling framework e g see jokulsdottir and archer 2016 would however allow a comparison of fecal pellet fluxes to total poc flux under varying conditions the model presented in this paper is capable of tracking other types of zooplankton flux from excretion and respiration and could therefore be used to investigate the relative contribution of fecal pellet flux versus other types of metabolic flux 5 conclusion the relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent based model that uses trait based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean the model shows that zooplankton community composition feeding preference and behavior i e dvm affect fecal pellet carbon flux in the mesopelagic for example the model indicates that zooplankton communities dominated by omnivores tend to have the largest throughout the water column this could be a potential problem for global biogeochemical models which typically represent only 1 type of zooplankton and those that do include more zooplankton categories typically use a size based rather than feeding preference categorization bopp et al 2013 because our model in its current version is a static model we cannot include the effects of seasonality or longer term zooplankton behavior such as ontogenetic vertical migration which undoubtedly effect both zooplankton community structure and fecal pellet flux future iterations of the model will incorporate these aspects the challenges in expanding this model are in finding or developing trait based physiological relationships for other ecologically and biogeochemically important taxa and the availability of extensive datasets that include the necessary ecological and sediment trap data credit authorship contribution statement c e countryman conceptualization formal analysis validation methodology writing original draft writing

24415,fecal pellets are a significant component of total particulate organic carbon poc flux in the ocean and a key component of the biological pump the effect of copepod community structure feeding behavior and diel vertical migration dvm on fecal pellet carbon flux was investigated using an agent based model which was applied to two contrasting open ocean regions an oligotrophic hawaii ocean time series site aloha and a mesotrophic japanese time series site k2 system data from the vertical transport in the global ocean vertigo project was used to parameterize the model and modelled fecal pellet fluxes were compared to field derived neutrally buoyant sediment trap data to examine how community structure and dvm impact fecal pellet carbon flux in the water column the model produces copepod fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with sediment trap data from k2 and aloha and with other modeling studies the vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in a greater magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime distributions communities dominated by omnivores resulted in higher fecal pellet carbon flux and lower poc attenuation than those dominated by carnivores or detritivores incorporating dvm into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet fluxes the relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent based model that uses trait based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean keywords biological carbon pump zooplankton community structure fecal pellet flux trait based model individual based model 1 introduction the oceans act as a significant sink for anthropogenic carbon released into the atmosphere sabine et al 2004 sabine and tanhua 2010 since the start of the industrial era the world s oceans have taken up and stored 25 of total anthropogenic emissions which include both fossil fuel emissions and the effects of land use changes sabine and tanhua 2010 estimates show that of the 9 5 0 5 pg c yr 1 emitted through fossil fuel usage i e energy and cement production between 2009 and 2018 2 5 0 6 pg c yr 1 26 was taken up by the oceans friedlingstein et al 2019 the biological carbon pump bcp plays an important role in the ability of the oceans to take up atmospheric carbon and sequester it or store it long term in the deep ocean the bcp comprises the biologically mediated processes that transfer organic carbon from the surface waters to the deep ocean as particulate organic carbon poc and dissolved organic carbon doc ducklow et al 2001 volk and hoffert 1985 estimates of the carbon export flux leaving the surface global ocean range from 5 to 12 pg c yr 1 siegel et al 2016 a range that encompasses estimates of annual fossil fuel emissions the fraction of poc produced in and then exported from surface waters varies regionally for example different oceanic sites examined in buesseler and boyd 2009 showed net primary production npp i e gross production minus respiration ranging between 200 and 1400 mg c m 2 d 1 and those same sites had poc export at the base of the euphotic zone ranging from 20 to almost 500 mg c m 2 d 1 the corresponding ez ratios which is defined as the export flux at the euphotic zone divided by npp also vary between locations with low observations from subtropical and tropical pacific sites 0 02 at the equatorial pacific eqpac sites and 0 08 at aloha and higher values of 0 45 for the north atlantic bloom experiment nabe buesseler and boyd 2009 some of this variability is a result of differences in food web and community structure that can affect the dominant types of particles sinking through the water column legendre and rivkin 2002 passow 2002 turner 2015 the export of organic carbon in the ocean can be broadly divided into two components passive and active flux passive flux consists of sinking particles composed of phytoplankton cells zooplankton and fish fecal pellets aggregates of biological particles marine snow and other forms of biological detritus alldredge and silver 1988 steinberg and landry 2017 turner 2015 zooplankton fecal pellets are readily found in sediment traps and can contribute between 0 and 100 of the total poc flux depending on location season and depth turner 2015 wilson et al 2008 for example the fecal pellet proportion of poc flux at station k2 in the subpolar north pacific decreased with depth with 20 of the flux consisting of fecal pellets at 150 m and only 5 at 500 m whereas the fecal pellet proportion increased with depth at station aloha in the subtropical north pacific from 14 to 35 for 150 m and 500 m respectively wilson et al 2008 the fecal pellet poc flux measured in sediment traps at station k2 was 4 5 times higher than at station aloha and fecal pellets were 2 5 times larger at k2 than at aloha wilson et al 2008 this was thought to be due to differences in zooplankton community structure at the two sites with larger zooplankton size and total biomass at k2 resulting in increased transport efficiency and higher overall flux buesseler et al 2007 steinberg et al 2008a active flux is mediated by zooplankton and fishes that undergo diel vertical migration dvm generally thought of to be an adaptive behavior for predator avoidance hays 1994 but one that serves to move carbon vertically through the water column longhurst et al 1990 animals undergoing dvm feed in the epipelagic zone at night and migrate to the mesopelagic zone where they reside during the day and metabolize their food respiring co2 excreting dissolved organic carbon doc and egesting fecal pellets at depth hays 1994 hernández león and ikeda 2005 steinberg et al 2002 this active carbon flux by dvm is on average equivalent to 15 20 of the passive poc flux and can exceed passive poc flux during seasons or in regions of high migrating biomass longhurst et al 1990 saito et al 2005 steinberg et al 2000 zhang and dam 1997 organic carbon can be considered sequestered in the ocean if it reaches depths 1000 m and is removed from contact with atmosphere for more than 100 years primeau 2005 solomon et al 2007 however the sinking flux of poc exported from the surface ocean is rapidly attenuated before it reaches these depths honjo et al 2008 martin et al 1987 stukel et al 2019 due to a combination of abiotic and biotic processes physical processes such as fragmentation by turbulence alldredge et al 1990 stemmann et al 2004 and zooplankton swimming dilling and alldredge 2000 convert large rapidly settling particles into smaller more slowly settling ones thereby reducing poc export but not the total poc concentration biotic processes such as microbial degradation anderson and tang 2010 mayor et al 2014 ploug 2001 ploug and grossart 1999 and consumption by organisms calbet and saiz 2005 dagg 1993 jackson and checkley jr 2011 van der jagt et al 2020 reduce the amount of sinking poc and so reduce the flux the amount of poc reaching the deep ocean can also be affected by zooplankton feeding which can modify the sinking poc flux especially in the mesopelagic zone because zooplankton can ingest smaller particles and effectively repackage the carbon contained therein into dense faster sinking fecal pellets thereby altering the flux fowler and knauer 1986 lampitt 1992 zooplankton that undergo diel vertical migration effectively short circuit some of these physical and biotic processes that attenuate carbon by consuming carbon in the surface waters and excreting labile carbon deeper in the water column consequently the relative importance of the active flux increases with depth steinberg et al 2000 in regions of high vertically migrating biomass steinberg and landry 2017 or where zooplankton migrate to greater depths in addition the feeding ecology of zooplankton can change with depth with carnivory becoming more important deeper in the water column steinberg et al 2008a vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 for example the proportion of carnivorous zooplankton in the northwest subarctic pacific ocean increases from 25 of the mesozooplankton biomass between 200 m and 300 m to over 50 of the biomass between 500 m and 1000 m vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 at k2 specifically distinct peaks of carnivorous zooplankton have been found in the mesopelagic zone steinberg et al 2008a these zooplankton are likely feeding on either zooplankton resident at those depths or on vertically migrating zooplankton and provide an input of fecal pellets at depth though some of these new pellets may be consumed rapidly wilson et al 2008 models of the bcp and export flux typically combine organisms into functional groups and describe the flow of carbon between them using a system of coupled differential equations while considerable progress has been made using this approach it is not without problems for example the number of functional groups employed varies between models making model comparison harder and the role of grazers tends to be oversimplified dadou et al 2001 jackson and burd 2001 sailley et al 2013 most large scale models do not include an active flux driven by dvm but recent studies that do show that it increases predicted poc export fluxes out of the euphotic zone by 10 30 archibald et al 2019 bianchi et al 2013a putzeys and hernández león 2005 however these models did not resolve zooplankton community composition this is important because zooplankton community structure changes temporally and spatially and is affected by climate change richardson 2008 potentially resulting in changes to carbon export brun et al 2019 here we describe a model of copepod fecal pellet production and export flux that incorporates differences in both copepod community structure and behavior using an agent based model agent based models also known as individual based models explicitly represent individuals and their behavior rather than using differential equations to track the time evolution of the concentration of different functional groups this modeling approach has a long history of use in ecology volker and railsback 2005 and in modeling marine zooplankton including the effects of zooplankton dvm on predation by fish rinke and petzoldt 2008 and the nearshore retention of zooplankton in upwelling systems batchelder et al 2002 while these studies give insight into the role that dvm plays in trophic interactions and ecosystem dynamics few studies examine the impact of dvm on biogeochemical processes wallace et al 2013 used an agent based model to show that in high latitude environments dvm by copepods enhanced fecal pellet production in deeper layers of the water column thereby increasing export to depth but their model did not consider the effect on fluxes of changes in zooplankton community composition our model builds on previous work by adding copepod community composition to examine how community composition and dvm affect the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the ocean 2 methods 2 1 description of sites we parameterize our model using data collected during the vertical transport in the global ocean vertigo project on a cruise to the north pacific subtropical gyre station aloha 27 75 n 158 w during 22 june 9 july 2004 and to the subpolar northwest pacific station k2 47 n 160 e during 22 july 11 august 2005 buesseler et al 2007 fig 1 these data sets were chosen as a basis for developing the model because they contained detailed information on zooplankton community structure and dvm i e depth discrete abundance of major taxa during the day and night steinberg et al 2008a and zooplankton fecal pellet fluxes measured using neutrally buoyant sediment traps deployed at 150 m 300 m and 500 m wilson et al 2008 as well as the vertical export of poc e g boyd et al 2008 elskens et al 2008 trull et al 2008 the contrasting environments at the two locations also allowed us to develop the model for the different zooplankton communities k2 is a colder 10 c at the surface to 2 c at depths deeper than 150 m fig 1 fresher 32 8 33 6 psu in epipelagic waters mesotrophic system with a shallower summer mixed layer depth 25 m than station aloha which is a warmer 22 26 c at the surface to 10 c at 500 m fig 1 more saline 34 6 35 2 psu oligotrophic system with a deeper summer mixed layer depth 50 m station k2 zooplankton biomass was an order of magnitude higher than that at aloha steinberg et al 2008a leading to higher transport efficiencies buesseler et al 2008 data used in this study are available at the bco dmo data repository for the vertigo project https www bco dmo org project 2050 the model was built using python python software foundation version 3 6 2 2 model description the aim of our model was to investigate the effects of zooplankton specifically copepod community composition and behavior on the sinking flux of fecal pellets in the water column the model represented a 1 m2 column of water that extends from the surface to a depth of 1000 m the water column was subdivided into 9 depth bins 0 50 m 50 100 m 100 150 m 150 200 m 200 300 m 300 400 m 400 500 m 500 750 m and 750 1000 m corresponding to the depth intervals used during vertigo for zooplankton sampling at both aloha and k2 steinberg et al 2008a water column profiles of temperature salinity and dissolved oxygen at the two locations were obtained from data collected during vertigo fig 1 which are used for metabolic calculations described in the following sections 2 3 modeling zooplankton the zooplankton community at both sites were dominated by copepods which made up between 72 74 and 70 86 of the zooplankton abundance in the upper 1000 m for aloha and k2 respectively steinberg et al 2008a in addition the majority of identifiable fecal pellets caught in sediment traps were copepod fecal pellets wilson et al 2008 because of this and the lower availability of quantitative metabolic data for many other taxa we considered only copepods in our model with changes in community structure being reflected in different vertical distributions and feeding preferences agent based models are designed to represent individuals data from day and nighttime net tows show that within a water column of 1 m2 cross sectional area and extending from the surface to 1000 m there would be 46 000 80 000 individual copepods for k2 and 18 000 20 000 for aloha steinberg et al 2008a the range of values at a single site is due to differences between daytime and nighttime field observations and was used to provide lower and upper abundance limits for the model we represented copepods using the concept of a super individual si metz and de roos 1992 scheffer et al 1995 in order to reduce the computational cost of the model while retaining varied community compositions each si represented many real individuals fig s1a all having the same properties and allowed us to represent the large copepod abundances and varied community compositions using far fewer modeled individuals for example at station k2 we used 100 sis table 1 each representing 460 800 individual copepods with the same characteristics such as size swimming behavior metabolic rates etc we investigated the effect that the number of individuals represented by si had on the model results by running the model with 100 1000 and 10 000 individuals being represented by a single si a one way analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the fecal pellet production results not shown when using different numbers of individuals represented by the si f 2 21 1 86 p 0 17 we used three size classes of si in the model following saiz and calbet 2007 small copepods 10 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 0 95 mm medium copepods 10 200 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 0 95 2 4 mm and large copepods 200 µg c ind 1 prosome lengths 2 4 mm each si represents individuals of a given size class and is given a pl selected at random from the range of pl corresponding to that size class thus individuals represented by a specific si all have the same pl but different sis representing say small copepods all have different values of the pl within the range specified for that size class the proportion of individuals within each size class was determined from the size based biomass data from steinberg et al 2008a and is shown in table 1 along with the ranges of total water column copepod abundance we used a trait based approach to model copepod processes where organism size served as the master trait because of its impact on fecal pellet flux stamieszkin et al 2015 and other processes litchman et al 2013 prosome length pl was used as a proxy for copepod size andersen et al 2016 with allometric relationships table 2 used to determine copepod properties e g dry weight and relevant rates e g respiration the prosome length was also used to calculate the size µm3 of a full gut and the size µm3 of the fecal pellets see table 2 the amount of carbon associated with the fecal pellets was calculated using a conversion factor of 0 08 mg c mm 3 of fecal pellet wilson et al 2008 see table 2 for equation and further description in the ingestion section three different copepod feeding preferences were considered for the sis as a way of examining the effect of community composition on fecal pellet flux omnivory carnivory and detritivory omnivores in the model fed on both phytoplankton and microzooplankton carnivores fed on microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton and detritivores fed on sinking and suspended detritus sis were randomly allocated a feeding preference so that all individuals within an si had the same feeding preference we used 4 distinct community compositions table 3 chosen in an ad hoc manner but designed to represent a reasonable range of open ocean communities community composition a had equal abundances of all three feeding preferences i e one third of the sis were omnivores one third were carnivores and one third were detritivores community composition b had 60 of sis as omnivores while carnivores and detritivores each made up 20 of the sis similarly community composition c had an abundance ratio of omnivores carnivores detritvores of 20 60 20 and community composition d had an abundance ratio of 20 20 60 the allocation of a feeding preference to a given si was done in conjunction with the size class to maintain these abundance ratios within each size class for example community a consisted of a third each of the small medium and large copepod sis represented as omnivores a third as carnivores and an additional third as detritivores these were assigned in order of created for example in community b 60 each of the small medium and large sis were assigned as omnivores the next 20 were assigned as carnivores and the last 20 were assigned as detritivores we modeled two distinct conditions to examine the effects of dvm on fecal pellet flux in the first a classic dvm scenario a portion of the zooplankton migrated to shallower depths at night retreating to depth during the day in the second zooplankton were not allowed to undertake dvm and remained at the same depth throughout the day and night we used a simplified version of dvm where migrating individuals remained at their daytime depth for 10 h 8am 6pm then migrated to their nighttime depth for 2 h 6pm 8pm remained at that depth for 10 h 8pm 6am and then migrated back to their daytime depth for 2 h 6am 8am this migration time of 2 h falls within the observed values from field acoustic data for vertically migrating zooplankton and micronekton bianchi and mislan 2016 in the dvm scenario the total number of migrating individuals was determined using the zooplankton night day abundance ratios for the upper 150 m from steinberg et al 2008a this resulted in 40 of the total individuals being randomly assigned as migrators at k2 and 25 at aloha the majority of the migrators were omnivores which are considered suspension feeders feeding on phytoplankton and microzooplankton although this number changed slightly if the proportion of omnivores to the total population was less than the number needed as migrators in this case additional individuals in the carnivore and detritivore categories were chosen at random and set as migrators so that when the model was initiated it matched the field data as closely as possible migration swimming speeds for each si were set randomly within the range 3 6 cm s 1 which falls within the range suggested for calanoid copepods hardy and bainbridge 1954 hirche 1987 svetlichny et al 2020 and for migrating zooplankton bianchi and mislan 2016 this means that in the model as in the natural environment swimming speeds were not a function of the size of a copepod copepod sis were distributed throughout the water column at the start of a model run in such a way as to match the distributions seen in vertigo data with the appropriate number of sis in each of the depth bins fig s1b we ran the model using different vertical distributions nighttime daytime and a mixture of the two see table 3 to examine the effects that vertical distribution had on fecal pellet flux once the water column was initialized with the depth distribution of zooplankton sis the model was run using a 1 min time step starting at midnight t 0 at each time step sis in the model are able to migrate only if they are classified as a migrating individual and only in the dvm scenario eat respire allocate carbon to growth excrete fill their gut digest and or egest fecal pellets fig s1c each of these processes are discussed in detail below the model was run for 100 model days allowing it to reach a pseudo steady state condition i e a repeating daily cycle which occurred after 17 days with data taken from the last 10 model days 2 4 ingestion ingestion depends on the food available for an individual at its given depth food concentrations in poc throughout the water column were set using literature data and are shown in fig 2 four food types were considered phytoplankton 5 µm to include sizes typically ingested by copepods hansen et al 1994 microzooplankton zooplankton 200 µm in size which are mostly protozoans small mesozooplankton which includes all mesozooplankton from 0 35 to 1 mm in size and sinking and suspended detritus the concentrations for these were obtained from vertigo data except for microzooplankton concentration at k2 which was obtained from an august and september 2005 subarctic north pacific station near k2 sohrin et al 2010 food profiles were converted from their original values into poc µg poc l 1 as needed phytoplankton food profiles in chl a from boyd et al 2008 were converted to poc using log poc 2 27 0 35log chl from legendre and michaud 1999 small mesozooplankton profiles from steinberg et al 2008a were converted from dry weight mg c m 3 to µg c l 1 using simple unit conversion sinking and suspended detrital poc profiles µm poc from bishop and wood 2008 were converted to µg c l 1 using the molar mass of carbon profiles of detrital poc inevitably include fecal pellets thus we risked double counting fecal pellet flux in the model to avoid this we subtracted the amount of fecal pellet carbon created in the water column in our model from the detrital poc profiles food availability for omnivore sis was calculated using the total concentration of phytoplankton and microzooplankton at the si s current depth likewise the available food for carnivore sis was determined using the total concentration of microzooplankton and small mesozooplankton at the depth of the si detritivores consumed sinking and suspended poc at a rate based on the total concentration of these food sources at the si depth ingestion rates were calculated using the depth associated food availability the dry weight dw of the individual calculated using an allometric relationship based on prosome length table 2 and relationships table 2 compiled from the literature for calanoid copepods saiz and calbet 2007 we created five levels of ingestion to follow a typical type ii functional response of copepod ingestion the lowest level represented a scenario where there was not enough food for ingestion food concentration 5 µg c l 1 the subsequent levels each represented incrementally increasing ranges of food availability each with its own corresponding ingestion rates the first two levels were imposed by this study and the upper three levels were taken from literature values see table 2 we used an assimilation efficiency to determine the amount of ingested carbon used for metabolic processes such as respiration and excretion with the remainder being allocated for fecal pellet production assimilation efficiencies were set to 0 7 0 9 and 0 4 for omnivores carnivores and detritivores respectively valiela 2015 table 2 food availability with depth relative to assimilation efficiency is shown in fig 3 2 5 respiration respiration was calculated from water temperature and individual dry weight using an empirical allometric equation from ikeda et al 2007 that uses copepod size depth in the water column temperature and salinity respiration rates obtained from this equation see table 2 were converted from µl o2 individual 1 h 1 to µl c individual 1 h 1 using the molecular weight for carbon the molar volume of a gas and a respiration quotient rq the ratio of oxygen used to carbon produced of 0 8 an appropriate value for zooplankton al mutairi and landry 2001 hayward 1980 mayzaud et al 2005 2 6 excretion growth excretion was calculated as a percentage 12 of the carbon ingested during a given time step saba et al 2011 carbon was allocated towards growth only when assimilated carbon from ingestion was large enough to support all metabolic processes respiration allocation to growth and excretion in which case the carbon allocated to growth was set to be 18 of ingestion saba et al 2011 our model does not consider zooplankton growth explicitly because we only have data from single cruises and not a time series which would allow for growth to occur consequently growth in the model is used as carbon storage allowing for some carbon to be stored for times when assimilated carbon is insufficient to cover base metabolism for example at depth where food availability is low and ingestion close to zero organisms still respired using carbon stored in the growth compartment which is then reduced accordingly this allows an individual to respire even when no ingestion is taking place 2 7 fecal pellet production ingested carbon remaining after assimilation went directly into the gut the gut size of an individual was related to its body size as previously described an individual in the model that did not have a full gut continued to eat until the gut was full organisms evacuated a full gut after a gut passage time gpt of 30 min which falls within the observed range for calanoid copepods besiktepe and dam 2002 tirelli and mayzaud 2005 at which time the carbon in the gut was egested fully in the form of a fecal pellet the gut was then set to empty or an amount leftover from overfilling the gut in one time step and the individual proceeded to fill its gut again two fecal pellets were assumed to be created in the gut at one time mauchline 1998 setting the amount of carbon of a full gut equal to the amount of carbon of two fecal pellets 2 8 fecal pellet flux once fecal pellets were egested in the model they were assigned to a new type of si distinct from the copepod sis that sinks through the water and was degraded or removed at each time step the fecal pellets produced by a copepod si represent the amount of fecal pellet carbon that would be produced by all the individual copepods represented by that si e g 1 si 800 individuals for k2 and were assigned sinking speeds of 30 50 and 80 m d 1 for small medium and large copepods respectively which are typical values for copepod fecal pellet sinking velocities ploug et al 2008b yoon et al 2001 degradation in our model or the fecal pellet removal rate encompasses several processes that result in the attenuation of fecal pellets including remineralization by coprophagy and microbial degradation we used a range of fecal pellet removal rates between 5 and 40 of fecal pellet carbon per day which falls within the wide range of literature values poulsen and iversen 2008 poulsen and kiørboe 2006 sampei et al 2004 fecal pellets were collected in model sediment traps located at 150 m 300 m and 500 m modeled fecal pellet fluxes from these model sediment traps were compared to literature values from wilson et al 2008 corresponding to the depths of sediment traps used in vertigo buesseler et al 2008 martin curves martin et al 1987 were fitted using a nonlinear least squares routine to the modeled fecal pellet flux data to determine the b parameter f z f z 0 z z 0 b where f z is the fecal pellet flux at depth z and b 0 indicates that flux is attenuated with depth 2 9 setting zooplankton abundance vertical distribution we used zooplankton net tow data taken at stations aloha and k2 as part of the vertigo program steinberg et al 2008a to create a series of copepod vertical distributions that captured a range of realistic depth distributions and that allowed for dvm to be incorporated the two locations had contrasting total zooplankton abundance different vertical distributions of zooplankton abundance and different zooplankton size distributions steinberg et al 2008a for example station k2 had a significantly higher total abundance with a greater proportion of medium and large sized copepods table 1 we set the vertical distribution of copepods using data from day night net tows taken at both sites ascribing changes in zooplankton abundances to dvm can be complicated by daytime net avoidance by some taxa and result in the total number of organisms integrated through the water column to differ between day and night e g ianson et al 2004 consequently we developed several different vertical distributions of copepods for the models table 3 these include 4 non dvm vertical distributions designated d1 d2 n1 and n2 for each location using a mixture of daytime and nighttime total abundances and vertical distributions for these cases copepods maintained their initially assigned depths and did not move vertically the dvm model runs for each location used only the nighttime total copepod abundance for that site and the model was initialized with the nighttime vertical abundance distribution individuals assigned as migrators performed vertical migration as described in the modeling zooplankton section the resulting zooplankton vertical distributions are shown in fig 4 we refer to the two broad classes of simulations as aloha simulations and k2 simulations because the zooplankton depth distributions used to initialize the simulations were based on data from those sites we did not attempt to make predictive simulations of fecal pellet fluxes at these two locations but rather used the derived zooplankton and food distributions as disparate examples of natural systems that can be used to explore the consequences of changes in community composition and zooplankton behavior maximum abundance of copepods in the aloha simulations are in the 0 50 m depth bin which contains approximately 5 103 organisms abundances decrease steadily with depth between the surface and 150 m fig 4 they are then approximately constant between 150 m and 300 m daytime vertical distributions d1 and n1 increase again in the 300 500 m depth bins whereas nighttime vertical distributions d2 and n2 decrease in these depths abundances in the 0 50 m depth bin for the k2 simulations vary from 15 40 103 organisms abundances decrease sharply and remain low between 50 and 200 m before increasing significantly in the 200 300 m depth bin abundances then decrease steadily below 300 m 2 10 model implementation simulation experiments the model was built and run in python python software foundation version 3 6 each model scenario summarized in table 3 was run a total of 6 times and the resulting mean and standard deviations of these repetitions are presented and used for comparison between model scenarios we used two metrics to examine the effect of community composition on fecal pellet flux the feeding preferences of individuals community compositions a b c and d and the vertical distributions of the copepods in the water column abundance modes d1 d2 n1 n2 and dvm first because we are interested in the flux in the mesopelagic zone we concentrated on the modeled fecal pellet flux at 150 300 and 500 m second we calculated the b parameter b value from the martin curve from the model data usually the b value is used as a measure of the average attenuation of flux with depth material produced in surface waters is consumed as it sinks to deeper waters however because we set the value of the fecal pellet removal rate the b value can be interpreted as a measure of where in the water column fecal pellets are produced for example material sinking from the surface to 500 m depth will be consumed during its passage resulting in a lower flux at 500 m fresh material produced at 250 m for example will not be degraded or removed as much by the time it reaches 500 m leading to a lower average attenuation of flux 3 model results the attenuation of fecal pellet flux with depth is determined in part by a free parameter the fecal pellet removal rate we determined values for this parameter by running all model scenarios see table 3 using a range of values for the fecal pellet removal rate our aim was not to determine values that explained the observed vertical attenuation of flux at both sites but rather to obtain values that allowed for a range of model fecal pellet fluxes that compared favorably with those observed in sediment traps at 150 300 and 500 m at the two sites the best agreement between modeled and observed fluxes was obtained with a fecal pellet removal rate of 20 per day for aloha simulations and 30 per day for k2 simulations a comparison of all tested degradation rates 5 40 with field data is available in supplementary material figure s2 for aloha a degradation rate of 20 produced modeled fecal pellet fluxes that fell within the ranges of the sediment trap data at all three depths for station k2 a 30 degradation rate produced modeled fluxes that fell within the range of most of the sediment trap data at that site but produced slightly smaller modeled fluxes than observed fluxes at 300 m in reality the degradation rates most likely vary with depth but this would be hard to examine without including a full ecosystem model that incorporated the degradation pathways in lieu of this we chose a simple constant value of the degradation rate these values produced model results that generally overlapped with the range of field data at all depths for the different model scenarios fig 5 modeled and observed fluxes were larger for k2 than aloha simulations fig 5 because of the greater abundance of copepods in the water column modeled fluxes varied within the range of observed fluxes for each of the three trap depths fig 5 these results gave us confidence that the model could be used to investigate the effects of community composition and behavior on the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the water column 3 1 fecal pellet flux with depth variability in the modeled fecal pellet fluxes follows broadly similar patterns for both the aloha and k2 simulations fig 5 in particular for a given community composition the relative differences between fluxes obtained using different copepod vertical distributions remain approximately the same at all three depths for example community b tends to have higher fluxes and community c tends to have lower fluxes fig 5 these patterns are set by the fecal pellet production rates in the upper 150 m and remain basically the same to 500 m this indicates that fecal pellet production at depths 150 m does not contribute significantly to fecal pellet fluxes for example simulations with the zooplankton vertical distribution n2 nighttime water column abundance and nighttime vertical distribution produce the largest fluxes for all communities for both the aloha and k2 simulations fig 5 this is a consequence of nighttime vertical distributions having more copepods in the upper 100 m of the water column which is where food abundance is highest and to a lesser extent that nighttime total abundances are larger than in daytime thus the model suggests that the magnitude of the flux is sensitive to where individuals reside in the water column not just the total water column abundance aloha simulations with communities c carnivore dominated and d detritivore dominated generally have less fecal pellet flux at all depths than those with communities a evenly mixed and b omnivore dominated fig 5 there is a similar though less pronounced difference for the k2 simulations this is because fecal pellet production rates in the top 150 m were lower for communities c and d fig 6 food available for fecal pellet production by carnivores and detritivores were the lowest at all depths in the aloha simulations fig 4 resulting in low fecal pellet production rates these differences were less pronounced for the k2 simulations largely because of the greater total abundance of zooplankton and smaller relative differences between the food available for omnivores and detritivores fig 4 incorporating dvm into the simulations produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases for example fluxes with dvm at aloha are the smallest for communities c and d at all trap depths fig 5 the same is true for communities a and b at aloha when comparing it to the fluxes of abundance distributions n1 and n2 which have the same total copepod abundances in the entire water column as the dvm mode but slightly different vertical distributions the majority of migrators in this model are omnivores eating phytoplankton and microzooplankton and although surface nighttime abundances are high fig 4 they are only in this depth bin for 10 h a day in the dvm scenario this results in lower overall fecal pellet fluxes at 150 m production rates of fecal pellets below 150 m are approximately 10 of those at shallower depths fig 6 because of the decrease in food availability with increasing depths fig 4 fluxes with dvm at aloha for communities a and b tend to be slightly higher than the fluxes for d1 and d2 which is mostly due to the difference in overall abundance with d1 and d2 having lower zooplankton abundances than the dvm scenario at k2 fluxes with dvm were smaller than n1 and n2 for communities c and d at all trap depths this is not the same for communities a and b where the flux with the dvm scenario generally falls in between the flux values for n1 and n2 at all depths fig 5 this is a result of the relative contribution of fecal pellet production at depth for these model scenarios where the dvm scenario has lower fecal pellet production than n1 and n2 below 100 m fig 6 for communities a and b compared to communities c and d the relative importance of dvm is greater for the k2 simulations the greater amount of food available for fecal pellet production by omnivores in the upper 50 m leads to a greater flux out of the surface waters than in the aloha simulations fecal pellet production rates are low below 100 m in the k2 simulations but are greater when dvm is incorporated compared to dvm scenarios at aloha fig 6 this leads to a small but significant production of new fecal pellets at depth that results in an increase in the relative importance of dvm deeper in the water column at k2 the modeled flux at 500 m showed broadly similar patterns at both sites as community composition and vertical distribution of zooplankton varied at both sites community composition b omnivore dominated tended to produce the larger flux for each vertical zooplankton distribution fig 5 this is unsurprising since food availability for omnivores is almost always greater than that for both carnivores and detritivores at every depth with the exception for depth intervals between 200 and 500 m at k2 where the food availability for detritivores slightly surpasses that for omnivores see fig 4 simulations that use the nighttime vertical distribution of zooplankton d2 and n2 where there are more individuals in the surface waters than at depth tend to have the largest fecal pellet fluxes at all depths for all community compositions with n2 nighttime abundance simulations having slightly greater fluxes than d1 daytime abundance due to the higher total abundance for n2 fig 5 although the n1 abundance scenario has higher overall water column abundance than d2 the vertical distribution of the total abundance results in fewer individuals in the upper 150 m for n1 scenarios the generally greater fluxes in scenarios n1 and n2 are likely to be the result of greater overall zooplankton abundances especially in the surface waters where there is more available food for fecal pellet production if model results are normalized to total water column zooplankton abundance these differences disappear data not shown 3 2 attenuation coefficient b value the calculated b values were generally 2 fold higher at k2 than at aloha but there was no consistent pattern in b value with differences in community composition fig 7 the b values in the dvm scenario at aloha were within the range for the non dvm scenarios for communities a b and c indicating that dvm does not impact flux attenuation fig 7 at k2 b values in the dvm scenario fell between the b values for n1 and n2 for all community compositions fig 7 reflecting the intermediary nature of the dvm vertical abundance compared to n1 and n2 4 discussion the model results show that copepod vertical distribution feeding preference and migratory behavior all affect the vertical flux of fecal pellets in the water column many current biogeochemical models do not explicitly include zooplankton dvm and those that do e g archibald et al 2019 bianchi et al 2013b use a small number of functional groups e g small zooplankton and large zooplankton to represent the modeled zooplankton populations this does not capture the range of zooplankton dvm behavior and feeding strategies our model while focusing only on copepods explored this range of variation by incorporating feeding preferences omnivores carnivores and detritivores in addition to including a range of copepod sizes differences in vertical distribution of copepods and dvm behavior 4 1 dvm mediated fecal pellet flux the model presented here was not designed to be a predictive model but instead was used to explore the effects of copepod community composition on dvm mediated fecal pellet fluxes however the model yields fecal pellet fluxes that are consistent with data from k2 and aloha wilson et al 2008 and that are consistent with other modeling studies for example bianchi et al 2013b calculated annual average dvm mediated fluxes for all zooplankton as opposed to copepods only at the base of the euphotic zone at k2 and aloha as 27 6 and 2 4 mg c m 2 d 1 respectively these are total dvm mediated fluxes i e fecal pellet plus respiration plus excreted dissolved organic carbon and are at shallower depths than our model where fecal pellet fluxes at 150 m range between 2 2 15 6 and 1 0 7 2 at k2 and aloha respectively 4 2 effects of dvm on flux attenuation the value of the b parameter in equation 1 varies spatially and temporally with values in the northeast pacific for total poc rather than just fecal pellet poc as in this study reported to vary between 0 32 and 0 97 martin et al 1987 a global assessment using thorium based particle export measurements and sediment trap data to estimate total poc flux yielded b values that ranged between 0 36 and 1 09 henson et al 2012 and a subsequent study using a global database of particle size spectrum measurements yielded a range of 0 42 1 75 guidi et al 2015 some of this variation comes from the variability in the interactions between sinking particles and zooplankton and bacteria in the mesopelagic zone buesseler and lampitt 2008 including production of sinking fecal pellets at depth the effects of this can be seen for example in the model runs for the k2 simulations using community d abundance distributions d1 n1 and dvm all have lower values of b i e less net attenuation of flux that result from the production of fecal pellets between 200 and 250 m depth fig 6 simulations with abundance distributions d2 and n2 have much lower fecal pellet production rates in this depth bin and a higher overall b value similarly the aloha simulation using community d with dvm has a higher fecal pellet production rate in the 150 200 m depth bin in both cases the co occurrence of zooplankton and available food resources at a given depth is key while calculations based on the martin curve can lead to a misunderstanding of the mechanisms controlling the biological carbon pump between different locations buesseler et al 2020 they are appropriate to use within the same location in this study i e to compare between community compositions within station aloha but not to compare between aloha and k2 a large range of model scenarios resulted in similar attenuation indicating that care must be exercises when interpreting b values derived from field data incorporating dvm into the model produced lower fecal pellet fluxes in some cases compared to the non dvm scenarios while also marginally improving the agreement between the modeled and observed median fecal pellet flux one explanation for this is that dvm is not necessarily the most effective ecological method to create high flux at depth it is merely a consequence of visual predation and serves primarily as a mechanism to avoid predation while maximizing food availability another method to increase fecal pellet fluxes is to simply have higher zooplankton abundance in the epipelagic which resulted in greater magnitude of fecal pellet production in fact this can be seen when comparing non dvm nighttime scenarios to dvm scenarios and daytime scenarios the vertical distribution of copepods matching nighttime field data resulted in higher magnitude of fecal pellet flux at all model depths compared to daytime this was simply because there were more individuals at shallower depths where food availability was higher the fecal pellet flux from dvm scenarios was generally higher than daytime scenarios but lower than nighttime scenarios the vertical distribution of zooplankton abundance in the dvm scenarios most closely matches field data as does the resulting fecal pellet flux compared to other model scenarios 4 3 model complexity considerations we used an agent based approach to represent more details of the copepod community composition in the model however this still oversimplifies zooplankton community composition for example we assume that the zooplankton community was composed entirely of copepods this is a reasonable assumption for k2 and aloha where copepods dominate the zooplankton communities in the epipelagic and mesopelagic zones steinberg et al 2008a and where copepod fecal pellets represent the majority of identifiable pellets caught in sediment traps wilson et al 2008 however this would pose a problem for modeling environments where non copepod taxa constitute a large portion of the zooplankton especially if allometric data is lacking for these taxa zooplankton fecal pellets differ in size shape density and hence sinking velocity depending on taxon thus representing the zooplankton community as a single taxon producing fecal pellets with one set of characteristics will affect the fecal pellet flux for example copepods produce small ellipsoidal or ovoid pellets with sinking rates between 26 and 300 m d 1 ploug et al 2008a yoon et al 2001 whereas salps produce larger more rectangular pellets with sinking speeds several hundred to 1000 m d 1 iversen et al 2017 phillips et al 2009 yoon et al 2001 it is thus important for future extensions of the model to include additional zooplankton taxa however while there is a large literature on copepod size metabolism and diet preferences e g benedetti et al 2016 brun et al 2017 corresponding information and allometric relationships for other zooplankton taxa are more limited making model formulation problematic we used a one dimensional model for the water column which we assumed to be static with no vertical mixing or advection into or out of the model one dimensional models are frequently used to examine the behavior of the biological pump e g dadou et al 2001 and although an idealization it was reasonable in this case where we are exploring the effects of changes in copepod community composition on fecal pellet flux although we used field data from k2 and aloha to develop and parameterize this model it is difficult to perform direct comparisons between observations and predictive model results of dvm mediated flux one reason for this is the uncertainty in the data day night zooplankton net tows that are used to quantify dvm tend to yield different total daytime and nighttime zooplankton abundances integrated for the total water column steinberg et al 2008a there can be several reasons for this biophysical interactions can lead to patchiness in zooplankton spatial distributions on a wide range of scales e g prairie et al 2012 also organisms deeper in the water column may be advected away from the sampling track between sampling intervals and so are not counted in the later tow or bathypelagic species may migrate into the mesopelagic zone net avoidance where organisms sense the approaching net and avoid it may also be factor ianson et al 2004 such uncertainties need to be accounted for when comparing models with data we ran the model to a pseudo steady state where the daily cycle was repeated this is because the available data represented a single snapshot of the zooplankton community and fecal pellet flux zooplankton that were consumed by carnivores were re inserted into the model in order to preserve the zooplankton abundances as a result the model did not take into account detailed predator prey dynamics between different zooplankton species such dynamics can lead to decoupling of changes in flux deep in the water column from changes occurring in surface waters jackson and burd 2001 extending the model to run on seasonal or annual timescales will require considering these effects as well as the effects of ontogenetic or life cycle vertical migration on vertical flux which at k2 is equivalent to 9 of the passive poc flux at 1000 m kobari et al 2008 one of the methods we used to change community structure in the model was to vary the proportions of zooplankton using different feeding modes omnivory detritivory and carnivory to simplify the model we held the proportion of copepods in these feeding modes constant with depth however the feeding ecology of zooplankton changes with depth with carnivory becoming more important deeper in the water column steinberg et al 2008b vinogradov and tseitlin 1983 wilson et al 2008 keeping the proportion of copepods of a given feeding mode constant with depth is likely to have a small impact on the model results because modeled fecal pellet production rates are relatively low below 150 m usually 10 of those at 150 m this may change if other zooplankton taxa are included in the model for example chaetognaths made up the third most abundant mesozooplankton taxon at k2 and aloha overall with maximum abundances of 11 2 m 3 and 34 1 m 3 respectively compared to calanoid copepods with maximum abundances of 80 m 3 at aloha and 800 m 3 at k2 steinberg et al 2008a including other such taxa would require modeling additional feeding strategies such as flux feeding jackson 1993 raptorial feeding and ambush feeding kiørboe 2008 where functional relationships between predator and prey are less established a notable limitation to this model is its focus on zooplankton fecal pellet carbon flux and the exclusion of other forms of poc flux given the driving question of this study to investigate the role of zooplankton community structure and behavior on fecal pellet carbon flux this limitation is appropriate however it is important to note that this model would not be able to relate the zooplankton fecal pellet carbon flux to total poc flux in the environment combining this model with more general poc flux models that use a similar modeling framework e g see jokulsdottir and archer 2016 would however allow a comparison of fecal pellet fluxes to total poc flux under varying conditions the model presented in this paper is capable of tracking other types of zooplankton flux from excretion and respiration and could therefore be used to investigate the relative contribution of fecal pellet flux versus other types of metabolic flux 5 conclusion the relatively simplified model presented here shows that an agent based model that uses trait based relationships for physiological rates can be used to give insight into the variability of particle flux in the deep ocean the model shows that zooplankton community composition feeding preference and behavior i e dvm affect fecal pellet carbon flux in the mesopelagic for example the model indicates that zooplankton communities dominated by omnivores tend to have the largest throughout the water column this could be a potential problem for global biogeochemical models which typically represent only 1 type of zooplankton and those that do include more zooplankton categories typically use a size based rather than feeding preference categorization bopp et al 2013 because our model in its current version is a static model we cannot include the effects of seasonality or longer term zooplankton behavior such as ontogenetic vertical migration which undoubtedly effect both zooplankton community structure and fecal pellet flux future iterations of the model will incorporate these aspects the challenges in expanding this model are in finding or developing trait based physiological relationships for other ecologically and biogeochemically important taxa and the availability of extensive datasets that

silvertown et al 2015 letten et al 2015 these are just a few of the ways in which variance in a single resource can drive multiple trade offs and co existence opportunities in a hydrological niche trautz et al 2018 although the hydrological niches of plant communities have been verified by experiments theoretical research is still relatively insufficient barkaoui et al 2017 trautz et al 2017 the formation of plant community diversity is a process of environmental filtration and biological filtration but the biological filtration of interspecific and intraspecific interactions is based on the trade offs between the utilization efficiency of water resources and the relative growth rate due to the limitation in water resources huxman and venable 2013 harrison et al 2015 it is also a biological selection of the interaction between biology and the environment trautz et al 2017 barkaoui et al 2017 through the process of inter species and intra species interactions with the environment the plant community has a community succession the long term succession of a plant community is an important part of the evolution of the ecosystem in which it is located the continuation of the community requires the matching of the biophysical basis which can exist and the evolutionary mechanism which is not eliminated loreau and mazancourt 2013 although a community cannot evolve

different species in water limited communities compete with each other for water resources during the process of species reproduction species interactions among communities form different community structures similar to evolution eventually a stable community for the maximal use of water resources is established in water limited ecosystems huxman and venable 2013 barabãs and d andrea 2016 therefore a plant community diversity theory that can better understand community stability and how it changes with the environment should be a diversity theory that reflects both niche and evolution evolutionary stability theory was established based on countermeasure selection due to interactions that included direct and indirect effects at different levels genes individuals and populations and so is an important tool for understanding biological and ecological phenomena iwasa and pomiankowski 1995 crespi and semeniuk 2004 buunk et al 2008 uller and pen 2011 mcnickle and dybzinski 2013 harish and kurland 2017 nevertheless the application of evolutionary stability theory at the community level has received less attention goodnight 1990 han et al 2019 in fact it is necessary for any ecological community to fit the environment and achieve an evolutionarily stable strategy ess in ecosystems the nature of community succession is competition among different community structures at a specified time scale the community structure adapts to the environment and is preserved by natural selection it then gradually expands in space different community structures correspond to different resource use strategies barabãs and d andrea 2016 ruse 2013 the ability of community adaptation to an environment is the suitability of the community named as the community fitness which will evolve with the evolution of an ecosystem table 1 compares the evolutionary stability strategies of intra species resource utilization in populations and the inter species resource utilization in communities the community eventually realizes the utilization efficiency of available water resources to the maximum extent to attain the status of an ecologically stable community and to match the available water in an environment the evolutionary stability theory of community water resource allocations is proposed in this paper for ecologically stable plant communities in water limited ecosystems the focus of the theory is on ecologically stable communities that are similar to island biogeographic communities macarthur and wilson 2001 whose diversity is stable under long time scales bohannan and lenski 2000 zhang et al 2000 a new hydrological niche plant diversity model is established and the species abundance and species area curves including the community hydrological niche differentiation factor are obtained finally the results are validated using existing diversity theories the study framework is shown in fig 1 2 methods this paper combines with the evolutionary stability theory and draws the conclusion that the water consumption per unit mass growth of i species in a unit time is the minimum value and constant the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean ratio of the hydrological niche of species in a community is developed as a new diversity index that is used to measure the community hydrological niche differentiation and a new plant diversity model is constructed 2 1 derivation of the evolutionary stable strategy model for community water resource utilization water is a restricted resource for communities in water limited ecosystems so there is an evolutionary stability strategy of water resource allocation among species let s be the number of the species then the hydrological niche of a species i is represented by wi0bimi the water consumption of the individual growth of the i species where mi is the adult individual biomass of i species bi is the average birth rate growth rate of new biomass over unit time of i species and w0i is the available water consumption per unit mass growth of i species in a unit time the hydrological niche vector of the general plant community can be defined as follows w01b1m1 w02b2m2 w0sbsms during the process of community succession the number of species s and the total number of individuals j where j i 1 s n i where ni is the number of i species maximize the hydrological niche difference until it stabilizes let w0ibimi ci where c is the total available water supply of the community during its growth period hence i 1 s c i n i c 1 λ j n j m j b j w 0 j i 1 s n i m i b i w 0 i j 1 2 3 s where λj is the proportion of the available water resources of the community that are utilized by j species the proportion λj is equal to 0 meaning that the species are not in the community let fi 1 w0i be the fitness of water resources consumed by i species pure countermeasures for community systems in addition let f be the fitness of water resources under the community mix strategy 2 f i 1 s λ i f i when the community reaches an evolutionary stable community the community water use strategy is also evolutionarily stable this is known from the evolutionary stability theorem cannings 1990 which is as follows 3 f f i 1 w 0 i or w 0 i w i 1 2 3 s where w is a constant namely the amount of water consumed per unit biomass of every species in a unit time is constant this is not only a condition for the stability of the community but also a reflection of the maximization of the available water resource efficiency of the community when the community reaches evolutionary stability the hydrological niche vector is arrived at as follows w b1m1 w b2m2 w bsms han et al 2020 discussed how a plant community species can maximize water resource utilization efficiency in a community in a water limited terrestrial ecosystem including water resource utilization characteristics at the individual and population levels the water consumption per unit mass growth of i species in unit time was the minimum value and a constant which provides a basis for the balance of different species in similar habitats for the community the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean of the hydrological niche of the species are relatively stable when the arithmetic mean i 1 s n i j b i m i w 0 i is sensitive to a larger w0ibimini j species with more reproductive biomasses the representative value of the larger w0i bimini j and the harmonic mean s i 1 s 1 w 0 i b i m i can be seen to be sensitive to a smaller w0ibimi species with smaller reproductive biomasses this can be seen as the representative value of the smaller w0ibimi therefore the ratio of the arithmetic mean to harmonic mean can be used to measure the differentiation degree of the community hydrological niche 4 ϖ i 1 s w 0 i b i m i n i j s i 1 s 1 w 0 i b i m i where ϖ is the hydrological niche difference factor from the definition of ϖ it can be seen that ϖ is closely related to the ratio of those larger w0ibimini j widespread species with relatively larger water resource consumptions to those smaller w0i bimi narrow spread species with slow individual growth rates in the community the greater the difference between the widespread species and the narrow spread species in the community the larger the ϖ typically ϖ is greater than 1 if there is no difference among species under the strong assumption of neutral theory then according to the definition of ϖ it can be seen that when the environmentally available water supply fluctuates more species richness contributes to the stability of ϖ zuppingerdingley et al 2014 the greater the hydrological niche difference the more able the community is to adapt to the environment and the more conducive to avoiding competition from the perspective of water resource utilization species with larger individual biomasses are more capable of utilizing available water resources quickly while species with smaller individual biomasses are more likely to fill the entire hydrological niche space when the community reaches an evolutionary stable community and w0i w i 1 2 3 s 5 ϖ i 1 s b i m i n i j s i 1 s 1 b i m i i 1 s μ i h i where μ i n i j h i b i m i s j 1 s 1 b j m j s j 1 s 1 b j m j is regarded as a community level parameter and bimi corresponds to the resource consumption of i species hence the ecological significance of hi is clear when in a community within a certain area the larger the mi the smaller the ni where ni is the number of i species hence m i 1 n i and b i m i w b i n i and the following is established 6 h i b i n i s j 1 s n j b j hence b i m i or b i n i are the strategies of i species growth to adapt to the environment these different growth strategies to adapt to the environment in a water limited environment that also correspond to different water resource use strategies reflecting the differentiation of the hydrological niche in this paper the primary work is to quantitatively describe the relationship between the hydrological niche difference factor and the number of species contained by n individuals 2 2 the establishment of the hydrological niche diversity model in terrestrial plant communities in water limited environments in an ecologically stable community in water limited environments the ultimate goal of community succession is to maximize the power of the available water resources in a regional terrestrial plant community where the number of individuals of i species remains unchanged related to the number of total individuals hence in an ecologically stable community the amount of water required for the growth of a new biomass is equal to the amount of water consumed by the old biomass in a unit time hence 7 b i w 0 i d i w i where di is the average mortality death rate of biomass over a unit time for i species wi is the water supplied by the unit death mass of i species in a unit time and w0i w and w is a constant in an ecologically stable community in addition to the relatively stable environment stable communities and stable community patterns also need to meet the following conditions i there is stability and consistency in the minimum limited resource utilization efficiency which is the basis for long term evolution and stability of the community w0i w ii the distribution of resources used among the different species is stable during the process of species turnover bi w di wi iii the dynamic equilibrium of the community is achieved in the presence of mutation however the existing neutral theory only focuses on conditions ii and iii in fact condition i is the key to a stable community han et al 2020 in this paper the demographic trade offs of the neutral theory hypothesis in zhang et al 2012 are replaced with condition i combined with conditions ii and iii and a new plant diversity model is constructed condition i was a more reasonable hypothesis than the demographic trade offs neutral theory hypothesis for real communities condition i was also weaker and more general let v is the species variation coefficient mcgill 2003 volkov 2005 v 1 it was hypothesized there are no super species in a community in other words for each species b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j hence by considering the different individual masses the distribution of the species abundance in a regional community was in conformity to the fisher log series distribution however there is niche information in the α diversity coefficient please see the supplementary material appendix 1 for details 8 φ n i 1 s p i e n i j 1 s θ di s d j i j 1 v n n 1

is the species variation coefficient n is the number of individuals φ n is the average species number contained by n individuals and j is the total number of individuals in the community the diversity index and diversity theory are well integrated in this paper it can be seen from this model that the degree of the community hydrological niche difference ω was a factor of the diversity index of the community as part of the diversity index ω has a clear ecological significance it is clear that the mean value of the ecological niche of the species is constant and the greater the difference in the niches of the different species the more diverse the community α fig 2 a the results were validated using existing classic plant diversity theories the formation of a unified theory is an important ecological research direction that is similar to newton s law of physics mcgill et al 2007 mcgill 2010 although the neutral and generalized neutral theories hubbell 2005 zhang et al 2012 matthews and whittaker 2014 are too strong to match the true situation in the hypothesis they still provide the advantages of diversity predictions for tropical rainforests the average birth rate growth rate of new mass over a unit time of i species bi the water consumption per a unit mass of i species in a unit time w0i the average mortality death rate of mass over a unit time of i species di and the dry mass of i species at the individual level mi are constants in the classical neutral theory of hubbell hubbell 2005 namely the strong symmetry neutral hypothesis for a generalized neutral theory hypothesis matthews and whittaker 2014 mi and di are constants the mean value of bi is a constant and for the demographic trade offs neutral theory hypothesis and w0i and mi are constants zhang et al 2012 in this paper the neutral hydrological niche hypothesis was based on w0i being a constant as the most important community model the classical species area curve plays an important role in testing many diversity theories brown et al 2002 mcgill et al 2007 mcgill 2010 and it also has important application significance he and hubbell 2011 when s is the number of species of a local community in area a and c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the relationship is described as follows c aaz where a is a constant and z is the fractal dimension of resources in space which is related to the distribution of available water resources and is determined by the soils and the extent of their reuse in the community ranging from 1 to 1 5 han et al 2020 the species area curves are also derived from han et al 2020 s ba z where z 0 5 z 1 and it can also verify the predicted values of the species area relationship experimentally b u w a h where h is the average community fitness of the unit area w is a constant namely the amount of water consumed per unit biomass of every species in a unit time u is a constant namely the difference of the water potential at the community level during the niche overlapping period and a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as the multi year average the species area curves are also derived from eq 14 in the form s θωlog 1 a θω zhang et al 2012 where ω is the hydrological niche difference factor of the community θ jv 1 v where v is hubbell s species variation coefficient and j is the total number of individuals in the community larger ω indicates a stronger difference in the niches of the different species of a local community through numerical simulation θ 0 4 j 4 104 v 0 00001 and the species area curves of the two different theoretical systems can be well matched see fig 2 b 3 discussion in this paper the evolutionary stability theory of community water resource allocation was studied in ecologically stable plant communities in water limited environments and the water consumption of individual biomass growth was used to quantify the hydrological niches of species in addition the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean ratio of the hydrological niches of species in a community was used to measure the degree of community hydrological niche differentiation by constructing this plant diversity model the species abundance curve and species area curve including the community hydrological niche differentiation factors were obtained the theory and mechanism that were proposed in this paper were more justifiable compared with the neutral theory which is complementary to the existing diversity theory in addition to unifying and extending the classical neutral theory the new discovery was as follows please see the supplementary material appendix 1 for details v b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j 0 or b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j where these are important conditions in eq 5 however no matter how approximate it is true for 1 v 1 v 1 v b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j therefore an explanation was then provided for the problems in the prediction results of the classical neutral theory when the number of individuals n is large enough fig 3 of mcgill 2003 this hydrological niche differentiation model contains not only the empirical fisher log series distribution but also more niche differentiation parameters zuppingerdingley et al 2014 the empirical fisher log series distribution predicts diversity in many plots but there are few empirical fisher log series distribution parameters according to this hydrological niche differentiation model there were the following important discoveries considering the different individual masses the distribution of the species abundance in a regional community was near the fisher log series distribution however there was niche information in the α diversity coefficient and the larger the niche differentiation the greater the number of species having the same abundance in a water constrained ecosystem the plant diversity of the community is determined by the regionally available water resources and the changes in the species abundance that are filtered by the local biological and abiotic environment and driven by the full utilization of water resources see fig 3 the main driving force for the increasing number of species is the full utilization of available water resources han et al 2020 so the more the environmentally available water c the greater the number of species in the community s by adaptation and coevolution more species are able to go through environmental and biological filtration becoming community species that can utilize more available water resources at different spatial scales the greater the number of species in the community s the greater the niche differentiation in order to avoid water resource competition zuppingerdingley et al 2014 because d ϖ d z 0 from s θωlog 1 a θω ba z for s 1 the greater the niche differentiation the bigger the fractal dimension of available water resources in space z so the more environmentally available water because of this circular effect changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species in this paper one community evolutionary stability theory was proposed and a diversity theory of terrestrial plant communities limited by water resources was established during the process of community evolution resources are allocated among species tilman 1982 van et al 2017 and the best water resource allocation strategy was achieved through interspecies and intraspecies competition and interactions with the environment this results in the most suitable community high efficiency and stability under the community evolutionary stability water resource allocation strategy the species abundance curves and species area curves were derived using information on niche differentiation which are also important in the diversity theory mcgill 2010 by utilizing the derivation and verification of this model this theory of evolutionary stability can be applied to the theory of community diversity in this paper the quantitative relationship between hydrological niche and plant diversity in water limited ecosystems was also given which provided an example of hydrological niche and neutral diversity integration based on the evolutionary stability theory this new example not only unifies and expands the existing theories of community evolutionary diversity but also embodies differentiation factors of community water ecology in community diversity the introduction of the hydrological niche into the evolutionary theory of plant diversity provided an important example for understanding how environmental water resource changes affect diversity which will help to further understand how stable plant communities change with the environment and promote the integration of niche theory and evolutionary theory to the best of our knowledge we matched the species area curves obtained by different diversity theories and linked the different diversity theories to explain the community biodiversity for the first time the water resources involved in this model are the available water resources for the plant community instead of the total amount of water resources in a region this paper used the community in a water limited ecosystem as an example primarily to facilitate an understanding of the relevant concepts such as the maximization of the available water resource utilization efficiency of the plant community and an evolutionary stable community based on water resource utilization in fact in wet areas or those areas with abundant water resources plants have evolved water loving characteristics and the total amount of available water resources is essentially fixed hence the available water resources are closely related to plant growth and distribution the slightest change in water resources in time and space is an important limiting factor for plant growth eagleson 2005 silvertown 2015 garcía baquero 2016 harrison et al 2015 therefore the plant diversity model of the hydrological niche in this paper is applicable both in arid and wet

strategy of water resource allocation among species let s be the number of the species then the hydrological niche of a species i is represented by wi0bimi the water consumption of the individual growth of the i species where mi is the adult individual biomass of i species bi is the average birth rate growth rate of new biomass over unit time of i species and w0i is the available water consumption per unit mass growth of i species in a unit time the hydrological niche vector of the general plant community can be defined as follows w01b1m1 w02b2m2 w0sbsms during the process of community succession the number of species s and the total number of individuals j where j i 1 s n i where ni is the number of i species maximize the hydrological niche difference until it stabilizes let w0ibimi ci where c is the total available water supply of the community during its growth period hence i 1 s c i n i c 1 λ j n j m j b j w 0 j i 1 s n i m i b i w 0 i j 1 2 3 s where λj is the proportion of the available water resources of the community that are utilized by j species the proportion λj is equal to 0 meaning that the species are not in the community let fi 1 w0i be the fitness of water resources consumed by i species pure countermeasures for community systems in addition let f be the fitness of water resources under the community mix strategy 2 f i 1 s λ i f i when the community reaches an evolutionary stable community the community water use strategy is also evolutionarily stable this is known from the evolutionary stability theorem cannings 1990 which is as follows 3 f f i 1 w 0 i or w 0 i w i 1 2 3 s where w is a constant namely the amount of water consumed per unit biomass of every species in a unit time is constant this is not only a condition for the stability of the community but also a reflection of the maximization of the available water resource efficiency of the community when the community reaches evolutionary stability the hydrological niche vector is arrived at as follows w b1m1 w b2m2 w bsms han et al 2020 discussed how a plant community species can maximize water resource utilization efficiency in a community in a water limited terrestrial ecosystem including water resource utilization characteristics at the individual and population levels the water consumption per unit mass growth of i species in unit time was the minimum value and a constant which provides a basis for the balance of different species in similar habitats for the community the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean of the hydrological niche of the species are relatively stable when the arithmetic mean i 1 s n i j b i m i w 0 i is sensitive to a larger w0ibimini j species with more reproductive biomasses the representative value of the larger w0i bimini j and the harmonic mean s i 1 s 1 w 0 i b i m i can be seen to be sensitive to a smaller w0ibimi species with smaller reproductive biomasses this can be seen as the representative value of the smaller w0ibimi therefore the ratio of the arithmetic mean to harmonic mean can be used to measure the differentiation degree of the community hydrological niche 4 ϖ i 1 s w 0 i b i m i n i j s i 1 s 1 w 0 i b i m i where ϖ is the hydrological niche difference factor from the definition of ϖ it can be seen that ϖ is closely related to the ratio of those larger w0ibimini j widespread species with relatively larger water resource consumptions to those smaller w0i bimi narrow spread species with slow individual growth rates in the community the greater the difference between the widespread species and the narrow spread species in the community the larger the ϖ typically ϖ is greater than 1 if there is no difference among species under the strong assumption of neutral theory then according to the definition of ϖ it can be seen that when the environmentally available water supply fluctuates more species richness contributes to the stability of ϖ zuppingerdingley et al 2014 the greater the hydrological niche difference the more able the community is to adapt to the environment and the more conducive to avoiding competition from the perspective of water resource utilization species with larger individual biomasses are more capable of utilizing available water resources quickly while species with smaller individual biomasses are more likely to fill the entire hydrological niche space when the community reaches an evolutionary stable community and w0i w i 1 2 3 s 5 ϖ i 1 s b i m i n i j s i 1 s 1 b i m i i 1 s μ i h i where μ i n i j h i b i m i s j 1 s 1 b j m j s j 1 s 1 b j m j is regarded as a community level parameter and bimi corresponds to the resource consumption of i species hence the ecological significance of hi is clear when in a community within a certain area the larger the mi the smaller the ni where ni is the number of i species hence m i 1 n i and b i m i w b i n i and the following is established 6 h i b i n i s j 1 s n j b j hence b i m i or b i n i are the strategies of i species growth to adapt to the environment these different growth strategies to adapt to the environment in a water limited environment that also correspond to different water resource use strategies reflecting the differentiation of the hydrological niche in this paper the primary work is to quantitatively describe the relationship between the hydrological niche difference factor and the number of species contained by n individuals 2 2 the establishment of the hydrological niche diversity model in terrestrial plant communities in water limited environments in an ecologically stable community in water limited environments the ultimate goal of community succession is to maximize the power of the available water resources in a regional terrestrial plant community where the number of individuals of i species remains unchanged related to the number of total individuals hence in an ecologically stable community the amount of water required for the growth of a new biomass is equal to the amount of water consumed by the old biomass in a unit time hence 7 b i w 0 i d i w i where di is the average mortality death rate of biomass over a unit time for i species wi is the water supplied by the unit death mass of i species in a unit time and w0i w and w is a constant in an ecologically stable community in addition to the relatively stable environment stable communities and stable community patterns also need to meet the following conditions i there is stability and consistency in the minimum limited resource utilization efficiency which is the basis for long term evolution and stability of the community w0i w ii the distribution of resources used among the different species is stable during the process of species turnover bi w di wi iii the dynamic equilibrium of the community is achieved in the presence of mutation however the existing neutral theory only focuses on conditions ii and iii in fact condition i is the key to a stable community han et al 2020 in this paper the demographic trade offs of the neutral theory hypothesis in zhang et al 2012 are replaced with condition i combined with conditions ii and iii and a new plant diversity model is constructed condition i was a more reasonable hypothesis than the demographic trade offs neutral theory hypothesis for real communities condition i was also weaker and more general let v is the species variation coefficient mcgill 2003 volkov 2005 v 1 it was hypothesized there are no super species in a community in other words for each species b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j hence by considering the different individual masses the distribution of the species abundance in a regional community was in conformity to the fisher log series distribution however there is niche information in the α diversity coefficient please see the supplementary material appendix 1 for details 8 φ n i 1 s p i e n i j 1 s θ di s d j i j 1 v n n 1

is the species variation coefficient n is the number of individuals φ n is the average species number contained by n individuals and j is the total number of individuals in the community the diversity index and diversity theory are well integrated in this paper it can be seen from this model that the degree of the community hydrological niche difference ω was a factor of the diversity index of the community as part of the diversity index ω has a clear ecological significance it is clear that the mean value of the ecological niche of the species is constant and the greater the difference in the niches of the different species the more diverse the community α fig 2 a the results were validated using existing classic plant diversity theories the formation of a unified theory is an important ecological research direction that is similar to newton s law of physics mcgill et al 2007 mcgill 2010 although the neutral and generalized neutral theories hubbell 2005 zhang et al 2012 matthews and whittaker 2014 are too strong to match the true situation in the hypothesis they still provide the advantages of diversity predictions for tropical rainforests the average birth rate growth rate of new mass over a unit time of i species bi the water consumption per a unit mass of i species in a unit time w0i the average mortality death rate of mass over a unit time of i species di and the dry mass of i species at the individual level mi are constants in the classical neutral theory of hubbell hubbell 2005 namely the strong symmetry neutral hypothesis for a generalized neutral theory hypothesis matthews and whittaker 2014 mi and di are constants the mean value of bi is a constant and for the demographic trade offs neutral theory hypothesis and w0i and mi are constants zhang et al 2012 in this paper the neutral hydrological niche hypothesis was based on w0i being a constant as the most important community model the classical species area curve plays an important role in testing many diversity theories brown et al 2002 mcgill et al 2007 mcgill 2010 and it also has important application significance he and hubbell 2011 when s is the number of species of a local community in area a and c is the total quantity of available water resources in the growth season the relationship is described as follows c aaz where a is a constant and z is the fractal dimension of resources in space which is related to the distribution of available water resources and is determined by the soils and the extent of their reuse in the community ranging from 1 to 1 5 han et al 2020 the species area curves are also derived from han et al 2020 s ba z where z 0 5 z 1 and it can also verify the predicted values of the species area relationship experimentally b u w a h where h is the average community fitness of the unit area w is a constant namely the amount of water consumed per unit biomass of every species in a unit time u is a constant namely the difference of the water potential at the community level during the niche overlapping period and a is a constant related to water supply such as the amount of water resources per unit area such as the multi year average the species area curves are also derived from eq 14 in the form s θωlog 1 a θω zhang et al 2012 where ω is the hydrological niche difference factor of the community θ jv 1 v where v is hubbell s species variation coefficient and j is the total number of individuals in the community larger ω indicates a stronger difference in the niches of the different species of a local community through numerical simulation θ 0 4 j 4 104 v 0 00001 and the species area curves of the two different theoretical systems can be well matched see fig 2 b 3 discussion in this paper the evolutionary stability theory of community water resource allocation was studied in ecologically stable plant communities in water limited environments and the water consumption of individual biomass growth was used to quantify the hydrological niches of species in addition the arithmetic mean and harmonic mean ratio of the hydrological niches of species in a community was used to measure the degree of community hydrological niche differentiation by constructing this plant diversity model the species abundance curve and species area curve including the community hydrological niche differentiation factors were obtained the theory and mechanism that were proposed in this paper were more justifiable compared with the neutral theory which is complementary to the existing diversity theory in addition to unifying and extending the classical neutral theory the new discovery was as follows please see the supplementary material appendix 1 for details v b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j 0 or b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j where these are important conditions in eq 5 however no matter how approximate it is true for 1 v 1 v 1 v b i n i m i j i s b j n j m j therefore an explanation was then provided for the problems in the prediction results of the classical neutral theory when the number of individuals n is large enough fig 3 of mcgill 2003 this hydrological niche differentiation model contains not only the empirical fisher log series distribution but also more niche differentiation parameters zuppingerdingley et al 2014 the empirical fisher log series distribution predicts diversity in many plots but there are few empirical fisher log series distribution parameters according to this hydrological niche differentiation model there were the following important discoveries considering the different individual masses the distribution of the species abundance in a regional community was near the fisher log series distribution however there was niche information in the α diversity coefficient and the larger the niche differentiation the greater the number of species having the same abundance in a water constrained ecosystem the plant diversity of the community is determined by the regionally available water resources and the changes in the species abundance that are filtered by the local biological and abiotic environment and driven by the full utilization of water resources see fig 3 the main driving force for the increasing number of species is the full utilization of available water resources han et al 2020 so the more the environmentally available water c the greater the number of species in the community s by adaptation and coevolution more species are able to go through environmental and biological filtration becoming community species that can utilize more available water resources at different spatial scales the greater the number of species in the community s the greater the niche differentiation in order to avoid water resource competition zuppingerdingley et al 2014 because d ϖ d z 0 from s θωlog 1 a θω ba z for s 1 the greater the niche differentiation the bigger the fractal dimension of available water resources in space z so the more environmentally available water because of this circular effect changes in water resources resulted in the community maximizing the utilization efficiency of water resources by adjusting the number and abundance of species in this paper one community evolutionary stability theory was proposed and a diversity theory of terrestrial plant communities limited by water resources was established during the process of community evolution resources are allocated among species tilman 1982 van et al 2017 and the best water resource allocation strategy was achieved through interspecies and intraspecies competition and interactions with the environment this results in the most suitable community high efficiency and stability under the community evolutionary stability water resource allocation strategy the species abundance curves and species area curves were derived using information on niche differentiation which are also important in the diversity theory mcgill 2010 by utilizing the derivation and verification of this model this theory of evolutionary stability can be applied to the theory of community diversity in this paper the quantitative relationship between hydrological niche and plant diversity in water limited ecosystems was also given which provided an example of hydrological niche and neutral diversity integration based on the evolutionary stability theory this new example not only unifies and expands the existing theories of community evolutionary diversity but also embodies differentiation factors of community water ecology in community diversity the introduction of the hydrological niche into the evolutionary theory of plant diversity provided an important example for understanding how environmental water resource changes affect diversity which will help to further understand how stable plant communities change with the environment and promote the integration of niche theory and evolutionary theory to the best of our knowledge we matched the species area curves obtained by different diversity theories and linked the different diversity theories to explain the community biodiversity for the first time the water resources involved in this model are the available water resources for the plant community instead of the total amount of water resources in a region this paper used the community in a water limited ecosystem as an example primarily to facilitate an understanding of the relevant concepts such as the maximization of the available water resource utilization efficiency of the plant community and an evolutionary stable community based on water resource utilization in fact in wet areas or those areas with abundant water resources plants have evolved water loving characteristics and the total amount of available water resources is essentially fixed hence the available water resources are closely related to plant growth and distribution the slightest change in water resources in time and space is an important limiting factor for plant growth eagleson 2005 silvertown 2015 garcía baquero 2016 harrison et al 2015 therefore the plant diversity model of the hydrological niche in this paper is applicable both in arid and wet

24417,recently much effort has been expended to improve species distribution models sdms particularly for use in systematic conservation planning as they affect the arrangement and effectiveness of spatial prioritization protocol definition to create smds is a real and complex problem faced to protect threatened environments in large megadiverse areas such as the amazon basin we compare spatial prioritizations based on different protocols to generate general and specific models of multiple taxa while in general protocols we use only bioclimatic variables in specific protocols we also added different environmental variables that are more appropriate to the sets of related species our results show greater precision and less commission error in the final models adjusted with specific protocols especially for aquatic species with the inclusion of hydrological variables we also demonstrate that modeling choices can play an important role in determining the priority of a region with prioritization of different areas depending on the models adjusted based on general and specific protocols we argue that niche models for multi taxon prioritization studies should be more efficient when based on choices that capture the ecological requirements of different taxonomic groups keywords species distribution models systematic conservation planning commission errors multitaxon approach hydrological variable 1 introduction the geographic distribution is one of the most important properties of ecological species for both understanding its threats and acting toward its conservation range size is usually an important predictor of species threat under iucn red listing protocols keith et al 2018 mace et al 2008 but the actual distribution of species is also a good predictor of its exposure to the most important spatially structured threats such as land use change and invasive species dawson et al 2011 de marco et al 2020 moreover the occurrence of a species in each site is also an important clue to understand its environmental limits in relation to abiotic factors and its interaction within assembled communities normand et al 2009 pellissier et al 2010 thus it is not surprising the high effort of the scientific community to develop and improve existing tools to better describe and predict this property and its variation among species currently the ecological niche models species distribution models enm sdm framework is stablished as an efficient set of procedures to estimate species distribution based on occurrence records and environmental predictors araújo et al 2019 elith and leathwick 2009 as a consequence sdms play an important role as a tool to estimate conservation value or conservation costs to build successful protected areas networks rondinini et al 2006 for instance many recent systematic conservation planning scp studies use sdms as part of the process of defining spatial prioritization lehtomäki et al 2019 lentini and wintle 2015 velazco et al 2020 its use represents an advance in recognition of conservation values costs by informing a gradient of suitability instead of only species presence absence despite the potential of sdms to support decisions related to the establishment of conservation actions their influence on scp solutions deserves attention because they can affect both the effectiveness and the arrangement of spatial priorities guisan et al 2013 velazco et al 2020 the obvious most important issue is the number of unique records which is related to the existing bias in our knowledge about the real ecological niche of the species bystriakova et al 2012 guillera arroita et al 2015 pearson et al 2007 it is also anticipated an interaction between this variable and spatial autocorrelation and prevalence also known to affect ecological models dormann et al 2007 lawson et al 2014 record et al 2013 one of the most important issues usually related to the accessibility problem barve et al 2011 based on the bam diagram of soberón 2007 is the dispersal capacity and historical accessibility of the species lower dispersal capacity or effective spatial barriers may prevent the species to access suitable areas and cause large overprediction in species distribution models mendes et al 2020 which has repercussions while setting conservation priorities velazco et al 2020 otherwise modelling species using different ecosystems from terrestrial systems freshwater or marine systems demands the use of different sets of environmental variables nevertheless the large majority of studies stick to bioclimatic variables derived from worldclim to model species distributions in spite of a recent effort to include environmental variables better suited to the set of species under study domisch et al 2013 velazco et al 2017 the list of species attributes may be even larger but the big picture is that species intrinsic properties may affect the results on the bright side there is a large set of solutions in the literature to respond to each of those problems andrade et al 2020 in the different spc tools the spatial representation of conservation targets is among the main input layers being sensitive to aspects of sdms such as predictor variables and model uncertainties la marca et al 2019 lemes and loyola 2013 nevertheless a cursory view of the recent conservation literature will show that most published studies use a common set of parameters and most important the same set of predictor variables to model all species de marco et al 2020 dyderski et al 2018 fortini et al 2015 we would like to explain this pattern mostly by the difference between those studies and the actual exercises conservation practitioners do when responding to real demands in environmental agencies across the world those academic studies usually focus on a single set of conservation targets de marco et al 2020 dyderski et al 2018 fortini et al 2015 while conservation practitioners need to select a wide range of targets to realistic cover the consequences of spatially defined threats consider for instance the prim shortcut for plano de redução de impactos sobre a biodiversidade a program to mitigate biodiversity threats initiative in brazil icmbio 2018a or the programs to identify conservation priorities and assess impacts in new south wales australia kujala et al 2015 in southern finland lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 and madagascar kremen et al 2008 all examples deal with localized impacts and require a large variety of conservation targets to make sense of the heterogeneity present in the system furthermore spatial prioritizations for conservation are even more challenging in mega diverse environments due to its greater complexity and biological diversity and there is an urgent necessity for large geographic extensions under increasing human activities such as the amazon in order to reduce the net loss of biodiversity fajardo et al 2014 foley et al 2014 thus it is imperative to select a large set of conservation targets to function as ecological indicators to those changes and conveniently measure possible impacts under these conditions an interesting problem faced by practitioners of the enm sdm approach is how to establish a modelling protocol that maximizes predictive accuracy and consequently improves the efficiency of spatial prioritization analysis a generalist protocol with general abiotic variables and disregarding restrictions to dispersal is the most common strategy in the literature muscatello et al 2021 velazco et al 2020 nevertheless when dealing with several taxa or species with different ecological requirements it is expected that species specific tunning will depend on available life history and ecological knowledge of species which is far from complete in many species rich countries diniz filho et al 2010 freitas et al 2021 therefore it is unlikely that a general protocol will accurately represent the different ecological responses of distinct taxonomic groups and different protocols must be built to respond for species particularities here we test the hypothesis that spatial prioritizations based on models generated from specific protocols better capture the variety of ecological niches present in megadiverse ecosystems and are more efficient in defining areas with greater conservation value maximum complementarity of targets absence of net loss of biodiversity and lower cost smaller geographic extension to test this hypothesis we compared two spatial prioritizations using different modeling protocols target species were selected according to a well defined real conservation problem the identification of infra structure and economic development projects that threaten amazonian biodiversity hence those targets also reflect common limitations that decision makers face at least in tropical areas for instance a low number of records and incomplete knowledge of ecological traits may limit the number of species that actually may act as conservation targets obviously realism may hinder generality but we argue that those conditions reflect the kind or problem faced by environmental agencies worldwide and the general patterns observed in many species rich areas of tropical systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 categories of conservation targets as conservation targets we selected 50 fauna species with spatial distribution in the amazon basin sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation impacts the selection of conservation targets that are necessarily sensitive to the threat vector with the potential to increase their risk of extinction when exposed to environmental impacts and that should also function as indicators of biodiversity is an important step in determining priority areas for conservation in our work we define as conservation targets endangered fauna species and migratory species which require the conservation of habitats and the availability of food resources in disarticulated areas in order to survive although not all conservation targets are endemic to the amazon region they were included because they represent species that although widely distributed require conservation actions that aim to protect important samples of populations or specific resources in that area species were categorized according to habitat terrestrial or aquatic behavior migratory or non migratory and the availability of occurrence records 30 and than 30 unique records table 1 we used occurrence records compiled and validated by researchers at icmbio in the process of assessing the risk of extinction of brazilian fauna icmbio 2018b or data sources available on the website of the global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org for species in the amazon basin that do not occur in brazil the selected species have different evolutionary histories including representatives of groups such as mammalia aves reptile amphibia actinopterygii and chondrichthyes 2 2 theory calculation 2 2 1 general protocol the choice of environmental data is central in species distribution exercises our general protocol uses the most common choice of the 19 bioclimatic variables available in the worldclim website http www worldclim org fick and hijmans 2017 additionally to include a description of important topographic components we ve incorporated both slope and flow accumulation derived from gtopo https rda ucar edu datasets ds758 0 the spatial extent of the species distribution was limited to the neotropical region to ensure the use of all available occurrence data and assume that this restriction is a good approximation of our species accessible area considering their evolutionary history barve et al 2011 we used both climatic and topographic variables at a resolution of 9 25 km² this resolution reduces the spatial autocorrelation of original variables while also minimizes the effects of biological interactions on determining species distribution hortal et al 2010 we used a principal component analysis pca to reduce variable multicollinearity and derive new uncorrelated variables we used as new variables for model fitting the first six axes of the pca which accounts for 96 1 of the original variation table s4 details about of collinearity issues in de marco and nóbrega 2018 we used four different modelling algorithms to fit models support vector machine svm guo et al 2005 random forests rdf prasad et al 2006 maxent using only linear and quadratic features mxs anderson and gonzalez 2011 phillips et al 2017 and gausian bayesian gau golding and purse 2016 those algorithms were chosen to encompass different theoretical basis for suitability estimatives and are widely applicable in species distribution modelling e g velazco et al 2019 lemes et al 2019 ingram et al 2020 beeman et al 2021 sillero et al 2021 rdf fits multiple regression trees and uses an ensemble of the best trees to produce a final suitability map rdf was ajdusted using the function tunerf in the package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 we used 1000 trees in the tunning process with a step factor of two for inflaction or deflaction in the number of variables sampled as candidates at each split svm is a machine learning algorithm that estimates suitability by finding the best hyperplane that discriminates presences from pseudo absences we fitted svm using the function ksvm of the package kernlab karatzoglou et al 2004 which consists of a c classification svm with a cost of constrain violation of value one with a gaussian kernel mxs is based on the principle of maximum entropy which maximizes the distance between the environmental density of the occurrences and the background we fitted mxs using the function maxnet of the package maxnet phillips 2021 and used linear and quadratic features with default values for regularization gau uses gaussian processes to fit complex response functions which are smoothed using different function and methods we used the graf function from the graf package to fit gau golding 2017 and used the laplace approximation as smooth function for models that require absence data svm rdf and gau we created pseudo absences in the same number of occurrence data and avoided allocating pseudo absences in areas climatically similar to those in which species are registered to occur engler et al 2004 for mxs we sampled 10000 random points throughout the whole extent to act as background to reduce algorithm uncertainty we created an ensemble model with the average suitability of algorithms that had jaccard values above the average jaccard for each species avoiding the inclusion of models generated from algorithms with poor predictions in the final model velazco et al 2019 we reduced overprediction by incorporating distance constraints to our suitability predictions mendes et al 2020 in this procedure the suitability maps are binarized and split into suitable patches which represents a set of connected suitable pixels we kept in our results only those patches in which species presence is registered and removed suitable patches with no occurrence data as they might be climatically suitable but not occupied by the species due to barriers created by climatically unsuitable areas we used two different methods to partition species data for model evaluation for species with a large amount of data 30 unique occurrences we geographically partitioned species occurrence data in two groups using a checkerboard andrade et al 2020 this method creates two occurrences subsets and each one is used to fit the model and also acts as an evaluation subset for the model fitted using the other group of occurrences for species with few occurrence data 30 unique occurrences we randomly partitioned the occurrence dataset selecting 70 of the data for fitting the models and 30 for evaluation this procedure is replicated 10 times in order to capture the variability caused by the random sample the whole modelling procedure was conducted using the r package enmtml andrade et al 2020 2 2 2 specific protocols in order to capture the specific characteristics of a set of species we changed the general protocol to develop specific modelling protocols for the different taxonomic groups in which we used different environmental variables or methods to control for overprediction and contrasted those predictions against models fitted using the general protocol table 2 terrestrial non migratory mammals retained the same protocol as described in the general protocol using only bioclimatic and topographic variables and accounting for overprediction by considering suitability patches migratory birds are not permanent residents of the country with some species residing temporarily in specific coastal areas in order to capture this pattern for migratory species we ve included predictors that account for the location of commonly used coastal features such as dunes beaches distance to the coast restinga habitats and lagoons again we derived principal components for bioclimatic topographic and coastal features variables combined and used 13 axes that account for 95 94 of the total variation table s5 finally models for freshwater species were developed using environmental layers specific for the freshwater environment from the hydroatlas database linke et al 2019 we selected 31 variables that carry information about the hydrology and hydrography of watersheds its physiography climate and soils and geology with information at the level of pfafstetter basins level 6 table s1 we once more derived principal components from those variables and used the first sixteen axis which account for 96 27 of the total variation table s6 for freshwater species we ve also used a different method to account for overprediction since the methods used for terrestrial species may select two rivers that are not directly connected which causes the inclusion of rivers in which the species is actually absent therefore for freshwater species we ve developed a method that accounts for watershed connectivity when accounting for overprediction and select only those basins which are suitable and downstream from species registered occurrence 2 2 3 spatial conservation prioritization two spatial conservation prioritizations scp were performed based on species distribution maps contrasting general and specific protocols using zonation software vs 4 0 moilanen et al 2014 we used the core area zonation caz removal rule caz emphasizes the selection of high quality habitat areas for the rarest species and the retention of central areas for all species even at the expense of cost efficiency moilanen 2007 velazco et al 2020 in both prioritizations all conservation targets received the same weight wj 1 0 and therefore were considered to have the same conservation priority we have adopted planning units with a spatial layer formed by a mosaic of hydrographic basins level 5 venticinque et al 2016 and protected areas icmbio 2019 mma 2019 unep wcmc 2020 when a planning unit layer is used all grid cells occurring within a planning unit are removed and ranked at the same time rather than the cell by cell ranking also a hierarchical mask i e protected areas was not used in the analyzes the mask identifies areas that must be retained and classified only after all other areas have been classified thus ensuring that they have higher priority lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 the spatial representation of the landscape condition summarizes how the different classes of land cover affect the maintenance of terrestrial and aquatic conservation targets with weights assigned according to the targets response leathwick et al 2010 factors that positively influence the distribution of targets were considered remnants of natural vegetation and protected areas and negatively due to anthropogenic disturbances hydroelectric dams agriculture mining roads power lines railways waterways artificial wetlands urban area source of data described in the supplementary material table 3 during the zonation processing each conservation target layer was multiplied by the corresponding landscape condition layer aquatic or terrestrial adjusting the original distribution according to the habitat integrity we analyzed the results from two zonation outputs priority rank map and performance curves the priority rank is linearly scaled through the landscape to the interval 0 1 and we compared pairwise priority ranking values of cells of the two ranks performance curves quantify the proportion of the original occurrences remaining for each feature when successively smaller fractions of the landscape remain for conservation lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 thus they indicate the remaining proportion of the distribution of the species in priority conservation areas we investigated these performance curves for all species and habitat subgroups aquatic and terrestrial and they were considered different when the confidence intervals did not overlap between groups 2 2 4 analytical procedures we applied a threshold that maximizes the jaccard index which is derived from the confusion matrix leroy et al 2018 this will be referred hereafter as jaccard threshold although there are other ways to derive range size we choose simply to use the estimate derived from the thresholding of the suitability map after controlling for overprediction these estimates are simpler and frequently used in practical studies of conservation biology marcer et al 2013 pena et al 2014 syfert et al 2014 moreover they represent known methodological constraints related to omission and commission errors that will be useful to evaluate the factors affecting model performance we have evaluated models by their jaccard index leroy et al 2018 jaccard is less sensitive to prevalence a recurrent problem in commonly used evaluation metrics for enm studies leroy et al 2018 including the more commonly used area under the curve auc lobo et al 2008 and true skill statistics tss allouche et al 2006 it is a common practice in enms to use suitability patterns to discuss practical applications in a given area fagundes et al 2015 faleiro et al 2013 loyola et al 2008 while a set of our species is not exclusive to the amazon region given the number of endemic species and the biome relevance it is common to discuss conservation actions specific to the biome therefore we evaluated our model s accuracy within this region for that we created random points within the amazon to act as absence data for evaluation nevertheless we put a large warning sign over the common evaluations based on the estimation of overprediction all available methods are based on the use of pseudoabsence data distributed over the target area as random pseudoabsences are exactly what it says false absences they may fail to represent true absences which may include an error in the estimation of the overprediction rate 3 results 3 1 models in general e specific protocols as models for terrestrial non migratory species were fitted following only the general protocol we present here differences in enm evaluation only for terrestrial migratory and aquatic species and present jaccard index values for all species in the supplementary material table s2 models fitted following the general or specific protocols had significant differences in the predicted suitability pattern for both aquatic and migratory terrestrial species fig 1 this difference was more evident for restricted migratory species such as tringa semipalmata fig 1 top left calidris pusilla and numenius hudsonicus fig s1 and widely distributed aquatic species such as crenicichla johanna fig 1 top right podocnemis expansa and trichechus inuguis fig s1 on the other side the difference was less evident for terrestrial migratory species not restricted to the coast such as prognes subis fig 1 lower left actitis macularius and rynchops niger fig s1 and restricted aquatic species pimelodus stewartii fig 1 lower right scobinancistrus aureatus and hypancistrus zebra fig s1 this effect was reflected in the jaccard comparison between frameworks fig 1 center with widely distributed migratory species having similar jaccard values for both general and specific frameworks and restricted aquatic species achieving better jaccard index in the general framework nevertheless a much larger set of species reached better jaccard index when models were created following the specific protocol which resulted in an overall improvement of the specific protocol in comparison to the general one paired t test t 3 021 p 0 05 specific protocols generate higher omission rates fig 2 a paired t test t 2 702 p 0 05 and lower commission rates fig 2c paired t test t 4 298 p 0 05 than general protocol nevertheless there is a strong dependence of the commission rate on the estimated prevalence which is not observable for omission rates there is a large variability in the omission prevalence and commission prevalence plots in the x axis which evidences that model fitted following the general protocol resulted in broader suitability predictions larger omission rates observed in the specific protocol fig 2b are entirely related to aquatic species fig 2a and could be a direct consequence of its prevalence this occurs at least in part due to the larger effect of a single occurrence data in species with a small number of records thus the omission rate estimation is affected by large sampling effects commission errors for aquatic species on the other hand were much lower using the specific protocol framework fig 2c mostly due to the general protocol broader suitability predictions terrestrial migratory species had much smaller differences among protocols with very similar omission rates fig 2a and a slightly higher commission rate for restricted species when following the general protocol fig 2c 3 2 prioritization comparison 3 2 1 spatial conservation prioritization our results revealed that there was a difference in spatial prioritization generated by general and specific protocols the areas in common with the two priorities with a high conservation value comprise only 17 1 267 432 km² of the amazon basin fig 3 in the general protocol prioritization the highest conservation values predominated in the eastern amazon region and in the northern portion of the western amazon whereas the hierarchy the landscape resulting from the specific protocol was better distributed in the study area the differential of this last prioritization is the longitudinal configuration close to aquatic environments as observed between the madeira river and the llanos de moxos plain northern bolivia with the connectivity between the different regions favored by the intermediate values of importance for conservation in the threshold between 0 5 and 0 75 in contrast the lower environmental suitability values overlap in the priorities in 1 186 636 km² 16 of the amazon basin shared spatially in the andean region which can be explained by the distribution of the selected species as a conservation target we also observed as a result of the prioritization of the specific protocols a concentration of these areas in the southeastern region of the brazilian amazon called the arc of deforestation unlike the results for the simple protocol located mainly in the central west region of the brazilian amazon thus the spatial distribution of the higher conservation values of the prioritization derived from the specific protocol 0 5 suggests that the addition of more environmental variables and geographic information predicting sdms such as those used in this study coastal features connectivity between basins hydrology hydrography of watersheds and their physiography climate soils and geology and spatial restriction methods are able to predict more environmentally suitable regions for species maintenance when compared to methods that use only bioclimatic variables 3 2 2 zonation curves comparison prioritizations should be compared considering the amount of species distribution protected in the landscape the prioritization scenario generated from specific protocols covered a better representation of the conservation features distribution the general protocol approach on the other hand reduced the mean representation of the fauna distribution when protecting 0 to 60 of landscape areas fig 4 b considering the realistic interval between 0 and 20 of protected landscape the prioritization solution under the specific protocols showed a greater coverage of aquatic species range than the general protocol fig 4c for migratory birds the specific protocols prioritization solution also showed a higher proportion of species range when protecting lower percentages of landscape than the general protocol although with the highest confidence interval fig 4d for terrestrial species there was no difference because it was applied only the general protocol using the same bioclimatic and topographic variables so both curves are the same fig 4e when considering all species together in the scenario of 0 20 protected areas network the specific protocols prioritization were able to retain a higher proportion of all species range fig 4b when considering the unattainable scenario of protecting 80 to 100 of the amazon region there is no difference in the protocols because both prioritizations were able to embrace the entirely distributions of all species even when evaluating groups freshwater migratory birds and terrestrial separately fig 4a however the difference in the performance s prioritizations became evident in more plausible protecting scenarios this result suggests that when the conservation goals in terms of protected landscapes areas are lower than 60 the prioritization solution derived from specific sdm protocols were more efficient in protecting covering species distribution ranges especially for aquatic species 4 discussion biodiversity representation is a challenge for researchers especially in highly diverse tropical regions which presents high levels of linnean and wallacean shortfalls and strong sampling bias bini et al 2006 cornwell et al 2019 oliveira et al 2016 this fact by itself makes it unlikely that a general protocol would suffice for representing all species we demonstrate that modelling choices might play a major role in determining the priority of an area or region systematic conservation planning spc was developed with the purpose of aiding stakeholders with a decision making protocol for conservation cowling and pressey 2003 margules and pressey 2000 with that in mind it is imperative to consider that applied biodiversity conservation decisions are generally multi taxa which have different ecological requirements and responses fattorini et al 2011 yong et al 2018 therefore models fitted using a general protocol for all species appointed different basin priority when contrasted to models fitted using specific protocols for the different taxonomic groups selecting predictors following species biology is not a new topic in niche models fourcade et al 2018 however this strategy is commonly restricted to studies which encompassed a low number of species velazco et al 2017 for which there is a decent level of knowledge porfirio et al 2014 we advocate that niche models for multi taxa prioritization studies must be based upon choices that capture the ecological requirements of the different taxonomic groups in our study selecting predictors and spatial restriction driven by taxonomy had strong impact in prioritization results achieving a more efficient prioritization especially for aquatic species fig 4 and an overall difference for the amazon region fig 3 the use of specific protocols improve the prediction of species distribution by incorporating better descriptors of the habitats they occupy we demonstrated greater precision in the final models with the use of basinatlas linke et al 2019 variables in a high spatial resolution 1km with emphasis on the models of aquatic species that better reflect the longitudinal connectivity of the river network and indicate greater suitability in the areas overlapping the drainage networks and less in terrestrial portions of the basin in our study hydrological variables were added to climatic physiographic soil and geological variables to model aquatic species which were often modeled with the same climatic and physical variables used to model terrestrial species frederico et al 2014 mcgarvey et al 2018 parreira et al 2019 with lower resolutions which can considerably expand the expected potential distribution area likewise the specific protocol includes coastal features to model migratory species and species associated to marine coastal habitats this may reduce commission errors for coastal migratory species while not overfitting when migratory species were widely distributed on the continent considering that the successful use of sdms in conservation planning requires that the model s predictions are accurate and able to identify places of high suitability for a species guisan et al 2006 we emphasize that commission errors have important implications for the establishment of conservation strategies as they lead to the selection of non relevant areas affecting the representativeness and adequacy of the reserves network rondinini et al 2006 velazco et al 2020 more important the most critical aspect of setting species conservation priorities is the engagement process of all political actors demanding complex agreements among different stakeholders adams et al 2019 mcintosh 2019 commission errors reduce the confidence of the specialists in the tool additionally commission errors could be are used by economic actors to dismiss the conservation efforts in the opposite direction the use of more conservative models can make conservationist actions more effective especially given the current scenarios that demands an urgency in conservation measures with scarce resources we also emphasize that in the construction of appropriate sdms to guide conservation actions the alignment between theoretical issues and practical experience should be more promising as it is essential for modelers to better understand the conservation decision process while managers must provide feedback to modelers about the actual use of sdms guisan et al 2013 the comparative curves of the proportion of species range within the protected areas network consolidates our idea that efforts to prioritize areas for conservation cannot neglect the quality of information on the distribution of conservation targets our spatial prioritization scheme for conservation based on specific protocols is more robust because it protects a more significant portion of the species distribution at lower costs than that generated by general protocols once again the difference is even more explicit when comparing the curves of aquatic species prioritization efforts have been done in order to identify important areas for achieving biodiversity conservation goals in several ecosystems kremen et al 2008 lehtomäki et al 2019 vilar 2020 using however a single general protocol to model several species distribution in their prioritization methods other studies have discussed the general effects of changes in sdms parameters increasing the incongruity of selected areas by spatial prioritizations mainly influenced by the control of sampling bias the application of binary limits muscatello et al 2021 the restriction methods and the geographic extent velazco et al 2020 however none of them suggested the inclusion of specific sdm protocols selecting environmental variables and spatial restriction according to the biological demands of each species thus instead of just diagnosing the effects of changes in the sdms parameters we advocate that the integrated use of specific sdm protocols with spatial prioritization optimize the cost benefit gains for conservation as a result the use of specific protocols captures a better coverage of species distribution in the proposed protected area in a realistic scenario of a lower conservation cost 0 20 of the protected landscape scp is commonly based on biodiversity substitutes belonging to a specific taxon group often defined based on data availability ease of mapping or accumulated knowledge for the taxon rodrigues and brooks 2007 the areas prioritization based on the distribution of a small set of taxa does not always represent the complexity of the practical issues faced by environmental managers who sometimes need to find solutions that protect species with different evolutionary histories or different taxonomic groups sensitive to the same impact prioritizing conservation for different taxa is therefore probably a more efficient way of capturing biodiversity patterns and promoting the persistence of most species kremen et al 2008 allowing the proposition of more effective conservation actions in comparison with a single species prioritization or a single taxonomic group in terms of environmental management the multi tax approach help systematizing information on the different targets affected establishing a direct relationship between sensitive species and impacts and proposing more holistic and prioritized conservation strategies this may also facilitate to accommodate the needs of different stakeholders involved favoring engagement and improve the social perception of the process which is considered the most critical problem of scp implementation to simulate real conservation issues we used the amazon basin as an example to compare how distribution models influence prioritization output this approach reinforces the complexity of choosing conservation targets from a scp perspective specific protocols can be built for any similar ecosystem that requires urgent protection measures in this study the region s biodiversity is strongly associated with aquatic ecosystems and the priorities resulting from the two protocols have not been convergent despite the existence of a wide network of protected areas encompassing approximately 25 of the region icmbio 2019 mma 2019 unep wcmc 2020 most of them were not defined to protect aquatic environments and new proposals must be assertive in identifying areas of high conservation value excluded from the network fagundes et al 2018 frederico et al 2014 extrapolating this consideration to other ecosystems prioritization analyzes must pay attention to the particularities of conservation targets to find truly effective solutions although the definition of different groups might seem challenging as it requires some level of biological knowledge about the different species we advocate that even a coarse definition as we performed in this study may lead to major improvements in the prioritization process finally it is also necessary to be aware of species with endemic populations or restricted distribution for which the use of multiple models may end up being very restrictive and result in omissions of populations in those situations the use of more general protocols which commonly result in broader predictions may be considered 5 conclusion models for decision making are a major challenge for researchers as real conservation situations often involve multiple taxa which may have quite different ecological requirements correlative distribution models derive species biological requirements from the data a property that is responsible for their wide applicability but it demands caution when using those models for decision making as the capability of those models to produce realistic and biologic meaningful predictions varies widely depending on the species ecological niche consequently further analysis that use those models as input such as the popular spatial prioritization for conservation are also impacted by this property especially in mega diverse highly complex geographically extensive and threatened environments therefore the applicability of those models for decision making demands more consideration towards the biological specificities of the species which often results in different models for a species or group of species conservation is a social political economic biological discussion which means that the multiple agents have different demands and knowledge about the system and consequently a conservation effort success is directly related to how

24417,recently much effort has been expended to improve species distribution models sdms particularly for use in systematic conservation planning as they affect the arrangement and effectiveness of spatial prioritization protocol definition to create smds is a real and complex problem faced to protect threatened environments in large megadiverse areas such as the amazon basin we compare spatial prioritizations based on different protocols to generate general and specific models of multiple taxa while in general protocols we use only bioclimatic variables in specific protocols we also added different environmental variables that are more appropriate to the sets of related species our results show greater precision and less commission error in the final models adjusted with specific protocols especially for aquatic species with the inclusion of hydrological variables we also demonstrate that modeling choices can play an important role in determining the priority of a region with prioritization of different areas depending on the models adjusted based on general and specific protocols we argue that niche models for multi taxon prioritization studies should be more efficient when based on choices that capture the ecological requirements of different taxonomic groups keywords species distribution models systematic conservation planning commission errors multitaxon approach hydrological variable 1 introduction the geographic distribution is one of the most important properties of ecological species for both understanding its threats and acting toward its conservation range size is usually an important predictor of species threat under iucn red listing protocols keith et al 2018 mace et al 2008 but the actual distribution of species is also a good predictor of its exposure to the most important spatially structured threats such as land use change and invasive species dawson et al 2011 de marco et al 2020 moreover the occurrence of a species in each site is also an important clue to understand its environmental limits in relation to abiotic factors and its interaction within assembled communities normand et al 2009 pellissier et al 2010 thus it is not surprising the high effort of the scientific community to develop and improve existing tools to better describe and predict this property and its variation among species currently the ecological niche models species distribution models enm sdm framework is stablished as an efficient set of procedures to estimate species distribution based on occurrence records and environmental predictors araújo et al 2019 elith and leathwick 2009 as a consequence sdms play an important role as a tool to estimate conservation value or conservation costs to build successful protected areas networks rondinini et al 2006 for instance many recent systematic conservation planning scp studies use sdms as part of the process of defining spatial prioritization lehtomäki et al 2019 lentini and wintle 2015 velazco et al 2020 its use represents an advance in recognition of conservation values costs by informing a gradient of suitability instead of only species presence absence despite the potential of sdms to support decisions related to the establishment of conservation actions their influence on scp solutions deserves attention because they can affect both the effectiveness and the arrangement of spatial priorities guisan et al 2013 velazco et al 2020 the obvious most important issue is the number of unique records which is related to the existing bias in our knowledge about the real ecological niche of the species bystriakova et al 2012 guillera arroita et al 2015 pearson et al 2007 it is also anticipated an interaction between this variable and spatial autocorrelation and prevalence also known to affect ecological models dormann et al 2007 lawson et al 2014 record et al 2013 one of the most important issues usually related to the accessibility problem barve et al 2011 based on the bam diagram of soberón 2007 is the dispersal capacity and historical accessibility of the species lower dispersal capacity or effective spatial barriers may prevent the species to access suitable areas and cause large overprediction in species distribution models mendes et al 2020 which has repercussions while setting conservation priorities velazco et al 2020 otherwise modelling species using different ecosystems from terrestrial systems freshwater or marine systems demands the use of different sets of environmental variables nevertheless the large majority of studies stick to bioclimatic variables derived from worldclim to model species distributions in spite of a recent effort to include environmental variables better suited to the set of species under study domisch et al 2013 velazco et al 2017 the list of species attributes may be even larger but the big picture is that species intrinsic properties may affect the results on the bright side there is a large set of solutions in the literature to respond to each of those problems andrade et al 2020 in the different spc tools the spatial representation of conservation targets is among the main input layers being sensitive to aspects of sdms such as predictor variables and model uncertainties la marca et al 2019 lemes and loyola 2013 nevertheless a cursory view of the recent conservation literature will show that most published studies use a common set of parameters and most important the same set of predictor variables to model all species de marco et al 2020 dyderski et al 2018 fortini et al 2015 we would like to explain this pattern mostly by the difference between those studies and the actual exercises conservation practitioners do when responding to real demands in environmental agencies across the world those academic studies usually focus on a single set of conservation targets de marco et al 2020 dyderski et al 2018 fortini et al 2015 while conservation practitioners need to select a wide range of targets to realistic cover the consequences of spatially defined threats consider for instance the prim shortcut for plano de redução de impactos sobre a biodiversidade a program to mitigate biodiversity threats initiative in brazil icmbio 2018a or the programs to identify conservation priorities and assess impacts in new south wales australia kujala et al 2015 in southern finland lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 and madagascar kremen et al 2008 all examples deal with localized impacts and require a large variety of conservation targets to make sense of the heterogeneity present in the system furthermore spatial prioritizations for conservation are even more challenging in mega diverse environments due to its greater complexity and biological diversity and there is an urgent necessity for large geographic extensions under increasing human activities such as the amazon in order to reduce the net loss of biodiversity fajardo et al 2014 foley et al 2014 thus it is imperative to select a large set of conservation targets to function as ecological indicators to those changes and conveniently measure possible impacts under these conditions an interesting problem faced by practitioners of the enm sdm approach is how to establish a modelling protocol that maximizes predictive accuracy and consequently improves the efficiency of spatial prioritization analysis a generalist protocol with general abiotic variables and disregarding restrictions to dispersal is the most common strategy in the literature muscatello et al 2021 velazco et al 2020 nevertheless when dealing with several taxa or species with different ecological requirements it is expected that species specific tunning will depend on available life history and ecological knowledge of species which is far from complete in many species rich countries diniz filho et al 2010 freitas et al 2021 therefore it is unlikely that a general protocol will accurately represent the different ecological responses of distinct taxonomic groups and different protocols must be built to respond for species particularities here we test the hypothesis that spatial prioritizations based on models generated from specific protocols better capture the variety of ecological niches present in megadiverse ecosystems and are more efficient in defining areas with greater conservation value maximum complementarity of targets absence of net loss of biodiversity and lower cost smaller geographic extension to test this hypothesis we compared two spatial prioritizations using different modeling protocols target species were selected according to a well defined real conservation problem the identification of infra structure and economic development projects that threaten amazonian biodiversity hence those targets also reflect common limitations that decision makers face at least in tropical areas for instance a low number of records and incomplete knowledge of ecological traits may limit the number of species that actually may act as conservation targets obviously realism may hinder generality but we argue that those conditions reflect the kind or problem faced by environmental agencies worldwide and the general patterns observed in many species rich areas of tropical systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 categories of conservation targets as conservation targets we selected 50 fauna species with spatial distribution in the amazon basin sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation impacts the selection of conservation targets that are necessarily sensitive to the threat vector with the potential to increase their risk of extinction when exposed to environmental impacts and that should also function as indicators of biodiversity is an important step in determining priority areas for conservation in our work we define as conservation targets endangered fauna species and migratory species which require the conservation of habitats and the availability of food resources in disarticulated areas in order to survive although not all conservation targets are endemic to the amazon region they were included because they represent species that although widely distributed require conservation actions that aim to protect important samples of populations or specific resources in that area species were categorized according to habitat terrestrial or aquatic behavior migratory or non migratory and the availability of occurrence records 30 and than 30 unique records table 1 we used occurrence records compiled and validated by researchers at icmbio in the process of assessing the risk of extinction of brazilian fauna icmbio 2018b or data sources available on the website of the global biodiversity information facility gbif http www gbif org for species in the amazon basin that do not occur in brazil the selected species have different evolutionary histories including representatives of groups such as mammalia aves reptile amphibia actinopterygii and chondrichthyes 2 2 theory calculation 2 2 1 general protocol the choice of environmental data is central in species distribution exercises our general protocol uses the most common choice of the 19 bioclimatic variables available in the worldclim website http www worldclim org fick and hijmans 2017 additionally to include a description of important topographic components we ve incorporated both slope and flow accumulation derived from gtopo https rda ucar edu datasets ds758 0 the spatial extent of the species distribution was limited to the neotropical region to ensure the use of all available occurrence data and assume that this restriction is a good approximation of our species accessible area considering their evolutionary history barve et al 2011 we used both climatic and topographic variables at a resolution of 9 25 km² this resolution reduces the spatial autocorrelation of original variables while also minimizes the effects of biological interactions on determining species distribution hortal et al 2010 we used a principal component analysis pca to reduce variable multicollinearity and derive new uncorrelated variables we used as new variables for model fitting the first six axes of the pca which accounts for 96 1 of the original variation table s4 details about of collinearity issues in de marco and nóbrega 2018 we used four different modelling algorithms to fit models support vector machine svm guo et al 2005 random forests rdf prasad et al 2006 maxent using only linear and quadratic features mxs anderson and gonzalez 2011 phillips et al 2017 and gausian bayesian gau golding and purse 2016 those algorithms were chosen to encompass different theoretical basis for suitability estimatives and are widely applicable in species distribution modelling e g velazco et al 2019 lemes et al 2019 ingram et al 2020 beeman et al 2021 sillero et al 2021 rdf fits multiple regression trees and uses an ensemble of the best trees to produce a final suitability map rdf was ajdusted using the function tunerf in the package randomforest liaw and wiener 2002 we used 1000 trees in the tunning process with a step factor of two for inflaction or deflaction in the number of variables sampled as candidates at each split svm is a machine learning algorithm that estimates suitability by finding the best hyperplane that discriminates presences from pseudo absences we fitted svm using the function ksvm of the package kernlab karatzoglou et al 2004 which consists of a c classification svm with a cost of constrain violation of value one with a gaussian kernel mxs is based on the principle of maximum entropy which maximizes the distance between the environmental density of the occurrences and the background we fitted mxs using the function maxnet of the package maxnet phillips 2021 and used linear and quadratic features with default values for regularization gau uses gaussian processes to fit complex response functions which are smoothed using different function and methods we used the graf function from the graf package to fit gau golding 2017 and used the laplace approximation as smooth function for models that require absence data svm rdf and gau we created pseudo absences in the same number of occurrence data and avoided allocating pseudo absences in areas climatically similar to those in which species are registered to occur engler et al 2004 for mxs we sampled 10000 random points throughout the whole extent to act as background to reduce algorithm uncertainty we created an ensemble model with the average suitability of algorithms that had jaccard values above the average jaccard for each species avoiding the inclusion of models generated from algorithms with poor predictions in the final model velazco et al 2019 we reduced overprediction by incorporating distance constraints to our suitability predictions mendes et al 2020 in this procedure the suitability maps are binarized and split into suitable patches which represents a set of connected suitable pixels we kept in our results only those patches in which species presence is registered and removed suitable patches with no occurrence data as they might be climatically suitable but not occupied by the species due to barriers created by climatically unsuitable areas we used two different methods to partition species data for model evaluation for species with a large amount of data 30 unique occurrences we geographically partitioned species occurrence data in two groups using a checkerboard andrade et al 2020 this method creates two occurrences subsets and each one is used to fit the model and also acts as an evaluation subset for the model fitted using the other group of occurrences for species with few occurrence data 30 unique occurrences we randomly partitioned the occurrence dataset selecting 70 of the data for fitting the models and 30 for evaluation this procedure is replicated 10 times in order to capture the variability caused by the random sample the whole modelling procedure was conducted using the r package enmtml andrade et al 2020 2 2 2 specific protocols in order to capture the specific characteristics of a set of species we changed the general protocol to develop specific modelling protocols for the different taxonomic groups in which we used different environmental variables or methods to control for overprediction and contrasted those predictions against models fitted using the general protocol table 2 terrestrial non migratory mammals retained the same protocol as described in the general protocol using only bioclimatic and topographic variables and accounting for overprediction by considering suitability patches migratory birds are not permanent residents of the country with some species residing temporarily in specific coastal areas in order to capture this pattern for migratory species we ve included predictors that account for the location of commonly used coastal features such as dunes beaches distance to the coast restinga habitats and lagoons again we derived principal components for bioclimatic topographic and coastal features variables combined and used 13 axes that account for 95 94 of the total variation table s5 finally models for freshwater species were developed using environmental layers specific for the freshwater environment from the hydroatlas database linke et al 2019 we selected 31 variables that carry information about the hydrology and hydrography of watersheds its physiography climate and soils and geology with information at the level of pfafstetter basins level 6 table s1 we once more derived principal components from those variables and used the first sixteen axis which account for 96 27 of the total variation table s6 for freshwater species we ve also used a different method to account for overprediction since the methods used for terrestrial species may select two rivers that are not directly connected which causes the inclusion of rivers in which the species is actually absent therefore for freshwater species we ve developed a method that accounts for watershed connectivity when accounting for overprediction and select only those basins which are suitable and downstream from species registered occurrence 2 2 3 spatial conservation prioritization two spatial conservation prioritizations scp were performed based on species distribution maps contrasting general and specific protocols using zonation software vs 4 0 moilanen et al 2014 we used the core area zonation caz removal rule caz emphasizes the selection of high quality habitat areas for the rarest species and the retention of central areas for all species even at the expense of cost efficiency moilanen 2007 velazco et al 2020 in both prioritizations all conservation targets received the same weight wj 1 0 and therefore were considered to have the same conservation priority we have adopted planning units with a spatial layer formed by a mosaic of hydrographic basins level 5 venticinque et al 2016 and protected areas icmbio 2019 mma 2019 unep wcmc 2020 when a planning unit layer is used all grid cells occurring within a planning unit are removed and ranked at the same time rather than the cell by cell ranking also a hierarchical mask i e protected areas was not used in the analyzes the mask identifies areas that must be retained and classified only after all other areas have been classified thus ensuring that they have higher priority lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 the spatial representation of the landscape condition summarizes how the different classes of land cover affect the maintenance of terrestrial and aquatic conservation targets with weights assigned according to the targets response leathwick et al 2010 factors that positively influence the distribution of targets were considered remnants of natural vegetation and protected areas and negatively due to anthropogenic disturbances hydroelectric dams agriculture mining roads power lines railways waterways artificial wetlands urban area source of data described in the supplementary material table 3 during the zonation processing each conservation target layer was multiplied by the corresponding landscape condition layer aquatic or terrestrial adjusting the original distribution according to the habitat integrity we analyzed the results from two zonation outputs priority rank map and performance curves the priority rank is linearly scaled through the landscape to the interval 0 1 and we compared pairwise priority ranking values of cells of the two ranks performance curves quantify the proportion of the original occurrences remaining for each feature when successively smaller fractions of the landscape remain for conservation lehtomäki and moilanen 2013 thus they indicate the remaining proportion of the distribution of the species in priority conservation areas we investigated these performance curves for all species and habitat subgroups aquatic and terrestrial and they were considered different when the confidence intervals did not overlap between groups 2 2 4 analytical procedures we applied a threshold that maximizes the jaccard index which is derived from the confusion matrix leroy et al 2018 this will be referred hereafter as jaccard threshold although there are other ways to derive range size we choose simply to use the estimate derived from the thresholding of the suitability map after controlling for overprediction these estimates are simpler and frequently used in practical studies of conservation biology marcer et al 2013 pena et al 2014 syfert et al 2014 moreover they represent known methodological constraints related to omission and commission errors that will be useful to evaluate the factors affecting model performance we have evaluated models by their jaccard index leroy et al 2018 jaccard is less sensitive to prevalence a recurrent problem in commonly used evaluation metrics for enm studies leroy et al 2018 including the more commonly used area under the curve auc lobo et al 2008 and true skill statistics tss allouche et al 2006 it is a common practice in enms to use suitability patterns to discuss practical applications in a given area fagundes et al 2015 faleiro et al 2013 loyola et al 2008 while a set of our species is not exclusive to the amazon region given the number of endemic species and the biome relevance it is common to discuss conservation actions specific to the biome therefore we evaluated our model s accuracy within this region for that we created random points within the amazon to act as absence data for evaluation nevertheless we put a large warning sign over the common evaluations based on the estimation of overprediction all available methods are based on the use of pseudoabsence data distributed over the target area as random pseudoabsences are exactly what it says false absences they may fail to represent true absences which may include an error in the estimation of the overprediction rate 3 results 3 1 models in general e specific protocols as models for terrestrial non migratory species were fitted following only the general protocol we present here differences in enm evaluation only for terrestrial migratory and aquatic species and present jaccard index values for all species in the supplementary material table s2 models fitted following the general or specific protocols had significant differences in the predicted suitability pattern for both aquatic and migratory terrestrial species fig 1 this difference was more evident for restricted migratory species such as tringa semipalmata fig 1 top left calidris pusilla and numenius hudsonicus fig s1 and widely distributed aquatic species such as crenicichla johanna fig 1 top right podocnemis expansa and trichechus inuguis fig s1 on the other side the difference was less evident for terrestrial migratory species not restricted to the coast such as prognes subis fig 1 lower left actitis macularius and rynchops niger fig s1 and restricted aquatic species pimelodus stewartii fig 1 lower right scobinancistrus aureatus and hypancistrus zebra fig s1 this effect was reflected in the jaccard comparison between frameworks fig 1 center with widely distributed migratory species having similar jaccard values for both general and specific frameworks and restricted aquatic species achieving better jaccard index in the general framework nevertheless a much larger set of species reached better jaccard index when models were created following the specific protocol which resulted in an overall improvement of the specific protocol in comparison to the general one paired t test t 3 021 p 0 05 specific protocols generate higher omission rates fig 2 a paired t test t 2 702 p 0 05 and lower commission rates fig 2c paired t test t 4 298 p 0 05 than general protocol nevertheless there is a strong dependence of the commission rate on the estimated prevalence which is not observable for omission rates there is a large variability in the omission prevalence and commission prevalence plots in the x axis which evidences that model fitted following the general protocol resulted in broader suitability predictions larger omission rates observed in the specific protocol fig 2b are entirely related to aquatic species fig 2a and could be a direct consequence of its prevalence this occurs at least in part due to the larger effect of a single occurrence data in species with a small number of records thus the omission rate estimation is affected by large sampling effects commission errors for aquatic species on the other hand were much lower using the specific protocol framework fig 2c mostly due to the general protocol broader suitability predictions terrestrial migratory species had much smaller differences among protocols with very similar omission rates fig 2a and a slightly higher commission rate for restricted species when following the general protocol fig 2c 3 2 prioritization comparison 3 2 1 spatial conservation prioritization our results revealed that there was a difference in spatial prioritization generated by general and specific protocols the areas in common with the two priorities with a high conservation value comprise only 17 1 267 432 km² of the amazon basin fig 3 in the general protocol prioritization the highest conservation values predominated in the eastern amazon region and in the northern portion of the western amazon whereas the hierarchy the landscape resulting from the specific protocol was better distributed in the study area the differential of this last prioritization is the longitudinal configuration close to aquatic environments as observed between the madeira river and the llanos de moxos plain northern bolivia with the connectivity between the different regions favored by the intermediate values of importance for conservation in the threshold between 0 5 and 0 75 in contrast the lower environmental suitability values overlap in the priorities in 1 186 636 km² 16 of the amazon basin shared spatially in the andean region which can be explained by the distribution of the selected species as a conservation target we also observed as a result of the prioritization of the specific protocols a concentration of these areas in the southeastern region of the brazilian amazon called the arc of deforestation unlike the results for the simple protocol located mainly in the central west region of the brazilian amazon thus the spatial distribution of the higher conservation values of the prioritization derived from the specific protocol 0 5 suggests that the addition of more environmental variables and geographic information predicting sdms such as those used in this study coastal features connectivity between basins hydrology hydrography of watersheds and their physiography climate soils and geology and spatial restriction methods are able to predict more environmentally suitable regions for species maintenance when compared to methods that use only bioclimatic variables 3 2 2 zonation curves comparison prioritizations should be compared considering the amount of species distribution protected in the landscape the prioritization scenario generated from specific protocols covered a better representation of the conservation features distribution the general protocol approach on the other hand reduced the mean representation of the fauna distribution when protecting 0 to 60 of landscape areas fig 4 b considering the realistic interval between 0 and 20 of protected landscape the prioritization solution under the specific protocols showed a greater coverage of aquatic species range than the general protocol fig 4c for migratory birds the specific protocols prioritization solution also showed a higher proportion of species range when protecting lower percentages of landscape than the general protocol although with the highest confidence interval fig 4d for terrestrial species there was no difference because it was applied only the general protocol using the same bioclimatic and topographic variables so both curves are the same fig 4e when considering all species together in the scenario of 0 20 protected areas network the specific protocols prioritization were able to retain a higher proportion of all species range fig 4b when considering the unattainable scenario of protecting 80 to 100 of the amazon region there is no difference in the protocols because both prioritizations were able to embrace the entirely distributions of all species even when evaluating groups freshwater migratory birds and terrestrial separately fig 4a however the difference in the performance s prioritizations became evident in more plausible protecting scenarios this result suggests that when the conservation goals in terms of protected landscapes areas are lower than 60 the prioritization solution derived from specific sdm protocols were more efficient in protecting covering species distribution ranges especially for aquatic species 4 discussion biodiversity representation is a challenge for researchers especially in highly diverse tropical regions which presents high levels of linnean and wallacean shortfalls and strong sampling bias bini et al 2006 cornwell et al 2019 oliveira et al 2016 this fact by itself makes it unlikely that a general protocol would suffice for representing all species we demonstrate that modelling choices might play a major role in determining the priority of an area or region systematic conservation planning spc was developed with the purpose of aiding stakeholders with a decision making protocol for conservation cowling and pressey 2003 margules and pressey 2000 with that in mind it is imperative to consider that applied biodiversity conservation decisions are generally multi taxa which have different ecological requirements and responses fattorini et al 2011 yong et al 2018 therefore models fitted using a general protocol for all species appointed different basin priority when contrasted to models fitted using specific protocols for the different taxonomic groups selecting predictors following species biology is not a new topic in niche models fourcade et al 2018 however this strategy is commonly restricted to studies which encompassed a low number of species velazco et al 2017 for which there is a decent level of knowledge porfirio et al 2014 we advocate that niche models for multi taxa prioritization studies must be based upon choices that capture the ecological requirements of the different taxonomic groups in our study selecting predictors and spatial restriction driven by taxonomy had strong impact in prioritization results achieving a more efficient prioritization especially for aquatic species fig 4 and an overall difference for the amazon region fig 3 the use of specific protocols improve the prediction of species distribution by incorporating better descriptors of the habitats they occupy we demonstrated greater precision in the final models with the use of basinatlas linke et al 2019 variables in a high spatial resolution 1km with emphasis on the models of aquatic species that better reflect the longitudinal connectivity of the river network and indicate greater suitability in the areas overlapping the drainage networks and less in terrestrial portions of the basin in our study hydrological variables were added to climatic physiographic soil and geological variables to model aquatic species which were often modeled with the same climatic and physical variables used to model terrestrial species frederico et al 2014 mcgarvey et al 2018 parreira et al 2019 with lower resolutions which can considerably expand the expected potential distribution area likewise the specific protocol includes coastal features to model migratory species and species associated to marine coastal habitats this may reduce commission errors for coastal migratory species while not overfitting when migratory species were widely distributed on the continent considering that the successful use of sdms in conservation planning requires that the model s predictions are accurate and able to identify places of high suitability for a species guisan et al 2006 we emphasize that commission errors have important implications for the establishment of conservation strategies as they lead to the selection of non relevant areas affecting the representativeness and adequacy of the reserves network rondinini et al 2006 velazco et al 2020 more important the most critical aspect of setting species conservation priorities is the engagement process of all political actors demanding complex agreements among different stakeholders adams et al 2019 mcintosh 2019 commission errors reduce the confidence of the specialists in the tool additionally commission errors could be are used by economic actors to dismiss the conservation efforts in the opposite direction the use of more conservative models can make conservationist actions more effective especially given the current scenarios that demands an urgency in conservation measures with scarce resources we also emphasize that in the construction of appropriate sdms to guide conservation actions the alignment between theoretical issues and practical experience should be more promising as it is essential for modelers to better understand the conservation decision process while managers must provide feedback to modelers about the actual use of sdms guisan et al 2013 the comparative curves of the proportion of species range within the protected areas network consolidates our idea that efforts to prioritize areas for conservation cannot neglect the quality of information on the distribution of conservation targets our spatial prioritization scheme for conservation based on specific protocols is more robust because it protects a more significant portion of the species distribution at lower costs than that generated by general protocols once again the difference is even more explicit when comparing the curves of aquatic species prioritization efforts have been done in order to identify important areas for achieving biodiversity conservation goals in several ecosystems kremen et al 2008 lehtomäki et al 2019 vilar 2020 using however a single general protocol to model several species distribution in their prioritization methods other studies have discussed the general effects of changes in sdms parameters increasing the incongruity of selected areas by spatial prioritizations mainly influenced by the control of sampling bias the application of binary limits muscatello et al 2021 the restriction methods and the geographic extent velazco et al 2020 however none of them suggested the inclusion of specific sdm protocols selecting environmental variables and spatial restriction according to the biological demands of each species thus instead of just diagnosing the effects of changes in the sdms parameters we advocate that the integrated use of specific sdm protocols with spatial prioritization optimize the cost benefit gains for conservation as a result the use of specific protocols captures a better coverage of species distribution in the proposed protected area in a realistic scenario of a lower conservation cost 0 20 of the protected landscape scp is commonly based on biodiversity substitutes belonging to a specific taxon group often defined based on data availability ease of mapping or accumulated knowledge for the taxon rodrigues and brooks 2007 the areas prioritization based on the distribution of a small set of taxa does not always represent the complexity of the practical issues faced by environmental managers who sometimes need to find solutions that protect species with different evolutionary histories or different taxonomic groups sensitive to the same impact prioritizing conservation for different taxa is therefore probably a more efficient way of capturing biodiversity patterns and promoting the persistence of most species kremen et al 2008 allowing the proposition of more effective conservation actions in comparison with a single species prioritization or a single taxonomic group in terms of environmental management the multi tax approach help systematizing information on the different targets affected establishing a direct relationship between sensitive species and impacts and proposing more holistic and prioritized conservation strategies this may also facilitate to accommodate the needs of different stakeholders involved favoring engagement and improve the social perception of the process which is considered the most critical problem of scp implementation to simulate real conservation issues we used the amazon basin as an example to compare how distribution models influence prioritization output this approach reinforces the complexity of choosing conservation targets from a scp perspective specific protocols can be built for any similar ecosystem that requires urgent protection measures in this study the region s biodiversity is strongly associated with aquatic ecosystems and the priorities resulting from the two protocols have not been convergent despite the existence of a wide network of protected areas encompassing approximately 25 of the region icmbio 2019 mma 2019 unep wcmc 2020 most of them were not defined to protect aquatic environments and new proposals must be assertive in identifying areas of high conservation value excluded from the network fagundes et al 2018 frederico et al 2014 extrapolating this consideration to other ecosystems prioritization analyzes must pay attention to the particularities of conservation targets to find truly effective solutions although the definition of different groups might seem challenging as it requires some level of biological knowledge about the different species we advocate that even a coarse definition as we performed in this study may lead to major improvements in the prioritization process finally it is also necessary to be aware of species with endemic populations or restricted distribution for which the use of multiple models may end up being very restrictive and result in omissions of populations in those situations the use of more general protocols which commonly result in broader predictions may be considered 5 conclusion models for decision making are a major challenge for researchers as real conservation situations often involve multiple taxa which may have quite different ecological requirements correlative distribution models derive species biological requirements from the data a property that is responsible for their wide applicability but it demands caution when using those models for decision making as the capability of those models to produce realistic and biologic meaningful predictions varies widely depending on the species ecological niche consequently further analysis that use those models as input such as the popular spatial prioritization for conservation are also impacted by this property especially in mega diverse highly complex geographically extensive and threatened environments therefore the applicability of those models for decision making demands more consideration towards the biological specificities of the species which often results in different models for a species or group of species conservation is a social political economic biological discussion which means that the multiple agents have different demands and knowledge about the system and consequently a conservation effort success is directly related to how

24418,fish schools reduce their predators encounter rates not only by performing evasive maneuvers but also by increasing distances between prey patches however a similar challenge applies to isolated prey fish seeking refuge during periods of diel school formation we demonstrate with an ideal gas movement model that as the stock sizes of a fish who forms schools daily decreases school densities do not change yet their average sizes become smaller and the numbers of isolated prey increases dramatically in this scenario predator encounter rates remain remarkably equivalent across a few orders of magnitude in stock sizes with a marginal peak at intermediate prey densities however even slight benefits from predator evasion maneuvers would decrease predation rates on larger schools substantially in support we found empirically that higher proportions of prey fish fail to join schools at low stock sizes and that predator consumption rates decline as prey stock size increases keywords ideal gas model encounter probability fish schools prey patches predator prey foraging theory conspicuousness fisheries acoustics 1 introduction the aggregation of individuals into organized and mobile groups occurs across a wide range of prey species and often reduces the risk of predation to the individual taylor 1976 turner and pitcher 1986 ioannou et al 2011 while the formation structure and maintenance of prey aggregations have been well explored in the scientific literature from an ethological perspective krause et al 2000 viscido et al 2005 soria et al 2007 willis 2008 brierley and cox 2010 studies of the ecological consequences for predation upon prey that form mobile aggregations have been relatively uncommon in recent years although see accolla et al 2015 this is true despite the fact that earlier studies of the ecological consequences of such aggregations tinbergen et al 1967 vine 1971 taylor 1976 freedman and wolkowicz 1986 turner and pitcher 1986 cosner et al 1999 parrish 1993 had not produced general agreement on those consequences early studies debated whether the increased distance between groups of prey would lower encounter rates with predators despite the increased conspicuousness of larger prey aggregations kiltie 1980 turner and pitcher 1986 of the few more recent relevant studies ioannu et al 2011 found that increased conspicuousness would not offset the benefits of spacing for experimentally aggregated invertebrate groups under fish predation and ruxton and johnsen 2016 modelled underwater visual acuity to conclude that conspicuousness increases at a much lower rate than density as group sizes increase however both these results are limited to the initial detection of a group and do not investigate the dynamics of group formation alternate approaches have focused more generally on deriving the predator s functional response cosner et al 1999 fryxell et al 2007 anderson 2010 geritz and gyllenberg 2013 all of these assumed that predation on mobile groups may be described by a holling type ii curve i e with increasing prey density consumption of prey increases monotonically from zero towards an asymptotic maximum these theoretical studies are enlightening but also limited because they do not use the extensive ethological knowledge of group formation as their guide ignore the role of predation in affecting group formation and instead represent simpler group dynamics with the addition or subtraction of individuals based on constant rates e g geritz and gyllenberg 2013 one notable exception is an individual based model accolla et al 2015 that found holling type iii functional responses i e with increasing prey density consumption of prey increases from 0 to a maximum but declines again at higher prey densities when aggregating prey over a 2 dimensional space through repulsion alignment and attraction interactions i e a r a model in nature prey group sizes and distributions are typically dynamic and influenced by multiple density dependent and independent factors petitgas et al 2001 milne et al 2005 buuveibaatar et al 2013 holubova et al 2019 animal movement models can incorporate the random and non random elements of animal interactions gurarie and ovaskainen 2013 with the ecological constraints of group formation krause et al 2000 to generate the range of group sizes predators might experience in their environment for many schooling species the formation of schools occurs on a diel basis and so predators experience shifts in the degree of prey aggregation over time their ability to encounter these patches will be dependent on how their environment facilitates both the process of school formation and subsequently school detection we explore here how the density of prey and the conspicuousness of schools influence the encounter rates of the predator and prey as schools form in a previous paper de kerckhove et al 2015a we characterized the movement of a schooling fish coregonus artedi cisco as an ideal gas process hutchinson and waser 2007 depending primarily on the cisco s swimming speed visual acuity size of the visual target i e fish or school and the initial cisco density here called the stock size representing the total number of fish in the population ciscos require ambient light to remain in schools and therefore schools disperse at night and reform in the morning milne et al 2005 we noted that during school formation every morning the overall density of cisco groups here called entities when referring to both singleton fish and schools would drop dramatically within an hour lowering the probabilities that a predator or a singleton cisco would encounter a school from this observation we hypothesized that 1 for large stocks fish would initially find each other easily and form relatively large schools whose conspicuousness would continue to attract any remaining singletons and thus quickly reduce the density of cisco entities 2 for small stocks schools would take longer to form and generally be of a smaller size ultimately leaving higher densities of singletons within the lake this scenario predicts a negative relationship between stock size and daytime densities of cisco entities which could lead to low encounter rates with predators at high stock sizes unless it was offset sufficiently by the conspicuousness of the larger sized school or by changes in the predator s behavior in this study we extend our ideal gas model igm of school formation to examine how encounter rates with predators vary across a range of stock sizes the movement of organisms can be modelled using the same properties of the movement of ideal gas particles the igm s primary assumptions are 1 movement between individuals is independent 2 speed over each dimension of movement e g x y and z coordinates follows a maxwell boltzman distribution 3 movement is equally likely in any direction and 4 movement trajectories follow straight lines note that a lack of any movement also follows these assumptions these basic assumptions can in some cases be modified to depict more realistic patterns of movement which has allowed the igm to be applied to a wide range of animals hutchinson and waser 2007 the great strength of the igm is that encounter rates between individuals can be predicted based on the density of the organisms within the environment if the basic movement parameters are known this relationship can be used as a null model to estimate population sizes during field surveys or to model ecological interactions within populations or communities the equations for the igm only calculate encounter rates over a particular period of time based on a set of movement visual and density parameters we base the parameters and test our model with empirical data from lake opeongo ontario canada which contains cisco and their predator salvelinus namaycush lake trout we explore how the dynamics of cisco school formation affect the shape of the lake trout s encounter probabilities based on prey density school conspicuousness and group defense 2 materials and methods 2 1 general model structure the model we present here has two levels 1 the igm equations which calculate encounter rates between entities and 2 a book keeping component that processes the encounter rates into changes in entity density and keeps track of the time of day thus at any time the encounter rates between entities can be calculated by the igm equations as long as the entity densities are recorded in the book keeping component for the previous time step the igm equations are used to calculate encounter rates among singletons and schools based on their density movement and visual parameters these equations are only spatially referenced by the density parameter and as such the spatial arena s dimensions need not be defined as long as the distribution of entities is known to be random as confirmed in de kerckhove et al 2015a from hydroacoustic surveys of the lake basin thus the igm equations do not explicitly track individuals within a spatial arena but instead calculate the encounter rates that would occur at any point between a focal individual and the rest of the individuals within the environment using probability models hutchinson and waser 2007 the book keeping component of the model keeps track of the density of all entities of interest including predators lake trout singletons individual cisco and a range of school sizes as well as any physical variables i e light or temperature which might change over the daytime and affect the movement or visual igm parameters thus the model we present here is primarily driven by encounter rates and time 2 2 ideal gas model equations our previous study de kerckhove et al 2015a describes the igm equations and parameterization for cisco in great detail and so it will only be briefly presented here note that within the previous publication we verified that cisco singletons and schools generally move as ideal gas particles the three sets of main parameters are density ρ m 3 of singletons subscript f and schools subscript s was measured by recording the numerical abundance of singletons and each school size class ns and dividing it by the volume of the lake m3 within the study zone at night the entire stock comprises only singletons as the day progresses the stock size remains approximately the same daily predation is a small fraction of the cisco population but densities of singletons and each school size class change as cisco entities interact the swimming speeds m s of cisco singletons vf and schools vs were estimated using field measurements in lake opeongo and were incorporated into gerritsen and strickler 1977 relative speed formulation de kerckhove et al 2015a b the speeds are not assumed to change over the entire model it is possible to incorporate changes in speed due to changes in temperature or upon encountering an entity but those nuances were not required as we did not observe great changes in singleton or school swimming speeds in lake opeongo during the daytime de kerckhove et al 2015b the visual acuity of cisco was estimated from a range of studies including targeted experimental link and edsall 1996 and field milne et al 2005 observations and allometric relationships in fish mcgill and mittelbach 2006 light dependent detection distances d m were modelled as a michaelis menten function of ambient light levels at depth and a maximum detection distance following holbrook et al 2013 the shape of the organism s field of view is an important parameter because it determines the volume of space surveyed as the organism moves over a period of time the cisco has a forward facing hemispherical field of view around their eyes i e link and edsall 1996 refer to it as a deflated basketball with a radius of d as they move the encounter rates are determined by the probability that another entity will be found within the volume of space surveyed as the sun rises the ambient light levels will change thus unlike the swimming speed parameters the time of day will have an influence on detection distance of the cisco from these parameters the probability of not encountering another cisco entity during school formation over one second could be represented by the following equations for the two types of cisco entity singletons f or schools s of a particular size class ns 1a e f f e 4 3 v f π ρ f d f 2 1b e f s e v f 2 v s 2 3 1 v f π ρ s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 1c e s s e 4 3 v s π ρ s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 where ex y is the probability of no encounter between any focal entity of population x and entity from a population of y and ns is the size class of the school from population y as part of the volume equation for a spheroid disk which is the shape of a cisco school equations characterizing lake trout t cisco encounters were similar to those of singleton cisco encountering each other and schools and were also parameterized using field observations in lake opeongo milne et al 2005 dunlop et al 2010 and experimentally derived relationships beauchamp et al 1999 mcgill and mittelbach 2005 however note that the verification of lake trout movement as an ideal gas particle would likely require additional targeted hydroacoustics and telemetry field work a main difference however was the shape of visual perception surrounding the lake trout s eye our previous work on the igm formulations were successful in replicating rates and patterns of cisco school formation but nevertheless revealed the model s high sensitivity to the parameterization of visual acuity de kerckhove et al 2015a with additional information on lake trout foraging we refined our model for the lake trout s detection of prey lake trout encounter some entities at or below their eye level i e within the ambient light levels and perceive others above their eye level i e backlit from the sky experimental and field studies suggests that lake trout attain a maximum reaction distance of 1 m irrespective of prey size under ambient light beauchamp et al 1999 but will approach schools from as far as 6 m if they are backlit dunlop et al 2010 thus we characterize their field of view as a 1 m semi hemispherical range at or below their eyes and mcgill and mittelbach s 2005 allometric relationship with prey size above their eyes i e a conical field of view see fig a1 in the online appendix a further with no clear direction on the relative visual acuity of lake trout vs cisco at very low light levels see beauchamp et al 1999 milne et al 2005 we assumed that the lake trout s reaction distance improved with increasing light levels at roughly the same rate as the cisco with these modifications the basic encounter equations were 1d e t f e v t 2 v f 2 3 1 v t π ρ f d t 2 1e e t s e v t 2 v s 2 3 1 v t π ρ s d t 3 0 0038 n s π 2 2 3 book keeping model components in lake opeongo lake trout forage only in the daytime milne et al 2005 dunlop et al 2010 and so the model is initiated at the onset of dawn nautical twilight and is iterated every second for up to 8 h one second was chosen as an appropriate time step because the density of entities can change very fast and thus greatly affect the encounter rates time periods longer than 8 h were not attempted because the model has not been verified for the behavior of schools as the light levels diminish and so this model only addresses half of the foraging period however we note that theoretical encounter rates should be very low for the afternoon and that lake trout are most active in the morning in lake opeongo cruz font et al 2019 and so we believe we are modeling the most important foraging period of the day at each iteration the encounter probabilities are calculated for every possible interaction among singletons and schools of all sizes and then applied to the existing densities such that each within species encounter results in the fusion of the two entities be it singletons or schools for example the number of cisco cisco interactions λf f that involve only singletons is 2 λ f f ρ f v 1 e 4 3 v f π ρ f d f 2 n s 199 e v f 2 v s 2 3 1 v f π ρ n s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 where the light square bracket encloses the number of singletons i e their density multiplied by lake volume the dark square brackets encloses the probability of singleton to singleton encounters and the set braces enclose the probability of not encountering schools that contain 2 to 199 individuals following this calculation the abundance of singletons would be reduced by λf f and the abundance of schools with two individuals would be increased by half of λf f only school sizes up to 74 and 199 fish were explicitly counted for lake trout cisco and cisco cisco encounters respectively after which all schools of greater size were grouped together and assigned a volume corresponding to either 75 or 200 individuals these two alternative maximum sizes limit the allometrically driven detection distances to the maximum distance measured in lake opeongo dunlop et al 2010 in the model singletons and smaller schools will continue to join these large schools yet their visibility will remain that of the maximum size see table 1 for all the model parameters our three main assumptions regarding lake trout foraging are 1 predatory encounters do not split schools for significant time periods or significantly influence the rate of school formation 2 lake trout always move as ideal gas particles and thus will not remain with a school following the initial attack and 3 lake trout do not change their foraging strategy over the course of the 8 h study period we address these simplifying assumptions in our discussion of the model and field results 2 4 field surveys all field surveys were conducted on the south arm of lake opeongo 45 42 n 78 22 w a 58 km2 oligotrophic lake with a maximum depth of 49 4 m mobile

affixed to the mid ship of survey vessels daytime mobile surveys were conducted on july 13 and 14 august 16 and 21 and september 21 22 and 23 2009 to measure the density of cisco singletons and schools within the pelagic zone as described in a series of studies de kerckhove et al 2015a b extensive day and night mobile and fixed platform acoustic surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to characterize the behavior of cisco and lake trout within the pelagic zone all surveys and data analyses adhered to the great lakes standard operating protocols parker stetter et al 2009 and all split beam transducers were calibrated at the time and location of the surveys as per the recommendations of the manufacturers all raw acoustic data were processed using echoview myriax software pty ltd version 5 2 70 and included their 2d school detection module and fish track detection module all data within 5 m from the surface and beyond a depth of 15 m were excluded from the analysis to avoid non target detections all echograms school detections and fish tracks were examined to identify and remove bad data regions due to electronic noise cavitation and bottom intrusion within the analysis area and non target detections estimates of the magnitude of background noise at 1 m were obtained from passive listening of each transducer and removed from the sv data using the time varied gain data generator and linear subtraction operator in echoview we report standard transducer and calibration parameters in table s1 in the supplementary materials and extensively describe our analysis methodologies in associated publications de kerckhove et al 2015b cisco singleton and school densities were estimated separately and only added together to estimate the overall density of cisco entities to be able to compare between surveys with different transects the average density of the fish and schools was calculated by 1 partitioning the transects into 100 m long sampling units i e elementary distance sampling units edsus and 2 randomly sampling with replacement 1000 edsus from each survey and taking the average density from the set lake trout predatory behavior was analyzed by visually examining 24 h fixed platform acoustics surveys conducted between october 14th and 30th 2010 interactions between schools and fish tracks were assumed to involve a lake trout predatory strike if 1 the fish track contained target strength values greater than the maximum response for cisco i e 32 db using target strength size relationships in frouzova et al 2005 and 2 the schools displayed evasive manoeuvers see nøttestad and axelsen 1999 the timing and extent of the interaction was recorded as well as the number of repeated strikes netting surveys were conducted routinely on lake opeongo with lake trout the primary target sandstrom and lester 2009 suspended pelagic net surveys of cisco were conducted in 1995 1999 2001 and 2007 2010 see table a2 these surveys generally followed a common protocol and used the same set of nets milne et al 2005 both programs were completed in conjunction with our acoustic surveys and allowed us to differentiate between our study species and non target detections frouzova et al 2005 cisco catch per unit effort cpue values were compared between years by standardizing all net sizes and soak times for a 1 hour set with the most common gill net gang 46 m long x 2 m deep and by determining the mean and standard deviation of the cpue for each year using equation 5 38 in headrick 2010 3 n 1 2 s 1 2 n 2 2 s 2 2 n 2 s 1 2 n 1 s 2 2 n 1 s 1 2 n 2

different mesh sizes creel surveys have been conducted on lake opeongo during the summer months by the nrf since 1936 matuszek et al 1990 the stomach contents of lake trout are analyzed within 12 h of their capture following a standard protocol we examined the number of coregonid fish prey items found in lake trout stomachs in july august and september between 1993 and 2011 2 5 ideal gas model predictions and empirical tests as noted by fryxell and lundberg 1998 and reiterated by mcgill and mittelbach 2006 extending foraging models to field predictions is typically limited by an inability to measure crucial parameters one of these is clearly the capture success of an individual from a school based on an encounter with the lake trout to estimate how encounter probabilities could represent actual rates of consumption under predation evasion manoeuvers we assumed a declining probability of capture success from encounters with increasingly larger schools as in major 1978 morgan and godin 1985 parrish 1993 krause and godin 1995 krause et al 1998 turesson and brönmark 2004 while empirical findings are varied solitary predators foraging on obligate schoolers rather than facultative schoolers or shoals generally experience a quick decline in capture success with increasing school size even at very small sizes e g 2 to 10 individuals we modelled this expectation with a negative power relationship between the number of fish within a school ns and the probability of capture success pcs 4 p c s n s x where x is 0 for no difference in capture success 0 5 for a moderate loss in capture success i e for school sizes of 2 4 10 50 and 75 the probability of success decreases to approximately 70 50 30 14 and 12 respectively and 1 for a rapid loss of success such that even a school size of 2 confers a 50 loss the igm was run and initialized at six different stock sizes 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 06 and 0 1 cisco m3 for which the daytime densities of cisco entities over 8 h were 1 compared among each other and 2 used to derive lake trout encounter probabilities per minute for both singletons and schools over all capture success scenarios encounter probabilities with lake trout were calculated at each hour to determine the shape of encounter curves with different stock sizes as the relative densities of singletons and schools changed over the morning to estimate the total morning encounter probabilities the lake trout encounter rates for each minute were summed for the 8 h morning period the influence of the basic parameters on the ideal gas model have been explored well elsewhere gerritsen and strickler 1977 however we conducted a relatively simple global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 to ensure that the most influential parameters swimming speeds and visual acuity would not overwhelm the effects of different cisco stock sizes to our model interpretations as such we elected to resample from normal distributions of our parameters informed from our field surveys dunlop et al 2010 de kerckhove et al 2015a we used the means reported in table 1 with the swimming speed standard deviations for lake trout 0 5 m s cisco singletons 0 06 m s and cisco schools 0 18 m s an arbitrary standard deviation of 1 for visual acuity note that we have already tested an up to 50 variation in reaction distance for the cisco model in de kerckhove et al 2015a we randomly sampled from these distributions 100 times for three density treatment e g 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 cisco m3 to ensure that the 95 confidence intervals on our predicted changes in density and encounter rates over the daytime did not overlap from over a decade of acoustic and netting surveys on lake opeongo it is known that cisco stocks decline over july august and september roughly 0 06 0 03 and 0 01 cisco m3 respectively due in part to predation by lake trout milne et al 2005 vascotto 2006 moryk 2010 de kerckhove et al 2015a our model was used to predict the daytime densities of cisco singletons and schools at these three stock sizes which we then compared to the results of daytime acoustic surveys conducted in july august and september 2009 in addition the differences in the monthly singleton and school densities from the surveys were compared using an anova to examine the influence of changing cisco densities on lake trout consumption the annual average number of cisco found in lake trout stomachs from the creel surveys between 1992 and 2011 was compared to the cpue of cisco from the pelagic netting surveys using ordinary least squares regression 3 results the output of the ideal gas model for the 8 h following dawn nautical twilight at six different cisco stock sizes suggested that relatively high densities of both cisco singletons and schools are only found for the first hour of daylight fig 1 a b after this time all densities declined rapidly and leveled off at a small fraction of their stock sizes by 4 h the proportions of remaining singletons were inversely related to the stock i e 0 04 0 005 and 0 0005 of 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 cisco m3 respectively contrastingly by 4 h the density of schools of all sizes were similar to each other 5 10 5 school m3 regardless of stock size however average school sizes increased with stock size such that after 2 h there were no large schools 100 individuals for the smallest stock size 0 001 m 3 but 76 large schools for intermediate 0 01 m 3 and over 300 for the highest 0 1 m 3 the igm predicted that lake trout encounter probabilities should follow the same general temporal pattern as the changes in density of cisco entities regardless of the capture success parameterization encounters first increased with light levels peaked for a short period in the morning and then declined rapidly to lower levels for the rest of the day see fig 1c d encounter rates with singletons and schools peaked within the first hour at low i e 0 005 m 3 and intermediate 0 03 m 3 stock sizes these dynamics led to asymptotic or dome shaped encounter probability relationships at the first hour of foraging dome shaped relationships with much lower probabilities of encounter at the next two hours and increasingly flat relationships independent of stock sizes for the rest of the morning fig 2 note that varying the swimming speeds or visual acuity of lake trout or cisco entities did not alter these relative patterns nor created overlapping 95 confidence intervals on the curves in figs 1 or 2 taken over the entire morning lake trout were most likely to experience peak encounter probabilities at intermediate stock sizes however in the absence of any limits to lake trout capture success the peak was only marginally larger than at higher stock sizes fig 3 any decline in the effectiveness of capture success decreased the probabilities of encounter in general across all stock sizes and disproportionately more for larger stock sizes leading to more pronounced dome shaped curves daytime acoustic surveys roughly corresponding to our modelled stock sizes of 0 06 0 03 and 0 01 cisco m3 for july august and september respectively demonstrated that cisco singleton densities significantly increased anova f 7 86 df 6 p 0 05 and school densities remained constant fig 4 as stock size declined these empirical results matched our qualitative model predictions and even our quantitative estimates of daytime school densities however observed cisco singleton densities were much higher than we predicted between 4 and 8 h over the last two decades lake trout have been increasing their average consumption of cisco r2 0 52 p 0 01 even as the catch per unit effort of cisco in pelagic gill nets has fallen fig 5 the variation on the gill net catches is high yet typical of netting surveys on lake opeongo the number of cisco found in lake trout stomachs in the creel surveys increased from roughly two to three from 1992 to 2011 fixed platform acoustic surveys identified 53 predation events in which a large fish interacted with a school leading to evasive manoeuvers behavioral notes from observing the interactions include 1 no predation strikes on schools were observed prior to 9 30 am 0 4 decimal time yet afterwards occurred with equal frequency until sunset 2 the duration of the interactions ranged from 1 to 5 min and 3 evasive manoeuvers involved the school splitting into two or more smaller schools or shifting direction 4 discussion performance of the ideal gas model across a wide range of stock sizes demonstrated that there was 1 an inverse relationship between stock size and singleton densities and 2 schools while generally larger demonstrated no differences in densities as stock sizes increased these results suggest that while school size is primarily dependent on stock size distributions of school density are dependent much more on the ideal gas movement parameters as densities decline in the morning the encounter rate between schools becomes so small that the time required to aggregate all schools into one entity would take an extremely long time certainly much more than one day if so limnological parameters including water clarity and volume will determine to a great degree how many schools can be accommodated in the lake before encounter rates drop to negligible levels our model is the first to show how this unintuitive association between population size and school numbers could arise and explains previously puzzling empirical findings despite a targeted effort by the european union no relationship could be found between the stock size and the number of schools in the aegean sea western mediterranean bay of biscay or north sea petitgas et al 2001 complex patterns between stock size and pelagic schools have instead been explored using evolutionary arguments suggesting life history thresholds to the benefit of schooling at low and high densities maury 2017 similarly in freshwater no relationships were found in fifteen lakes in sweden turesson and brönmark 2007 who suggested lower visibility as the factor limiting encounter rates in highly productive systems nor in our own temporal surveys on lake opeongo although note that holubova et al 2019 noted density dependent effects on schooling and shoaling across multiple species within a lake in contrast we predicted a straightforward relationship between stock sizes and the distribution of school sizes which has been commonly found in these same oceans petitgas et al 2001 willis 2008 and lakes turesson and brönmark 2007 holubova et al 2019 and even for terrestrial herds buuveibaatar et al 2013 our contribution of an internal mechanism to these empirical observations supports the hypothesis that there are fundamental emergent properties of aquatic animal aggregations brierley and cox 2010 further our results call into question the use of simpler characterizations of group formation that ensure a linear relationship between population size and group density e g a becker and doring equation in geritz and gyllenberg 2013 the derivation of encounter probabilities for lake trout using the igm demonstrated that 1 the first hour of foraging would yield the greatest encounter probabilities over the daytime 2 on the shape of encounter probabilities could yield asymptotic dome shaped and uniformly flat curves depending on the time of day and the target prey i e singletons or schools and 3 over the 8 h period a dome shaped curve best represented the overall encounter probabilities if lake trout were susceptible to evasive maneuvers by schools it is first important to note that across the day encounter probabilities were much lower than would be experienced if individual cisco were dispersed randomly so here group conspicuousness does not offset the benefits of increased spacing between groups when comparing aggregating with non aggregating species kiltie 1980 turner and pitcher 1986 ioannou et al 2011 however inherent in the igm model is the influence of school conspicuousness on encounter rates which here appeared to lead slightly higher encounter rates with predators with the larger school sizes and equivalent school densities thus within aggregating species conspicuousness could remain an important ecological variable this result presents a novel cost benefit interpretation of school spacing versus conspicuousness suggesting that fitness benefits for the cisco would drive behavior that limits school sizes or initiates diel vertical migrations into darker depths of the water column any decreases in capture success on the other hand leads to lower and dome shaped encounter probabilities this result is intuitive as whichever stock produces the largest schools will be least protected from predation events based directly on the capture success parameterization our finding of dome shaped prey encounter rate vs stock size curves in the morning may explain why our empirical results suggest that lake trout foraging rates increased as cisco stocks fell over the last 20 years in lake opeongo later in the day all the response curves increasingly flattened to uniform and low encounter probabilities across all stock sizes resembling the very flat type ii functional responses derived for lake trout from bioenergetics models that did not incorporate prey aggregation eby et al 1995 these results and the observation that cisco schools disaggregate only once light levels are too low for lake trout to forage milne et al 2005 all suggest that the morning foraging period is the only opportunity for lake trout to experience different encounter rates based on cisco stock sizes other sources of evidence from our lake monitoring datasets further support the importance of morning foraging with a particular focus on cisco individuals first in our creel analysis of lake trout stomach contents if we separated lake trout caught in the morning from those caught in the afternoon we found that only the morning data showed a significant increase in intake rates of cisco r2 0 41 p 0 05 fig a2 over the last 20 years second from our fixed platform acoustic surveys we did not observe predation events on schools prior to 9 30 am even though schools had formed long before see fig a3 both these observations suggest that lake trout may change their behavior over the course of the day and instead target individual cisco first thing in the morning to take advantage of their high density and vulnerability if so this would further increase the likelihood of a unimodal encounter curve see fig a4 because the encounter probability is best for individuals in mid sized stocks and remains much lower after the morning period for all stock sizes despite the evidence presented above it is important to recognize some caveats with our conclusion as well as to revisit some of our assumptions first we noted along with previous work on lake opeongo that cisco schools perform evasive manoeuvers leading to multiple strikes from lake trout predators dunlop et al 2010 if lake trout remain with a school once it has an initial encounter they would at least be temporarily abandoning ideal gas movement once a detection is made if so encounter rates would certainly increase between lake trout and schools which would lead to non random assortments of predators and prey and allow the lake trout to forage more effectively across all stock sizes second our model ignores the bioenergetic limits to foraging as well as handling time it is very unlikely that lake trout can actively forage every minute of the day and instead must rest digest and handle prey and so the cumulative effects of the early morning s high encounter rates may not overwhelm the flat curves over the rest of the day third and similar to the last we ignore the effects of water temperature on swimming speed which could influence the interpretation of our empirical data for our monthly contrasts but not necessarily our timeseries across the years our annual monitoring does not suggest great changes in temperature however we note from our sensitivity analyses that densities have a much larger effect on the encounter rates than swimming speeds last cisco singleton densities appeared to be higher in our field surveys than the model predicted while they were still low enough to not greatly influence the daily encouter rates with lake trout there are a few implications of this observation that violate the assumptions of our model it may suggest that isolated cisco individuals may change their behavior later in the morning stop seeking schools and perhaps focus on foraging it could also result from lake trout repeatedly striking one school see fig a5 leading to a dispersion of individual cisco across the daytime and last the higher densities for observed cisco could indicate that the pelagic zone is not a uniform arena for their movement martinez garcia et al 2020 while we reported uniform densities of schools and cisco across two dimensional surface of the lake basin de kerckhove et al 2015a it is possible that changes in depth through diel vertical movements could lead to non uniform distributions of individual cisco while we did not have sufficient information on handling times and predator behaviours to estimate a functional response the effects of stock size on encounter rate will often produce functional responses with a similar qualitative form as encounter is a necessary component of predation community dynamics are sensitive to the shape and magnitude of the functional response employed to model predator prey interactions murdoch et al 2003 turchin 2003 abrams 2010 as such the choice between a type ii and dome shaped curves could lead to different population dynamics and different courses of action in the management of economically important schooling fish species freedman and wolkowicz 1986 further our study suggests that the trade off between group size and group density in terms of predator encounter rates remains a compelling question ioannou et al 2010 and requires more investigation into predator consumption rates and the associated prey mortality our model provides motivation for further study into the influence of the predator s capture success and the dilution effect contributed by the number of fish in the school turner and pitcher 1986 on the per capita mortality of the prey given the need to revive ecological debate on this topic we echo geritz and gyllenberg 2013 ioannou et al 2010 call for a more explicit exploration of predator prey dynamics using models that mechanistically represent schooling behavior prey detection and predator consumption rates last we revisit that maury 2017 used an evolutionary argument to suggest that the properties of schooling may lead to greater ecosystem stability in oceans maury 2017 arguments coupled with the inherent stabilizing properties of type iii functional responses neutal and thorne 2015 may begin to explain the ubiquity of aggregated prey in pelagic systems eqs 1a 1e 2 4 credit authorship contribution statement derrick de kerckhove

24418,fish schools reduce their predators encounter rates not only by performing evasive maneuvers but also by increasing distances between prey patches however a similar challenge applies to isolated prey fish seeking refuge during periods of diel school formation we demonstrate with an ideal gas movement model that as the stock sizes of a fish who forms schools daily decreases school densities do not change yet their average sizes become smaller and the numbers of isolated prey increases dramatically in this scenario predator encounter rates remain remarkably equivalent across a few orders of magnitude in stock sizes with a marginal peak at intermediate prey densities however even slight benefits from predator evasion maneuvers would decrease predation rates on larger schools substantially in support we found empirically that higher proportions of prey fish fail to join schools at low stock sizes and that predator consumption rates decline as prey stock size increases keywords ideal gas model encounter probability fish schools prey patches predator prey foraging theory conspicuousness fisheries acoustics 1 introduction the aggregation of individuals into organized and mobile groups occurs across a wide range of prey species and often reduces the risk of predation to the individual taylor 1976 turner and pitcher 1986 ioannou et al 2011 while the formation structure and maintenance of prey aggregations have been well explored in the scientific literature from an ethological perspective krause et al 2000 viscido et al 2005 soria et al 2007 willis 2008 brierley and cox 2010 studies of the ecological consequences for predation upon prey that form mobile aggregations have been relatively uncommon in recent years although see accolla et al 2015 this is true despite the fact that earlier studies of the ecological consequences of such aggregations tinbergen et al 1967 vine 1971 taylor 1976 freedman and wolkowicz 1986 turner and pitcher 1986 cosner et al 1999 parrish 1993 had not produced general agreement on those consequences early studies debated whether the increased distance between groups of prey would lower encounter rates with predators despite the increased conspicuousness of larger prey aggregations kiltie 1980 turner and pitcher 1986 of the few more recent relevant studies ioannu et al 2011 found that increased conspicuousness would not offset the benefits of spacing for experimentally aggregated invertebrate groups under fish predation and ruxton and johnsen 2016 modelled underwater visual acuity to conclude that conspicuousness increases at a much lower rate than density as group sizes increase however both these results are limited to the initial detection of a group and do not investigate the dynamics of group formation alternate approaches have focused more generally on deriving the predator s functional response cosner et al 1999 fryxell et al 2007 anderson 2010 geritz and gyllenberg 2013 all of these assumed that predation on mobile groups may be described by a holling type ii curve i e with increasing prey density consumption of prey increases monotonically from zero towards an asymptotic maximum these theoretical studies are enlightening but also limited because they do not use the extensive ethological knowledge of group formation as their guide ignore the role of predation in affecting group formation and instead represent simpler group dynamics with the addition or subtraction of individuals based on constant rates e g geritz and gyllenberg 2013 one notable exception is an individual based model accolla et al 2015 that found holling type iii functional responses i e with increasing prey density consumption of prey increases from 0 to a maximum but declines again at higher prey densities when aggregating prey over a 2 dimensional space through repulsion alignment and attraction interactions i e a r a model in nature prey group sizes and distributions are typically dynamic and influenced by multiple density dependent and independent factors petitgas et al 2001 milne et al 2005 buuveibaatar et al 2013 holubova et al 2019 animal movement models can incorporate the random and non random elements of animal interactions gurarie and ovaskainen 2013 with the ecological constraints of group formation krause et al 2000 to generate the range of group sizes predators might experience in their environment for many schooling species the formation of schools occurs on a diel basis and so predators experience shifts in the degree of prey aggregation over time their ability to encounter these patches will be dependent on how their environment facilitates both the process of school formation and subsequently school detection we explore here how the density of prey and the conspicuousness of schools influence the encounter rates of the predator and prey as schools form in a previous paper de kerckhove et al 2015a we characterized the movement of a schooling fish coregonus artedi cisco as an ideal gas process hutchinson and waser 2007 depending primarily on the cisco s swimming speed visual acuity size of the visual target i e fish or school and the initial cisco density here called the stock size representing the total number of fish in the population ciscos require ambient light to remain in schools and therefore schools disperse at night and reform in the morning milne et al 2005 we noted that during school formation every morning the overall density of cisco groups here called entities when referring to both singleton fish and schools would drop dramatically within an hour lowering the probabilities that a predator or a singleton cisco would encounter a school from this observation we hypothesized that 1 for large stocks fish would initially find each other easily and form relatively large schools whose conspicuousness would continue to attract any remaining singletons and thus quickly reduce the density of cisco entities 2 for small stocks schools would take longer to form and generally be of a smaller size ultimately leaving higher densities of singletons within the lake this scenario predicts a negative relationship between stock size and daytime densities of cisco entities which could lead to low encounter rates with predators at high stock sizes unless it was offset sufficiently by the conspicuousness of the larger sized school or by changes in the predator s behavior in this study we extend our ideal gas model igm of school formation to examine how encounter rates with predators vary across a range of stock sizes the movement of organisms can be modelled using the same properties of the movement of ideal gas particles the igm s primary assumptions are 1 movement between individuals is independent 2 speed over each dimension of movement e g x y and z coordinates follows a maxwell boltzman distribution 3 movement is equally likely in any direction and 4 movement trajectories follow straight lines note that a lack of any movement also follows these assumptions these basic assumptions can in some cases be modified to depict more realistic patterns of movement which has allowed the igm to be applied to a wide range of animals hutchinson and waser 2007 the great strength of the igm is that encounter rates between individuals can be predicted based on the density of the organisms within the environment if the basic movement parameters are known this relationship can be used as a null model to estimate population sizes during field surveys or to model ecological interactions within populations or communities the equations for the igm only calculate encounter rates over a particular period of time based on a set of movement visual and density parameters we base the parameters and test our model with empirical data from lake opeongo ontario canada which contains cisco and their predator salvelinus namaycush lake trout we explore how the dynamics of cisco school formation affect the shape of the lake trout s encounter probabilities based on prey density school conspicuousness and group defense 2 materials and methods 2 1 general model structure the model we present here has two levels 1 the igm equations which calculate encounter rates between entities and 2 a book keeping component that processes the encounter rates into changes in entity density and keeps track of the time of day thus at any time the encounter rates between entities can be calculated by the igm equations as long as the entity densities are recorded in the book keeping component for the previous time step the igm equations are used to calculate encounter rates among singletons and schools based on their density movement and visual parameters these equations are only spatially referenced by the density parameter and as such the spatial arena s dimensions need not be defined as long as the distribution of entities is known to be random as confirmed in de kerckhove et al 2015a from hydroacoustic surveys of the lake basin thus the igm equations do not explicitly track individuals within a spatial arena but instead calculate the encounter rates that would occur at any point between a focal individual and the rest of the individuals within the environment using probability models hutchinson and waser 2007 the book keeping component of the model keeps track of the density of all entities of interest including predators lake trout singletons individual cisco and a range of school sizes as well as any physical variables i e light or temperature which might change over the daytime and affect the movement or visual igm parameters thus the model we present here is primarily driven by encounter rates and time 2 2 ideal gas model equations our previous study de kerckhove et al 2015a describes the igm equations and parameterization for cisco in great detail and so it will only be briefly presented here note that within the previous publication we verified that cisco singletons and schools generally move as ideal gas particles the three sets of main parameters are density ρ m 3 of singletons subscript f and schools subscript s was measured by recording the numerical abundance of singletons and each school size class ns and dividing it by the volume of the lake m3 within the study zone at night the entire stock comprises only singletons as the day progresses the stock size remains approximately the same daily predation is a small fraction of the cisco population but densities of singletons and each school size class change as cisco entities interact the swimming speeds m s of cisco singletons vf and schools vs were estimated using field measurements in lake opeongo and were incorporated into gerritsen and strickler 1977 relative speed formulation de kerckhove et al 2015a b the speeds are not assumed to change over the entire model it is possible to incorporate changes in speed due to changes in temperature or upon encountering an entity but those nuances were not required as we did not observe great changes in singleton or school swimming speeds in lake opeongo during the daytime de kerckhove et al 2015b the visual acuity of cisco was estimated from a range of studies including targeted experimental link and edsall 1996 and field milne et al 2005 observations and allometric relationships in fish mcgill and mittelbach 2006 light dependent detection distances d m were modelled as a michaelis menten function of ambient light levels at depth and a maximum detection distance following holbrook et al 2013 the shape of the organism s field of view is an important parameter because it determines the volume of space surveyed as the organism moves over a period of time the cisco has a forward facing hemispherical field of view around their eyes i e link and edsall 1996 refer to it as a deflated basketball with a radius of d as they move the encounter rates are determined by the probability that another entity will be found within the volume of space surveyed as the sun rises the ambient light levels will change thus unlike the swimming speed parameters the time of day will have an influence on detection distance of the cisco from these parameters the probability of not encountering another cisco entity during school formation over one second could be represented by the following equations for the two types of cisco entity singletons f or schools s of a particular size class ns 1a e f f e 4 3 v f π ρ f d f 2 1b e f s e v f 2 v s 2 3 1 v f π ρ s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 1c e s s e 4 3 v s π ρ s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 where ex y is the probability of no encounter between any focal entity of population x and entity from a population of y and ns is the size class of the school from population y as part of the volume equation for a spheroid disk which is the shape of a cisco school equations characterizing lake trout t cisco encounters were similar to those of singleton cisco encountering each other and schools and were also parameterized using field observations in lake opeongo milne et al 2005 dunlop et al 2010 and experimentally derived relationships beauchamp et al 1999 mcgill and mittelbach 2005 however note that the verification of lake trout movement as an ideal gas particle would likely require additional targeted hydroacoustics and telemetry field work a main difference however was the shape of visual perception surrounding the lake trout s eye our previous work on the igm formulations were successful in replicating rates and patterns of cisco school formation but nevertheless revealed the model s high sensitivity to the parameterization of visual acuity de kerckhove et al 2015a with additional information on lake trout foraging we refined our model for the lake trout s detection of prey lake trout encounter some entities at or below their eye level i e within the ambient light levels and perceive others above their eye level i e backlit from the sky experimental and field studies suggests that lake trout attain a maximum reaction distance of 1 m irrespective of prey size under ambient light beauchamp et al 1999 but will approach schools from as far as 6 m if they are backlit dunlop et al 2010 thus we characterize their field of view as a 1 m semi hemispherical range at or below their eyes and mcgill and mittelbach s 2005 allometric relationship with prey size above their eyes i e a conical field of view see fig a1 in the online appendix a further with no clear direction on the relative visual acuity of lake trout vs cisco at very low light levels see beauchamp et al 1999 milne et al 2005 we assumed that the lake trout s reaction distance improved with increasing light levels at roughly the same rate as the cisco with these modifications the basic encounter equations were 1d e t f e v t 2 v f 2 3 1 v t π ρ f d t 2 1e e t s e v t 2 v s 2 3 1 v t π ρ s d t 3 0 0038 n s π 2 2 3 book keeping model components in lake opeongo lake trout forage only in the daytime milne et al 2005 dunlop et al 2010 and so the model is initiated at the onset of dawn nautical twilight and is iterated every second for up to 8 h one second was chosen as an appropriate time step because the density of entities can change very fast and thus greatly affect the encounter rates time periods longer than 8 h were not attempted because the model has not been verified for the behavior of schools as the light levels diminish and so this model only addresses half of the foraging period however we note that theoretical encounter rates should be very low for the afternoon and that lake trout are most active in the morning in lake opeongo cruz font et al 2019 and so we believe we are modeling the most important foraging period of the day at each iteration the encounter probabilities are calculated for every possible interaction among singletons and schools of all sizes and then applied to the existing densities such that each within species encounter results in the fusion of the two entities be it singletons or schools for example the number of cisco cisco interactions λf f that involve only singletons is 2 λ f f ρ f v 1 e 4 3 v f π ρ f d f 2 n s 199 e v f 2 v s 2 3 1 v f π ρ n s d f 3 0 0038 n s π 2 where the light square bracket encloses the number of singletons i e their density multiplied by lake volume the dark square brackets encloses the probability of singleton to singleton encounters and the set braces enclose the probability of not encountering schools that contain 2 to 199 individuals following this calculation the abundance of singletons would be reduced by λf f and the abundance of schools with two individuals would be increased by half of λf f only school sizes up to 74 and 199 fish were explicitly counted for lake trout cisco and cisco cisco encounters respectively after which all schools of greater size were grouped together and assigned a volume corresponding to either 75 or 200 individuals these two alternative maximum sizes limit the allometrically driven detection distances to the maximum distance measured in lake opeongo dunlop et al 2010 in the model singletons and smaller schools will continue to join these large schools yet their visibility will remain that of the maximum size see table 1 for all the model parameters our three main assumptions regarding lake trout foraging are 1 predatory encounters do not split schools for significant time periods or significantly influence the rate of school formation 2 lake trout always move as ideal gas particles and thus will not remain with a school following the initial attack and 3 lake trout do not change their foraging strategy over the course of the 8 h study period we address these simplifying assumptions in our discussion of the model and field results 2 4 field surveys all field surveys were conducted on the south arm of lake opeongo 45 42 n 78 22 w a 58 km2 oligotrophic lake with a maximum depth of 49 4 m mobile fisheries acoustic surveys for the purpose of biomass estimates and fish ecological research have been carried out annually since 1999 on lake opeongo in association with the ontario ministry of mines northern development natural resources and forestry nrf harkness laboratory of fisheries research e g dunlop et al 2010 the surveys included in this study utilized simrad systems kongsberg maritime kongsberg norway including ek60 7 x7 split beam 70 khz and 120 khz transducers two ek60 4 x10 split beam 120 khz transducers and a sm2000 200 khz multibeam transducer mounted from aluminum poles affixed to the mid ship of survey vessels daytime mobile surveys were conducted on july 13 and 14 august 16 and 21 and september 21 22 and 23 2009 to measure the density of cisco singletons and schools within the pelagic zone as described in a series of studies de kerckhove et al 2015a b extensive day and night mobile and fixed platform acoustic surveys were conducted in 2009 and 2010 to characterize the behavior of cisco and lake trout within the pelagic zone all surveys and data analyses adhered to the great lakes standard operating protocols parker stetter et al 2009 and all split beam transducers were calibrated at the time and location of the surveys as per the recommendations of the manufacturers all raw acoustic data were processed using echoview myriax software pty ltd version 5 2 70 and included their 2d school detection module and fish track detection module all data within 5 m from the surface and beyond a depth of 15 m were excluded from the analysis to avoid non target detections all echograms school detections and fish tracks were examined to identify and remove bad data regions due to electronic noise cavitation and bottom intrusion within the analysis area and non target detections estimates of the magnitude of background noise at 1 m were obtained from passive listening of each transducer and removed from the sv data using the time varied gain data generator and linear subtraction operator in echoview we report standard transducer and calibration parameters in table s1 in the supplementary materials and extensively describe our analysis methodologies in associated publications de kerckhove et al 2015b cisco singleton and school densities were estimated separately and only added together to estimate the overall density of cisco entities to be able to compare between surveys with different transects the average density of the fish and schools was calculated by 1 partitioning the transects into 100 m long sampling units i e elementary distance sampling units edsus and 2 randomly sampling with replacement 1000 edsus from each survey and taking the average density from the set lake trout predatory behavior was analyzed by visually examining 24 h fixed platform acoustics surveys conducted between october 14th and 30th 2010 interactions between schools and fish tracks were assumed to involve a lake trout predatory strike if 1 the fish track contained target strength values greater than the maximum response for cisco i e 32 db using target strength size relationships in frouzova et al 2005 and 2 the schools displayed evasive manoeuvers see nøttestad and axelsen 1999 the timing and extent of the interaction was recorded as well as the number of repeated strikes netting surveys were conducted routinely on lake opeongo with lake trout the primary target sandstrom and lester 2009 suspended pelagic net surveys of cisco were conducted in 1995 1999 2001 and 2007 2010 see table a2 these surveys generally followed a common protocol and used the same set of nets milne et al 2005 both programs were completed in conjunction with our acoustic surveys and allowed us to differentiate between our study species and non target detections frouzova et al 2005 cisco catch per unit effort cpue values were compared between years by standardizing all net sizes and soak times for a 1 hour set with the most common gill net gang 46 m long x 2 m deep and by determining the mean and standard deviation of the cpue for each year using equation 5 38 in headrick 2010 3 n 1 2 s 1 2 n 2 2 s 2 2 n 2 s 1 2 n 1 s 2 2 n 1 s 1 2 n 2

different mesh sizes creel surveys have been conducted on lake opeongo during the summer months by the nrf since 1936 matuszek et al 1990 the stomach contents of lake trout are analyzed within 12 h of their capture following a standard protocol we examined the number of coregonid fish prey items found in lake trout stomachs in july august and september between 1993 and 2011 2 5 ideal gas model predictions and empirical tests as noted by fryxell and lundberg 1998 and reiterated by mcgill and mittelbach 2006 extending foraging models to field predictions is typically limited by an inability to measure crucial parameters one of these is clearly the capture success of an individual from a school based on an encounter with the lake trout to estimate how encounter probabilities could represent actual rates of consumption under predation evasion manoeuvers we assumed a declining probability of capture success from encounters with increasingly larger schools as in major 1978 morgan and godin 1985 parrish 1993 krause and godin 1995 krause et al 1998 turesson and brönmark 2004 while empirical findings are varied solitary predators foraging on obligate schoolers rather than facultative schoolers or shoals generally experience a quick decline in capture success with increasing school size even at very small sizes e g 2 to 10 individuals we modelled this expectation with a negative power relationship between the number of fish within a school ns and the probability of capture success pcs 4 p c s n s x where x is 0 for no difference in capture success 0 5 for a moderate loss in capture success i e for school sizes of 2 4 10 50 and 75 the probability of success decreases to approximately 70 50 30 14 and 12 respectively and 1 for a rapid loss of success such that even a school size of 2 confers a 50 loss the igm was run and initialized at six different stock sizes 0 001 0 005 0 01 0 03 0 06 and 0 1 cisco m3 for which the daytime densities of cisco entities over 8 h were 1 compared among each other and 2 used to derive lake trout encounter probabilities per minute for both singletons and schools over all capture success scenarios encounter probabilities with lake trout were calculated at each hour to determine the shape of encounter curves with different stock sizes as the relative densities of singletons and schools changed over the morning to estimate the total morning encounter probabilities the lake trout encounter rates for each minute were summed for the 8 h morning period the influence of the basic parameters on the ideal gas model have been explored well elsewhere gerritsen and strickler 1977 however we conducted a relatively simple global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 to ensure that the most influential parameters swimming speeds and visual acuity would not overwhelm the effects of different cisco stock sizes to our model interpretations as such we elected to resample from normal distributions of our parameters informed from our field surveys dunlop et al 2010 de kerckhove et al 2015a we used the means reported in table 1 with the swimming speed standard deviations for lake trout 0 5 m s cisco singletons 0 06 m s and cisco schools 0 18 m s an arbitrary standard deviation of 1 for visual acuity note that we have already tested an up to 50 variation in reaction distance for the cisco model in de kerckhove et al 2015a we randomly sampled from these distributions 100 times for three density treatment e g 0 1 0 01 and 0 001 cisco m3 to ensure that the 95 confidence intervals on our predicted changes in density and encounter rates over the daytime did not overlap from over a decade of acoustic and netting surveys on lake opeongo it is known that cisco stocks decline over july august and september roughly 0 06 0 03 and 0 01 cisco m3 respectively due in part to predation by lake trout milne et al 2005 vascotto 2006 moryk 2010 de kerckhove et al 2015a our model was used to predict the daytime densities of cisco singletons and schools at these three stock sizes which we then compared to the results of daytime acoustic surveys conducted in july august and september 2009 in addition the differences in the monthly singleton and school densities from the surveys were compared using an anova to examine the influence of changing cisco densities on lake trout consumption the annual average number of cisco found in lake trout stomachs from the creel surveys between 1992 and 2011 was compared to the cpue of cisco from the pelagic netting surveys using ordinary least squares regression 3 results the output of the ideal gas model for the 8 h following dawn nautical twilight at six different cisco stock sizes suggested that relatively high densities of both cisco singletons and schools are only found for the first hour of daylight fig 1 a b after this time all densities declined rapidly and leveled off at a small fraction of their stock sizes by 4 h the proportions of remaining singletons were inversely related to the stock i e 0 04 0 005 and 0 0005 of 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 cisco m3 respectively contrastingly by 4 h the density of schools of all sizes were similar to each other 5 10 5 school m3 regardless of stock size however average school sizes increased with stock size such that after 2 h there were no large schools 100 individuals for the smallest stock size 0 001 m 3 but 76 large schools for intermediate 0 01 m 3 and over 300 for the highest 0 1 m 3 the igm predicted that lake trout encounter probabilities should follow the same general temporal pattern as the changes in density of cisco entities regardless of the capture success parameterization encounters first increased with light levels peaked for a short period in the morning and then declined rapidly to lower levels for the rest of the day see fig 1c d encounter rates with singletons and schools peaked within the first hour at low i e 0 005 m 3 and intermediate 0 03 m 3 stock sizes these dynamics led to asymptotic or dome shaped encounter probability relationships at the first hour of foraging dome shaped relationships with much lower probabilities of encounter at the next two hours and increasingly flat relationships independent of stock sizes for the rest of the morning fig 2 note that varying the swimming speeds or visual acuity of lake trout or cisco entities did not alter these relative patterns nor created overlapping 95 confidence intervals on the curves in figs 1 or 2 taken over the entire morning lake trout were most likely to experience peak encounter probabilities at intermediate stock sizes however in the absence of any limits to lake trout capture success the peak was only marginally larger than at higher stock sizes fig 3 any decline in the effectiveness of capture success decreased the probabilities of encounter in general across all stock sizes and disproportionately more for larger stock sizes leading to more pronounced dome shaped curves daytime acoustic surveys roughly corresponding to our modelled stock sizes of 0 06 0 03 and 0 01 cisco m3 for july august and september respectively demonstrated that cisco singleton densities significantly increased anova f 7 86 df 6 p 0 05 and school densities remained constant fig 4 as stock size declined these empirical results matched our qualitative model predictions and even our quantitative estimates of daytime school densities however observed cisco singleton densities were much higher than we predicted between 4 and 8 h over the last two decades lake trout have been increasing their average consumption of cisco r2 0 52 p 0 01 even as the catch per unit effort of cisco in pelagic gill nets has fallen fig 5 the variation on the gill net catches is high yet typical of netting surveys on lake opeongo the number of cisco found in lake trout stomachs in the creel surveys increased from roughly two to three from 1992 to 2011 fixed platform acoustic surveys identified 53 predation events in which a large fish interacted with a school leading to evasive manoeuvers behavioral notes from observing the interactions include 1 no predation strikes on schools were observed prior to 9 30 am 0 4 decimal time yet afterwards occurred with equal frequency until sunset 2 the duration of the interactions ranged from 1 to 5 min and 3 evasive manoeuvers involved the school splitting into two or more smaller schools or shifting direction 4 discussion performance of the ideal gas model across a wide range of stock sizes demonstrated that there was 1 an inverse relationship between stock size and singleton densities and 2 schools while generally larger demonstrated no differences in densities as stock sizes increased these results suggest that while school size is primarily dependent on stock size distributions of school density are dependent much more on the ideal gas movement parameters as densities decline in the morning the encounter rate between schools becomes so small that the time required to aggregate all schools into one entity would take an extremely long time certainly much more than one day if so limnological parameters including water clarity and volume will determine to a great degree how many schools can be accommodated in the lake before encounter rates drop to negligible levels our model is the first to show how this unintuitive association between population size and school numbers could arise and explains previously puzzling empirical findings despite a targeted effort by the european union no relationship could be found between the stock size and the number of schools in the aegean sea western mediterranean bay of biscay or north sea petitgas et al 2001 complex patterns between stock size and pelagic schools have instead been explored using evolutionary arguments suggesting life history thresholds to the benefit of schooling at low and high densities maury 2017 similarly in freshwater no relationships were found in fifteen lakes in sweden turesson and brönmark 2007 who suggested lower visibility as the factor limiting encounter rates in highly productive systems nor in our own temporal surveys on lake opeongo although note that holubova et al 2019 noted density dependent effects on schooling and shoaling across multiple species within a lake in contrast we predicted a straightforward relationship between stock sizes and the distribution of school sizes which has been commonly found in these same oceans petitgas et al 2001 willis 2008 and lakes turesson and brönmark 2007 holubova et al 2019 and even for terrestrial herds buuveibaatar et al 2013 our contribution of an internal mechanism to these empirical observations supports the hypothesis that there are fundamental emergent properties of aquatic animal aggregations brierley and cox 2010 further our results call into question the use of simpler characterizations of group formation that ensure a linear relationship between population size and group density e g a becker and doring equation in geritz and gyllenberg 2013 the derivation of encounter probabilities for lake trout using the igm demonstrated that 1 the first hour of foraging would yield the greatest encounter probabilities over the daytime 2 on the shape of encounter probabilities could yield asymptotic dome shaped and uniformly flat curves depending on the time of day and the target prey i e singletons or schools and 3 over the 8 h period a dome shaped curve best represented the overall encounter probabilities if lake trout were susceptible to evasive maneuvers by schools it is first important to note that across the day encounter probabilities were much lower than would be experienced if individual cisco were dispersed randomly so here group conspicuousness does not offset the benefits of increased spacing between groups when comparing aggregating with non aggregating species kiltie 1980 turner and pitcher 1986 ioannou et al 2011 however inherent in the igm model is the influence of school conspicuousness on encounter rates which here appeared to lead slightly higher encounter rates with predators with the larger school sizes and equivalent school densities thus within aggregating species conspicuousness could remain an important ecological variable this result presents a novel cost benefit interpretation of school spacing versus conspicuousness suggesting that fitness benefits for the cisco would drive behavior that limits school sizes or initiates diel vertical migrations into darker depths of the water column any decreases in capture success on the other hand leads to lower and dome shaped encounter probabilities this result is intuitive as whichever stock produces the largest schools will be least protected from predation events based directly on the capture success parameterization our finding of dome shaped prey encounter rate vs stock size curves in the morning may explain why our empirical results suggest that lake trout foraging rates increased as cisco stocks fell over the last 20 years in lake opeongo later in the day all the response curves increasingly flattened to uniform and low encounter probabilities across all stock sizes resembling the very flat type ii functional responses derived for lake trout from bioenergetics models that did not incorporate prey aggregation eby et al 1995 these results and the observation that cisco schools disaggregate only once light levels are too low for lake trout to forage milne et al 2005 all suggest that the morning foraging period is the only opportunity for lake trout to experience different encounter rates based on cisco stock sizes other sources of evidence from our lake monitoring datasets further support the importance of morning foraging with a particular focus on cisco individuals first in our creel analysis of lake trout stomach contents if we separated lake trout caught in the morning from those caught in the afternoon we found that only the morning data showed a significant increase in intake rates of cisco r2 0 41 p 0 05 fig a2 over the last 20 years second from our fixed platform acoustic surveys we did not observe predation events on schools prior to 9 30 am even though schools had formed long before see fig a3 both these observations suggest that lake trout may change their behavior over the course of the day and instead target individual cisco first thing in the morning to take advantage of their high density and vulnerability if so this would further increase the likelihood of a unimodal encounter curve see fig a4 because the encounter probability is best for individuals in mid sized stocks and remains much lower after the morning period for all stock sizes despite the evidence presented above it is important to recognize some caveats with our conclusion as well as to revisit some of our assumptions first we noted along with previous work on lake opeongo that cisco schools perform evasive manoeuvers leading to multiple strikes from lake trout predators dunlop et al 2010 if lake trout remain with a school once it has an initial encounter they would at least be temporarily abandoning ideal gas movement once a detection is made if so encounter rates would certainly increase between lake trout and schools which would lead to non random assortments of predators and prey and allow the lake trout to forage more effectively across all stock sizes second our model ignores the bioenergetic limits to foraging as well as handling time it is very unlikely that lake trout can actively forage every minute of the day and instead must rest digest and handle prey and so the cumulative effects of the early morning s high encounter rates may not overwhelm the flat curves over the rest of the day third and similar to the last we ignore the effects of water temperature on swimming speed which could influence the interpretation of our empirical data for our monthly contrasts but not necessarily our timeseries across the years our annual monitoring does not suggest great changes in temperature however we note from our sensitivity analyses that densities have a much larger effect on the encounter rates than swimming speeds last cisco singleton densities appeared to be higher in our field surveys than the model predicted while they were still low enough to not greatly influence the daily encouter rates with lake trout there are a few implications of this observation that violate the assumptions of our model it may suggest that isolated cisco individuals may change their behavior later in the morning stop seeking schools and perhaps focus on foraging it could also result from lake trout repeatedly striking one school see fig a5 leading to a dispersion of individual cisco across the daytime and last the higher densities for observed cisco could indicate that the pelagic zone is not a uniform arena for their movement martinez garcia et al 2020 while we reported uniform densities of schools and cisco across two dimensional surface of the lake basin de kerckhove et al 2015a it is possible that changes in depth through diel vertical movements could lead to non uniform distributions of individual cisco while we did not have sufficient information on handling times and predator behaviours to estimate a functional response the effects of stock size on encounter rate will often produce functional responses with a similar qualitative form as encounter is a necessary component of predation community dynamics are sensitive to the shape and magnitude of the functional response employed to model predator prey interactions murdoch et al 2003 turchin 2003 abrams 2010 as such the choice between a type ii and dome shaped curves could lead to different population dynamics and different courses of action in the management of economically important schooling fish species freedman and wolkowicz 1986 further our study suggests that the trade off between group size and group density in terms of predator encounter rates remains a compelling question ioannou et al 2010 and requires more investigation into predator consumption rates and the associated prey mortality our model provides motivation for further study into the influence of the predator s capture success and the dilution effect contributed by the number of fish in the school turner and pitcher 1986 on the per capita mortality of the prey given the need to revive ecological debate on this topic we echo geritz and gyllenberg 2013 ioannou et al 2010 call for a more explicit exploration of predator prey dynamics using models that mechanistically represent schooling behavior prey detection and predator consumption rates last we revisit that maury 2017 used an evolutionary argument to suggest that the properties of schooling may lead to greater ecosystem stability in oceans maury 2017 arguments coupled with the inherent stabilizing properties of type iii functional responses neutal and thorne 2015 may begin to explain the ubiquity of aggregated prey in pelagic systems eqs 1a 1e 2 4 credit authorship contribution statement derrick de kerckhove

24419,bioclimate envelope models were evaluated for possible spatial nonstationarity for american lobster homarus americanus in the gulf of maine gom five environmental variables were considered including bottom water temperature bottom water salinity distance offshore sediment grain size and latitude three models accounting for varying degrees of spatial nonstationarity were developed and evaluated spatial scales developed in these models were determined by the patterns of the gom coastal currents and the associated affects these currents have on the gom oceanography this study suggests that incorporating spatial nonstationarity into habitat suitability modeling may lead to improved models forecast plots for the 2028 2055 period revealed that traditional modeling techniques applied at coarse spatial scales estimated higher suitability of habitat for juvenile lobsters than models at smaller spatial scales for adult lobsters coarse spatial model yielded higher suitability in both coastal waters in western gom and farther offshore waters in eastern gom and generally estimated lower suitability in coastal eastern gom waters and some offshore western gom waters compared to finer scale spatial models these results demonstrate how hsi estimates would vary based on the choice of spatial scales and its consequences this information could benefit future stakeholders to prepare and adapt at more localized scales for changes that may occur in a region that is susceptible to climate change keywords american lobster31 bioclimate model2 climate change3 gulf of maine4 habitat suitability5 nonstationary6 scale dependent7 1 introduction evidence of environmental and ecological gradients throughout the gulf of maine gom suggests the culturing of nonstationary species environment relationships spatial nonstationarity can be defined as the presence of variation in relationships between independent and dependent variables across space windle et al 2012 however it is common for species environmental models to assume spatial stationarity which assumes relationships to be constant over space chang et al 2016 tanaka et al 2019 biases and model inaccuracies may arise when assuming spatial stationarity in a spatially heterogeneous environment because in an environment that exhibits spatial nonstationarity the association between dependent and independent variables decreases with increasing distance brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 2002 past literature has found evidence of spatial nonstationarity existing within the gom li et al 2018 staples et al 2019 although evidence of spatial nonstationarity exists within this region previous literature has not explored how habitat suitability index hsi model estimates could change based on the spatial scale at which the model is run this idea is called the zoning effect and occurs when statistical analysis results can differ based on how zones of an area of interest are defined and grouped fotheringham et al 2002 we postulate that the zoning effect is likely to occur when analyzing species distribution data in the gom due to the spatial nonstationarity that has been observed in this region thus it is possible that estimating habitat suitability at localized scales will be more biologically reflective than models that operate across broader spatial scales hsi models also known as bioclimate or bioclimate envelope models are widely used to estimate and predict the habitat suitability for a species at a given location tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 torre et al 2018 tanaka et al 2019 there are many types of bioclimate model approaches but the approach used in this study is the statistical bioclimate model heikkinen et al 2006 hsi models are useful for evaluating the quality of habitat for a particular species based on density observations and environmental conditions across a spatial extent of interest information generated by these models can be crucial to assessing how habitat quality is changing over space and or time guan et al 2017 torre et al 2018 hsi models estimate suitability indices sis for each environmental variable included in the model these sis represent a relationship between abundance and the selected environmental variable and assume that observations of high density are indicative of high quality habitat conditions for that species runnebaum et al 2018 the bioclimate models used in this study were applied to the gom coastal region the gom is an inlet of the atlantic ocean that spans from nova scotia to massachusetts and is considered to be one of the most biologically productive marine ecosystems townsend 1991 with a northeast to southwest productivity gradient observed in this region chang et al 2016 gradients in temperature and salinity have also been observed pettigrew et al 1998 chang et al 2016 and these variables are known to have significant influences on american lobster life history parameters lawton and lavalli 1995 quinn and rochette 2015 asmfc 2020 homarus americanus the american lobster is a benthic crustacean that supports the most valuable fishery in the united states noaa 2018 in 2019 the american lobster fishery was worth more than 630 million dollars where approximately 77 of the fishery s landings can be attributed to the state of maine lobster fishery accsp 2019 american lobster can be found along northwest atlantic waters from newfoundland to the mid atlantic region of the united states waddy aiken 1986 american lobsters are also found in a variety of habitats where the preference of these habitats has been thought to be influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature salinity substrate depth distance offshore and presence or absence of shelter previous literature has shown that american lobsters tend to exhibit a thermal preference between 12 and 18 c crossin et al 1998 and salinity preference between 20 32 ppt jury et al 1994 tanaka and chen 2015 although their substrate preference has been known to vary between life stages lobsters have been observed across a wide range of substrate types including cobble rock mud bedrock sand peat reefs and eelgrass beds lawton and lavalli 1995 using american lobster in the gom as a case study we explore the effects of spatial scale and thus varying assumptions of nonstationary on lobster habitat suitability estimates and compare those results to those of coarse scale models which assume spatial stationary to do this we developed season sex and size specific models to estimate the habitat suitability of american lobsters using bioclimate envelope models that vary in spatial scale variation in estimated habitat suitability between models is evaluated and the implications for what these differences can mean in a region susceptible to climate change are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the maine new hampshire inshore bottom trawl survey maine

coast sediment texture database which is run by the u s geological survey 2014 median sediment size was used as opposed to mean sediment size as median values are more robust to outliers tůmová et al 2019 behan et al 2021 thin plate splines were used to interpolate and estimate median grain size at each survey location these data can be found at https on doi gov 3538sgh and more information about the east coast sediment texture database can be found in u s geological survey 2014 bioclimate models were built using bottom trawl survey data from years 2000 2019 however to interpolate onto unsampled areas and novel time periods that are not covered by the bottom trawl survey supplementary bottom temperature and bottom salinity data were needed behan et al 2021 the needed supplementary data were obtained by spatially interpolating finite volume community ocean model fvcom data fvcom is an advanced ocean circulation model that uses an unstructured grid format making it ideal for usage in areas with complex coasts and bathymetry chen et al 2006 li et al 2017 the university of massachusetts dartmouth and woods hole oceanographic institution developed fvcom and more information about this model and the corresponding data are provided in chen et al 2006 forecasted anomalies for the region were taken from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ensemble projection framework for the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 available from https psl noaa gov ipcc ocn these data representing changes in bottom temperature and bottom salinity from a reference period 1956 2005 to a future period 2006 2055 were downscaled using bivariate spline interpolation with the akima package in r akima gebhardt 2016 before being added to the fvcom bottom temperature and bottom salinity fields however because fvcom data begins in 1978 the reference and future periods were shortened to 1978 2005 and 2028 2055 respectively for more information see behan et al 2021 2 2 model development lobster data were divided into eight groups based on season fall and spring sex female and male and size adult and juvenile chang et al 2016 li et al 2018 behan et al 2021 lobsters with carapace lengths 50mm were classified as juveniles for this study as in behan et al 2021 and due to differences in activity patterns that were found in lawton and lavalli 1995 3 different modeling techniques were applied to each of the eight lobster groups 1 a coarse scale bioclimate envelope model that assumes spatial stationary relationships between lobster abundance and environmental variables across the entire gom 2 a meso scale bioclimate envelope model that estimates unique lobster environment relationships for both eastern and western gom and 3 a fine scale bioclimate envelope model that estimates unique lobster environment relationships for eastern central and western gom see fig 1 for spatial subdivision of data although the hsi model is inherently a stationary model as it assumes constant relationships across the spatial extent to which the model is applied at assumptions of spatial nonstationarity are better satisfied in models 2 and 3 as unique lobster environment relationships are being estimated at localized regions rather than the same global relationships being used across the entire study area as in model 1 fotheringham et al 2002 previous literature have estimated habitat suitability in the gom using the bioclimate envelope model at large spatial scales tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 this traditionally applied technique is represented in this study by model 1 which assumes spatial homogeneity and is applied at the largest spatial scale this technique also assumes that stationary relationships between lobster abundance and environmental factors are sufficient to accurately predict the suitability of a potential or realized habitat location in a region that is ecologically complex other literature has demonstrated the existence of variation in environment abundance relationships across localized regions li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 to test the effects of these differences the bisected model 2 and trisected model 3 models were constructed at increasingly finer spatial scales respectively the purpose of this study is to explore how estimates of habitat suitability differ between models that vary in the degree of spatial nonstationarity assumed in hindcasting and forecasting scenarios the meso scale model model 2 broke up the data into east and west zones as in behan et al 2021 the western zone used data west of 69 27457 longitude eastern gom was represented by data east of 69 27457 longitude the data were subdivided along the 69 27457 longitude line because regions 1 and 2 of the bottom trawl survey are west of the penobscot bay region and 69 27457 is the approximate longitudinal line where region 2 of the bottom trawl survey intersects the coastline in addition this data partitioning location was driven by the gom coastal currents which have been thought to be one factor contributing to the spatial environmental gradients seen across the gulf lynch et al 1997 pettigrew et al 1998 chang et al 2016 and the nonstationarity that has been observed in this region li et al 2018 supporting literature states that the southern extent of the eastern maine coastal current emcc includes the penobscot bay region xue et al 2008 chang et al 2016 thus in model 2 data from the penobscot bay area is included into the designated eastern gom subsection although some literature supports this decision it is difficult to distinguish and establish where the emcc bifurcates and the western maine coastal current wmcc initiates some literature describes the emcc diverging within the penobscot bay region pettigrew et al 2005 or that the location of the split can be variable based on the distribution of slope water in the jordan basin brooks and townsend 1989 brooks 1985 thus the possible mixing of currents in the penobscot bay area could warp clearer relationships that may be established if central gom was represented by its own localized bioclimate model one previous study has used a similar trisected approach to view relationships between initial intra annual molts of american lobster and bottom temperatures in the gom staples et al 2019 consequently the model 3 is built in such way that the western gom region utilizes data west of 69 27457 longitude the central gom region has its own separate season sex and size specific models utilizing data between 69 27457 and 68 58246 longitude and the eastern gom region utilizes data east of 68 58246 longitude spatial coverage for each localized model can be visualized in fig 1 2 2 1 variable selection explanatory variable selection is an important part of the model development process as poor selection of appropriate covariates for a species model type or spatial area can lead to incorrect spurious or confounding results nonstationary models have the ability to account for spatial and temporal dependencies that cannot be explained solely by the explanatory variables included in the model bakka et al 2016 prior to model construction covariance testing revealed extreme covariance between distance from shore and average depth subsequently variance inflation factor vif tests revealed average depth to have high multicollinearity with the other factors having a 3 value zurr et al 2009 thus ultimately average depth was excluded from the final models and distance from shore was kept additionally latitude and longitude variables were highly correlated and resulted in vif numbers 3 so latitude was chosen to be kept over longitude because latitude was more significant at predicting lobster abundance in this study region significant variables for each localized model were chosen based on results from behan et al 2021 where generalized additive models gams were run on the same localized spatial areas and back fitted to check for spatial variable significance previous literature supports the inclusion of temperature salinity distance offshore sediment size and latitude as potential covariates in this study as these variables have been known to influence american lobster spatial distribution and habitat selection aiken and waddy 1986 asmfc 2020 chang et al 2010a 2010b lawton and lavalli 1995 sennick n d quinn and rochette 2015 only variables that were shown to be statistically significant p 0 05 at each localized area were included in the respective bioclimate models chang et al 2010 latitude and bottom water temperature variables were included in every bioclimate model bottom salinity distance from shore and sediment size were included in some models but not all based on local significance variables included in each model are summarized in table 1 2 2 2 suitability indices once significant variables were determined a bioclimate envelope model was run on each spatial region outlined in fig 1 the bioclimate envelope model generates habitat suitability indices hsis on a scale from 0 least suitable habitat to 1 most suitable habitat based on suitability indices sis of covariates thought to influence habitat quality and preference tanaka and chen 2015 the relationship between an environmental variable and lobster abundance is quantified by the si where then all sis are combined to form the overall hsi for a specific location runnebaum et al 2018 sis were determined via a technique known as the histogram method vinagre et al 2006 tanaka and chen 2015 to determine the optimum number of bins for the histograms the freedman diaconis rule freedman and diaconis 1981 was applied to the region with the least amount of data model 3 central gom region and the resulting optimum number of bins 14 was kept constant for all models the freedman diaconis rule finds the optimum bin width with the following equation b i n w i d t h 2 i q r n 1 3 where iqr is the interquartile range and n is the number of observations the optimum number of bins could then be determined by m a x m i n b i n w i d t h where max is the maximum value in the dataset and min is the minimum value in the dataset freedman and diaconis 1981 the freedman diaconis rule was used to find the optimum number of bins to use for the histogram method and fisher s natural breaks classification method was used to distinguish bin extents bivand 2019 tanaka and chen 2015 once sis were estimated for each variable and for each lobster group sis of significant variables for each respective lobster group were combined to form an overall hsi which ranged from 0 to 1 we used the arithmetic mean model amm tanaka and chen 2015 which can be written as h s i v 1 v s i v v where siv is the si of environmental variable v and v is the total number of environmental variables thus all variables had equal weighting as was done in tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 and hodgdon et al 2021 2 3 habitat suitability index and relative difference plots hindcasted habitat distributions were generated for each combination of lobster group and model for years 2000 2006 2012 and 2017 representing an approximate spread over the period of interest forecasted distribution plots for the period 2028 2055 were generated for each combination of lobster group and model differences between model 1 and models 2 or 3 were determined by calculating relative differences between habitat suitability estimates relative differences were estimated using the equation r e l a t i v e d i f f e r e n c e i n s e s t i m a t e d h s i i s e s t i m a t e d h s i i s e s t i m a t e d h s i i 100 where i is a location within the study area s estimated hsi i is the estimated lobster habitat quality from model 1 and ns estimated hsi i is the estimated lobster habitat quality from either the model 2 or model 3 relative difference plots between models 2 and 3 with model 1 were created for each lobster group and model over the same time frames as the hindcasts and forecasts bivariate splines from the akima r package were used to interpolate habitat suitability and relative difference plots at a high resolution akima and gebhardt 2016 3 results 3 1 suitability indices estimated suitability indices varied between lobster groups and between spatial scales the environmental variable bottom temperature was significant in all models and has been known to be an important habitat indicator for lobster in the gom boudreau et al 2015 tanaka et al 2019 the shape of the temperature si curves for both seasons and for all models generally followed a positive increasing pattern with increasing bottom temperature values followed by a decrease in suitability at higher temperatures for each season estimated temperature si curves for fall female juvenile and spring male adult groups can be seen in fig 2 where bottom temperature si estimates 0 8 indicate suitable thermal habitat as distinguished in tanaka and chen 2015 all si curves for each lobster group and for each covariate can be found in the supplementary material supplementary figs 1 10 latitude was also significant in every model model 1 and model 3 east and central latitude si curves were both unimodal in shape with highest suitability estimates occurring around 44 n in model 1 groups 44 3 n in model 3 east groups and around 43 8 n in model 3 central groups western region si curves for latitude demonstrated highest suitability around 43 9 n while model 2 east curves showed highest suitability around 43 9 n in adult groups and around 43 6 n in juvenile groups other environmental variables such as salinity distance offshore and sediment were not all significant across all models but for those that were and included in the model development estimated si curves still showed similar pattern where the si curve estimated for model 1 tended to more closely resemble the si curve of a specific region in the gom and less of the others see the supplementary materials for si curve figures for all variables and all lobster groups supplementary figs 1 10 3 2 habitat suitability index plots results derived from the amm hsi models were plotted for the hindcast years of 2000 2006 2012 and 2017 and for the forecast period of 2028 2055 multiple paired t tests were run between each model and with the exception of spring male adults spma in 2017 all p vales were 0 05 indicating that estimates from each model were significantly different from each other supplementary table 1 all models 1 3 generally estimated high suitability of habitat in coastal eastern gom where adult and fall groups showed higher suitability estimates slightly farther offshore than their juvenile or spring group counterparts see 2017 estimates in figs 3 and 4 as examples a trend was also observed in all hindcast years where higher hsis were estimated in the east in smaller scale fall models i e models 2 and 3 than for the fall model at the largest traditionally used spatial scale model 1 fig 3 differences in estimated hsis can also be seen in supplementary figs 11 12 where mean hsi estimates across the longitudinal profile of this study were plotted for both fall and spring of 2017 and the forecast year 2028 2055 in the central gom region comparative hsi plots demonstrate that fall plots for model 3 tended to yield a hot spot of suitable habitat hsi 0 9 around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions see fig 3 owl s head and tenants harbor regions are labeled in fig 1 of central gom model 3 yielded higher hsis in this area than any other model see supplementary fig 11 2017 flfa panel model 1 estimated higher mean values in fall and spring juvenile groups for all years during the hindcast period while model 2 commonly estimated higher mean hsi values in fall and spring adult groups during the hindcast period with the exception of fall male adults in 2012 where model 3 resulted in greatest mean hsis see supplementary table 2 models 2 and 3 in the fall better showcase the known cold spot seen in the inshore penobscot bay or sears island region fig 3 sears island region labeled in fig 1 an area where poor lobster settlement has been observed steneck and wilson 2001 and is also likely associated with poor habitat suitability specifically model 3 estimated hsis as low as 0 2 in the 2006 and 2012 hindcasts model 2 estimated this same area at an hsi of around 0 3 or higher whereas model 1 estimated hsis of at least 0 6 or higher for almost all hindcasted years this supports evidence that model localization may better reflect biological realism in the spring results showed that model 3 also predicted lower hsi values in the inner penobscot bay region and highlighted the cold spot more than models 1 or 2 did mean hsi estimates in spring 2017 were generally lower in the central gom region for model 3 in all lobster groups supplementary fig 11 and showed an overall lower mean hsi throughout the study area supplementary table 2 when compared to models 1 and 2 estimates comparison of hsi distribution plots showed that by comparing the most recent hindcast plots 2017 to the forecast estimates the proportion of suitable habitat i e hsi 0 6 in the fall has declined in farther offshore waters from 2017 to the 2028 2055 period figs 3 and 5 this observation was more prominent in eastern gom than for western conversely in the spring the proportion of suitable habitat 0 6 had increased in more offshore waters from 2017 to 2028 2055 figs 4 and 6 similar to the trends observed in the hindcast plots fall forecast model 3 plots estimated high hsis around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions of central gom with exception to the fall male adults flma group fall forecast model 3 plots also estimated low hsis in the sears island region compared to models 1 or 2 with an exception to the fall female adult flfa group fig 5 spring forecast model 3 plots also show these distinctions around sears island and tenants harbor but the common settlement hot spot that was observed around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions appears to have moved further offshore and to the east fig 6 3 3 relative difference hsi plots 3 3 1 model 1 vs model 2 relative differences were estimated between models 1 and 2 as well as between models 1 and 3 hindcast relative difference plots in the fall show that model 1 tended to estimate hsis higher than model 2 does throughout most of the gom in fall juveniles as well as in spring juveniles but to a lesser extent fig 7 in some fall and spring female juvenile relative difference plots for almost all hindcast years 2000 2017 there is evidence of model 2 estimating higher habitat suitability in waters farther offshore than model 1 did in western gom e g fig 7 this could be a sign that the finer scale model model 2 is suggesting that suitable habitat for juvenile lobster is not limited to the most inshore regions of western gom this also supports observations that lobsters have been moving towards farther offshore waters than in previous decades amfsc 2020 tanaka et al 2020 for adults model 2 estimated higher or similar hsis in western gom especially in fall male adult flma groups in 2017 fig 7 similar to juveniles model 2 adult estimations were lower in eastern gom when compared to model 1 estimations in the same region but these differences occurred in waters further offshore while model 2 estimated higher suitability in more nearshore waters when compared to model 1 hsi estimates in eastern gom fig 7 this was especially true for the flma group in eastern gom in 2017 fig 7 3 3 2 model 1 vs model 2 in relative difference plots between models 1 and 3 similar trends were still apparent that were noted in the relative difference plots between models 1 2 but the differences observed between models 1 and 3 were more extreme fig 7 juvenile group relative differences were large with model 3 estimating that the habitat for juveniles across the majority of the gom is less suitable than model 1 estimates especially in western gom and for fall groups fig 7 see supplementary fig 13 the proportion of area each model estimated at each hsi in 2017 for adult groups similar trends were observed in both spring and fall where model 3 had lower hsi estimates in coastal western and inner penobscot bay and farther offshore eastern waters than model 1 estimated conversely model 3 estimated higher habitat suitability in farther offshore western waters and for coastal eastern gom waters these trends were present in both fall and spring but in spring to a lesser degree fig 7 3 3 3 relative difference plots for forecast period in relative difference plots for the forecast period 2028 2055 many of the same trends persisted from the hindcast period to the forecast period for both seasons juvenile relative difference plots revealed that both models 2 and 3 estimated lower hsis than their model 1 counterparts throughout the majority of the gom supplementary fig 12 supplementary table 2 this can also be seen in fig 8 by the overwhelmingly higher proportion of red orange and yellow colors in each figure panel which designate that the finer scale models i e models 2 or 3 had a lower estimated hsi at a specific location than model 1 did in adult groups there was more of an even spread of relative underestimation and overestimation by model 1 where specifically in fall adult groups both models 2 and 3 estimated greater hsis in coastal inshore eastern gom and farther offshore western gom waters and estimated lower hsis in farther offshore central and eastern waters and coastal western gom fig 8 in the spring there were not as large of relative differences between adult groups in models 1 and 2 fig 8 and supplementary fig 12 but there were greater relative differences highlighted in the central gom region where model 3 estimated lower hsis in the inner penobscot bay region sears island and where model 3 estimated higher hsis in more offshore waters in central gom fig 8 4 discussion this study developed a modeling approach to explore the possible impacts of ignoring spatial heterogeneity of species environment relationships in habitat suitability index models across an environmentally and ecologically complex area the gom final hsi estimates yielded from the bioclimate model ultimately depend on the combination of estimated shape of the si curves between lobster abundance and environmental variables from these si curves many factors such as the proportion range and magnitude of suitable habitat have the potential to vary based on inclusion exclusion or partitioning of data in the model the shape and suitable range for environmental variable si curves exhibited variation across different localized scales this suggests that if a bioclimate model were applied to an environmentally and ecologically complex area at coarse spatial scale then the results may more accurately represent one localized region of the entire study area rather than well representing all spatial areas throughout the extent of the area of interest we speculate that one reason for these observations is that the coarse scale model could have a tendency to favor regions with higher variance in its data when estimating relationships between habitat suitability and environmental conditions this further highlights the importance of considering spatial scale in model development so that the masking effect brunsdon et al 1996 windle et al 2012 commonly observed in stationary models and global statistics can be limited and that localized differences can be better captured spring forecast models demonstrated an easterly shift in the estimated hot spot location when compared to hindcast estimates around the same location this shift in hot spot location is unique to spring model 3 forecasts and could be a result of this model better detecting northeast and offshore temporal shifts that have been thought to be occurring and are thought to continue to occur into the future goode et al 2019 mazur et al 2020 although there are no explicit temporal variables included in the development of any models tested in this study accounting for assumptions of nonstationarity has been thought to account for spatial dependencies which can t solely be explained by environmental variables bakka et al 2016 results from the relative difference plots between model 1 and model 2 or 3 highlighted the effects that assumptions of spatial scale have on model results some of the clearest patterns in spatial differences occurred in the central gom region we speculate the most prominent differences between models could be seen in this region because in model 3 central gom had its own unique model run on this area and therefore had the most potential to pick up on localized patterns the model 3 central gom region was the smallest scale model in this study and thus localized patterns are more likely to be emphasized because spatially irrelevant or less relevant data are not included in the model and thus only the most spatially relevant data can influence relationships in that area the relative differences between models 1 and 3 generally followed many of the same patterns of relative differences observed between models 1 and 2 but were typically more extreme we speculate this is the result of the differences in spatial scales between models 2 and 3 where assumptions of spatial nonstationarity in model 3 are better satisfied and thus more distinct from model 1 assumptions of stationarity it is important to recognize that larger differences from model 1 do not automatically mean that model 3 is the most biologically realistic model as it is difficult to determine the initial biological accuracy of model 1 determining the amount of biological realism a bioclimate model captures is particularly challenging as there are no raw or observable data for lobster habitat suitability available and thus estimates of hsi cannot be compared to any observed estimates hodgdon et al 2021 however model 3 results of this study correlate well with findings from behan et al 2021 and steneck and wilson 2001 especially in the central gom region which suggests strong model fit and biological realism in bioclimate models areas of good habitat are assumed to correlate with areas where high abundance have been observed and vice versa with areas of poor habitat biases can arise in conjunction of this assumption because lobsters tend to prefer rocky cobble or boulder habitat with plentiful locations to hide or take shelter lawton and lavalli 1995 these optimal shelter locations may not always be included in trawl surveys because trawls cannot be swept over areas with complex bottom topography or other obstructions such as areas densely fished with lobster traps it has also been thought that as a species density increases the spatial distribution of that species will also expand brown 1984 petitgas 1998 anderson and gregory 2000 this may lead to situations where individuals occupy a less suitable habitat because locations with the most suitable habitat are already occupied american lobster stocks have increased fivefold since the 1980s goode et al 2019 and densely populated areas could become less suitable as competition or susceptibility of disease increased effects of density dependent habitat selection could ultimately lead to differences between fundamental and realized niches and thus hsi model estimates a limitation of this study is that it only considers environmental variables as covariates future studies may benefit from the inclusion of biological covariates such as lobster density or predator and prey densities future studies should also explore how hsi estimates change using non trawl data such as scuba surveys or traps which might better survey sheltered habitat locations in this study all covariates are assumed to have equal influence on habitat suitability which is not likely to be a biologically reflective assumption although this study only considered statistically significant environmental covariates unique to each local model table 1 the influence of each significant covariate is not likely equal and future studies may benefit from incorporating weighted covariates in tandem with nonstationarity studies the smallest spatial scale explored in this study was approximately 2554 km2 sherman et al 2005 future studies may also benefit from exploring how different methodologies of data partitioning and scaling can impact model results another inherent limitation of the current study is the variegated nature of the results that comes from using multiple models in a patchwork design over a spatial extent reasonably there do not exist abrupt changes in habitat suitability where two models meet thus this approach should be used to determine trends in hsi estimates not to develop spatially precise calculations of habitat lastly temporal nonstationarity was not considered in this study as the focus of this study was to explore the effects of spatial nonstationarity due to the evidence that has been observed in past studies li et al 2018 in regards to exploring temporal nonstationarity due to the relatively short time period of data available to this study we made the assumption that not enough temporal nonstationarity is present to require accounting for potential temporal changes but if longer term projections were to be made temporal nonstationarity would likely need to be considered this however is outside the scope of this study this study suggests that lobster habitat suitability estimates are dependent on spatial scale and assumptions of nonstationarity due to this dependence global statistics models may mask localized effects resulting in ill informed management practices future management of the resource may benefit from region specific regulations using localized modelling approaches as was done in this study as an example if model 3 is indeed more biologically realistic than traditionally utilized stationary approaches as past literature suggests then traditionally used models may be overestimating juvenile lobster habitat this could result in a false security of recruitment expectations in future years as the suitability of habitat would likely be lower than a coarse scale model would predict for adult lobsters coarse scale models are likely to comparatively overestimate habitat suitability in western gom nearshore waters and further offshore waters of eastern gom while also underestimating further offshore waters in western gom and coastal waters of eastern gom in light of these differences it is important to consider the possibility of local heterogeneity in species habitat modeling and as it relates to the management of that species false overestimations of habitat suitability could lead to false perceptions of the current and future state and location of a population such false perceptions could result in relaxed regulations or ill informed biological reference point calculations for marine species relaxed regulations at inappropriate locations could potentially lead to overfishing and potential population decline or underfishing at other localized areas which could result in economic loss quality habitat suitability estimates will assist stakeholders in developing and implementing best practice methods to ensure the sustainability and longevity of a commercially valuable industry as we enter a new climate regime and smaller scale models may better capture these localized changes

24419,bioclimate envelope models were evaluated for possible spatial nonstationarity for american lobster homarus americanus in the gulf of maine gom five environmental variables were considered including bottom water temperature bottom water salinity distance offshore sediment grain size and latitude three models accounting for varying degrees of spatial nonstationarity were developed and evaluated spatial scales developed in these models were determined by the patterns of the gom coastal currents and the associated affects these currents have on the gom oceanography this study suggests that incorporating spatial nonstationarity into habitat suitability modeling may lead to improved models forecast plots for the 2028 2055 period revealed that traditional modeling techniques applied at coarse spatial scales estimated higher suitability of habitat for juvenile lobsters than models at smaller spatial scales for adult lobsters coarse spatial model yielded higher suitability in both coastal waters in western gom and farther offshore waters in eastern gom and generally estimated lower suitability in coastal eastern gom waters and some offshore western gom waters compared to finer scale spatial models these results demonstrate how hsi estimates would vary based on the choice of spatial scales and its consequences this information could benefit future stakeholders to prepare and adapt at more localized scales for changes that may occur in a region that is susceptible to climate change keywords american lobster31 bioclimate model2 climate change3 gulf of maine4 habitat suitability5 nonstationary6 scale dependent7 1 introduction evidence of environmental and ecological gradients throughout the gulf of maine gom suggests the culturing of nonstationary species environment relationships spatial nonstationarity can be defined as the presence of variation in relationships between independent and dependent variables across space windle et al 2012 however it is common for species environmental models to assume spatial stationarity which assumes relationships to be constant over space chang et al 2016 tanaka et al 2019 biases and model inaccuracies may arise when assuming spatial stationarity in a spatially heterogeneous environment because in an environment that exhibits spatial nonstationarity the association between dependent and independent variables decreases with increasing distance brunsdon et al 1996 fotheringham et al 2002 past literature has found evidence of spatial nonstationarity existing within the gom li et al 2018 staples et al 2019 although evidence of spatial nonstationarity exists within this region previous literature has not explored how habitat suitability index hsi model estimates could change based on the spatial scale at which the model is run this idea is called the zoning effect and occurs when statistical analysis results can differ based on how zones of an area of interest are defined and grouped fotheringham et al 2002 we postulate that the zoning effect is likely to occur when analyzing species distribution data in the gom due to the spatial nonstationarity that has been observed in this region thus it is possible that estimating habitat suitability at localized scales will be more biologically reflective than models that operate across broader spatial scales hsi models also known as bioclimate or bioclimate envelope models are widely used to estimate and predict the habitat suitability for a species at a given location tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 torre et al 2018 tanaka et al 2019 there are many types of bioclimate model approaches but the approach used in this study is the statistical bioclimate model heikkinen et al 2006 hsi models are useful for evaluating the quality of habitat for a particular species based on density observations and environmental conditions across a spatial extent of interest information generated by these models can be crucial to assessing how habitat quality is changing over space and or time guan et al 2017 torre et al 2018 hsi models estimate suitability indices sis for each environmental variable included in the model these sis represent a relationship between abundance and the selected environmental variable and assume that observations of high density are indicative of high quality habitat conditions for that species

literature has shown that american lobsters tend to exhibit a thermal preference between 12 and 18 c crossin et al 1998 and salinity preference between 20 32 ppt jury et al 1994 tanaka and chen 2015 although their substrate preference has been known to vary between life stages lobsters have been observed across a wide range of substrate types including cobble rock mud bedrock sand peat reefs and eelgrass beds lawton and lavalli 1995 using american lobster in the gom as a case study we explore the effects of spatial scale and thus varying assumptions of nonstationary on lobster habitat suitability estimates and compare those results to those of coarse scale models which assume spatial stationary to do this we developed season sex and size specific models to estimate the habitat suitability of american lobsters using bioclimate envelope models that vary in spatial scale variation in estimated habitat suitability between models is evaluated and the implications for what these differences can mean in a region susceptible to climate change are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the maine new hampshire inshore bottom trawl survey maine department of marine resources medmr and the new hampshire fish and game department nhfgd 2000 2019 inshore bottom trawl survey raw data supplied the american lobster abundance data used in this study this survey is semiannual with separate fall and spring seasonal surveys conducted each year the bottom trawl survey spans approximately 16 000 km2 and is subdivided into five survey regions fig 1 sherman et al 2005 these five regions include 1 new hampshire and southern maine 2 mid coast maine 3 penobscot bay 4 mt desert island and 5 downeast maine fig 1 the potential sampling area for this survey extends up to 22 22 km offshore each survey aims to sample 115 stations resulting in a sampling density of approximately 1 station for every 137 20 km2 the data included in this study were composed of depth area stratified random stations which were chosen by dividing the survey area into a 3 43 km2 grid and randomly chosen sherman et al 2005 a target tow of 20 min is set at a speed of 2 2 2 3 knots which covers roughly 1 48 km data from 486 971 individual lobsters were included in this study and all tow data were standardized to 20 min allowing for consistency and compatibility amongst tows tow data were standardized by the following equation a b u n d a n c e i 20 a b u n d a n c e i b 20 t i m e i b where abundancei20 is the estimated lobster abundance for a 20 min tow at location i abundanceib is the observed abundance at trawl b and timeib is the number of minutes trawl b surveyed for the bottom trawl survey records biological and environmental data such as species sex size bottom water temperature bottom water salinity latitude longitude and depth at each tow location sherman et al 2005 additional information about the medmr nhfgd inshore bottom trawl survey procedures protocols or specifics can be found in sherman et al 2005 the medmr nhfgd inshore bottom trawl survey has been found to render reliable and informative data for studying lobster habitat quality in the gom tanaka et al 2019 hodgdon et al 2020 bottom temperature bottom salinity latitude and longitude information from the years 2000 2019 were used from the medmr nhfgd inshore bottom trawl survey to inform the bioclimate models distance from shore and median sediment size variables were also estimated and utilized the distance offshore for each tow of the medmr nhfgd inshore bottom trawl survey was estimated as the distance between latitude and longitude tow midpoint values and the closest coastal point location median sediment grain size data were sourced from the east coast sediment texture database which is run by the u s geological survey 2014 median sediment size was used as opposed to mean sediment size as median values are more robust to outliers tůmová et al 2019 behan et al 2021 thin plate splines were used to interpolate and estimate median grain size at each survey location these data can be found at https on doi gov 3538sgh and more information about the east coast sediment texture database can be found in u s geological survey 2014 bioclimate models were built using bottom trawl survey data from years 2000 2019 however to interpolate onto unsampled areas and novel time periods that are not covered by the bottom trawl survey supplementary bottom temperature and bottom salinity data were needed behan et al 2021 the needed supplementary data were obtained by spatially interpolating finite volume community ocean model fvcom data fvcom is an advanced ocean circulation model that uses an unstructured grid format making it ideal for usage in areas with complex coasts and bathymetry chen et al 2006 li et al 2017 the university of massachusetts dartmouth and woods hole oceanographic institution developed fvcom and more information about this model and the corresponding data are provided in chen et al 2006 forecasted anomalies for the region were taken from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ensemble projection framework for the coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 available from https psl noaa gov ipcc ocn these data representing changes in bottom temperature and bottom salinity from a reference period 1956 2005 to a future period 2006 2055 were downscaled using bivariate spline interpolation with the akima package in r akima gebhardt 2016 before being added to the fvcom bottom temperature and bottom salinity fields however because fvcom data begins in 1978 the reference and future periods were shortened to 1978 2005 and 2028 2055 respectively for more information see behan et al 2021 2 2 model development lobster data were divided into eight groups based on season fall and spring sex female and male and size adult and juvenile chang et al 2016 li et al 2018 behan et al 2021 lobsters with carapace lengths 50mm were classified as juveniles for this study as in behan et al 2021 and due to differences in activity patterns that were found in lawton and lavalli 1995 3 different modeling techniques were applied to each of the eight lobster groups 1 a coarse scale bioclimate envelope model that assumes spatial stationary relationships between lobster abundance and environmental variables across the entire gom 2 a meso scale bioclimate envelope model that estimates unique lobster environment relationships for both eastern and western gom and 3 a fine scale bioclimate envelope model that estimates unique lobster environment relationships for eastern central and western gom see fig 1 for spatial subdivision of data although the hsi model is inherently a stationary model as it assumes constant relationships across the spatial extent to which the model is applied at assumptions of spatial nonstationarity are better satisfied in models 2 and 3 as unique lobster environment relationships are being estimated at localized regions rather than the same global relationships being used across the entire study area as in model 1 fotheringham et al 2002 previous literature have estimated habitat suitability in the gom using the bioclimate envelope model at large spatial scales tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 this traditionally applied technique is represented in this study by model 1 which assumes spatial homogeneity and is applied at the largest spatial scale this technique also assumes that stationary relationships between lobster abundance and environmental factors are sufficient to accurately predict the suitability of a potential or realized habitat location in a region that is ecologically complex other literature has demonstrated the existence of variation in environment abundance relationships across localized regions li et al 2018 liu et al 2019 to test the effects of these differences the bisected model 2 and trisected model 3 models were constructed at increasingly finer spatial scales respectively the purpose of this study is to explore how estimates of habitat suitability differ between models that vary in the degree of spatial nonstationarity assumed in hindcasting and forecasting scenarios the meso scale model model 2 broke up the data into east and west zones as in behan et al 2021 the western zone used data west of 69 27457 longitude eastern gom was represented by data east of 69 27457 longitude the data were subdivided along the 69 27457 longitude line because regions 1 and 2 of the bottom trawl survey are west of the penobscot bay region and 69 27457 is the approximate longitudinal line where region 2 of the bottom trawl survey intersects the coastline in addition this data partitioning location was driven by the gom coastal currents which have been thought to be one factor contributing to the spatial environmental gradients seen across the gulf lynch et al 1997 pettigrew et al 1998 chang et al 2016 and the nonstationarity that has been observed in this region li et al 2018 supporting literature states that the southern extent of the eastern maine coastal current emcc includes the penobscot bay region xue et al 2008 chang et al 2016 thus in model 2 data from the penobscot bay area is included into the designated eastern gom subsection although some literature supports this decision it is difficult to distinguish and establish where the emcc bifurcates and the western maine coastal current wmcc initiates some literature describes the emcc diverging within the penobscot bay region pettigrew et al 2005 or that the location of the split can be variable based on the distribution of slope water in the jordan basin brooks and townsend 1989 brooks 1985 thus the possible mixing of currents in the penobscot bay area could warp clearer relationships that may be established if central gom was represented by its own localized bioclimate model one previous study has used a similar trisected approach to view relationships between initial intra annual molts of american lobster and bottom temperatures in the gom staples et al 2019 consequently the model 3 is built in such way that the western gom region utilizes data west of 69 27457 longitude the central gom region has its own separate season sex and size specific models utilizing data between 69 27457 and 68 58246 longitude and the eastern gom region utilizes data east of 68 58246 longitude spatial coverage for each localized model can be visualized in fig 1 2 2 1 variable selection explanatory variable selection is an important part of the model development process as poor selection of appropriate covariates for a species model type or spatial area can lead to incorrect spurious or confounding results nonstationary models have the ability to account for spatial and temporal dependencies that cannot be explained solely by the explanatory variables included in the model bakka et al 2016 prior to model construction covariance testing revealed extreme covariance between distance from shore and average depth subsequently variance inflation factor vif tests revealed average depth to have high multicollinearity with the other factors having a 3 value zurr et al 2009 thus ultimately average depth was excluded from the final models and distance from shore was kept additionally latitude and longitude variables were highly correlated and resulted in vif numbers 3 so latitude was chosen to be kept over longitude because latitude was more significant at predicting lobster abundance in this study region significant variables for each localized model were chosen based on results from behan et al 2021 where generalized additive models gams were run on the same localized spatial areas and back fitted to check for spatial variable significance previous literature supports the inclusion of temperature salinity distance offshore sediment size and latitude as potential covariates in this study as these variables have been known to influence american lobster spatial distribution and habitat selection aiken and waddy 1986 asmfc 2020 chang et al 2010a 2010b lawton and lavalli 1995 sennick n d quinn and rochette 2015 only variables that were shown to be statistically significant p 0 05 at each localized area were included in the respective bioclimate models chang et al 2010 latitude and bottom water temperature variables were included in every bioclimate model bottom salinity distance from shore and sediment size were included in some models but not all based on local significance variables included in each model are summarized in table 1 2 2 2 suitability indices once significant variables were determined a bioclimate envelope model was run on each spatial region outlined in fig 1 the bioclimate envelope model generates habitat suitability indices hsis on a scale from 0 least suitable habitat to 1 most suitable habitat based on suitability indices sis of covariates thought to influence habitat quality and preference tanaka and chen 2015 the relationship between an environmental variable and lobster abundance is quantified by the si where then all sis are combined to form the overall hsi for a specific location runnebaum et al 2018 sis were determined via a technique known as the histogram method vinagre et al 2006 tanaka and chen 2015 to determine the optimum number of bins for the histograms the freedman diaconis rule freedman and diaconis 1981 was applied to the region with the least amount of data model 3 central gom region and the resulting optimum number of bins 14 was kept constant for all models the freedman diaconis rule finds the optimum bin width with the following equation b i n w i d t h 2 i q r n 1 3 where iqr is the interquartile range and n is the number of observations the optimum number of bins could then be determined by m a x m i n b i n w i d t h where max is the maximum value in the dataset and min is the minimum value in the dataset freedman and diaconis 1981 the freedman diaconis rule was used to find the optimum number of bins to use for the histogram method and fisher s natural breaks classification method was used to distinguish bin extents bivand 2019 tanaka and chen 2015 once sis were estimated for each variable and for each lobster group sis of significant variables for each respective lobster group were combined to form an overall hsi which ranged from 0 to 1 we used the arithmetic mean model amm tanaka and chen 2015 which can be written as h s i v 1 v s i v v where siv is the si of environmental variable v and v is the total number of environmental variables thus all variables had equal weighting as was done in tanaka and chen 2015 runnebaum et al 2018 and hodgdon et al 2021 2 3 habitat suitability index and relative difference plots hindcasted habitat distributions were generated for each combination of lobster group and model for years 2000 2006 2012 and 2017 representing an approximate spread over the period of interest forecasted distribution plots for the period 2028 2055 were generated for each combination of lobster group and model differences between model 1 and models 2 or 3 were determined by calculating relative differences between habitat suitability estimates relative differences were estimated using the equation r e l a t i v e d i f f e r e n c e i n s e s t i m a t e d h s i i s e s t i m a t e d h s i i s e s t i m a t e d h s i i 100 where i is a location within the study area s estimated hsi i is the estimated lobster habitat quality from model 1 and ns estimated hsi i is the estimated lobster habitat quality from either the model 2 or model 3 relative difference plots between models 2 and 3 with model 1 were created for each lobster group and model over the same time frames as the hindcasts and forecasts bivariate splines from the akima r package were used to interpolate habitat suitability and relative difference plots at a high resolution akima and gebhardt 2016 3 results 3 1 suitability indices estimated suitability indices varied between lobster groups and between spatial scales the environmental variable bottom temperature was significant in all models and has been known to be an important habitat indicator for lobster in the gom boudreau et al 2015 tanaka et al 2019 the shape of the temperature si curves for both seasons and for all models generally followed a positive increasing pattern with increasing bottom temperature values followed by a decrease in suitability at higher temperatures for each season estimated temperature si curves for fall female juvenile and spring male adult groups can be seen in fig 2 where bottom temperature si estimates 0 8 indicate suitable thermal habitat as distinguished in tanaka and chen 2015 all si curves for each lobster group and for each covariate can be found in the supplementary material supplementary figs 1 10 latitude was also significant in every model model 1 and model 3 east and central latitude si curves were both unimodal in shape with highest suitability estimates occurring around 44 n in model 1 groups 44 3 n in model 3 east groups and around 43 8 n in model 3 central groups western region si curves for latitude demonstrated highest suitability around 43 9 n while model 2 east curves showed highest suitability around 43 9 n in adult groups and around 43 6 n in juvenile groups other environmental variables such as salinity distance offshore and sediment were not all significant across all models but for those that were and included in the model development estimated si curves still showed similar pattern where the si curve estimated for model 1 tended to more closely resemble the si curve of a specific region in the gom and less of the others see the supplementary materials for si curve figures for all variables and all lobster groups supplementary figs 1 10 3 2 habitat suitability index plots results derived from the amm hsi models were plotted for the hindcast years of 2000 2006 2012 and 2017 and for the forecast period of 2028 2055 multiple paired t tests were run between each model and with the exception of spring male adults spma in 2017 all p vales were 0 05 indicating that estimates from each model were significantly different from each other supplementary table 1 all models 1 3 generally estimated high suitability of habitat in coastal eastern gom where adult and fall groups showed higher suitability estimates slightly farther offshore than their juvenile or spring group counterparts see 2017 estimates in figs 3 and 4 as examples a trend was also observed in all hindcast years where higher hsis were estimated in the east in smaller scale fall models i e models 2 and 3 than for the fall model at the largest traditionally used spatial scale model 1 fig 3 differences in estimated hsis can also be seen in supplementary figs 11 12 where mean hsi estimates across the longitudinal profile of this study were plotted for both fall and spring of 2017 and the forecast year 2028 2055 in the central gom region comparative hsi plots demonstrate that fall plots for model 3 tended to yield a hot spot of suitable habitat hsi 0 9 around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions see fig 3 owl s head and tenants harbor regions are labeled in fig 1 of central gom model 3 yielded higher hsis in this area than any other model see supplementary fig 11 2017 flfa panel model 1 estimated higher mean values in fall and spring juvenile groups for all years during the hindcast period while model 2 commonly estimated higher mean hsi values in fall and spring adult groups during the hindcast period with the exception of fall male adults in 2012 where model 3 resulted in greatest mean hsis see supplementary table 2 models 2 and 3 in the fall better showcase the known cold spot seen in the inshore penobscot bay or sears island region fig 3 sears island region labeled in fig 1 an area where poor lobster settlement has been observed steneck and wilson 2001 and is also likely associated with poor habitat suitability specifically model 3 estimated hsis as low as 0 2 in the 2006 and 2012 hindcasts model 2 estimated this same area at an hsi of around 0 3 or higher whereas model 1 estimated hsis of at least 0 6 or higher for almost all hindcasted years this supports evidence that model localization may better reflect biological realism in the spring results showed that model 3 also predicted lower hsi values in the inner penobscot bay region and highlighted the cold spot more than models 1 or 2 did mean hsi estimates in spring 2017 were generally lower in the central gom region for model 3 in all lobster groups supplementary fig 11 and showed an overall lower mean hsi throughout the study area supplementary table 2 when compared to models 1 and 2 estimates comparison of hsi distribution plots showed that by comparing the most recent hindcast plots 2017 to the forecast estimates the proportion of suitable habitat i e hsi 0 6 in the fall has declined in farther offshore waters from 2017 to the 2028 2055 period figs 3 and 5 this observation was more prominent in eastern gom than for western conversely in the spring the proportion of suitable habitat 0 6 had increased in more offshore waters from 2017 to 2028 2055 figs 4 and 6 similar to the trends observed in the hindcast plots fall forecast model 3 plots estimated high hsis around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions of central gom with exception to the fall male adults flma group fall forecast model 3 plots also estimated low hsis in the sears island region compared to models 1 or 2 with an exception to the fall female adult flfa group fig 5 spring forecast model 3 plots also show these distinctions around sears island and tenants harbor but the common settlement hot spot that was observed around the owl s head to tenants harbor coastal regions appears to have moved further offshore and to the east fig 6 3 3 relative difference hsi plots 3 3 1 model 1 vs model 2 relative differences were estimated between models 1 and 2 as well as between models 1 and 3 hindcast relative difference plots in the fall show that model 1 tended to estimate hsis higher than model 2 does throughout most of the gom in fall juveniles as well as in spring juveniles but to a lesser extent fig 7 in some fall and spring female juvenile relative difference plots for almost all hindcast years 2000 2017 there is evidence of model 2 estimating higher habitat suitability in waters farther offshore than model 1 did in western gom e g fig 7 this could be a sign that the finer scale model model 2 is suggesting that suitable habitat for juvenile lobster is not limited to the most inshore regions of western gom this also supports observations that lobsters have been moving towards farther offshore waters than in previous decades amfsc 2020 tanaka et al 2020 for adults model 2 estimated higher or similar hsis in western gom especially in fall male adult flma groups in 2017 fig 7 similar to juveniles model 2 adult estimations were lower in eastern gom when compared to model 1 estimations in the same region but these differences occurred in waters further offshore while model 2 estimated higher suitability in more nearshore waters when compared to model 1 hsi estimates in eastern gom fig 7 this was especially true for the flma group in eastern gom in 2017 fig 7 3 3 2 model 1 vs model 2 in relative difference plots between models 1 and 3 similar trends were still apparent that were noted in the relative difference plots between models 1 2 but the differences observed between models 1 and 3 were more extreme fig 7 juvenile group relative differences were large with model 3 estimating that the habitat for juveniles across the majority of the gom is less suitable than model 1 estimates especially in western gom and for fall groups fig 7 see supplementary fig 13 the proportion of area each model estimated at each hsi in 2017 for adult groups similar trends were observed in both spring and fall where model 3 had lower hsi estimates in coastal western and inner penobscot bay and farther offshore eastern waters than model 1 estimated conversely model 3 estimated higher habitat suitability in farther offshore western waters and for coastal eastern gom waters these trends were present in both fall and spring but in spring to a lesser degree fig 7 3 3 3 relative difference plots for forecast period in relative difference plots for the forecast period 2028 2055 many of the same trends persisted from the hindcast period to the forecast period for both seasons juvenile relative difference plots revealed that both models 2 and 3 estimated lower hsis than their model 1 counterparts throughout the majority of the gom supplementary fig 12 supplementary table 2 this can also be seen in fig 8 by the overwhelmingly higher proportion of red orange and yellow colors in each figure panel which designate that the finer scale models i e models 2 or 3 had a lower estimated hsi at a specific location than model 1 did in adult groups there was more of an even spread of relative underestimation and overestimation by model 1 where specifically in fall adult groups both models 2 and 3 estimated greater hsis in coastal inshore eastern gom and farther offshore western gom waters and estimated lower hsis in farther offshore central and eastern waters and coastal western gom fig 8 in the spring there were not as large of relative differences between adult groups in models 1 and 2 fig 8 and supplementary fig 12 but there were greater relative differences highlighted in the central gom region where model 3 estimated lower hsis in the inner penobscot bay region sears island and where model 3 estimated higher hsis in more offshore waters in central gom fig 8 4 discussion this study developed a modeling approach to explore the possible impacts of ignoring spatial heterogeneity of species environment relationships in habitat suitability index models across an environmentally and ecologically complex area the gom final hsi estimates yielded from the bioclimate model ultimately depend on the combination of estimated shape of the si curves between lobster abundance and environmental variables from these si curves many factors such as the proportion range and magnitude of suitable habitat have the potential to vary based on inclusion exclusion or partitioning of data in the model the shape and suitable range for environmental variable si curves exhibited variation across different localized scales this suggests that if a bioclimate model were applied to an environmentally and ecologically complex area at coarse spatial scale then the results may more accurately represent one localized region of the entire study area rather than well representing all spatial areas throughout the extent of the area of interest we speculate that one reason for these observations is that the coarse scale model could have a tendency to favor regions with higher variance in its data when estimating relationships between habitat suitability and environmental conditions this further highlights the importance of considering spatial scale in model development so that the masking effect brunsdon et al 1996 windle et al 2012 commonly observed in stationary models and global statistics can be limited and that localized differences can be better captured spring forecast models demonstrated an easterly shift in the estimated hot spot location when compared to hindcast estimates around the same location this shift in hot spot location is unique to spring model 3 forecasts and could be a result of this model better detecting northeast and offshore temporal shifts that have been thought to be occurring and are thought to continue to occur into the future goode et al 2019 mazur et al 2020 although there are no explicit temporal variables included in the development of any models tested in this study accounting for assumptions of nonstationarity has been thought to account for spatial dependencies which can t solely be explained by environmental variables bakka et al 2016 results from the relative difference plots between model 1 and model 2 or 3 highlighted the effects that assumptions of spatial scale have on model results some of the clearest patterns in spatial differences occurred in the central gom region we speculate the most prominent differences between models could be seen in this region because in model 3 central gom had its own unique model run on this area and therefore had the most potential to pick up on localized patterns the model 3 central gom region was the smallest scale model in this study and thus localized patterns are more likely to be emphasized because spatially irrelevant or less relevant data are not included in the model and thus only the most spatially relevant data can influence relationships in that area the relative differences between models 1 and 3 generally followed many of the same patterns of relative differences observed between models 1 and 2 but were typically more extreme we speculate this is the result of the differences in spatial scales between models 2 and 3 where assumptions of spatial nonstationarity in model 3 are better satisfied and thus more distinct from model 1 assumptions of stationarity it is important to recognize that larger differences from model 1 do not automatically mean that model 3 is the most biologically realistic model as it is difficult to determine the initial biological accuracy of model 1 determining the amount of biological realism a bioclimate model captures is particularly challenging as there are no raw or observable data for lobster habitat suitability available and thus estimates of hsi cannot be compared to any observed estimates hodgdon et al 2021 however model 3 results of this study correlate well with findings from behan et al 2021 and steneck and wilson 2001 especially in the central gom region which suggests strong model fit and biological realism in bioclimate models areas of good habitat are assumed to correlate with areas where high abundance have been observed and vice versa with areas of poor habitat biases can arise in conjunction of this assumption because lobsters tend to prefer rocky cobble or boulder habitat with plentiful locations to hide or take shelter lawton and lavalli 1995 these optimal shelter locations may not always be included in trawl surveys because trawls cannot be swept over areas with complex bottom topography or other obstructions such as areas densely fished with lobster traps it has also been thought that as a species density increases the spatial distribution of that species will also expand brown 1984 petitgas 1998 anderson and gregory 2000 this may lead to situations where individuals occupy a less suitable habitat because locations with the most suitable habitat are already occupied american lobster stocks have increased fivefold since the 1980s goode et al 2019 and densely populated areas could become less suitable as competition or susceptibility of disease increased effects of density dependent habitat selection could ultimately lead to differences between fundamental and realized niches and thus hsi model estimates a limitation of this study is that it only considers environmental variables as covariates future studies may benefit from the inclusion of biological covariates such as lobster density or predator and prey densities future studies should also explore how hsi estimates change using non trawl data such as scuba surveys or traps which might better survey sheltered habitat locations in this study all covariates are assumed to have equal influence on habitat suitability which is not likely to be a biologically reflective assumption although this study only considered statistically significant environmental covariates unique to each local model table 1 the influence of each significant covariate is not likely equal and future studies may benefit from incorporating weighted covariates in tandem with nonstationarity studies the smallest spatial scale explored in this study was approximately 2554 km2 sherman et al 2005 future studies may also benefit from exploring how different methodologies of data partitioning and scaling can impact model results another inherent limitation of the current study is the variegated nature of the results that comes from using multiple models in a patchwork design over a spatial extent reasonably there do not exist abrupt changes in habitat suitability where two models meet thus this approach should be used to determine trends in hsi estimates not to develop spatially precise calculations of habitat lastly temporal nonstationarity was not considered in this study as the focus of this study was to explore the effects of spatial nonstationarity due to the evidence that has been observed in past studies li et al 2018 in regards to exploring temporal nonstationarity due to the relatively short time period of data available to this study we made the assumption that not enough temporal nonstationarity is present to require accounting for potential temporal changes but if longer term projections were to be made temporal nonstationarity would likely need to be considered this however is outside the scope of this study this study suggests that lobster habitat suitability estimates are dependent on spatial scale and assumptions of nonstationarity due to this dependence global statistics models may mask localized effects resulting in ill informed management practices future management of the resource may benefit from region specific regulations using localized modelling approaches as was done in this study as an example if model 3 is indeed more biologically realistic than traditionally utilized stationary approaches as past literature suggests then traditionally used models may be overestimating juvenile lobster habitat this could result in a false security of recruitment expectations in future years as the suitability of habitat would likely be lower than a coarse scale model would predict for adult lobsters coarse scale models are likely to comparatively overestimate habitat suitability in western gom nearshore waters and further offshore waters of eastern gom while also underestimating further offshore waters in western gom and coastal waters of eastern gom in light of these differences it is important to consider the possibility of local heterogeneity in species habitat modeling and as it relates to the management of that species false overestimations of habitat suitability could lead to false perceptions of the current and future state and location of a population such false perceptions could result in relaxed regulations or ill informed biological reference point calculations for marine species relaxed regulations at inappropriate locations could potentially lead to overfishing and potential population decline or underfishing at other localized areas which could result in economic loss quality habitat suitability estimates will assist stakeholders in developing and implementing best practice methods to ensure the sustainability and longevity of a commercially valuable industry as we enter a new climate regime and smaller scale models may better capture these localized changes
