produced by the international working group on data and models which works under the iwa iahr joint committee on urban drainage reviews the state of the art and modelling tools developed recently to understand and manage ghg emissions from iuds further open problems and research gaps are discussed and a framework for handling ghg emissions from iudss is presented the literature review reveals that there is a need to strengthen already available mathematical models for iuds to take ghg into account keywords integrated urban drainage modelling water quality mathematical modelling ghg 1 introduction greenhouse gases from integrated urban drainage systems climate change can be attributed to greenhouse gas ghg emissions and is currently one of the most urgent challenges for humankind the impacts of climate change are evident worldwide and scientists predict that these impacts will intensify in the coming decades ipcc 2014 conveyance of water and wastewater in integrated urban drainage systems iudss contributes to ghg emissions through energy consumption indirect co2 emissions and fugitive gaseous emissions such as nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 direct emissions ch4 and n2o are two potent greenhouse gases with global warming potentials that are 25 and 298 times the global warming potential of co2 respectively when considering a 100 year period ipcc 2014 in addition ch4 and n2o contribute to stratospheric ozone destruction it is generally accepted that n2o is produced as an intermediate product in the microbial process of denitrification which converts nitrogen dinitrogen an inert gas the production of ghgs from water and wastewater occurs throughout integrated urban drainage systems which are complex systems composed of sewer systems wastewater treatment plants wwtp and receiving water bodies rwb as illustrated in fig 1 the sewer system drains wastewater mainly from household and industrial facilities and rainwater to prevent problems with hygiene and flooding in urban areas part of this drainage water is transported to wwtps and treated for subsequent release into a receiving water body remaining water which exceeds the capacity of the sewer system and or wwtp may be discharged directly into the receiving water body as an overflow in addition the receiving water body receives pollutant loads from agricultural activities i e no point pollution in the catchment i e the surrounding area that contribute to the quality status of the water body iuds consider all systems jointly because individual optimisation of the different components will not result in an overall optimisation of the system schütze and alex 2004 bach et al 2014 the water framework directive wfd requires strict effluent limits for pollutants and entails the adoption of river basin scale management for water issues and for achieving full cost recovery of water services benedetti et al 2013 similarly the integrate pollution prevention and control ippc directive requires member states of the european union to issue operating permits containing emission limit values based on the best available techniques the benefits of using integrated system wide approaches for solving real problems have been demonstrated by modelling pollution indicators required by the wfd i e concentrations of dissolved oxygen ammonia nitrate phosphorus etc langeveld et al 2013 recently significant investments have been made by the european union to improve knowledge regarding each component of the integrated water management systems and to understand how the different components interact e g eu fp6 projects neptune innowatech fp7 project climatewater and fp7 acqwa aimed at understanding the climate impact of water management in addition the eu fp7 project prepared and corfu fp7 projects worked on integration at an urban water level and the trust and sanitas fp7 projects worked on the deficiencies in european urban water management to develop an integrated technology knowledge and an action base despite these efforts governments and researchers are moving towards new integration concepts in water management that consider the inclusion of new environmental quality indicators including ghg emissions therefore new challenges must be overcome to improve sustainability and protect the environment in the same context there is a growing concern that iudss are not sustainably managed with respect to energy consumption however climate change is an important driver to increase the use of sustainable energy sources and minimise carbon footprint this knowledge has pushed researchers to consider new novel targets for preserving the environment including additional performance indicators that are related to ghg emissions flores alsina et al 2014 mannina et al 2016 when considering this principle new novel target indicators have been used to reduce climate change due to ghg emissions from iudss flores alsina et al 2014 in addition a theoretical modelling study that quantified the ghg emissions from an iuds was recently conducted guo et al 2012 despite strong limitations due to the use of a hypothetical virtual case study the potential of using a dynamic system wide model for balancing water quality operational costs and ghg emissions was demonstrated aside from this study no other surveys have been conducted to quantify or reduce ghg emissions from iudss one possible reason for this lack of research is the only recent awareness of the relevant contribution of ghgs from iudss as well as the lack of dedicated research projects that are focused on the goals mentioned above iudss are very complex in addition the quantification of ghg emissions can only be pursued at this preliminary stage by dedicated projects with sufficient relevant investments due to the extensive resources required for monitoring complex systems regarding the production and mitigation of ghg emissions from individual sub systems of the integrated systems i e sewer systems wwtp and receiving water bodies studies available in the literature are present but not designed for iuds related applications e g campos et al 2016 despite the importance of ghg emissions from iudss as far as the authors are aware no studies have been carried out that consider ghg emissions from all elements of the system in an integrated manner in the following sections the main studies regarding greenhouse gases from the individual sub systems sewer system wwtp and receiving water body are reported in the final section the research needs and efforts beyond the state of the art are discussed 2 greenhouse gases from sewer systems in a sewer system ghg emissions occur mainly in sewer conduits which convey wastewater mainly from households and industrial facilities and rainwater in the sewer conduits biological processes occur due to the presence of organic substances nutrients and microorganisms ghg emissions originate from anaerobic anoxic or aerobic biological processes that occur in sewer sediments which can be deposited at the bottom of the sewer conduits due to fluctuations in flow bulk water and in biofilms that grow on pipe walls fig 2 one challenge in evaluating ghg from sewer systems results from limited knowledge regarding the chemical biological and transport processes that occur in sewers in addition uncertainty regarding the characteristics of the system that affect physical chemical processes such as exact wastewater composition or sedimentation and resuspension poses further challenge to the quantification of ghg emissions bertrand krajewski 2007 benedetti et al 2013 mannina et al 2012 the first notable study focused on two pressurised sewer systems in the gold coast area australia and was conducted in 2008 guisasola et al 2008 the authors of this study found that a significant amount of ch4 can be produced in sewer systems in addition this ch4 production is positively correlated with the hydraulic retention time of the wastewater in these systems guisasola et al 2008 emphasised the need for understanding and controlling methanogenesis processes because they reduce the wastewater organic carbon that influences the formation of n2o inside of the wastewater treatment plant due to incomplete denitrification gutierrez et al 2014 found that the rate of ch4 production decreased during caustic dosing and increased increased when the ph was above however field studies have shown that in practice caustic dosing must be increased to achieve the same reduction in ch4 production rate as was obtained in the laboratory experiments gutierrez et al 2014 mohanakrishnan et al 2008 found that nitrite addition could be a promising and effective strategy for controlling ch4 production in sewers however this finding must be confirmed by conducting actual case studies jiang et al 2013 found a substantial reduction in ch4 production following the addition of nitrate in a laboratory gravity sewer system sudarjanto et al 2013 evaluated the effectiveness of three bioproducts for controlling ch4 in laboratory pressurised sewers and suggested that rigorous laboratory system tests should be performed prior to adopting bioproducts in real sewers little information exists regarding the role that sewers play in the production and emission of n2o among others koh and shaw 2016 contrary to the current international guidance of the intergovernmental panel on climate change gravity sewer systems have recently been found to serve as a source of n2o short et al 2014 these authors stress that research is needed regarding the quantification of ghg emissions from sewers in addition the longitudinal n2o concentrations in sewer networks both dissolved and in the headspace should be assessed to capture the spatio temporal variability of n2o production under different conditions short et al 2014 knowledge regarding the biochemical transformations that are responsible for n2o production in sewers is lacking short et al 2014 these previously listed results indicate that a consolidated and worldwide approach for effectively reducing such emissions does not exist studies have been conducted for mitigating ghg emissions from sewer systems however the application of these mitigation strategies is generally limited to the local conditions of the selected and limited case studies from a mathematical modelling perspective very few process models have been published in addition the applicability of these studies is generally limited to the local conditions in which they were developed for example 1 sulphide control sharma et al 2008 vollertsen et al 2011 2 methanogenesis guisasola et al 2009 and 3 sewer exfiltration benedetti et al 2013 studies have been conducted to predict sewer water quality empirical models have been proposed as an alternative to process models benedetti et al 2013 however a consolidated mathematical model for simulating ch4 and n2o from sewer systems has not been developed guo et al 2012 indeed few models have been proposed to assess the formation of ch4 from pressure sewers foley et al 2009 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 thus models for estimating the formation of ch4 from gravity sewer systems and the formation of n2o for pressure and gravity systems must be developed the limited number of mathematical models that are available for simulating ghg emissions from sewer systems has occurred because research was previously lacking thus this knowledge is in its infancy and requires additional research 3 greenhouse gases from wastewater treatment plants previous results have shown that the ghg emissions from wwtps should be controlled and reduced due to their high global warming potential kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 mannina et al 2016 the environmental protection agency of the united states 2006 reported that n2o from wwtps accounts for approximately 3 of n2o emissions and represents the sixth largest contributor recently several attempts have been made to understand ghg production processes joss et al 2009 foley et al 2009 daelman et al 2012 harper et al 2015 to quantify and measure ghg emissions gwrc 2011 and to predict and control ghg production corominas et al 2012 ni et al 2013a although greenhouse gas emissions from wwtps are of concern knowledge regarding their source and magnitude mainly for n2o remains incomplete kampschreur et al 2009 specifically the production of n2o due to the denitrification pathways of nitrifiers remains a subject of debate ni et al 2013b mannina et al 2016 sperandio et al 2016 specifically n2o can be produced both during nitrification only by means of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrification processes during both the nitrification denitrification process hydroxylamine nh2oh pathways and the heterotrophic denitrification pathway indeed it is well known that n2o is an intermediate of the heterotrophic denitrification bacteria but it can also be produced during the ammonia oxidation process nitrification kampschreur et al 2009 however the wide range of wwtp n2o emission factors measured and reported in literature underlines that the mechanisms involved in the n2o formation are not completely understood kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 mannina et al 2016 in fig 3 the n2o formation pathways are summarized the nitrification process is divided into two main steps in the first step autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria xaob aerobically oxidize nh3 or nh4 into no2 in the second step autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria xnob aerobically oxidize no2 into no3 denitrification leads to the reduction of no3 into n2 by means of heterotrophic bacteria growth xh n2o is produced during biological nitrogen removal processes due to both xaob and xh kampschreur et al 2009 ni and yuan 2015 xaob can produce n2o as a product of the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation identified as one of the major pathways or nitrite no2 reduction aob denitrification ni et al 2013a b heterotrophic biomass produces n2o as an obligate intermediate during nitrate no3 reduction law et al 2012 regarding the co2 it is directly produced due to aerobic and anaerobic biological processes during the aerobic biological processes the cell growth lead to the organic compounds oxidation into co2 while during the anaerobic biological processes the organic matter is transformed into biogas composed by co2 and ch4 the amount of the fossil co2 emissions from wwtps can vary with the inlet wastewater composition and the plant configuration ch4 has a gwp of 34 over a 100 year period ipcc 2013 it is mainly produced during the decomposition of a wide range of organic matter in anaerobic conditions a great amount of the volatile matter contained of the sludge entering the anaerobic digester is converted into ch4 around 40 the process of anaerobic digestion consists of four main subsequent steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis appels et al 2008 specifically during the hydrolysis step fist step both insoluble organic material and high molecular weight compounds such as lipids polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids are converted into soluble organic substances e g amino acids and fatty acids the products of the hydrolysis are further degraded during acidogenesis second step during the third step acetogenesis the organic acids and alcohols produced by acidogenesis are further digested to produce acetic acid as well as co2 and h2 finally during the fourth step methanogenesis ch4 is produced wwtps where anaerobic processes are implemented are often a source of ch4 cea 2013 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22575155 ch4 produced during the anaerobic decomposition of organic substrate activated by methanogenic bacteria can be released to the atmosphere through the surface of the opened tanks or during storage and handling of the digested sludge this methane emission can easily set off the reduced fossil co2 emission associated with biogas energy production https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22575155 biogas containing 55 65 of ch4 can be adopted as energy source to reduce the energy footprint and consequently the ghg emissions of the wwtp large amounts of ch4 can be also produced due to the disposal of raw sewage sludge to landfill czepiel et al 1993 regarding the quantification of ghgs and the different measurement techniques that are used previous studies have reported a range of measured ghg emissions mainly n2o daelman et al 2012 gwrc 2011 the existence of a range of ghg measurements has resulted in the conclusion that estimating ghg emissions from wwtps using emissions factors e g ipcc 2006 2014 oversimplifies the process and leads to extremely uncertain results law et al 2012 the emission factor for n2o for example is only based on one field study in which the wwtp was not designed for nitrogen removal gwrc 2011 the detailed mechanisms of n2o production have not been fully elucidated law et al 2012 recently two international research groups under the umbrella of the international water association iwa have been set up on benchmark simulation models tg iwa bmwwtp and on greenhouse gas emissions ghg iwa these research groups have the objective of deepening the aspects related to the setting up of a standard modelling tool for wwtps to be used at an international level and also deepening the knowledge concerning the assessment of ghg emissions from wwtps both groups have highlighted the need to converge research efforts towards the implementation of integrated approaches in the design and management of wwtps explicitly considering the minimization of the ghg emissions as one of the objectives from a mathematical modelling perspective wwtps are generally modelled using the activated sludge models that were proposed by the iwa henze et al 2000 these models are considered standard several authors have attempted to use these models flores alsina et al 2014 guo et al 2012 corominas et al 2012 hiatt and grady 2008 however most of these mathematical models remain theoretical because they are applied to hypothetical case studies without real data recently a mathematical model was successfully applied to a wastewater treatment plant ni et al 2013a but no consensus has been reached regarding the mathematical modelling of ghgs from wwtps recently a mathematical modelling study that was based on a virtual system demonstrated the benefits of mathematical modelling and included ghg emissions among the wastewater treatment plant targets flores alsina et al 2014 these authors concluded that the optimal way to simulate ghg emissions from wwtps is to use a plant wide approach that identifies all synergies among the different units of the plant flores alsina et al 2014 grau et al 2007 sweetapple et al 2014a b developed an extensive uncertainty analysis at plant wide scale taking into account ghg emissions such a study although developed on a theoretical case study demonstrated the effectiveness of advanced mathematical modelling methods for reducing the emissions and pin down criteria for plant operational strategies recent studies on ghg modelling include both conventional massara et al 2018 and advanced treatment systems such as membrane bioreactors mannina et al 2018b mannina and di bella 2012 such models are modifications of the asm in an attempt to come up with a modelling tools for ghg emissions from wwtps despite the efforts that have been made at an international level a simulation platform for the design and or the management of wwtps to minimise ghg emissions is still lacking moreover a literature review indicated that some important aspects require additional research law et al 2012 for example criteria are lacking for the design and management of wwtps that use integrated approaches including consideration of the emission of ghgs furthermore an extensive database of ghg measurements is lacking in terms of the temporal and spatial distributions for encoding the behaviour of ghgs in the yield process and for assessing the temporal variability of the ghgs throughout the year mannina et al 2018a these extensive databases are essential for developing and applying robust and reliable mathematical models in addition standard protocols for measuring emissions are lacking these protocols would allow individuals to compare the data obtained from different wwtps finally the identification of appropriate mitigation measures which are based on process control and are aimed at reducing ghg emissions is lacking furthermore knowledge gaps are present regarding the contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass during the formation of ghg emissions very recently an extensive italian national project on greenhouse gas emission from wwtps prin has been funded and is studying the production such gases with the final aim to set up a decision support system for their reduction caniani et al 2015 mannina 2017 such studies are however still lacking there are several projects ongoing that focus on the reduction of the energy consumption in wwtps de gussem et al 2014 but these projects do not explicitly quantify the impacts on ghg emissions 4 greenhouse gases from receiving water bodies the issues raised by ghg emissions from receiving water bodies have been thoroughly investigated in recent years ghgs from receiving water bodies are produced by complex biological processes in the water column fig 4 many efforts have been made by the technical community to accurately quantify ghg emissions from aquatic systems beaulieu et al 2014 musenze et al 2014 chen et al 2013 indeed these studies highlighted the significant contribution of these sources on ghg emissions and climate change a recent study reported that river and stream networks may contribute at least 10 of the n2o emissions resulting from anthropogenic activities to the atmosphere beaulieu et al 2011 beaulieu et al measured the n2o production rates of 72 streams and found that they were three times greater than those estimated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 musenze et al 2014 reported the results of a two year field data gathering campaign that was conducted in a sub tropical estuarine system and aimed to quantify ch4 and n2o emissions musenze et al 2014 found huge spatial and temporal variability in the ch4 and n2o emissions and highlighted the uncertainty due to a lack of accurate estimation methods for gas transfer velocity which represents a fundamental parameter for estimating ch4 and n2o fluxes from water beaulieu et al 2014 analysed the n2o concentrations in water samples and n2o emissions from the water surface by using floating chambers this study focused on the roles of heterotrophic denitrification and chemoautotrophic nitrification which have not been elucidated and highlighted the need for further research to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for n2o production in water systems furthermore despite strong efforts towards building a consensus for assessing the ghg status of aquatic systems many uncertainties remain these uncertainties mainly result from the lack of standard measurement techniques and standard tools for assessing ghg emissions and the limited reliable information obtained from a variety of sources goldenfum 2012 from a modelling perspective previous reports have not consolidated mathematical models for simulating ghg emissions from receiving water bodies guo et al 2012 despite a river water quality model rwqm has been developed shanahan et al 2001 to assess the influences of both point and non point pollution sources on water quality bach et al 2014 water quality models have yet to be extended to include n2o and ch4 production one could even go a step further by including the entire river catchment it is well known that land use and land management e g urbanization agricultural practices and forest management have a strong effect on both the catchment runoff and the carbon balance richardson et al 2013 catchment runoff directly affects river flows and as a consequence also the river water quality and related impacts of the urban drainage and wastewater system this again shows the need for a holistic approach where the development of sustainable climate proof approaches should not only address the impacts of climate change but also the feedbacks to the climate system and the potential benefits of the climate change mitigation in addition to an understanding of the processes occurring at the technical level such an approach requires holistic modelling methods that are efficient due to the multitude of aspects and interactions to be considered and the huge number of scenario simulations required to derive optimal strategies fast simulation models that describe the essence of the responses and interactions are necessary existing detailed physically based models have their limitations here one solution is the use of conceptual models or the option to combine models of different degrees of complexity according to the needs of the particular study schütze and alex 2004 wolfs et al 2015 recently developed an approach for the identification of a simplified surrogate conceptual model based on the results of a limited number of simulations with a state of the art full hydrodynamic river model similar approaches were developed for sewer systems wolfs and willems 2017 and for river and sewer water quality mannina and viviani 2010a b mannina et al 2012 vezzaro et al 2014 ogurek et al 2015 keupers and willems 2017 due to their simplicity and modular structure they allow easy extension with other conceptual model blocks e g to describe ghg emissions and feedbacks they moreover allow optimization applications and the derivation of optimal management strategies for urban storm and waste water systems 5 proposal of a new framework for ghg assessment from iuds bearing in mind the considerations discussed above the working group on data and models of the joint committee on urban drainage of iwa and iahr proposes a framework for dealing with ghg from iudss the overall idea is to overcome critical issues typical of iuds modelling more specifically to model ghg emissions at an integrated urban drainage scale the different sources of water and pollution have to be considered by integrating a cascade of sub models freni and mannina 2010 in the case of integrated approaches uncertainties propagate throughout a chain of sub models and the use of either extremely simplified or extremely detailed approaches can reduce the operator s confidence in the model s robustness willems 2008 freni et al 2009a b 2010a mannina et al 2017 mannina and viviani 2009 it is thus crucial to have an equal distribution of sub model complexities willems 2012 therefore advanced and innovative methods e g global sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis uncertainty analysis mathematical calibration protocols etc cosenza et al 2013 mannina et al 2011 should be used to develop and employ the mathematical modelling tools an important requirement is to define the boundaries of the integrated system in order to better define the information needed for the integrated model application modelling should be carried out based on a two step procedure first an in depth analysis of the different components should be carried out and new detailed mathematical models derived for simulating each sub system utilising existing physical based models from literature which do not currently do not fully take into account greenhouse gases bach et al 2014 to ensure the sub models produced are reliable the development process should be supported by knowledge derived from experimental activities the experimental data gathered would allow insights to be gained and ensure that phenomena regarding ghg formation and propagation are captured in the models due to their complexity these new models will not be appropriate for deriving long term statistical information which would be useful for mitigation strategies willems 2006 therefore the new detailed sub system models should be simplified by using conceptual simplified mathematical models characterized by a lower number of calibration parameters and reduced calculation times second step such simplified models should be derived for each sub system based on the detailed mathematical models and making optimal use of physical interpretation given to the model structure moreover a screening of mitigation measures e g best management practices freni et al 2010b control strategies for best sewer operation kroll et al 2016 specific bacteria for wastewater treatment integrated control automation regulation of aerated and non aerated phases in the wastewater treatment plant river oxygenation employment of particular aquatic plants for the receiving water bodies etc should be carried out to gain insight into the potential reduction of ghg emissions at micro sub system scales as good modelling strategy the major goal would be to integrate detailed and simplified models already available in literature to create a model detailed and simplified that can simulate ghg emissions from an integrated system under dynamic conditions furthermore beginning with the simplified integrated model a decision support system must be developed to design operate and evaluate control strategies for iudss fig 5 to fulfil this goal the following activities are required 1 setting up the detailed integrated model this model should be created by integrating the detailed mathematical models that should be developed for each sub system the model should include algorithms that are opportunely developed by upgrading existing algorithms in the literature based on the knowledge acquired when attempting to understand the ghg emission process and interactions model connectors should be developed to link the detailed models outer circle of fig 5 developed for each sub system the integrated detailed model should be calibrated and validated using a dataset collected during field monitoring campaigns 2 setting up the simplified integrated model to reduce the computational burden a simplified integrated model should be developed utilising simplified mathematical models for each sub system with this aim simple model connectors should be developed to link each sub model inner circle of fig 4 3 setting up the decision support system the decision support system should utilise the simplified integrated model it should be usable for general applications and by researchers and managers to optimise the design and operation of iudss 6 future perspectives and research needs the importance of reducing and mitigating ghg emissions from iudss has to be highlighted in this review to achieve such goals the following key requirements should be addressed produce a comprehensive data set containing ghg emissions from iudss i e sewer systems wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies and create new methods for collecting this data based on measurement protocols guidelines deliver a fundamental understanding of the key processes that are responsible for producing ghg emissions in iudss create mathematical models using data gathered from laboratory experiments and field monitoring to support the development of new tools that are able to quantify the effects of mitigation measures on ghg emissions the integrated mathematical model will be able to optimize in terms of ghg reduction entire systems while accounting for any interactions deliver innovative strategies scenario analyses and guidelines for reducing ghg emissions from iudss by means of innovative methods a comparison of alternative scenarios and solutions in terms of overall performance risk and cost is warmly recommended acknowledgements this work forms also part of a research project supported by a grant of the italian ministry of education

obtained in the laboratory experiments gutierrez et al 2014 mohanakrishnan et al 2008 found that nitrite addition could be a promising and effective strategy for controlling ch4 production in sewers however this finding must be confirmed by conducting actual case studies jiang et al 2013 found a substantial reduction in ch4 production following the addition of nitrate in a laboratory gravity sewer system sudarjanto et al 2013 evaluated the effectiveness of three bioproducts for controlling ch4 in laboratory pressurised sewers and suggested that rigorous laboratory system tests should be performed prior to adopting bioproducts in real sewers little information exists regarding the role that sewers play in the production and emission of n2o among others koh and shaw 2016 contrary to the current international guidance of the intergovernmental panel on climate change gravity sewer systems have recently been found to serve as a source of n2o short et al 2014 these authors stress that research is needed regarding the quantification of ghg emissions from sewers in addition the longitudinal n2o concentrations in sewer networks both dissolved and in the headspace should be assessed to capture the spatio temporal variability of n2o production under different conditions short et al 2014 knowledge regarding the biochemical transformations that are responsible for n2o production in sewers is lacking short et al 2014 these previously listed results indicate that a consolidated and worldwide approach for effectively reducing such emissions does not exist studies have been conducted for mitigating ghg emissions from sewer systems however the application of these mitigation strategies is generally limited to the local conditions of the selected and limited case studies from a mathematical modelling perspective very few process models have been published in addition the applicability of these studies is generally limited to the local conditions in which they were developed for example 1 sulphide control sharma et al 2008 vollertsen et al 2011 2 methanogenesis guisasola et al 2009 and 3 sewer exfiltration benedetti et al 2013 studies have been conducted to predict sewer water quality empirical models have been proposed as an alternative to process models benedetti et al 2013 however a consolidated mathematical model for simulating ch4 and n2o from sewer systems has not been developed guo et al 2012 indeed few models have been proposed to assess the formation of ch4 from pressure sewers foley et al 2009 2010 kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 thus models for estimating the formation of ch4 from gravity sewer systems and the formation of n2o for pressure and gravity systems must be developed the limited number of mathematical models that are available for simulating ghg emissions from sewer systems has occurred because research was previously lacking thus this knowledge is in its infancy and requires additional research 3 greenhouse gases from wastewater treatment plants previous results have shown that the ghg emissions from wwtps should be controlled and reduced due to their high global warming potential kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 mannina et al 2016 the environmental protection agency of the united states 2006 reported that n2o from wwtps accounts for approximately 3 of n2o emissions and represents the sixth largest contributor recently several attempts have been made to understand ghg production processes joss et al 2009 foley et al 2009 daelman et al 2012 harper et al 2015 to quantify and measure ghg emissions gwrc 2011 and to predict and control ghg production corominas et al 2012 ni et al 2013a although greenhouse gas emissions from wwtps are of concern knowledge regarding their source and magnitude mainly for n2o remains incomplete kampschreur et al 2009 specifically the production of n2o due to the denitrification pathways of nitrifiers remains a subject of debate ni et al 2013b mannina et al 2016 sperandio et al 2016 specifically n2o can be produced both during nitrification only by means of the ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob and denitrification processes during both the nitrification denitrification process hydroxylamine nh2oh pathways and the heterotrophic denitrification pathway indeed it is well known that n2o is an intermediate of the heterotrophic denitrification bacteria but it can also be produced during the ammonia oxidation process nitrification kampschreur et al 2009 however the wide range of wwtp n2o emission factors measured and reported in literature underlines that the mechanisms involved in the n2o formation are not completely understood kampschreur et al 2009 law et al 2012 mannina et al 2016 in fig 3 the n2o formation pathways are summarized the nitrification process is divided into two main steps in the first step autotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria xaob aerobically oxidize nh3 or nh4 into no2 in the second step autotrophic nitrite oxidizing bacteria xnob aerobically oxidize no2 into no3 denitrification leads to the reduction of no3 into n2 by means of heterotrophic bacteria growth xh n2o is produced during biological nitrogen removal processes due to both xaob and xh kampschreur et al 2009 ni and yuan 2015 xaob can produce n2o as a product of the hydroxylamine nh2oh oxidation identified as one of the major pathways or nitrite no2 reduction aob denitrification ni et al 2013a b heterotrophic biomass produces n2o as an obligate intermediate during nitrate no3 reduction law et al 2012 regarding the co2 it is directly produced due to aerobic and anaerobic biological processes during the aerobic biological processes the cell growth lead to the organic compounds oxidation into co2 while during the anaerobic biological processes the organic matter is transformed into biogas composed by co2 and ch4 the amount of the fossil co2 emissions from wwtps can vary with the inlet wastewater composition and the plant configuration ch4 has a gwp of 34 over a 100 year period ipcc 2013 it is mainly produced during the decomposition of a wide range of organic matter in anaerobic conditions a great amount of the volatile matter contained of the sludge entering the anaerobic digester is converted into ch4 around 40 the process of anaerobic digestion consists of four main subsequent steps hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis appels et al 2008 specifically during the hydrolysis step fist step both insoluble organic material and high molecular weight compounds such as lipids polysaccharides proteins and nucleic acids are converted into soluble organic substances e g amino acids and fatty acids the products of the hydrolysis are further degraded during acidogenesis second step during the third step acetogenesis the organic acids and alcohols produced by acidogenesis are further digested to produce acetic acid as well as co2 and h2 finally during the fourth step methanogenesis ch4 is produced wwtps where anaerobic processes are implemented are often a source of ch4 cea 2013 https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22575155 ch4 produced during the anaerobic decomposition of organic substrate activated by methanogenic bacteria can be released to the atmosphere through the surface of the opened tanks or during storage and handling of the digested sludge this methane emission can easily set off the reduced fossil co2 emission associated with biogas energy production https www ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed 22575155 biogas containing 55 65 of ch4 can be adopted as energy source to reduce the energy footprint and consequently the ghg emissions of the wwtp large amounts of ch4 can be also produced due to the disposal of raw sewage sludge to landfill czepiel et al 1993 regarding the quantification of ghgs and the different measurement techniques that are used previous studies have reported a range of measured ghg emissions mainly n2o daelman et al 2012 gwrc 2011 the existence of a range of ghg measurements has resulted in the conclusion that estimating ghg emissions from wwtps using emissions factors e g ipcc 2006 2014 oversimplifies the process and leads to extremely uncertain results law et al 2012 the emission factor for n2o for example is only based on one field study in which the wwtp was not designed for nitrogen removal gwrc 2011 the detailed mechanisms of n2o production have not been fully elucidated law et al 2012 recently two international research groups under the umbrella of the international water association iwa have been set up on benchmark simulation models tg iwa bmwwtp and on greenhouse gas emissions ghg iwa these research groups have the objective of deepening the aspects related to the setting up of a standard modelling tool for wwtps to be used at an international level and also deepening the knowledge concerning the assessment of ghg emissions from wwtps both groups have highlighted the need to converge research efforts towards the implementation of integrated approaches in the design and management of wwtps explicitly considering the minimization of the ghg emissions as one of the objectives from a mathematical modelling perspective wwtps are generally modelled using the activated sludge models that were proposed by the iwa henze et al 2000 these models are considered standard several authors have attempted to use these models flores alsina et al 2014 guo et al 2012 corominas et al 2012 hiatt and grady 2008 however most of these mathematical models remain theoretical because they are applied to hypothetical case studies without real data recently a mathematical model was successfully applied to a wastewater treatment plant ni et al 2013a but no consensus has been reached regarding the mathematical modelling of ghgs from wwtps recently a mathematical modelling study that was based on a virtual system demonstrated the benefits of mathematical modelling and included ghg emissions among the wastewater treatment plant targets flores alsina et al 2014 these authors concluded that the optimal way to simulate ghg emissions from wwtps is to use a plant wide approach that identifies all synergies among the different units of the plant flores alsina et al 2014 grau et al 2007 sweetapple et al 2014a b developed an extensive uncertainty analysis at plant wide scale taking into account ghg emissions such a study although developed on a theoretical case study demonstrated the effectiveness of advanced mathematical modelling methods for reducing the emissions and pin down criteria for plant operational strategies recent studies on ghg modelling include both conventional massara et al 2018 and advanced treatment systems such as membrane bioreactors mannina et al 2018b mannina and di bella 2012 such models are modifications of the asm in an attempt to come up with a modelling tools for ghg emissions from wwtps despite the efforts that have been made at an international level a simulation platform for the design and or the management of wwtps to minimise ghg emissions is still lacking moreover a literature review indicated that some important aspects require additional research law et al 2012 for example criteria are lacking for the design and management of wwtps that use integrated approaches including consideration of the emission of ghgs furthermore an extensive database of ghg measurements is lacking in terms of the temporal and spatial distributions for encoding the behaviour of ghgs in the yield process and for assessing the temporal variability of the ghgs throughout the year mannina et al 2018a these extensive databases are essential for developing and applying robust and reliable mathematical models in addition standard protocols for measuring emissions are lacking these protocols would allow individuals to compare the data obtained from different wwtps finally the identification of appropriate mitigation measures which are based on process control and are aimed at reducing ghg emissions is lacking furthermore knowledge gaps are present regarding the contributions of autotrophic and heterotrophic biomass during the formation of ghg emissions very recently an extensive italian national project on greenhouse gas emission from wwtps prin has been funded and is studying the production such gases with the final aim to set up a decision support system for their reduction caniani et al 2015 mannina 2017 such studies are however still lacking there are several projects ongoing that focus on the reduction of the energy consumption in wwtps de gussem et al 2014 but these projects do not explicitly quantify the impacts on ghg emissions 4 greenhouse gases from receiving water bodies the issues raised by ghg emissions from receiving water bodies have been thoroughly investigated in recent years ghgs from receiving water bodies are produced by complex biological processes in the water column fig 4 many efforts have been made by the technical community to accurately quantify ghg emissions from aquatic systems beaulieu et al 2014 musenze et al 2014 chen et al 2013 indeed these studies highlighted the significant contribution of these sources on ghg emissions and climate change a recent study reported that river and stream networks may contribute at least 10 of the n2o emissions resulting from anthropogenic activities to the atmosphere beaulieu et al 2011 beaulieu et al measured the n2o production rates of 72 streams and found that they were three times greater than those estimated by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 musenze et al 2014 reported the results of a two year field data gathering campaign that was conducted in a sub tropical estuarine system and aimed to quantify ch4 and n2o emissions musenze et al 2014 found huge spatial and temporal variability in the ch4 and n2o emissions and highlighted the uncertainty due to a lack of accurate estimation methods for gas transfer velocity which represents a fundamental parameter for estimating ch4 and n2o fluxes from water beaulieu et al 2014 analysed the n2o concentrations in water samples and n2o emissions from the water surface by using floating chambers this study focused on the roles of heterotrophic denitrification and chemoautotrophic nitrification which have not been elucidated and highlighted the need for further research to understand the mechanisms that are responsible for n2o production in water systems furthermore despite strong efforts towards building a consensus for assessing the ghg status of aquatic systems many uncertainties remain these uncertainties mainly result from the lack of standard measurement techniques and standard tools for assessing ghg emissions and the limited reliable information obtained from a variety of sources goldenfum 2012 from a modelling perspective previous reports have not consolidated mathematical models for simulating ghg emissions from receiving water bodies guo et al 2012 despite a river water quality model rwqm has been developed shanahan et al 2001 to assess the influences of both point and non point pollution sources on water quality bach et al 2014 water quality models have yet to be extended to include n2o and ch4 production one could even go a step further by including the entire river catchment it is well known that land use and land management e g urbanization agricultural practices and forest management have a strong effect on both the catchment runoff and the carbon balance richardson et al 2013 catchment runoff directly affects river flows and as a consequence also the river water quality and related impacts of the urban drainage and wastewater system this again shows the need for a holistic approach where the development of sustainable climate proof approaches should not only address the impacts of climate change but also the feedbacks to the climate system and the potential benefits of the climate change mitigation in addition to an understanding of the processes occurring at the technical level such an approach requires holistic modelling methods that are efficient due to the multitude of aspects and interactions to be considered and the huge number of scenario simulations required to derive optimal strategies fast simulation models that describe the essence of the responses and interactions are necessary existing detailed physically based models have their limitations here one solution is the use of conceptual models or the option to combine models of different degrees of complexity according to the needs of the particular study schütze and alex 2004 wolfs et al 2015 recently developed an approach for the identification of a simplified surrogate conceptual model based on the results of a limited number of simulations with a state of the art full hydrodynamic river model similar approaches were developed for sewer systems wolfs and willems 2017 and for river and sewer water quality mannina and viviani 2010a b mannina et al 2012 vezzaro et al 2014 ogurek et al 2015 keupers and willems 2017 due to their simplicity and modular structure they allow easy extension with other conceptual model blocks e g to describe ghg emissions and feedbacks they moreover allow optimization applications and the derivation of optimal management strategies for urban storm and waste water systems 5 proposal of a new framework for ghg assessment from iuds bearing in mind the considerations discussed above the working group on data and models of the joint committee on urban drainage of iwa and iahr proposes a framework for dealing with ghg from iudss the overall idea is to overcome critical issues typical of iuds modelling more specifically to model ghg emissions at an integrated urban drainage scale the different sources of water and pollution have to be considered by integrating a cascade of sub models freni and mannina 2010 in the case of integrated approaches uncertainties propagate throughout a chain of sub models and the use of either extremely simplified or extremely detailed approaches can reduce the operator s confidence in the model s robustness willems 2008 freni et al 2009a b 2010a mannina et al 2017 mannina and viviani 2009 it is thus crucial to have an equal distribution of sub model complexities willems 2012 therefore advanced and innovative methods e g global sensitivity analysis identifiability analysis uncertainty analysis mathematical calibration protocols etc cosenza et al 2013 mannina et al 2011 should be used to develop and employ the mathematical modelling tools an important requirement is to define the boundaries of the integrated system in order to better define the information needed for the integrated model application modelling should be carried out based on a two step procedure first an in depth analysis of the different components should be carried out and new detailed mathematical models derived for simulating each sub system utilising existing physical based models from literature which do not currently do not fully take into account greenhouse gases bach et al 2014 to ensure the sub models produced are reliable the development process should be supported by knowledge derived from experimental activities the experimental data gathered would allow insights to be gained and ensure that phenomena regarding ghg formation and propagation are captured in the models due to their complexity these new models will not be appropriate for deriving long term statistical information which would be useful for mitigation strategies willems 2006 therefore the new detailed sub system models should be simplified by using conceptual simplified mathematical models characterized by a lower number of calibration parameters and reduced calculation times second step such simplified models should be derived for each sub system based on the detailed mathematical models and making optimal use of physical interpretation given to the model structure moreover a screening of mitigation measures e g best management practices freni et al 2010b control strategies for best sewer operation kroll et al 2016 specific bacteria for wastewater treatment integrated control automation regulation of aerated and non aerated phases in the wastewater treatment plant river oxygenation employment of particular aquatic plants for the receiving water bodies etc should be carried out to gain insight into the potential reduction of ghg emissions at micro sub system scales as good modelling strategy the major goal would be to integrate detailed and simplified models already available in literature to create a model detailed and simplified that can simulate ghg emissions from an integrated system under dynamic conditions furthermore beginning with the simplified integrated model a decision support system must be developed to design operate and evaluate control strategies for iudss fig 5 to fulfil this goal the following activities are required 1 setting up the detailed integrated model this model should be created by integrating the detailed mathematical models that should be developed for each sub system the model should include algorithms that are opportunely developed by upgrading existing algorithms in the literature based on the knowledge acquired when attempting to understand the ghg emission process and interactions model connectors should be developed to link the detailed models outer circle of fig 5 developed for each sub system the integrated detailed model should be calibrated and validated using a dataset collected during field monitoring campaigns 2 setting up the simplified integrated model to reduce the computational burden a simplified integrated model should be developed utilising simplified mathematical models for each sub system with this aim simple model connectors should be developed to link each sub model inner circle of fig 4 3 setting up the decision support system the decision support system should utilise the simplified integrated model it should be usable for general applications and by researchers and managers to optimise the design and operation of iudss 6 future perspectives and research needs the importance of reducing and mitigating ghg emissions from iudss has to be highlighted in this review to achieve such goals the following key requirements should be addressed produce a comprehensive data set containing ghg emissions from iudss i e sewer systems wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies and create new methods for collecting this data based on measurement protocols guidelines deliver a fundamental understanding of the key processes that are responsible for producing ghg emissions in iudss create mathematical models using data gathered from laboratory experiments and field monitoring to support the development of new tools that are able to quantify the effects of mitigation measures on ghg emissions the integrated mathematical model will be able to optimize in terms of ghg reduction entire systems while accounting for any interactions deliver innovative strategies scenario analyses and guidelines for reducing ghg emissions from iudss by means of innovative methods a comparison of alternative scenarios and solutions in terms of overall performance risk and cost is warmly recommended acknowledgements this work forms also part of a research project supported by a grant of the italian ministry of education

7386,knowledge about the hydrological regime of wetlands is key to understand their physical and biological properties modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within a wetland is therefore becoming increasingly important 3d models have successfully modelled wetland dynamics but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography many 1d and 2d models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area this study proposes an enhanced quasi 2d modelling strategy that captures the interaction between river discharge and moon tides and the resulting hydrodynamics while using the scarce data available the water flow equations are discretised with an interconnected irregular cell scheme in which a simplification of the 1d saint venant equations is used to define the water flow between cells the spatial structure of wetlands is based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas the islands within the delta are modelled with levee cells creek cells and an interior cell representing a shallow marsh wetland the model is calibrated for an average year and the model performance is evaluated for another average year and additionally an extreme dry three month period and an extreme wet three month period the calibration and evaluation are done based on two water level measurement stations and two discharge measurement stations all located in the main rivers additional calibration is carried out with field water level measurements in a wetland area accurate simulations are obtained for both calibration and evaluation with high correlations between observed and simulated water levels and simulated discharges in the same order of magnitude as observed discharges calibration against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow mechanism in wetland areas a sensitivity analysis for several wetland parameters showed that these parameters are all influencing the water level fluctuation within the wetlands to varying degrees the enhanced quasi 2d model has the potential to accurately simulate river and wetland dynamics for large wetland areas and help to understand their hydrodynamics keywords hydrodynamic modelling wetlands ctss8 lower paraná delta 1 introduction wetlands are one of the most valuable ecosystems for mankind acreman and holden 2013 providing many ecosystem services like flood attenuation pollutant uptaking recharge of groundwater and habitat for biodiversity tsihrintzis et al 1998 special attention has been given to the study of their hydrological regime maltby and acreman 2011 since it determines the physical chemical and biological properties of wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2000 alteration of the catchment hydrology including abstraction of surface and groundwater impoundment or diversion of rivers and land use changes can have a significant impact on wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide there is an increasing need to develop models to assess wetland impacts evaluate risks and develop restoration plans acreman and miller 2007 being a particularly urgent issue for the world s largest deltas as the intensification of human activity deeply modifies the tidal river wetland interaction by changing coastal morphology and reducing wetland extent by filling or dredging hoitink et al 2016 2017 the choice of the modelling approach depends besides the modelling objectives on both scientific and technical aspects as well as on the resources available these aspects include among others the scale of the simulation domain topography hydrological and topographical data available the complexity of the hydraulic regime and computational costs modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes of wetlands is challenging mainly due to data availability in comparison to rivers there is a lack of systematic monitoring of water levels in wetlands okruszko et al 2011 the hydraulics within wetland systems are often neglected or simplified in modelling studies mao and cui 2012 for floodplain wetlands the extent vegetation heterogeneity and flat topography prevent field surveys and hydrological monitoring networks from providing a detailed representation of the propagation and characteristics of floods across the floodplain ogilvie et al 2015 thus remote sensing products are increasingly being used to provide detailed surface topography for 2d and 3d hydraulic models leauthaud et al 2013 haines 2013 grimson et al 2013 and flood extent maps to calibrate or evaluate the performance of the models grings et al 2006 grings et al 2009 salvia et al 2009 flows in wetlands can be characterized as shallow flows where the horizontal dimensions are much larger than the vertical ones arega 2013 the description of flow dynamics in wetlands therefore requires the use of a hydraulic model to capture the interaction between river discharge and moon tides the wetlands of tidal dominated deltas of large rivers present additional challenges due to the very different boundary conditions upstream and at the coastal front many studies have successfully performed hydrologic and hydrodynamic simulations of tidal wetlands in deltaic regions with varying degrees of spatial detail and using different modelling approaches table 1 3d models generally show a good performance and are reliable but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography therefore these models can only be applied to smaller areas or only address the dynamics of the distributary channels lower dimensional models are often preferred for large deltaic systems however many 1d and 2d models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area the first quasi 2d hydraulic model was developed for the large tidal delta of the mekong river by preissmann and cunge zanobetti et al 1968b cunge et al 1980 a quasi 2d model is a compromise between a 1d and a 2d model the main rivers are connected to separated river branches that represent the floodplain thereby creating the illusion of a 2d model although this type of model is able to deal with the temporal scale that is needed to capture the rapid dynamics of tides it is more commonly applied to river floodplain dynamics cunge et al 1980 riccardi 1997 bates and de roo 2000 riccardi et al 2013 as it can accommodate less detailed data and performs well compared to other 2d models beck 2016 quasi 2d models have been used for modelling tidal deltas and wetland systems by introducing an improvement to the spatial configuration of a wetland system a quasi 2d model can also become suitable for modelling the flow processes in tidal delta wetlands the proposed method of modelling requires a minimum amount of data and therefore has the potential to become a generalizable approach to help us understand the hydrodynamics of tidal delta wetlands around the world given this background the objective of this study is to calibrate and evaluate a quasi 2d model to simulate water flows in a test case using a spatial configuration which enables the explicit modelling of distributaries and island wetlands in a tidal delta wetland the ctss8 model riccardi 2000 is chosen for this study this quasi 2d model has successfully been applied to wetland systems around the world garcia et al 2007 sandy rojas et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 flow equations in the model are discretized through interconnected irregular cells which allows for introducting a new spatial structure to the model based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas this in turn allows for the simulation of the complex flow processes in the tidal wetland system 2 study area the test case used in this study is the lower parana river delta in the east of argentina which is a typical case of a tidal delta wetland fig 1 the study area is part of the growing portion of the lower delta covering an area of 2500 km2 between parana guazú and paraná de las palmas rivers fig 2 the paraná river system belongs to the rio de la plata basin the second largest basin in south america after the amazon runs through brazil paraguay and argentina where it flows into de la plata estuary forming the parana delta the delta region is a fluvial coastal complex iriondo 2004 which extends along 300 km from 32 5 s near the city of diamante in entre rios province to 34 29 s near the city of buenos aires covering an area of 17 000 km2 baigun et al 2008 the parana river delta is one of the largest coastal wetlands systems of argentina with a complex estuary delta parker and marcolini 1992 and a large wetland influenced by fresh water tides kandus and malvárez 2002 the lower delta is the deltaic front which extends from the bifurcation of the parana river into the parana guazú and the parana de las palmas rivers the parana guazú sub front has not considerably advanced due to the uruguay river currents which push the sediments to the other sub front average of 0 25 m year boulanger et al 2008 the parana de las palmas sub front is actively growing parallel to the coast near the city of buenos aires 50 100 m year average pittau et al 2004 the parana river drains an area of 2 3 106 km2 with a mean annual discharge of 18 500 m3 s at parana city near the delta apex with peak discharges up to 60 000 m3 s jaime and menendez 2002 the parana river has multimodal and unpredictable flood peaks from different sources high flows of the upper parana river local rainfall flows from minor tributaries moon tides storm surges and even ocean wave surges coming from de la plata estuary kandus et al 2006 baigun et al 2008 the main floods in the delta are driven by the paraná river which has one discharge peak in the austral late summer february march and another in the austral winter july the rio de la plata is also responsible for flooding in the downstream region of the paraná river in the lower delta de la plata estuary has semidiurnal tides with a microtidal regime with amplitudes less than 1 m in the delta which can temporarily reverse the flow of the distributaries prario et al 2011 the influence of the tide on the upstream part of the river depends on the paraná water level if strong winds from the southeast persist for several days the storm surge can block the outlet of paraná waters and increase water levels by 3 m or more the whole system shows seasonal but also interannual fluctuations grings et al 2006 water level fluctuation is also clearly visible in wetland areas on satellite images fig 3 and is of main importance to their physical properties the parana delta exhibits a rich mosaic of heterogeneous wetland landscapes that are interconnected by fluvial corridors with different drainage patterns marshes known locally as pajonales are the main landcover type baigun et al 2008 covering the lower topographic positions of the islands cortadera cyperus giganteus and junco schaenoplectus californicus marshes make up to 45 of the vegetation in the lower paraná delta grings et al 2006 forestry and cattle ranching have been the traditional landuses but agriculture and urban development are rapidly expanding on the islands baigun et al 2008 blanco and mendez 2010 these land uses require the development of infrastructural works including deepening of navigation channels diking island filling and construction of artificial drainages and water diversions resulting in a disconnection between the rivers and distributaries and their flood and tidal plains brinson and malvarez 2002 the impact of this disconnection on the parana delta wetlands has not been assessed yet 3 methods 3 1 model description the ctss8 quasi 2d model is a hydrologic hydraulic model riccardi 2000 developed to allow for continuous simulation of flow regimes and flooding patterns along floodplains the model focus is on horizontal flows but there is also an option to incorporate vertical flows sediment transport and vegetation effects it can simulate quasi 2d flow in a single layer and flow in two interconnected layers flow equations are discretised through a network of interconnected cells cunge 1975 cunge et al 1980 in order to deal with specific features of fluvial systems equations are used to represent different discharge laws between cells the governing equations are the st venant equations for continuity and different simplifications of the momentum equation the model structure allows the representation of reality with different levels of detail enabling the maximum possible subdivision of the physical components with geometrical and hydraulic parameters consistent with the available data it has been successfully applied in argentina to model rainfall runoff processes in transformed lowland areas riccardi 1997 riccardi 2000 and flood evolution in floodplain systems along the parana river garcia et al 2015 rojas et al 2014 in australia the model was used to simulate flows in the hunter estuary to study mangle and saltmarsh dynamics with rising sea levels sandy rojas et al 2014 this model is considered to be an alternative to the traditional 1d 2d mike flow model to simulate flows and flooding patterns throughout the macquarie marshes and to assess the impacts of different management schemes on the wetland habitats trivisonno et al 2014 3 2 model parameters cross sectional data and discharge data for the main rivers and distributaries within the study area were obtained from ina instituto nacional del agua the argentinean national water institute discharge measurements were available for an upstream location in the paraná de las palmas and an upstream location in the paraná guazú containing 144 records for a 22 year period for both locations the study area consists of 17 streams with a total length of 371 5 km a total of 95 cross sections were available for the study area water level measurement from six stations were available from the ministry of transport of argentina for the period 1999 2013 for the main river branches the paraná de las palmas and the paraná guazú three stations at each river the measurements have a resolution of 20 30 min and are referenced to the ign height reference level instituto geografico nacional the national geographical institute of argentina the water surface slope of the main rivers is in the order of 10 5 m m and the mean river widths range from 600 to 2500 m and depths from 5 to 16 m guerrero and lamberti 2013 the river bottom elevations of the river cells in the paraná de las palmas and paraná guazú were approximated assuming steady flow where the river bottom slope is equal to the water slope the average water level slope was estimated by calculating the mean water levels of the measurement stations over an 18 year time period the elevations of the other river cells were estimated by assuming a constant slope for every river and channel all six original water level series contain a significant number of outliers and missing values the outliers are first filtered out from the data series with an absolute threshold and a slope threshold small data gaps in the cleaned series are filled up by using linear interpolation data from a donor station are used to fill the larger gaps of a given station the donor is the measurement station with the highest correlation with the station presenting gaps the water level data of the donor station are scaled in time and amplitude to maximize correlation with the original station and to smoothly fill in the original gap after interpolation only 2 of the data series are missing values the boundary conditions are determined by measurements at four locations buenos aires brazo largo desembocadura and zarate fig 2 buenos aires station is linked to the paraná de las palmas in the model by a channel with dimensions which are approximated the water level measurements are interpolated to create equal 10 min intervals for all stations this is the largest time step that can combine the series with a 20 and 30 min interval without deleting measured data the calculation interval of the model is also 10 min for larger intervals the simulation becomes unstable the initial water levels are set to two meter for all cells except for the levee cells this creates a stable situation that needs limited spin up time the initial water depth for the levee cells is zero there is no overflow in the initial situation 3 3 improvement spatial configuration model our quasi 2d modelling strategy divides the study area in channels and islands with different connection mechanisms the main rivers and distributaries are modelled as a series of connected channel river cells with river river links for the islands we introduce an improvement of the spatial structure based on the ecogeomorphology of islands in complex estuarine deltas such as the parana river which is presented in fig 4 an island has an outer natural levee with an interior shallow marsh wetland connected to distributary streams or rivers by means of one or more tidal creeks which breach or cut across the levee an island is modelled by an inner cell surrounded by levee cells which in turn are surrounded by distributary river cells streams or main rivers fig 4 the inner cell represents the middle or center of the island covered with pajonal marsh the inner cell is surrounded by levee cells and creek cells which link to the river cells the inner cell is directly connected to the river cell by means of one or more creek cells the number of levee and creek cells matches the actual number of adjacent rivers of the island the creek cell is always filled with water flow through the levee cell is only possible when the water level is higher than the levee height island areas were estimated from gis data available from ign the islands are shown in fig 2 and indicated by the numbers 10 till 27 inner cells represent about 40 of the total island area based on estimates from satellite imagery the relative area of creek cells compared to that of levee cells is set to 0 02 being a rough estimation based on field observations the levee height is set to 1 54 m above the ign reference level added to the river bottom elevation this number is derived from field measurements that have been done near arroyo las casas fig 2 3 4 model calibration and evaluation the model was calibrated by means of an objective function consisting of two components the first component is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 this is the most widely used criterion for calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data but there has also been a long and vivid discussion about the suitability of nse the main concern about nse is its overestimation of model skill for basins with high seasonal variability gupta et al 2009 although the water levels in the study area are subject to seasonal variation the variation is not exceptionally large water levels vary between 1 and 3 m the nse equation is formulated as follows nse 1 t 1 n x s t x o t 2 t 1 n x o t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps xs t is the simulated water level at time step t xo t is the observed water level at time step t and μo is the mean observed water level the nse is calculated at carabelitas and las rosas the average nse serves as input for the objective function the second component is a discharge ratio this ratio is obtained as follows r q max q s q o q o q s 1 where qs is the average simulated discharge qo is the average observed discharge and rq is the discharge ratio the interval between two consecutive observed discharges is about two months this interval is too large to compare observed and simulated discharges on every time step therefore the average observed discharge during the calibration period is compared to the average simulated discharge during the same period this component of the objective function therefore guarantees that the simulated discharges have the same order of magnitude as the observed discharges the discharge ratio is calculated for zarate and brazo largo the two upstream boundary conditions both discharge ratios are calculated separately and then averaged the resultant is the second component of the objective function a discharge ratio of zero is perfect the full objective function is formulated as follows objective function α nse 1 1 α r q the nse is reduced by 1 the absolute value of the resultant forms the first component of the objective function this first component is minimized for a perfect nse of 1 parameter α is introduced to manually set the relative importance of nse and rq this value is set to 0 95 based on expert judgement and gives more importance to an accurate nse than an accurate rq an automatic calibration local optimization algorithm based on the nelder mead method nelder and mead 1965 was used to estimate the parameter values for manning coefficients creek levee ratio mean levee height mean height of the island inner cell and the length of the channel between buenos aires and the river mouth of the paraná de las palmas since the water levels showed regular behavior we used a spin up period of one week the period 1 september 2001 31 august 2002 is chosen as the most suitable calibration period because it is representative for an average hydrological year in terms of water levels with a small number of irregularities such as sudden jumps in water level or no fluctuation for a couple of days the model performance is evaluated for the average year september 2007 31 august 2008 the extreme dry period december 2008 february 2009 and the extreme wet period december 2009 february 2010 all with a spin up period of 1 week a period of 3 months is selected for the extreme periods because for a period of one year extremes would be filtered out the values of the calibration parameters obtained after calibration are used for the selected evaluation periods manual calibration was conducted to optimize the simulation of wetland flows the calibration period spans over 22 days for the period between 9 june and 1 july 2016 the manning coefficients of the river levee river creek creek inner and levee inner links are used as calibration parameters there are four overflow situations during the calibration period two overflow situations occurred within the first two days of the field measurements it is therefore chosen not to use a spin up period and to use a calculation interval of 6 s to minimize instabilities the objective function is based on the nse values calculated at rio capitan river cell arroyo las casas creek cell and the pajonal these three nse values are averaged multiple local minima of the objective function are searched to find an optimal solution las rosas and carabelitas stations are used for calibration purposes and evaluation of the model performance given the lack of gauge data for the wetlands two measurement stations were installed in june 2016 inside and outside a wetland located in the center of the study region near arroyo las casas 34 20 6 s 58 33 5 w creek cell and 34 21 s 58 33 2 w inner cell to be able to calibrate the wetland parameters of the model these stations measured the water level every minute and captured four overbank flows during the measurement period evaluation of the model performance for simulating flow mechanisms in wetlands is done by visual interpretation of the results for the field measurement period a sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify the effects of changing wetland parameters on flow dynamics in wetlands this sensitivity analysis helps us understand the flow processes in the tidal wetland one of the simplest and most common approaches for a sensitivity analysis is to change one factor at a time and analyze its effect on the output cariboni et al 2007 this method is selected in this study because of its simplicity and robustness the ratio area creek cells area levee cells the levee height and the manning coefficients of the wetland links are changed one at a time and the change of the average water level the variation of the water level the levee overflow and the delay between river and inner cells is assessed 4 results 4 1 model calibration and evaluation 4 1 1 river flows table 2 presents the calibration parameters obtained for river cell links main parana branches and distributaries the calibration process for rivers stopped after 52 iterations the manning coefficients are comparable with values found in the literature biancamaria et al 2009 chow 1959 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 table 3 presents the results for calibrating with a normal year and the evaluation for different hydrological conditions normal extremely dry and extremely wet periods the objective function gave lower but acceptable values for the evaluation periods than for the calibration period the simulation during the extreme dry period was more accurate than during the extreme wet period in terms of the discharge ratio the obtained results for the nses are highly satisfactory with nearly perfect simulations for both stations fig 5 presents the observed and simulated water levels at the calibration stations for january an average month in terms of hydrology for the calibration and evaluation periods fig 5a presents the observed and simulated water levels for the calibration at carabelitas the simulated water level shows an almost perfect match with the observed counterpart while at las rosas station the simulations consistently show higher water levels during low tide the nses are above 0 80 and the simulated average discharges differ less than 20 from the observed average discharges for the evaluation periods the model generally underestimates at las rosas for low tides and slightly overestimates at carabelitas for peak flows fig 5b d the simulation during the extreme dry period 5c was more accurate than the simulation during the extreme wet period 5d 4 1 2 wetland flows table 4 presents the calibration parameters obtained for the island cell links distributary levee creek and inner cell manual calibration of the wetland dynamics was stopped when changes of the calibration parameters did not result in improvements of more than 0 01 in the nse the final value of the averaged nse is 0 67 the hydraulic roughness is significantly higher for levees than for creeks as expected which can be explained by the presence of vegetation on levees and the lack of preferred flow patterns fig 6 presents an overflow situation which was correctly captured by the model fig 6a shows the complete period with field measurements fig 6b zooms into the overflow situation on june 27th 2016 the water level in the pajonal marsh rises due to high river water levels which causes high water levels in the creeks and levee overflow the peak water level reaches the pajonal marsh with some delay and is lower than the peak level measured in the arroyo las casas creek the outflow as a function of time is comparable to the inflow process until the water level reaches the levee height next the outflow is slowed down because water can only flow through the creeks this can be seen both in the measurements and the simulations 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 presents the results of the sensitivity analyses for the manning coefficients for the links between creek and inner cells fig 7a and river and creek cells fig 7b the creek levee ratio fig 7c and inner cell elevation fig 7d for a typical island during january 2008 for most inner cells similar variations were found although some only showed minor variations in water level because of their larger size the water level fluctuation in the inner cell is generally smaller than the water level fluctuation in the river cells a lower manning coefficient results in more water level fluctuation water level fluctuations in the wetland inner cell are more influenced by the manning coefficient of the creek inner cell link and the creek levee ratio than the manning coefficient of the river creek link and the island elevation fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the water level of the inner wetland cell to the value of the levee height the water level in the river cell fluctuates significantly more than the inner cell as would be expected a lower levee corresponds with more variation and an overall higher water level in the inner cell for an intermediate levee height 2 0 m the water level shows a sudden bending point when the water level surpasses the levee after which the outflow slows down because there is no longer levee overflow all water flows out via the creek and that slows down the outflow process the figure shows that the model can capture overflow processes and flow from the river to the inner wetland through creeks 5 discussion a model capable to simulate flood dynamics in a large fluvial coastal tidal delta should be able to represent hydrologic and hydraulic processes in a distributed way integrating the main drainage system with the different types of surface flows and their interactions which take place in the deltaic island landscape another requirement for modelling complex flows is giving primary importance to the physical interpretation while maintaining data needs as simple as possible so topographic and hydraulic representations of the physical reality are the two core elements needed to simulate flood dynamics gomes miguez et al 2017 most hydrologic and hydrodynamic models neglect the wetland dynamics or highly simplify wetland areas sassi and hoitink 2013 gu et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 simplified the non tidal upper parana delta by considering valley cells to represent complex alluvial valleys with islands bolgov et al 2014 used several storages to prevent large errors because wetland dynamics was not accounted for in their model our quasi 2d modelling strategy uses a spatial network of cells of irregular size connected to each other by links in a fashion similar to that proposed by cunge and used to model hydrodynamics in deltaic and floodplain regions zanobetti et al 1970 cunge et al 1980 we introduced an improvement based on the observed ecogeomorphology of islands in complex estuarine deltas such as the parana river the main rivers and distributaries are modeled as a series of connected river cells with river river links the islands are modeled by an inner wetland cell surrounded by levee cells which in turn are surrounded by river cells streams or main rivers the inner cell is connected to the river cell by means of one or more creek cells levee cells only transfer water when their height is surpassed by the water level in the river cells this improved strategy allows to simulate flow and overflow processes in one large scale model without having complete 3d information on the terrain and a high density of gauging stations despite having scarce data our model does not neglect the wetland dynamics the simulations presented in section 4 show that this spatial modelling strategy is being able to capture the distributary and wetland dynamics and their interaction actual flow processes are simulated instead of introducing compensation measures these flow processes contain valuable information about the hydrodynamics that is linked to the physical and biological properties of wetlands the model accurately simulates water levels and the average simulated discharges are in the same order of magnitude as the observed average discharges the results of the simulations during the extreme wet period are slightly worse than the results for the other evaluation periods during the extreme wet period there is more overflow than in the other periods and therefore more interaction between the river and wetland system hence the uncertainties in the proposed values for the wetland parameters are significantly more influencing the model outcomes than during average conditions several assumptions had to be made to be able to carry out wetland simulations e g assuming elevations for the different parts of the area and assuming a constant width for the creeks that connect the inner wetland with the river however since the wetland dynamics has limited effect on the river water levels during average conditions these assumptions have limited effect on the evaluation of the model performance at the measurement stations incorporating wetland dynamics in the model does therefore not lead to significant better or worse river water levels simulations the assumption of constant river slopes based on the difference between the average water levels at measurements stations does influence the simulations in the river because elevation is a main parameter in hydrodynamic models the water level simulations showed a consistent overestimation of the low water levels at las rosas in the paraná de las palmas probably due to incorrect river slope estimation and elevations a higher elevation in the paraná guazú than in the paraná de las palmas damps the effect of low water levels in the paraná de las palmas because water will flow from the paraná guazú in the paraná de las palmas during low water levels the model might overestimate this dampening because of too large differences between elevations in both rivers the model performance could only be evaluated at two locations in the main rivers and for one wetland area model calibration and evaluation have mainly been carried out based on observed water levels because of a lack of other data the upper and lower boundary conditions of the model are also prescribed by observed water levels as a result the model has a few degrees of freedom and one could argue that it is fairly easy to get good calibration and evaluation results while this is partly true it should be mentioned that the upstream and downstream boundary conditions are influenced by different flow processes tides river flow wetland flows etcetera which are not equally important at all gauge stations simulating the water levels correctly therefore is not a straightforward interpolation a denser network of measurement stations each measuring multiple flow parameters would enable a more thorough evaluation of the model it would also enable the formulation of new boundary conditions and calibration criteria which in turn will enhance the overall model performance it would also allow for the evaluation of the manual calibration of the wetland flow processes the model has successfully simulated tidal delta wetland flow processes for the presented case study now the question arises what this entails for tidal delta wetland systems around the world the results can not simply be extrapolated to other catchments around the world however if another catchment meets the requirements of the proposed method and model a similar study can be conducted to learn more about the hydrodynamics of this catchment since the used method of this study is based on limited data requirements it is applicable to many other similar study areas 6 conclusion this paper presents the application of the ctss8 model to a study area in the lower paraná delta argentina an enhanced strategy was used to spatially represent the wetland area in the study area the model was calibrated against water levels in the main rivers for the hydrological year september 2001 august 2002 with a 10 min interval and on field measurements in a wetland area for june 2016 the obtained values of the manning coefficients after calibration comply with values found in the literature the model was evaluated for an average hydrological year september 2007 august 2008 an extreme dry period december 2008 february 2009 and an extreme wet period december 2009 february 2010 water level simulations were successful for all periods at the two measurement locations in the main rivers the simulated discharges at two upstream locations have the correct order of magnitude the influence of the wetland area on water levels in the main rivers is negligible in the presented model set up however the river dynamics do influence the wetland dynamics and wetland parameters also influence wetland dynamics calibration of the model against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow and outflow mechanisms in the wetland area a next step would be to gather more water level measurements in the distributaries and wetland areas to evaluate the model performance more thoroughly the used model and method can also be applied to other tidal delta wetland systems around the world to learn more about their hydrodynamics and

7386,knowledge about the hydrological regime of wetlands is key to understand their physical and biological properties modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within a wetland is therefore becoming increasingly important 3d models have successfully modelled wetland dynamics but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography many 1d and 2d models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area this study proposes an enhanced quasi 2d modelling strategy that captures the interaction between river discharge and moon tides and the resulting hydrodynamics while using the scarce data available the water flow equations are discretised with an interconnected irregular cell scheme in which a simplification of the 1d saint venant equations is used to define the water flow between cells the spatial structure of wetlands is based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas the islands within the delta are modelled with levee cells creek cells and an interior cell representing a shallow marsh wetland the model is calibrated for an average year and the model performance is evaluated for another average year and additionally an extreme dry three month period and an extreme wet three month period the calibration and evaluation are done based on two water level measurement stations and two discharge measurement stations all located in the main rivers additional calibration is carried out with field water level measurements in a wetland area accurate simulations are obtained for both calibration and evaluation with high correlations between observed and simulated water levels and simulated discharges in the same order of magnitude as observed discharges calibration against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow mechanism in wetland areas a sensitivity analysis for several wetland parameters showed that these parameters are all influencing the water level fluctuation within the wetlands to varying degrees the enhanced quasi 2d model has the potential to accurately simulate river and wetland dynamics for large wetland areas and help to understand their hydrodynamics keywords hydrodynamic modelling wetlands ctss8 lower paraná delta 1 introduction wetlands are one of the most valuable ecosystems for mankind acreman and holden 2013 providing many ecosystem services like flood attenuation pollutant uptaking recharge of groundwater and habitat for biodiversity tsihrintzis et al 1998 special attention has been given to the study of their hydrological regime maltby and acreman 2011 since it determines the physical chemical and biological properties of wetlands mitsch and gosselink 2000 alteration of the catchment hydrology including abstraction of surface and groundwater impoundment or diversion of rivers and land use changes can have a significant impact on wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide there is an increasing need to develop models to assess wetland impacts evaluate risks and develop restoration plans acreman and miller 2007 being a particularly urgent issue for the world s largest deltas as the intensification of human activity deeply modifies the tidal river wetland interaction by changing coastal morphology and reducing wetland extent by filling or dredging hoitink et al 2016 2017 the choice of the modelling approach depends besides the modelling objectives on both scientific and technical aspects as well as on the resources available these aspects include among others the scale of the simulation domain topography hydrological and topographical data available the complexity of the hydraulic regime and computational costs modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes of wetlands is challenging mainly due to data availability in comparison to rivers there is a lack of systematic monitoring of water levels in wetlands okruszko et al 2011 the hydraulics within wetland systems are often neglected or simplified in modelling studies mao and cui 2012 for floodplain wetlands the extent vegetation heterogeneity and flat topography prevent field surveys and hydrological monitoring networks from providing a detailed representation of the propagation and characteristics of floods across the floodplain ogilvie et al 2015 thus remote sensing products are increasingly being used to provide detailed surface topography for 2d and 3d hydraulic models leauthaud et al 2013 haines 2013 grimson et al 2013 and flood extent maps to calibrate or evaluate the performance of the models grings et al 2006 grings et al 2009 salvia et al 2009 flows in wetlands can be characterized as shallow flows where the horizontal dimensions are much larger than the vertical ones arega 2013 the description of flow dynamics in wetlands therefore requires the use of a hydraulic model to capture the interaction between river discharge and moon tides the wetlands of tidal dominated deltas of large rivers present additional challenges due to the very different boundary conditions upstream and at the coastal front many studies have successfully performed hydrologic and hydrodynamic simulations of tidal wetlands in deltaic regions with varying degrees of spatial detail and using different modelling approaches table 1 3d models generally show a good performance and are reliable but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography therefore these models can only be applied to smaller areas or only address the dynamics of the distributary channels lower dimensional models are often preferred for large deltaic systems however many 1d and 2d models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area the first quasi 2d hydraulic model was developed for the large tidal delta of the mekong river by preissmann and cunge zanobetti et al 1968b cunge et al 1980 a quasi 2d model is a compromise between a 1d and a 2d model the main rivers are connected to separated river branches that represent the floodplain thereby creating the illusion of a 2d model although this type of model is able to deal with the temporal scale that is needed to capture the rapid dynamics of tides it is more commonly applied to river floodplain dynamics cunge et al 1980 riccardi 1997 bates and de roo 2000 riccardi et al 2013 as it can accommodate less detailed data and performs well compared to other 2d models beck 2016 quasi 2d models have been used for modelling tidal deltas and wetland systems by introducing an improvement to the spatial configuration of a wetland system a quasi 2d model can also become suitable for modelling the flow processes in tidal delta wetlands the proposed method of modelling requires a minimum amount of data and therefore has the potential to become a generalizable approach to help us understand the hydrodynamics of tidal delta wetlands around the world given this background the objective of this study is to calibrate and evaluate a quasi 2d model to simulate water flows in a test case using a spatial configuration which enables the explicit modelling of distributaries and island wetlands in a tidal delta wetland the ctss8 model riccardi 2000 is chosen for this study this quasi 2d model has successfully been applied to wetland systems around the world garcia et al 2007 sandy rojas et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 flow equations in the model are discretized through interconnected irregular cells which allows for introducting a new spatial structure to the model based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas this in turn allows for the simulation of the complex flow processes in the tidal wetland system 2 study area the test case used in this study is the lower parana river delta in the east of argentina which is a typical case of a tidal delta wetland fig 1 the study area is part of the growing portion of the lower delta covering an area of 2500 km2 between parana guazú and paraná de las palmas rivers fig 2 the paraná river system belongs to the rio de la plata basin the second largest basin in south america after the amazon runs through brazil paraguay and argentina where it flows into de la plata estuary forming the parana delta the delta region is a fluvial coastal complex iriondo 2004 which extends along 300 km from 32 5 s near the city of diamante in entre rios province to 34 29 s near the city of buenos aires covering an area of 17 000 km2 baigun et al 2008 the parana river delta is one of the largest coastal wetlands systems of argentina with a complex estuary delta parker and marcolini 1992 and a large wetland influenced by fresh water tides kandus and malvárez 2002 the lower delta is the deltaic front which extends from the bifurcation of the parana river into the parana guazú and the parana de las palmas rivers the parana guazú sub front has not considerably advanced due to the uruguay river currents which push the sediments to the other sub front average of 0 25 m year boulanger et al 2008 the parana de las palmas sub front is actively growing parallel to the coast near the city of buenos aires 50 100 m year average pittau et al 2004 the parana river drains an area of 2 3 106 km2 with a mean annual discharge of 18 500 m3 s at parana city near the delta apex with peak discharges up to 60 000 m3 s jaime and menendez 2002 the parana river has multimodal and unpredictable flood peaks from different sources high flows of the upper parana river local rainfall flows from minor tributaries moon tides storm surges and even ocean wave surges coming from de la plata estuary kandus et al 2006 baigun et al 2008 the main floods in the delta are driven by the paraná river which has one discharge peak in the austral late summer february march and another in the austral winter july the rio de la plata is also responsible for flooding in the downstream region of the paraná river in the lower delta de la plata estuary has semidiurnal tides with a microtidal regime with amplitudes less than 1 m in the delta which can temporarily reverse the flow of the distributaries prario et al 2011 the influence of the tide on the upstream part of the river depends on the paraná water level if strong winds from the southeast persist for several days the storm surge can block the outlet of paraná waters and increase water levels by 3 m or more the whole system shows seasonal but also interannual fluctuations grings et al 2006 water level fluctuation is also clearly visible in wetland areas on satellite images fig 3 and is of main importance to their physical properties the parana delta exhibits a rich mosaic of heterogeneous wetland landscapes that are interconnected by fluvial corridors with different drainage patterns marshes known locally as pajonales are the main landcover type baigun et al 2008 covering the lower topographic positions of the islands cortadera cyperus giganteus and junco schaenoplectus californicus marshes make up to 45 of the vegetation in the lower paraná delta grings et al 2006 forestry and cattle ranching have been the traditional landuses but agriculture and urban development are rapidly expanding on the islands baigun et al 2008 blanco and mendez 2010 these land uses require the development of infrastructural works including deepening of navigation channels diking island filling and construction of artificial drainages and water diversions resulting in a disconnection between the rivers and distributaries and their flood and tidal plains brinson and malvarez 2002 the impact of this disconnection on the parana delta wetlands has not been assessed yet 3 methods 3 1 model description the ctss8 quasi 2d model is a hydrologic hydraulic model riccardi 2000 developed to allow for continuous simulation of flow regimes and flooding patterns along floodplains the model focus is on horizontal flows but there is also an option to incorporate vertical flows sediment transport and vegetation effects it can simulate quasi 2d flow in a single layer and flow in two interconnected layers flow equations are discretised through a network of interconnected cells cunge 1975 cunge et al 1980 in order to deal with specific features of fluvial systems equations are used to represent different discharge laws between cells the governing equations are the st venant equations for continuity and different simplifications of the momentum equation the model structure allows the representation of reality with different levels of detail enabling the maximum possible subdivision of the physical components with geometrical and hydraulic parameters consistent with the available data it has been successfully applied in argentina to model rainfall runoff processes in transformed lowland areas riccardi 1997 riccardi 2000 and flood evolution in floodplain systems along the parana river garcia et al 2015 rojas et al 2014 in australia the model was used to simulate flows in the hunter estuary to study mangle and saltmarsh dynamics with rising sea levels sandy rojas et al 2014 this model is considered to be an alternative to the traditional 1d 2d mike flow model to simulate flows and flooding patterns throughout the macquarie marshes and to assess the impacts of different management schemes on the wetland habitats trivisonno et al 2014 3 2 model parameters cross sectional data and discharge data for the main rivers and distributaries within the study area were obtained from ina instituto nacional del agua the argentinean national water institute discharge measurements were available for an upstream location in the paraná de las palmas and an upstream location in the paraná guazú containing 144 records for a 22 year period for both locations the study area consists of 17 streams with a total length of 371 5 km a total of 95 cross sections were available for the study area water level measurement from six stations were available from the ministry of transport of argentina for the period 1999 2013 for the main river branches the paraná de las palmas and the paraná guazú three stations at each river the measurements have a resolution of 20 30 min and are referenced to the ign height reference level instituto geografico nacional the national geographical institute of argentina the water surface slope of the main rivers is in the order of 10 5 m m and the mean river widths range from 600 to 2500 m and depths from 5 to 16 m guerrero and lamberti 2013 the river bottom elevations of the river cells in the paraná de las palmas and paraná guazú were approximated assuming steady flow where the river bottom slope is equal to the water slope the average water level slope was estimated by calculating the mean water levels of the measurement stations over an 18 year time period the elevations of the other river cells were estimated by assuming a constant slope for every river and channel all six original water level series contain a significant number of outliers and missing values the outliers are first filtered out from the data series with an absolute threshold and a slope threshold small data gaps in the cleaned series are filled up by using linear interpolation data from a donor station are used to fill the larger gaps of a given station the donor is the measurement station with the highest correlation with the station presenting gaps the water level data of the donor station are scaled in time and amplitude to maximize correlation with the original station and to smoothly fill in the original gap after interpolation only 2 of the data series are missing values the boundary conditions are determined by measurements at four locations buenos aires brazo largo desembocadura and zarate fig 2 buenos aires station is linked to the paraná de las palmas in the model by a channel with dimensions which are approximated the water level measurements are interpolated to create equal 10 min intervals for all stations this is the largest time step that can combine the series with a 20 and 30 min interval without deleting measured data the calculation interval of the model is also 10 min for larger intervals the simulation becomes unstable the initial water levels are set to two meter for all cells except for the levee cells this creates a stable situation that needs limited spin up time the initial water depth for the levee cells is zero there is no overflow in the initial situation 3 3 improvement spatial configuration model our quasi 2d modelling strategy divides the study area in channels and islands with different connection mechanisms the main rivers and distributaries are modelled as a series of connected channel river cells with river river links for the islands we introduce an improvement of the spatial structure based on the ecogeomorphology of islands in complex estuarine deltas such as the parana river which is presented in fig 4 an island has an outer natural levee with an interior shallow marsh wetland connected to distributary streams or rivers by means of one or more tidal creeks which breach or cut across the levee an island is modelled by an inner cell surrounded by levee cells which in turn are surrounded by distributary river cells streams or main rivers fig 4 the inner cell represents the middle or center of the island covered with pajonal marsh the inner cell is surrounded by levee cells and creek cells which link to the river cells the inner cell is directly connected to the river cell by means of one or more creek cells the number of levee and creek cells matches the actual number of adjacent rivers of the island the creek cell is always filled with water flow through the levee cell is only possible when the water level is higher than the levee height island areas were estimated from gis data available from ign the islands are shown in fig 2 and indicated by the numbers 10 till 27 inner cells represent about 40 of the total island area based on estimates from satellite imagery the relative area of creek cells compared to that of levee cells is set to 0 02 being a rough estimation based on field observations the levee height is set to 1 54 m above the ign reference level added to the river bottom elevation this number is derived from field measurements that have been done near arroyo las casas fig 2 3 4 model calibration and evaluation the model was calibrated by means of an objective function consisting of two components the first component is the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 this is the most widely used criterion for calibration and evaluation of hydrological models with observed data but there has also been a long and vivid discussion about the suitability of nse the main concern about nse is its overestimation of model skill for basins with high seasonal variability gupta et al 2009 although the water levels in the study area are subject to seasonal variation the variation is not exceptionally large water levels vary between 1 and 3 m the nse equation is formulated as follows nse 1 t 1 n x s t x o t 2 t 1 n x o t μ o 2 where n is the total number of time steps xs t is the simulated water level at time step t xo t is the observed water level at time step t and μo is the mean observed water level the nse is calculated at carabelitas and las rosas the average nse serves as input for the objective function the second component is a discharge ratio this ratio is obtained as follows r q max q s q o q o q s 1 where qs is the average simulated discharge qo is the average observed discharge and rq is the discharge ratio the interval between two consecutive observed discharges is about two months this interval is too large to compare observed and simulated discharges on every time step therefore the average observed discharge during the calibration period is compared to the average simulated discharge during the same period this component of the objective function therefore guarantees that the simulated discharges have the same order of magnitude as the observed discharges the discharge ratio is calculated for zarate and brazo largo the two upstream boundary conditions both discharge ratios are calculated separately and then averaged the resultant is the second component of the objective function a discharge ratio of zero is perfect the full objective function is formulated as follows objective function α nse 1 1 α r q the nse is reduced by 1 the absolute value of the resultant forms the first component of the objective function this first component is minimized for a perfect nse of 1 parameter α is introduced to manually set the relative importance of nse and rq this value is set to 0 95 based on expert judgement and gives more importance to an accurate nse than an accurate rq an automatic calibration local optimization algorithm based on the nelder mead method nelder and mead 1965 was used to estimate the parameter values for manning coefficients creek levee ratio mean levee height mean height of the island inner cell and the length of the channel between buenos aires and the river mouth of the paraná de las palmas since the water levels showed regular behavior we used a spin up period of one week the period 1 september 2001 31 august 2002 is chosen as the most suitable calibration period because it is representative for an average hydrological year in terms of water levels with a small number of irregularities such as sudden jumps in water level or no fluctuation for a couple of days the model performance is evaluated for the average year september 2007 31 august 2008 the extreme dry period december 2008 february 2009 and the extreme wet period december 2009 february 2010 all with a spin up period of 1 week a period of 3 months is selected for the extreme periods because for a period of one year extremes would be filtered out the values of the calibration parameters obtained after calibration are used for the selected evaluation periods manual calibration was conducted to optimize the simulation of wetland flows the calibration period spans over 22 days for the period between 9 june and 1 july 2016 the manning coefficients of the river levee river creek creek inner and levee inner links are used as calibration parameters there are four overflow situations during the calibration period two overflow situations occurred within the first two days of the field measurements it is therefore chosen not to use a spin up period and to use a calculation interval of 6 s to minimize instabilities the objective function is based on the nse values calculated at rio capitan river cell arroyo las casas creek cell and the pajonal these three nse values are averaged multiple local minima of the objective function are searched to find an optimal solution las rosas and carabelitas stations are used for calibration purposes and evaluation of the model performance given the lack of gauge data for the wetlands two measurement stations were installed in june 2016 inside and outside a wetland located in the center of the study region near arroyo las casas 34 20 6 s 58 33 5 w creek cell and 34 21 s 58 33 2 w inner cell to be able to calibrate the wetland parameters of the model these stations measured the water level every minute and captured four overbank flows during the measurement period evaluation of the model performance for simulating flow mechanisms in wetlands is done by visual interpretation of the results for the field measurement period a sensitivity analysis is conducted to quantify the effects of changing wetland parameters on flow dynamics in wetlands this sensitivity analysis helps us understand the flow processes in the tidal wetland one of the simplest and most common approaches for a sensitivity analysis is to change one factor at a time and analyze its effect on the output cariboni et al 2007 this method is selected in this study because of its simplicity and robustness the ratio area creek cells area levee cells the levee height and the manning coefficients of the wetland links are changed one at a time and the change of the average water level the variation of the water level the levee overflow and the delay between river and inner cells is assessed 4 results 4 1 model calibration and evaluation 4 1 1 river flows table 2 presents the calibration parameters obtained for river cell links main parana branches and distributaries the calibration process for rivers stopped after 52 iterations the manning coefficients are comparable with values found in the literature biancamaria et al 2009 chow 1959 piedra cueva and fossati 2007 table 3 presents the results for calibrating with a normal year and the evaluation for different hydrological conditions normal extremely dry and extremely wet periods the objective function gave lower but acceptable values for the evaluation periods than for the calibration period the simulation during the extreme dry period was more accurate than during the extreme wet period in terms of the discharge ratio the obtained results for the nses are highly satisfactory with nearly perfect simulations for both stations fig 5 presents the observed and simulated water levels at the calibration stations for january an average month in terms of hydrology for the calibration and evaluation periods fig 5a presents the observed and simulated water levels for the calibration at carabelitas the simulated water level shows an almost perfect match with the observed counterpart while at las rosas station the simulations consistently show higher water levels during low tide the nses are above 0 80 and the simulated average discharges differ less than 20 from the observed average discharges for the evaluation periods the model generally underestimates at las rosas for low tides and slightly overestimates at carabelitas for peak flows fig 5b d the simulation during the extreme dry period 5c was more accurate than the simulation during the extreme wet period 5d 4 1 2 wetland flows table 4 presents the calibration parameters obtained for the island cell links distributary levee creek and inner cell manual calibration of the wetland dynamics was stopped when changes of the calibration parameters did not result in improvements of more than 0 01 in the nse the final value of the averaged nse is 0 67 the hydraulic roughness is significantly higher for levees than for creeks as expected which can be explained by the presence of vegetation on levees and the lack of preferred flow patterns fig 6 presents an overflow situation which was correctly captured by the model fig 6a shows the complete period with field measurements fig 6b zooms into the overflow situation on june 27th 2016 the water level in the pajonal marsh rises due to high river water levels which causes high water levels in the creeks and levee overflow the peak water level reaches the pajonal marsh with some delay and is lower than the peak level measured in the arroyo las casas creek the outflow as a function of time is comparable to the inflow process until the water level reaches the levee height next the outflow is slowed down because water can only flow through the creeks this can be seen both in the measurements and the simulations 4 2 sensitivity analysis fig 7 presents the results of the sensitivity analyses for the manning coefficients for the links between creek and inner cells fig 7a and river and creek cells fig 7b the creek levee ratio fig 7c and inner cell elevation fig 7d for a typical island during january 2008 for most inner cells similar variations were found although some only showed minor variations in water level because of their larger size the water level fluctuation in the inner cell is generally smaller than the water level fluctuation in the river cells a lower manning coefficient results in more water level fluctuation water level fluctuations in the wetland inner cell are more influenced by the manning coefficient of the creek inner cell link and the creek levee ratio than the manning coefficient of the river creek link and the island elevation fig 8 shows the sensitivity of the water level of the inner wetland cell to the value of the levee height the water level in the river cell fluctuates significantly more than the inner cell as would be expected a lower levee corresponds with more variation and an overall higher water level in the inner cell for an intermediate levee height 2 0 m the water level shows a sudden bending point when the water level surpasses the levee after which the outflow slows down because there is no longer levee overflow all water flows out via the creek and that slows down the outflow process the figure shows that the model can capture overflow processes and flow from the river to the inner wetland through creeks 5 discussion a model capable to simulate flood dynamics in a large fluvial coastal tidal delta should be able to represent hydrologic and hydraulic processes in a distributed way integrating the main drainage system with the different types of surface flows and their interactions which take place in the deltaic island landscape another requirement for modelling complex flows is giving primary importance to the physical interpretation while maintaining data needs as simple as possible so topographic and hydraulic representations of the physical reality are the two core elements needed to simulate flood dynamics gomes miguez et al 2017 most hydrologic and hydrodynamic models neglect the wetland dynamics or highly simplify wetland areas sassi and hoitink 2013 gu et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 simplified the non tidal upper parana delta by considering valley cells to represent complex alluvial valleys with islands bolgov et al 2014 used several storages to prevent large errors because wetland dynamics was not accounted for in their model our quasi 2d modelling strategy uses a spatial network of cells of irregular size connected to each other by links in a fashion similar to that proposed by cunge and used to model hydrodynamics in deltaic and floodplain regions zanobetti et al 1970 cunge et al 1980 we introduced an improvement based on the observed ecogeomorphology of islands in complex estuarine deltas such as the parana river the main rivers and distributaries are modeled as a series of connected river cells with river river links the islands are modeled by an inner wetland cell surrounded by levee cells which in turn are surrounded by river cells streams or main rivers the inner cell is connected to the river cell by means of one or more creek cells levee cells only transfer water when their height is surpassed by the water level in the river cells this improved strategy allows to simulate flow and overflow processes in one large scale model without having complete 3d information on the terrain and a high density of gauging stations despite having scarce data our model does not neglect the wetland dynamics the simulations presented in section 4 show that this spatial modelling strategy is being able to capture the distributary and wetland dynamics and their interaction actual flow processes are simulated instead of introducing compensation measures these flow processes contain valuable information about the hydrodynamics that is linked to the physical and biological properties of wetlands the model accurately simulates water levels and the average simulated discharges are in the same order of magnitude as the observed average discharges the results of the simulations during the extreme wet period are slightly worse than the results for the other evaluation periods during the extreme wet period there is more overflow than in the other periods and therefore more interaction between the river and wetland system hence the uncertainties in the proposed values for the wetland parameters are significantly more influencing the model outcomes than during average conditions several assumptions had to be made to be able to carry out wetland simulations e g assuming elevations for the different parts of the area and assuming a constant width for the creeks that connect the inner wetland with the river however since the wetland dynamics has limited effect on the river water levels during average conditions these assumptions have limited effect on the evaluation of the model performance at the measurement stations incorporating wetland dynamics in the model does therefore not lead to significant better or worse river water levels simulations the assumption of constant river slopes based on the difference between the average water levels at measurements stations does influence the simulations in the river because elevation is a main parameter in hydrodynamic models the water level simulations showed a consistent overestimation of the low water levels at las rosas in the paraná de las palmas probably due to incorrect river slope estimation and elevations a higher elevation in the paraná guazú than in the paraná de las palmas damps the effect of low water levels in the paraná de las palmas because water will flow from the paraná guazú in the paraná de las palmas during low water levels the model might overestimate this dampening because of too large differences between elevations in both rivers the model performance could only be evaluated at two locations in the main rivers and for one wetland area model calibration and evaluation have mainly been carried out based on observed water levels because of a lack of other data the upper and lower boundary conditions of the model are also prescribed by observed water levels as a result the model has a few degrees of freedom and one could argue that it is fairly easy to get good calibration and evaluation results while this is partly true it should be mentioned that the upstream and downstream boundary conditions are influenced by different flow processes tides river flow wetland flows etcetera which are not equally important at all gauge stations simulating the water levels correctly therefore is not a straightforward interpolation a denser network of measurement stations each measuring multiple flow parameters would enable a more thorough evaluation of the model it would also enable the formulation of new boundary conditions and calibration criteria which in turn will enhance the overall model performance it would also allow for the evaluation of the manual calibration of the wetland flow processes the model has successfully simulated tidal delta wetland flow processes for the presented case study now the question arises what this entails for tidal delta wetland systems around the world the results can not simply be extrapolated to other catchments around the world however if another catchment meets the requirements of the proposed method and model a similar study can be conducted to learn more about the hydrodynamics of this catchment since the used method of this study is based on limited data requirements it is applicable to many other similar study areas 6 conclusion this paper presents the application of the ctss8 model to a study area in the lower paraná delta argentina an enhanced strategy was used to spatially represent the wetland area in the study area the model was calibrated against water levels in the main rivers for the hydrological year september 2001 august 2002 with a 10 min interval and on field measurements in a wetland area for june 2016 the obtained values of the manning coefficients after calibration comply with values found in the literature the model was evaluated for an average hydrological year september 2007 august 2008 an extreme dry period december 2008 february 2009 and an extreme wet period december 2009 february 2010 water level simulations were successful for all periods at the two measurement locations in the main rivers the simulated discharges at two upstream locations have the correct order of magnitude the influence of the wetland area on water levels in the main rivers is negligible in the presented model set up however the river dynamics do influence the wetland dynamics and wetland parameters also influence wetland dynamics calibration of the model against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow and outflow mechanisms in the wetland area a next step would be to gather more water level measurements in the distributaries and wetland areas to evaluate the model performance more thoroughly the used model and method can also be applied to other tidal delta wetland systems around the world to learn more about their hydrodynamics and the functioning of tidal delta wetlands in general acknowledgements this work was mostly carried out at 3ia unsam argentina within the framework of sjoerd wester s master thesis project at the

7387,this paper advances the physical understanding of the flow duration curve fdc regional variation it provides a process based analysis of the interaction between climate and landscape properties to explain disparities in fdc shapes we used i long term measured flow and precipitation data over 73 catchments from the eastern us ii we calibrated the sacramento model sac sma to simulate soil moisture and flow components fdcs the catchments classification based on storm characteristics pointed to the effect of catchments landscape properties on the precipitation variability and consequently on the fdc shapes the landscape properties effect was pronounce such that low value of the slope of fdc sfdc hinting at limited flow variability were present in regions of high precipitation variability whereas in regions with low precipitation variability the sfdcs were of larger values the topographic index distribution at the catchment scale indicated that saturation excess overland flow mitigated the flow variability under conditions of low elevations with large soil moisture storage capacity and high infiltration rates the sfdcs increased due to the predominant subsurface stormflow in catchments at high elevations with limited soil moisture storage capacity and low infiltration rates our analyses also highlighted the major role of soil infiltration rates on the fdc despite the impact of the predominant runoff generation mechanism and catchment elevation in conditions of slow infiltration rates in soils of large moisture storage capacity at low elevations and predominant saturation excess the sfdcs were of larger values on the other hand the sfdcs decreased in catchments of prevalent subsurface stormflow and poorly drained soils of small soil moisture storage capacity the analysis of the flow components fdcs demonstrated that the interflow contribution to the response was the higher in catchments with large value of slope of the fdc the surface flow fdc was the most affected by the precipitation as it tracked the precipitation duration curve pdc in catchments with low sfdcs this became less applicable as surface flow fdc diverged from pdc at the upper tail 40 of the flow percentile the interflow and baseflow fdcs illustrated most the filtering effect on the precipitation the process understanding we achieved in this study is key for flow simulation and assessment in addition to future works focusing on process based fdc predictions keywords flow duration curve regional variation catchment filter precipitation topographic index runoff processes 1 introduction one of the most fundamental problems facing the hydrological community over the last several decades has been the lack of comprehensive understanding about the relative contributions of climatic and watershed characteristics on streamflow and the shape of flow duration curves fdcs yokoo and sivapalan 2011 a flow duration curve fdc graphically illustrates the percentage of time duration that streamflow exceeds a given value over a historical period for a particular river basin e g vogel and fennessey 1994 if the streamflow is assumed to be a random variable the fdc may also be viewed as the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the flow cdf e g vogel and fennessey 1994 leboutillier and waylen 1993 the fdc representation is relevant in many hydrologic applications including reservoir and lake sedimentation studies stream flow assessments hydropower feasibility analysis water quality management waste load allocation and water resource allocation vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 over the past several decades fdcs have been analyzed using a graphical representation ward and robinson 1990 or stochastic models in order to fit the appropriate statistical distribution to empirical fdcs cigizoglu and bayazit 2000 sugiyama et al 2003 castellarin 2004a iacobellis 2008 these studies helped the hydrologic community in issues related to the prediction of the fdc without explicitly advancing the physical understanding of the fdc controls most often the prediction studies at the ungauged catchments related the physiographic characteristics to the statistical moments of the fdc probability distributions leboutillier and waylen 1993 singh and mishra 2001 claps and fiorentino 1997 croker et al 2003 smakhtin and hughes 1997 fennessey and vogel 1990 castellarin et al 2004b this approach does not provide understanding of the fdc controls few researches dealing with the prediction at ungauged catchments provided implicit understanding of the fdc controls for instance musiake et al 1975 emphasized the prevalent effect of the geology structure on characterizing the baseflow after they classified the study catchments small to medium sized into physiographic classes and analyzed the baseflow data transfer between catchments of the same class sefton and howarth 1998 derived the parameters values of a rainfall runoff model from relationships with the morphometric and physiographic characteristics over 60 catchments in uk these relationships indicated through sensitivity analyses of the parameters the collective effect of the landscape characteristics soil land use slope and elevation on the fdc shapes the effect of the geology structure and the landscape characteristics remained indicative and required a detailed physical and quantitative analyses one of the rare studies that addressed thoroughly the effect of the vegetation types on the shape of the fdcs is burt and swank 1992 the study demonstrated that fertilized grass and the forest cover controlled similarly the discharge levels for all the frequency classes the existing literature can be used as base for our study towards a more comprehensive understanding of the fdc controls another category of studies analyzed the fdcs from the perspective of runoff processes using stochastic modeling botter et al 2007a muneepeerakul et al 2010a b botter et al 2009 the investigations contributed to advance the understanding of the fdc controls botter et al 2007a derived the slow flow component fdc baseflow through analysis of the soil moisture dynamics and the statistical properties of the precipitation subsequently botter et al 2009 included non linearity in the subsurface storage discharge relationship and muneepeerakul et al 2010a b extended the same model to include a fast flow component surface flow the ability of the model to reproduce observed fdcs has been tested in small to medium sized catchments in both the us and europe botter et al 2007b ceola et al 2010 botter 2010 however this stochastic dynamic model builds on assumptions about precipitation i e non random events in poisson rainfall arrival and could only be applied seasonally with constant parameter values for each season botter et al 2007a b therefore overcoming the limitations of the stochastic dynamic framework reviewed above would further help in revealing the climatic and landscape controls of the fdcs in the continental us a recent series of empirical studies analyzed the pattern of change of the fdcs in catchments from all the us cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the study catchments had diverse climate and landscape properties at a first stage cheng et al 2012 analyzed the fdc shape from the correlation of their statistical moments when fitted to a gamma distribution with first order catchment characteristics i e baseflow index maximum daily precipitation and a fraction of non rainy days subsequently in a study by coopersmith et al 2012 the study catchments were classified into climate clusters based on climate signatures i e precipitation seasonality index seasonality index of the precipitation and day of peak precipitation the climate clusters helped yaeger et al 2012 to investigate the spatial pattern of fdcs using the process controls of the seasonal flow response in the us namely the aridity the snowmelt and the phenology these processes were determined by the combined modeling and empirical water balance study of ye et al 2012 however the large extent of the study area i e the entire continental us did not reveal sufficient detail about the climatic and landscape controls of fdcs the characteristics of climate seasonality aridity and phenology that influenced the average seasonal flow response in ye et al 2012 were not sufficient to explain the diversity of fdc shapes across the continental us yaeger et al 2012 a study by yokoo and sivapalan 2011 examined the shapes of fdcs under several theoretical combinations of landscape properties with climate this study developed a conceptual framework to predict fdcs using a runoff process based approach the framework considered the fdc as constructed from precipitation variability that cascades through the catchment system and gets exposed to landscapes in order to generate runoff under its respective process controls cheng et al 2012 this conceptual framework provided some understanding but it required further analyses and testing using observed data yokoo and sivapalan 2011 nonetheless it can also serve as guidance for investigations focusing on the study of fdc controls even with previous research regarding the factors that control the shapes of the fdcs we remain far from understanding the physical mechanisms behind the regional variation of fdc the need for a process based understanding motivated the research goals of this study therefore here we propose to analyze the regional variation of fdcs in the eastern us to advance our current physical understanding about fdc controls the eastern us has considerable variability in landscape i e mountains and plains and climate in particular the mountainous appalachian region has historically been prone to flooding caused by late winter and early spring rains as well as snowmelt summer cloudbursts and remnants of tropical systems perry and combs 1998 perry et al 2001 hicks et al 2005 the following questions guided our research 1 if the regional variation of fdcs is controlled by the interaction of climate and landscape properties then to what extent is the diversity in the shapes of fdcs explained by each of the controls and 2 in response to their effect what is the aspect of the runoff processes that govern the regional variation of fdcs we developed a number of methods to answer our research questions in this paper we used rainfall runoff data from 73 catchments across the eastern us and through a combination of data analysis and conceptual rainfall runoff modeling we analyzed the diversity in precipitation and in storms of the study catchments then we developed a framework to characterize differences and similarities in landscape properties to measure their interaction with precipitation to affect the fdc we elucidated the effect of fdc controls on the flow components and runoff processes and we investigated the distributions of topographic indexes at the catchment level our overall goal was to providea detailed analysis of the climate and landscape properties in the region of interest and to advance the process understanding of the physical relationships between the shapes of fdcs and the effect of climate and landscape properties 2 dataset and study area 2 1 dataset the catchments used in this study are part of the database developed for the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 the database contains historical hydro meteorological data and land surface characteristics for many hydrological basins in the us and in other countries duan et al 2006 mopex research has been driven by a series of international workshops that brought together interested hydrologists and modellers to exchange knowledge and experience in developing and applying model parameter estimation techniques with its focus on parameter estimation mopex plays a major role in the context of international initiatives such as prediction in ungauged basins pub hrachowitz et al 2013 we extracted all the data of catchments located within the study area from the mopex database we chose the mopex because it has relatively long record length 50 years on average and it has been used repeatedly in several researches in the u s koren et al 2003 cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 2016 the database is freely available and was retrieved from the following website www nws noaa gov oh mopex mo datasets htm air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet and streamflow are all available with a daily time step precipitation data is representative of the catchment average and is available at both daily and hourly time steps in this study we use the hourly and daily precipitation as well as the daily flow and daily pet the record length ranges from 1948 to 2000 the mopex catchments are considered to be associated with a natural flow regime with limited human influence schaake et al 2006 2 2 study area characteristics we studied the spatial pattern of fdcs using 73 mopex catchments from the eastern us the mean annual precipitation map in the study catchments varies between 702 mm and 2072 mm see appendix table 1 the catchments have a humid climate the aridity index the ratio of the map by the potential evapotranspiration is rather low according to coopersmith et al 2012 see appendix table 1 where the catchments are sorted according to their site code the catchment size ranged from 67 km2 to 8052 km2 as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 appendix around 20 of the catchments have sizes above 4000 km2 the catchments are mainly forested with some proportions of agricultural lands and limited influence of urban areas see appendix table 1 the catchments runoff ratio that is the annual runoff by the annual precipitation ratio has a minimum of 0 33 a maximum of 0 64 and a median of 0 44 see appendix table 1 perennial snow cover is absent for most catchments and does not exceed 3 of the surface area for individual catchments berghuijs et al 2014 the precipitation in the eastern us is of low seasonality fig 1 b coopersmith et al 2012 sawicz et al 2011 the mean monthly precipitation has limited fluctuation through seasons whereas storm characteristics in particular storm intensity have systematic seasonal variation hershfield 1961 orographic thunderstorms are common in the appalachian mountains and produce large rainfall accumulations that may exceed 600 mm for 6 h storms erskine 1951 eisenlohr 1952 miller 1990 smith et al 1996 at the headwater scale orographic thunderstorms lead to large floods that may exceed the 500 year return period such as the event of november 1985 in central appalachian see miller 1990 the appalachian mountains create a contrast in elevations as shown by the digital elevation model dem in fig 2 catchments with low relief are mainly located in the eastern coast and in the state of georgia while the interior catchments have higher relief the maximum elevation across the region is 2029 m above sea level m a s l and the minimum is 93 m a s l fig 2 this area of low elevation refers to a wetland in florida that lies below sea level in this study we do not describe the detailed geomorphology and geology descriptors i e impermeable areas spring horizon intermittent streams covering such a large region because of limited availability the variation in soil texture and structure across the study region affects the soil hydrologic properties and so the flow response wood et al 1984 fig 2 illustrates the spatial pattern of the main hydrologic groups hgb soil with medium infiltration rate and hgc soil with slow infiltration rate wood et al 1984 note that there is a gradual decrease of hgb soils from the southern to northern regions in mid latitudes the soil is a combination of hgb and hgc while in northeast it becomes predominantly hgc 3 methods our analysis of the regional variation of fdcs covered two main dimensions i the study of fdc shapes in the context of landscape properties acting as a filter for precipitation at the catchment scale and ii detailed analyses of the spatial pattern of the fdcs using flow components and runoff generation mechanisms prior to the fdc analyses we grouped the study catchments into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics in order to control for climate and isolate the effect of landscape properties on the regional variation of fdcs we diagnosed the seasonality of storm characteristics in each catchment this has been achieved by storm separation of hourly precipitation see section 3 1 below we analyzed the slope of the fdcs sfdcs and their regional variation i e the slope of the fdc is surrogate of the flow variability sawicz et al 2011 see section 3 4 of this manuscript for more details on how the slope of the fdc is calculated and defined we defined categories of flow variability across study catchments based on the average value of sfdcs then we investigated the differences in fdcs from the interaction of catchment filter with precipitation variability we assessed the effect of catchment filter from the spatial pattern of fdcs and the precipitation duration curves pdcs using as guidance the conceptual framework of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the slopes of the precipitation duration curve pdc are considered a surrogate of precipitation variability the catchment filter effect on the precipitation collectively represent the impact of the landscape properties i e soil hydrologic properties surface topography and vegetation type and the geology structure the limited availability of detailed descriptors of the vegetation i e age density species and the geology suggests we focus in combination to the storm characteristics on the impact of the landscape properties and the soil moisture storage capacity smsc we calibrated the sac sma model to predict the daily soil moisture and estimate the smsc at the catchment scale the sac sma model has been applied worldwide and particularly in the different hydro climate regimes of the united states koren et al 2003 it allows for more detailed flow simulations by separating flow into runoff components namely the direct runoff surface runoff interflow and baseflow van werkhoven et al 2008 burnash 1995 we utilised the flow components provided by sac sma simulations to meet the second dimension of our research goal we also determined the predominant runoff generation mechanisms after we investigated the topographic index ti distribution at the catchment scale these process based investigations explained the physical reasons for the regional variation of the fdcs at this level we reassessed the effect of the catchment filter on precipitation pdc to determine the flow component fdc that is directly affected by the precipitation variability fig 3 summarizes the several steps of our study 3 1 storm separation we obtained hourly rainfall data from the mopex database that is available for each study catchment we separated the hourly rainfall into storm and inter storm periods using an automated objective algorithm the separation criterion is a specified minimum dry period between consecutive events equal to 6 h erskine 1951 eisenlohr 1952 miller 1990 smith et al 1996 which is similar to what other researchers have adopted hershfield 1961 and huff 1967 used 6 h koutsoyiannis and foufoula georgiou 1993 used 7 h robinson and sivapalan 1997 used 7 h in a study area belonging to the appalachian region the pulse events of intensity equal or lower than 0 01 mm hour are considered as part of a no event period the storm separation generated a time series of storm intensity storm duration and storm depth subsequently we looked at the mean monthly change of the storm depth storm intensity and the storm duration we had to analyze the behaviour of the change more closely in order to classify the catchments into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics from this perspective using climate indices and a synoptic based approach i e verdon kidd and kiem 2009 would not help us to get detailed knowledge of the storm characteristics our approach serves the goal of our study i e understanding the controls of the fdc shapes at regional scale 3 2 simulation of soil moisture calibration of sac sma under the mopex project default sac sma parameters a priori parameters have been estimated for each catchment in the dataset to facilitate model calibration koren et al 2003 after calibration we used the sac sma model output to estimate daily soil moisture and the flow component fdc the basic design of the model centers on a two layer soil structure a relatively thin upper layer and usually a much thicker lower layer that supplies moisture to meet the evapotranspiration demands koren et al 2003 each layer consists of tension and free water storages the a priori sac sma model parameters available in mopex were estimated using soil information from a statsgo soil texture map koren et al 2003 eleven parameters from a total of thirteen were estimated using soil physical relationships soil water content θs field capacity θfld and wilting point θwlt in 11 soil layers koren et al 2003 the other two parameters do not have a physical meaning adimp and pctim deal with the fraction of impervious areas in a catchment the default ranges by sac sma were initially used for these two parameters thus the model simulations of flows and soil moisture account for the role of the impervious areas we calibrated the sac sma model parameters using the shuffle complex algorithm sce ua with 10 000 iterations sorooshian et al 1993 this algorithm is extensively used for sac sma calibration to achieve different research goals such as studying model parameter transferability e g gan and burges 2006 and building a large database for the continental us e g newman et al 2015 similar to gan and burges 2006 and koren et al 2003 we constrained the calibration to the a priori value of each parameter to keep physical consistency and reduce equifinality we set 35 as the range of deviations allowed from the default parameters this range is larger than the range used in koren et al 2003 i e 25 we set this interval to allow for more variability around the default parameters and in the parameters space that is used by the sce ua algorithm to find the global optimum the model was calibrated for the period 1948 1963 the objective function minimized rmse root mean square error between daily observed and simulated flows the model calibration performance was evaluated by nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the catchments with the highest ns were tested for validation and considered in the analyses using a sample of 100 catchments for calibration those with ns lower than 0 50 were disregarded from the study the eliminated catchments should have a minimal effect on our outcomes i e environmental controls of the fdcs the same ns based criterion was used by berghuijs et al 2014 for analysis of regional water balance in the continental us in this study the catchment sample decreased from 100 to 73 and the efficiency of daily simulated flows ranged from 0 50 and 0 92 the average ns value was 0 72 at lower efficiency mainly peaks of winter december and early spring february were underestimated overall the model performance was satisfactory in this study sac sma simulation helped in predicting the time series of daily flow components and daily soil moisture 3 3 soil moisture storage capacity smsc the soil moisture storage capacity smsc is a surrogate of root zone depth as described in gao et al 2014 it is a reservoir that acts as a dynamic buffer that moderates flows and retains tension water for plant use fenicia et al 2008 zhao and liu 1995 therefore smsc was calculated using daily soil moisture sm estimates from the sac sma model every year each catchment has a maximum and minimum value of sm the difference between the two figures is equivalent to the reservoir of catchment water storage capacity gao et al 2014 the median storage capacity for each catchment was determined and taken as representative 3 4 slope of the empirical fdc the slope of the fdc sfdc is a surrogate of the flow variability in time sawicz et al 2011 it is calculated between the 33rd and 66th flow quantile since at semi log scale this represents a relatively linear part of the fdc yadav et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 the entire daily record of the 50 year on average length was used to construct the empirical fdcs and to calculate their slopes a high slope value indicates a variable flow regime while a small value means a more damped flow response sawicz et al 2011 the sfdc is defined as 1 sfdc ln q 33 ln q 66 0 66 0 33 where sfdc is the slope of the flow duration curve q33 is the streamflow value at the 33rd percentile and q66 is its value at the 66th percentile we normalized the empirical fdcs by the mean annual daily flows as in yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and yaeger et al 2012 before we calculated the slopes of the curves 3 5 precipitation duration curve and catchment filter the pdc is constructed in the same way as the fdc but instead of daily flows we used daily precipitation smakhtin and masse 2000 the entire daily record of 50 years on average was used to construct the empirical pdcs and calculate their slopes spdc we normalized the pdcs by their respective mean daily precipitation before we calculated the slopes unlike fdc the slope of the pdc usually dips at a smaller percentile than the total 100 because precipitation may be null for many days in a year smakhtin and masse 2000 then the most linear part of the spdc calculation will not be equal to that used for sfdc instead it will depend on the precipitation records the linear portion of pdc across the study catchments ranged between 10 and 30 according to the conceptual framework of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the precipitation is filtered by the catchment system to generate daily flows of a given variability here we assumed that the catchment filter can be assessed using the ratio of sfdc to spdc higher values of this ratio correspond to sfdc values that are closer to spdc this also corresponds to weaker catchment filters leading to high flow variability 3 6 topographic index distribution for each catchment analyses of the topographic index ti are helpful to explore the predominant runoff generation ti represents the propensity of a point within a catchment to generate saturation excess overland flow beven and kirkby 1979 due to a topographic control on surface and subsurface flows rice and hornberger 1998 ti was first defined by beven and kirkby 1979 as follows 1 ti ln a tan β where ti is the topographic index of a point pixel within a watershed α is the specific upslope area per unit contour length β is the local topographic slope angle acting at the point in this study ti was calculated at the pixel level using a dem of 30 m resolution and algorithms necessary for the determination of specific upslope area a and the local slope angle β rousseau et al 2005 hentati et al 2010 the ti calculation uses the properties of the stream network namely the flow directions and the flow accumulation which both help to identify the riparian zone see hentati et al 2010 finer details about the stream network dynamics and the stream connectivity are difficult to get for each watershed therefore the effects of intermittent streams and whether they affect the predominant runoff generation mechanism and the flow response are not considered in our calculations of the topographic index and goes beyond the scope of our study the frequency of ti distribution was then determined for each catchment after classification of ti pixel values the differences in the ti frequency distribution at the catchment scale illustrates the wide differences in topographic properties between study catchments and consequently the effect of topography on the flow response according to beven and kirkby 1979 and beven and wood 1983 large values of ti in tails of the distribution indicate the likelihood of runoff being generated by saturation excess overland flow whereas smaller values in the tails hint to predominant subsurface processes in the runoff generation the flow response depends also on the soil infiltration properties and permeability price 2011 ameli et al 2015 therefore our analyses of the runoff generation mechanism using ti serve to reveal the predominant mechanism that takes place as a response to topography while we acknowledge the effect of other factors i e permeability on the flow response we use the spatial pattern of the soil hydrologic properties as indicative of the soil infiltration rates and permeability wood et al 1984 the combination between the soil hydrologic properties and the ti analyses helped in understanding the effect of the runoff generation mechanisms on the regional flow response and the shapes of fdc 4 results 4 1 effects of landscape properties on filtering the precipitation and inducing regional variation of the fdcs 4 1 1 climate clusters the fig 4 a illustrates the catchments classified into three clusters according to monthly changes of average daily storm intensity storm duration and storm depth the storm intensity had the most systematic regional variation across the eastern us compared to the rest of storm metrics therefore it was the criterion that helped to classify the study catchments into three clusters or geographically defined regions of homogeneous storm characteristics the c3 cluster fig 4 b had a peak storm intensity in summer july in c2 the storm intensity had no seasonality fig 4 c however in c1 fig 4 d we observed two peaks a first one in summer and a second in late winter meanwhile the storm depth seasonality was similar in c2 and c1 clusters declining dramatically during the summer and increasing during the fall and winter in the c3 cluster northeast the storm depth was marginally higher in the summer compared to the fall and winter seasons the duration did not exhibit a seasonal pattern and its variation is correlated to storm intensity fluctuations smaller storm intensities corresponded to larger durations and vice versa the storms in c3 and c2 clusters had the longest duration 24 h while in c1 the duration did not go beyond 18 h 4 1 2 precipitation variability from slopes of precipitation duration curves on average the pdc curves dip at 70 of time exceedance in the c1 and c2 clusters and at 80 for the c3 cluster in the northeastern us fig 5 b d and c respectively these high precipitation percentiles are illustrative of the humid climate in the eastern us three catchments in the c3 cluster dip at 50 they are highlighted by a rectangle in fig 4 a these catchments have a larger number of days with zero precipitation than the rest of the catchments in the same cluster the map for each of these three catchments is in the same range of the average value in the c3 cluster 1100 mm the cumulative distribution function cdfs of spdcs in each catchment for each cluster are shown in fig 5 a the clusters of c1 and c2 have the steepest pdcs high variability of precipitation in c3 the precipitation is less variable because of flatter pdcs fig 5 a 4 1 3 soil moisture storage capacity the smsc soil moisture storage capacity was classified into two groups based on the average of 73 catchments in fig 6 a the figure shows that lowland areas i e in north carolina georgia and some catchments in virginia and pennsylvania have above average smscs compared to highland areas i e high elevations of appalachian mountains where smscs are below average the c1 georgia and c2 clusters are regions where most of the catchments have high smsc compared to catchments in c3 fig 6 b overall smsc increases along north south and west east directions the forest cover was the lowest in proportions in c2 and c3 fig 6 c the smscs were the smallest in the c3 because of catchments with highest mean elevations fig 6 d and poor drained soils highest rates of hgc soils fig 6 e the smsc was significantly negatively correlated p values 0 05 to forest cover catchment mean elevation and hgc soils fig 6 f h consequently smsc is affected by the interaction between forest cover topography and soil hydrologic properties in c2 the smsc increased as the infiltration rates increased lower hgc fig 6 e and the mean elevation decreased fig 6 a in c1 the smsc was the largest with low mean elevations fig 6 d and well drained soils lower hgc fig 6 e the catchments at high elevation happened to be the most forested fig 6 c the smsc decreased at the most forested catchments fig 6 f 4 1 4 the regional variation of the fdc categories of flow variability the fdc slopes were grouped into two categories sfdcs below and above average fig 7 a shows the non spatial correlation of sfdcs with climate clusters which demonstrates the dominant effect of catchments landscape properties in the regional variation of fdcs the sfdc decreases from northern to southern regions the sfdc is correlated with catchment latitude via a statistically significant relationship r2 0 076 r 0 27 p value 0 05 we do not show the figure of the regression for conciseness the sfdc also decreases in a west east direction fig 7 a which explains the low r2 of the sfdc latitude relationship fig 7 b c and d illustrate the fdc of each catchment classified into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics the steepest fdcs highest sfdc values are mostly located in the c3 cluster and in some catchments from c1 and c2 fig 7 e most catchments in c1 and c2 had small sfdcs in fig 7 f and 7 g the change in the flow variability sfdc is related to the change in soil moisture storage capacity smsc and soil hydrologic properties hgc p value 0 05 we notice that there is high variability of the sfdc in the 200 300 mm range of the smsc the smsc explains only 4 5 r2 0 045 of the total variability of the sfdc thus in the 200 300 mm range of the smsc the fdc may have low or large value of the slopes this hints at other factors that caused this variability also there is high variability around hgc 0 20 and a small decrease of the sfdc for hgc beyond the 70 we admit that in addition to the soil infiltration rates indicated by proportions of the hgc and properties of the smsc the structure of the subsurface geology and the deep groundwater would have contributed to this variability the spatial pattern of sfdc shows that in the northeastern us c3 most catchments have high flow variability large sfdcs and small smscs at high elevations where hgc soils are predominant fig 2 b the few catchments in c1 south east and c2 center with large sfdcs had small smscs and soils with medium to slow infiltration rates half hgc and half hgb they are mainly located in kentucky and the interior parts of virginia fig 7 a two main particularities in the spatial pattern of the fdcs are worth mentioning first there were few catchments in c2 where small smsc was associated with limited flow variability small sfdc these catchments highlighted by a rectangle in fig 7 a have predominant hgb soils fig 2 second few catchments in north carolina and south georgia highlighted by oval shape in fig 7 a had large flow variability high sfdc in soils with large smsc and slow infiltration rates hgc and hgd fig 3 4 1 5 effect of catchment filter on precipitation and flow duration curves after we analyzed the spatial pattern of the sfdc that changes proportionally to patterns of the landscape properties mean elevation hgc forest cover and the smsc we explore the pattern of the catchment filter the catchment filter helps to implicitly measure the effect of the catchment system in filtering the precipitation and in generating flow characterized by some level of variability a value of the sfdc according to the way it is calculated ratio of the sfdc by the spdc it points collectively to the effect of all the factors that contribute to filter the precipitation i e landscape properties deep groundwater and the geology structure in fig 8 a the filter effect increased from the northern to southern regions the weakest filters were found in the c3 cluster where the sfdc to spdc ratio was above average fig 8 a and b the filters in most catchments from c1 and c2 had below average ratios fig 8 b the cdfs representing the catchment filters in c1 and c2 illustrate the extent to which they have similar landscape characteristics fig 8 b the spatial pattern of the catchment filters in fig 8 a reflects that of fdc in fig 7 a hence the fdc shapes are a mirror of the catchment filter effect on the pdc the characteristics of the catchment filters are related to the soil hydrologic properties and soil moisture storage capacity fig 8 c and d the effect of the catchment filters on precipitation became more pronounced as hgc rates decreased and smsc increased p value 0 05 4 2 process understanding of the fdc regional variation 4 2 1 aspect of flow component fdcs fig 9 displays the fdcs of each flow component with regard to sfdc categories high sfdc versus low sfdc in fig 7 a the slopes of the baseflow fdcs are of larger values in fig 9 a for sites with high sfdcs than those in fig 9 b for sites with low sfdcs we calculated the slope of the median baseflow fdc in each category it was larger in the category of large sfdcs slope 3 55 than that of small sfdcs slope 2 42 fig 9 a and b this suggests that the total flow variability is partly caused by the baseflow variability interflow has a more pronounced contribution to total flow in catchments with large sfdcs compared to those with flat small sfdcs in fact it dips between 20 and 70 of the flow percentile for high sfdc category whereas this happens between 30 and 55 for low sfdc category fig 9 b and e respectively the normalized median curves confirm these differences fig 10 a it dips at 47 and at 35 in 10 b the surface flow fdcs in the upper tail and until 40 of the distribution are flatter for catchments with small flow variability small sfdcs in fig 9 b compared to those with high flow variability large sfdc catchments category in fig 9 a this flow lasts longer and has less irregularities at the lower tail for catchments exhibiting large sfdcs it dips between 85 and 95 when sfdc is large and between 60 and 80 in when sfdc is small the normalized surface flow fdcs in both categories were consistent with the differences in the upper tail where surface flow fdc is more regular in the large sfdc category whereas it showed an inflexion at 40 in the small sfdc category fig 10 a and b respectively consequently high flow variability stems from a highly variable baseflow a predominant interflow and a highly variable surface flow however in catchments where the response is dampened small sfdcs the baseflow and surface flow are less variable and interflow contributes less to the total flow variability 4 2 2 predominant runoff generation mechanism across the eastern us from fig 11 the ti distributions separated into three distinct groups according to differences in the runoff generation mechanisms across the study catchments fig 11 a three main categories were distinguished the left skewd the middle and the right skewed in fig 11 b the catchments in the right skewed ti distribution have large ti values in their tails which suggests predominant saturation excess overland flow curve with dashed lines they spread over the coastal plain and piedmont regions fig 11 a however catchments from the left skewed ti distribution have smaller values in their tails which illustrates the prevalent effect of subsurface stromflow over the saturation excess overland flow fig 11 b these are mountainous catchments from the appalachians fig 11 a with regard to the middle ti distribution it is hard to distinguish a prevalent mechanism both mechanisms could be important in their effect on the flow response the differences of flow component indices and their fdcs across ti categories explained the pattern of the runoff mechanisms the baseflow indices were consistent fig 12 a and d however according to the cdfs of the surface flow index this latter is higher in catchments with dominant satuartion excess overland flow right skewed and to some exent the middle ti clusters fig 12 d the subsurface flow and interflow indices are larger in catchments with predominant subsurface runoff processes left skewed ti cluster cdfs in fig 12 c and f respectively fig 12 compares the fdc flow components using typical catchments in each ti category the interflow was dominant as a result of prevalent subsurface runoff processes that is it dips at 50 and 35 of the distribution in left skewed and middle ti category in fig 13 a and c respectively the interflow effect on the response becomes of lesser importance whenever the saturation excess is dominant i e interflow dips at 30 of the distribution in fig 13 b 4 2 3 fdc regional variation in relation to the pattern of runoff generation mechanisms from fig 11 the catchments with predominant subsurface processes have large sfdcs fig 7 a and limited soil moisture storage capacity smsc fig 6 a in catchments with large smsc fig 6 a the prevalent saturation excess overland flow decreases the sfdcs fig 7 a it is worth mentioning that in some catchments highlighted by an oval shape in fig 11 a with predominant saturation excess and large smsc fig 6 a the sfdcs are of large values fig 7 a also few catchments with predominant subsurface processes and limited smsc highlighted by square shape in fig 11 a exhibited low flow variability small sfdcs fig 7 a this seems to conflict with the general pattern of the relationship between fdc shapes and predominant runoff generation mechanism other factors interacted with the topography i e soil structure the soils in catchments highlighted by an oval shape is a combination of hgc and hgb proportions fig 2 moreover the soils in catchments highlighted by a square shape are well drained hgb in fig 2 these combinations are pointing out to the following whenever saturation excess is predominant the limited water infiltration could make the flow response less dampened also under predominant subsurface processes the high infiltration rate mitigates the flow response in order to better understand the effect of the infiltration rate on the runoff processes and the fdc shape we used the parameter permutations between two catchments of different soil properties hgc versus hgb and located in the piedmont region highlighted with ovale shape in fig 8 a a detailed description of the catchments main characteristics is provided in table 1 appendix the saturation excess is predominant in both catchments the calibrated parameters of the catchment with poor drainage conditions fig 14 a are used to simulate flows for the catchment with predominant hgb fig 14 b the total flow fdc diverge in catchment number 02349500 from the base conditions fig 14 c the interflow shifted upward while baseflow diverged from base conditions the surface flow curve kept the same shape after parameter permutation hence the change in the fdc shapes of interflow and baseflow steepened the total flow fdc 4 2 4 flow components of the fdc with regards to precipitation process understanding of the catchment filter effect the effect of the catchment filter on precipitation precipitation duration curve pdc could be demonstrated through the aspect of subsurface and surface processes from figs 13 and 14 the surface flow is most sensitive to pdc the pdc and the surface flow fdc dip at the same percentile contrary to the subsurface flow components interflow and baseflow they seem to be less dependent on precipitation and rather more dependent on subsurface processes such as the groundwater and the deep percolation properties of the soils note that the surface flow fdc is almost parallel to the pdc in catchments with predominant subsurface processes and poorly drained soils fig 13 a and c however according to fig 13 b and 14 b the surface flow fdc deviates from the pdc at the upper tail in catchments with small sfdcs under conditions of predominant saturation excess and well drained soils hgb hence the catchment filter although it seems to directly affect subsurface processes appears to affect surface flow response in catchments with limited flow variability 5 discussion the goal of this paper was to elucidate the spatial pattern of fdcs over the eastern us and to evaluate the interaction between climate and landscape properties with respect to runoff processes in order to provide a comprehensive physical understanding of the regional variation of fdcs we analyzed rainfall runoff data from 73 mopex catchments these catchments were classified into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics in order to control for climate and better inspect the effect of landscape properties the storm intensity revealed the most distinct systematic seasonal variation across catchments and was used as a criterion for the classification the use of other climatic variables e g precipitation and temperature for climate classification in past studies from the us were less relevant to delineate zones of similar climate e g fovell and fovell 1993 our cluster delineation using storms was consistent with hershfield 1961 where in the northeastern us c3 cluster the storm intensity has a peak in the summer in the center it is evenly distributed through seasons c2 cluster and in the southeast state of georgia in c1 cluster it shows two peaks during the summer and spring seasons the climate classification by coopersmith et al 2012 in the us split our study area into two clusters based on a combination of climate indices e g aridity precipitation seasonality peak of precipitation day and the average runoff most likely the storm characteristics help to elucidate more details about climate homogeneity which is critically needed for the study of interaction between climate and landscape properties 5 1 to what extent the diversity of fdc shapes can be explained by climate and landscape properties we found that in the cluster of low precipitation variability flat pdc in the northeastern us c3 cluster fig 5 a the flows had high variability large sfdcs fig 7 e also in clusters of high precipitation variability steep pdc in the central regions c2 cluster fig 5 a and in southeastern us c1 cluster in georgia the flows had low variability small sfdcs fig 7 e this finding underlines the effect of the catchments filter when interacting with the precipitation in the process of flow generation as a result of the effect of the catchment filter the overall pattern was a decrease in the value of slope of fdcs from northern to southern regions and from west to east directions statistical significant correlation of the sfdc with the latitude p value 0 05 in this study mainly we reveal the effect of the interaction between the soil moisture storage capacity smsc the soil drainage conditions and the topography in characterizing the catchment filter figs 6 and 8 whose spatial pattern fig 8 a mirrored the regional variation of the fdc fig 7 a in past fdc regionalization studies some of these landscape properties mean elevation soil types and land cover have been used as explanatory variables to regionalize fdc without being explicitly analyzed in terms of their effect on the flow variability for example arora et al 2005 used the mean elevation to distinguish between regions of different fdcs sefton and howarth 1998 deployed a combination of landscape characteristics e g topography soil types climate and land cover for fdc regionalization most of the large small sfdcs are located at high low elevation fig 7 a however there are few catchments in c1 and c2 clusters despite they are at high low elevation they have small large sfdcs highlighted by square and an oval shape in fig 7 a respectively in the following we discuss first the reasons for large small sfdcs at high low elevation we found that most of the catchments in c1 and c2 acted as a strong precipitation filter fig 8 b due to large smsc figs 6 b and 8 c and large soil infiltration rates figs 6 e and 8 d whereas the catchment filter in c3 was weaker fig 8 b because of small smsc at high elevation figs 6 b and 8 c and poorly drained soils figs 6 e and 8 d a study by swift et al 1988 demonstrated that the decreasing soil depth in steep topography resulted in less opportunity to store soil moisture before a rain also swift et al 1988 study suggested that at higher elevation there is a limited evapotranspiration demand in our study region we found that the potential evapotranspiration pet decreased with elevation which supports the idea of decreased et at high elevation and its effect on enhancing the flow variability the figure of the pet spatial pattern was not shown for conciseness in conditions of catchments at high elevation butt et al 2001 stated that the steep topography indicates the hydraulic gradient of shallow soils these physical explanations that combine the decrease of the soil moisture storage capacity with the decrease of et and the increase of the hydraulic gradient under conditions of steep topography corroborate our findings and help to understand the controls of large values of the sfdcs at high elevations in catchments of the c3 cluster and a few in c1 and c2 clusters our results also underscored the effect of the soil properties on shapes of the fdcs the increase in the hgc proportions steepened the slope of the fdcs fig 7 g according to price 2011 the influence of soil characteristics on water storage can be understood by the tight correlations between soil properties and topography the soil properties play a significant role in the rate of soil moisture loss due to surface or subsurface topographic gradients dodd and lauenroth 1997 yeakley et al 1998 therefore large values of slope of the fdcs at high elevations in c3 and in a few catchments from c1 and c2 could be related to the interaction of shallow soils with poor drainage conditions this effect is maximized in c3 where the sfdcs were the largest fig 7 e and close to the precipitation variability slope of pdc fig 8 a in contrast to conditions of large sfdcs the mitigated flow response small sfdcs in most catchments from c1 and c2 could be explained by the interaction of flat topography with soils of high infiltration rates hgb the increased water storage capacity large smsc dampened the flow variability despite the large precipitation variability we should mention that in our study the effect of the vegetation cover on the flow variability was overall not as explicit as the effect of topography and soil drainage conditions in fact the contrast in types of the vegetation cover between the study catchments is not as pronounced as it is for topography and soil hydrologic properties the vegetation cover is consistent and decreases in few catchments in piedmonts and the southeastern us see fig 8 in berghuijs et al 2014 therefore the vegetation cover effect was rather implicit to that of soil moisture storage capacity statistically significant correlation between smsc and forest cover proportions in fig 6 f with regard to conditions of large sfdcs at low elevations in southern georgia in c1 and in the east coast in c2 and small sfdcs at high elevations in c2 fig 7 a this finding could explain the considerable scatter we found for the sfdc smsc correlation p value 0 05 fig 7 f compared to the sfdc hgc relationship p value 0 05 fig 7 e the decrease in smsc due to elevation while it is associated with large sfdcs should not be taken as a general pattern there are other factors apart from the elevation that control the fdc shapes we conjecture the effect of the groundwater implicitly considered in soil moisture simulations of the sac sma model and the geology structure that are not investigated because of limited data availability nonetheless the landscape properties i e soil hydrologic properties forest cover interacting with the smsc pattern help in framing an explanation the smsc correlates with the forest cover mean elevation and soil hydrologic properties fig 6 f h at high elevations small smsc in conditions of small sfdcs the large infiltration rate allows for the rain water to move downward to the root zone in presence of forest cover the water might have been used by the forest i e transpiration and interception to allow for additional storage as et takes place bonell 1993 hence less water is stored in the soil leading to dry antecedent moisture conditions prior to the rain event it has been shown repeatedly particularly by isotope hydrology that pre event conditions mainly the antecedent moisture conditions affect the flow response mcdonnell 1990 sklash and farvolen 1979 in a study by burt and swank 1992 the forest cover explicitly reduced the flow response by affecting flow magnitudes and their respective frequency the fdcs were of lower value of the slope compared to those from other vegetation types the dry antecedent moisture conditions due to the effect of the forest cover mitigates the flow for all ranges of the precipitation events small and extremes this effect remains true for small to medium flows based on deterministic chronological pairing approach bathurst 2014 as well as for extreme flows based on stochastic frequency pairing approach birkinshaw et al 2011 fig 8 crooks and davies 2001 fig 6 reynard et al 2001 fig 5 therefore it appears that in the few fully forested catchments at high elevations the small sfdcs are related to the effect of the interaction between the forest cover and the large infiltration rate on the antecedent moisture conditions and consequently on the flows magnitude and frequency with regard to the condition of large sfdcs at low elevations most likely the low infiltration rates dominant hgc soils did not allow to damp the flow response despite the large smsc one should not forget the effect of below surface geology and its role to advance the understanding of the flow variability controls particularly in mountainous areas i e di matteo et al 2017 kelson and wells 1989 this dimension is again not covered in the present research because of lack of data our results from the empirical analysis partially agree with the hypothesis of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 that stems from a theoretical numerical study where it has been suggested that slope of the fdcs in shallow soils are steeper than those in deep soils it is true that most catchments in the present study region have large small sfdcs at high elevations in conditions of small large smsc however the exceptions we found make the generalization hampered by the soil hydrologic properties in addition to other factors related to the subsurface geology one may suggest that when smsc is large and the soil is poorly drained the flow variability could be high close to precipitation variability because of limited infiltration rates the fdcs can be of low values of the slope despite of the small smsc if the soil is well drained the effect of landscape properties on steepening the fdcs is maximized in c3 cluster if the poor drainage conditions and small smscs on steep topography are combined the several hypotheses that emerge from our empirical analyses require further testing using several degrees of landscape complexity when interacting with the climate 5 2 process based understanding of the spatial pattern of fdcs the process based analyses of the spatial pattern of sfdcs revealed that catchments with large sfdcs mainly in c3 cluster and in few catchments from c1 and c2 have a larger proportion of interflow and steep slope of the surface flow fdcs figs 9 a 10 a than catchments with small sfdcs the runoff flow components have different velocities usually surface flow is the fastest response followed by interflow and baseflow previous studies found that subsurface flow sum of interflow and baseflow can be as fast as surface flow e g sklash and farvolen 1979 these properties imply that high flow variability large sfdcs can be related to the predominance of fast flow components on the response also we found that more variable total flow corresponds with steeper slope of the baseflow fdcs as well as larger slopes of median baseflow fdcs see fig 10 this result suggests that baseflow characteristics vary with catchment conditions and although it is a slow response it also affects the overall flow variability this hints at the effect of groundwater associated with the geology of soils below surface i e di matteo et al 2017 the ti analyses showed that most catchments with large sfdcs had left skewed ti distributions with small values in their tails this fact leads to predominant subsurface flow processes in the runoff generation routine beven and kirkby 1979 illustrated by large interflow index hinting at limited groundwater effect the predominant landscape properties in catchments with large sfdcs limited smsc steep topography and poor drainage conditions and the properties of the surface and interflow responses indicate that the fdc shape illustrates the effect of limited runoff contributing area small tis in tails likely the hydraulic gradient is the major regulator of the response hewlett and hibbert 1967 another significant aspect deals with the effect of soil infiltration rates in the runoff processes a combination of hgb and hgc or fully hgc in catchments of large sfdcs the surface flow fdcs were of more regular shape than in catchments of small sfdcs all dip at 80 in fig 9 c versus 60 to 80 in fig 9 f the small infiltration rates in catchments with large sfdcs mostly located in hillslopes suggest that the infiltration excess overland flow is dominant in the process of surface flow generation beven and wood 1983 guebert and gardner 2001 found that on steep slope catchments the surface flow response becomes faster when it is dominated by the infiltration excess mechanism therefore the large sfdcs illustrate the culminated effect of the infiltration excess surface flow and the interflow the effect of this combination could be of major impact in c3 catchments due to larger proportions of hgc soils compared to the rest of catchments in c1 and c2 of the same large sfdc category with respect to the small sfdcs that represent most catchments in c1 and c2 the proportion of interflow from the total flow is low fig 10 b the surface flow fdcs at the upper tail as well as the median slope of the baseflow fdcs are flat see fig 10 b in these catchments the increase of tis in the tails make the ti distributions right skewed fig 11 b ti increases as contributing area increases and slope angle decreases see eq 1 hinting to a well developed riparian zone beven and wood 1983 usually the more developed this zone the deeper the soils allowing for more infiltration until saturation the runoff response under these conditions is dominated by saturation excess overland flow the excess water runs as surface runoff due to saturation excess overland flow beven and wood 1983 the aspect of runoff processes in most catchments from c1 and c2 and the landscape properties large smscs and high proportions of hgb soils suggest that the saturation excess dampens the flow response as a result of flat topography and large infiltration rates likely the increase of groundwater levels in catchments with small sfdcs at low elevations slows down the surface flow limits the interflow contribution and enhances the baseflow as pointed out in the previous section 5 1 the fdcs could be flat in conditions of small smsc and well drained soils the ti analyses classified these catchments highlighted by square shape in fig 11 a under a predominant subsurface runoff processes category likewise other catchments with prevalent saturation excess have small sfdcs in presence of poorly drained soils highlighted by oval shape in fig 11 a both findings support the idea about the influence of infiltration rate in affecting the runoff processes in the literature the infiltration rate is associated with soil depth topography and hydrologic characteristics weiler and mcdonnell 2007 and it is a chief regulator of the flow response guebert and gardner 2001 therefore in the catchments with small values of the smsc and the sfdc the impact of the predominant subsurface stormflow at hillslopes could have been lessened by the high infiltration rates that reduced the interflow contribution fig 12 f respectively under similar conditions guebert and gardner 2001 stated that on catchments at high elevation the landscape features in combination with high infiltration rate may produce a significant overland flow by saturation excess mechanism the saturation in hillslope catchments is controlled by both the topography and the permeability of soil layers graham et al 2010 more research is required to elucidate the relative role of saturation excess on the flow response when subsurface stormflow is dominant in hillslope catchments of well drained soils the results from parameter permutations between catchments at low elevations and of opposite soil hydrologic properties hgb versus hgc explained the case of large sfdcs at low elevations the lower infiltration rate steepened the total flow fdc because the interflow shifted upward and the baseflow diverged from base conditions fig 14 c this outcome is consistent with beven and germann 1982 who stated that fine soil texture limits groundwater influence also bonell 1993 reported that in forest environments the infiltration excess overland flow may occur in combination with saturation excess overland flow owing to properties of lower infiltration therefore a predominant saturation excess may lead to a less dampened response because of limited drainage conditions this is probably the most plausible physical explanation for the shapes of fdcs in the few catchments we question here with regard to the effect of the pdcs on the flow component fdcs as a response to the interaction with the catchment filter the subsurface flow fdcs were not sensitive to the precipitation behaviour but were rather directly affected by the catchment conditions only surface flow fdc tracked the pdc as suggested by yokoo and sivapalan 2011 however in typical catchments with small sfdcs the surface flow fdc and pdc were not parallel as in the theoretical study of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 but rather diverged at the upper tail 40 of the surface flow percentile figs 13 b and 14 b therefore for conditions of dampened flow catchment characteristics have a major role in filtering the precipitation even at the level of a fast response 6 conclusions the state of knowledge about fdcs lacked physical understanding about the controls underpinning their regional variation our study helped to advance our physical understanding by investigating the interaction of climate and landscape properties and the innate runoff processes responsible for the disparities in the shapes of fdcs using 73 catchments from the eastern us we highlighted strong regional differences within and across clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics the fdc shapes were attributed to the filter effect of landscape properties on precipitation this effect was pronounced so that regions with high precipitation variability had limited flow variability small sfdc on the other hand the regions with low precipitation variability had the highest flow variability large sfdc the flow response was dampened small sfdc in catchments at low elevations of well drained soils and large storage capacity these characteristics led to predominant saturation excess overland flow that allowed for more infiltration to lower layers enhanced baseflow and limited interflow the largest slope of the fdcs were associated with steep topography soils of small storage capacity and low infiltration rates this interaction led to dominant subsurface stormflow and surface flow generated by infiltration excess overland flow this paper also demonstrated that the effect of soil infiltration rate on fdc shapes was pronounced such that small large sfdcs at low high elevations is not always a general pattern at low elevation and large soil moisture storage capacity the catchments with predominant saturation excess experienced high flow variability large sfdcs because of poor drainage conditions also in shallow well drained soils at high elevations the prevalent subsurface stormflow led to limited flow variability and small sfdcs for all of the process based analyses the surface flow was the flow component most directly affected by the precipitation variability however this relationship became less important in catchments with small sfdcs this result suggests that both the subsurface flow components interflow and baseflow and the surface flow are highly affected by the dominant filter effect dictated by the landscape properties the limited availability of detailed descriptors of geology geomorphology and the groundwater levels covering a large region points out that we are also limited with respect to understanding subsurface controls see as example di matteo et al 2017 more limitations deal with the need to investigate in more detail the impact of the stream hydrological properties and the vegetation type i e species age density on the fdc shapes our results need to be complemented by an investigation of the effect of the catchments geomorphology and the vegetation type with regard to whether our analysis of the fdc controls have considered the non stationarity in streamflow response caused by either land use or climate variability i e milly et al 2008 our study catchments have limited anthropogenic activities therefore non stationarity in streamflow is due mainly to natural fluctuation caused by enso el niñosouthern oscillation sivapalan and samuel 2009 the fifty years of observed flow data would be subject to cyclical fluctuations of wet and dry years consequently our physical understanding of the fdc controls could potentially change depending on whether we investigated only flow records representative of dry or wet years one of the potential changes would deal with more visible differences in the shapes of the fdc that illustrates more explicitly the effect of groundwater levels we recommend to address the effect of enso on understanding the fdc controls in future studies also one should mention in addition to the enso effect that the fdc controls we quantify in this study may not hold in the future under non stationarity caused by future anthropogenic climate or land use change despite the limitations the physical understanding we gained is key for future works related to process based fdc predictions this research venue will further advance the understanding and can be used to solve issues of predictions in ungauged basins following our empirical approach more research is needed to study the regional change of flow variability in other regions within the us and elsewhere around the world to either corroborate or refute our hypothesized conclusions and address the limitations of our analysis we believe that our empirical study can be aided by numerical experiments such as yokoo and sivapalan

7387,this paper advances the physical understanding of the flow duration curve fdc regional variation it provides a process based analysis of the interaction between climate and landscape properties to explain disparities in fdc shapes we used i long term measured flow and precipitation data over 73 catchments from the eastern us ii we calibrated the sacramento model sac sma to simulate soil moisture and flow components fdcs the catchments classification based on storm characteristics pointed to the effect of catchments landscape properties on the precipitation variability and consequently on the fdc shapes the landscape properties effect was pronounce such that low value of the slope of fdc sfdc hinting at limited flow variability were present in regions of high precipitation variability whereas in regions with low precipitation variability the sfdcs were of larger values the topographic index distribution at the catchment scale indicated that saturation excess overland flow mitigated the flow variability under conditions of low elevations with large soil moisture storage capacity and high infiltration rates the sfdcs increased due to the predominant subsurface stormflow in catchments at high elevations with limited soil moisture storage capacity and low infiltration rates our analyses also highlighted the major role of soil infiltration rates on the fdc despite the impact of the predominant runoff generation mechanism and catchment elevation in conditions of slow infiltration rates in soils of large moisture storage capacity at low elevations and predominant saturation excess the sfdcs were of larger values on the other hand the sfdcs decreased in catchments of prevalent subsurface stormflow and poorly drained soils of small soil moisture storage capacity the analysis of the flow components fdcs demonstrated that the interflow contribution to the response was the higher in catchments with large value of slope of the fdc the surface flow fdc was the most affected by the precipitation as it tracked the precipitation duration curve pdc in catchments with low sfdcs this became less applicable as surface flow fdc diverged from pdc at the upper tail 40 of the flow percentile the interflow and baseflow fdcs illustrated most the filtering effect on the precipitation the process understanding we achieved in this study is key for flow simulation and assessment in addition to future works focusing on process based fdc predictions keywords flow duration curve regional variation catchment filter precipitation topographic index runoff processes 1 introduction one of the most fundamental problems facing the hydrological community over the last several decades has been the lack of comprehensive understanding about the relative contributions of climatic and watershed characteristics on streamflow and the shape of flow duration curves fdcs yokoo and sivapalan 2011 a flow duration curve fdc graphically illustrates the percentage of time duration that streamflow exceeds a given value over a historical period for a particular river basin e g vogel and fennessey 1994 if the streamflow is assumed to be a random variable the fdc may also be viewed as the complement of the cumulative distribution function of the flow cdf e g vogel and fennessey 1994 leboutillier and waylen 1993 the fdc representation is relevant in many hydrologic applications including reservoir and lake sedimentation studies stream flow assessments hydropower feasibility analysis water quality management waste load allocation and water resource allocation vogel and fennessey 1994 vogel and fennessey 1995 over the past several decades fdcs have been analyzed using a graphical representation ward and robinson 1990 or stochastic models in order to fit the appropriate statistical distribution to empirical fdcs cigizoglu and bayazit 2000 sugiyama et al 2003 castellarin 2004a iacobellis 2008 these studies helped the hydrologic community in issues related to the prediction of the fdc without explicitly advancing the physical understanding of the fdc controls most often the prediction studies at the ungauged catchments related the physiographic characteristics to the statistical moments of the fdc probability distributions leboutillier and waylen 1993 singh and mishra 2001 claps and fiorentino 1997 croker et al 2003 smakhtin and hughes 1997 fennessey and vogel 1990 castellarin et al 2004b this approach does not provide understanding of the fdc controls few researches dealing with the prediction at ungauged catchments provided implicit understanding of the fdc controls for instance musiake et al 1975 emphasized the prevalent effect of the geology structure on characterizing the baseflow after they classified the study catchments small to medium sized into physiographic classes and analyzed the baseflow data transfer between catchments of the same class sefton and howarth 1998 derived the parameters values of a rainfall runoff model from relationships with the morphometric and physiographic characteristics over 60 catchments in uk these relationships indicated through sensitivity analyses of the parameters the collective effect of the landscape characteristics soil land use slope and elevation on the fdc shapes the effect of the geology structure and the landscape characteristics remained indicative and required a detailed physical and quantitative analyses one of the rare studies that addressed thoroughly the effect of the vegetation types on the shape of the fdcs is burt and swank 1992 the study demonstrated that fertilized grass and the forest cover controlled similarly the discharge levels for all the frequency classes the existing literature can be used as base for our study towards a more comprehensive understanding of the fdc controls another category of studies analyzed the fdcs from the perspective of runoff processes using stochastic modeling botter et al 2007a muneepeerakul et al 2010a b botter et al 2009 the investigations contributed to advance the understanding of the fdc controls botter et al 2007a derived the slow flow component fdc baseflow through analysis of the soil moisture dynamics and the statistical properties of the precipitation subsequently botter et al 2009 included non linearity in the subsurface storage discharge relationship and muneepeerakul et al 2010a b extended the same model to include a fast flow component surface flow the ability of the model to reproduce observed fdcs has been tested in small to medium sized catchments in both the us and europe botter et al 2007b ceola et al 2010 botter 2010 however this stochastic dynamic model builds on assumptions about precipitation i e non random events in poisson rainfall arrival and could only be applied seasonally with constant parameter values for each season botter et al 2007a b therefore overcoming the limitations of the stochastic dynamic framework reviewed above would further help in revealing the climatic and landscape controls of the fdcs in the continental us a recent series of empirical studies analyzed the pattern of change of the fdcs in catchments from all the us cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 the study catchments had diverse climate and landscape properties at a first stage cheng et al 2012 analyzed the fdc shape from the correlation of their statistical moments when fitted to a gamma distribution with first order catchment characteristics i e baseflow index maximum daily precipitation and a fraction of non rainy days subsequently in a study by coopersmith et al 2012 the study catchments were classified into climate clusters based on climate signatures i e precipitation seasonality index seasonality index of the precipitation and day of peak precipitation the climate clusters helped yaeger et al 2012 to investigate the spatial pattern of fdcs using the process controls of the seasonal flow response in the us namely the aridity the snowmelt and the phenology these processes were determined by the combined modeling and empirical water balance study of ye et al 2012 however the large extent of the study area i e the entire continental us did not reveal sufficient detail about the climatic and landscape controls of fdcs the characteristics of climate seasonality aridity and phenology that influenced the average seasonal flow response in ye et al 2012 were not sufficient to explain the diversity of fdc shapes across the continental us yaeger et al 2012 a study by yokoo and sivapalan 2011 examined the shapes of fdcs under several theoretical combinations of landscape properties with climate this study developed a conceptual framework to predict fdcs using a runoff process based approach the framework considered the fdc as constructed from precipitation variability that cascades through the catchment system and gets exposed to landscapes in order to generate runoff under its respective process controls cheng et al 2012 this conceptual framework provided some understanding but it required further analyses and testing using observed data yokoo and sivapalan 2011 nonetheless it can also serve as guidance for investigations focusing on the study of fdc controls even with previous research regarding the factors that control the shapes of the fdcs we remain far from understanding the physical mechanisms behind the regional variation of fdc the need for a process based understanding motivated the research goals of this study therefore here we propose to analyze the regional variation of fdcs in the eastern us to advance our current physical understanding about fdc controls the eastern us has considerable variability in landscape i e mountains and plains and climate in particular the mountainous appalachian region has historically been prone to flooding caused by late winter and early spring rains as well as snowmelt summer cloudbursts and remnants of tropical systems perry and combs 1998 perry et al 2001 hicks et al 2005 the following questions guided our research 1 if the regional variation of fdcs is controlled by the interaction of climate and landscape properties then to what extent is the diversity in the shapes of fdcs explained by each of the controls and 2 in response to their effect what is the aspect of the runoff processes that govern the regional variation of fdcs we developed a number of methods to answer our research questions in this paper we used rainfall runoff data from 73 catchments across the eastern us and through a combination of data analysis and conceptual rainfall runoff modeling we analyzed the diversity in precipitation and in storms of the study catchments then we developed a framework to characterize differences and similarities in landscape properties to measure their interaction with precipitation to affect the fdc we elucidated the effect of fdc controls on the flow components and runoff processes and we investigated the distributions of topographic indexes at the catchment level our overall goal was to providea detailed analysis of the climate and landscape properties in the region of interest and to advance the process understanding of the physical relationships between the shapes of fdcs and the effect of climate and landscape properties 2 dataset and study area 2 1 dataset the catchments used in this study are part of the database developed for the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 schaake et al 2006 the database contains historical hydro meteorological data and land surface characteristics for many hydrological basins in the us and in other countries duan et al 2006 mopex research has been driven by a series of international workshops that brought together interested hydrologists and modellers to exchange knowledge and experience in developing and applying model parameter estimation techniques with its focus on parameter estimation mopex plays a major role in the context of international initiatives such as prediction in ungauged basins pub hrachowitz et al 2013 we extracted all the data of catchments located within the study area from the mopex database we chose the mopex because it has relatively long record length 50 years on average and it has been used repeatedly in several researches in the u s koren et al 2003 cheng et al 2012 coopersmith et al 2012 ye et al 2012 berghuijs et al 2014 2016 the database is freely available and was retrieved from the following website www nws noaa gov oh mopex mo datasets htm air temperature potential evapotranspiration pet and streamflow are all available with a daily time step precipitation data is representative of the catchment average and is available at both daily and hourly time steps in this study we use the hourly and daily precipitation as well as the daily flow and daily pet the record length ranges from 1948 to 2000 the mopex catchments are considered to be associated with a natural flow regime with limited human influence schaake et al 2006 2 2 study area characteristics we studied the spatial pattern of fdcs using 73 mopex catchments from the eastern us the mean annual precipitation map in the study catchments varies between 702 mm and 2072 mm see appendix table 1 the catchments have a humid climate the aridity index the ratio of the map by the potential evapotranspiration is rather low according to coopersmith et al 2012 see appendix table 1 where the catchments are sorted according to their site code the catchment size ranged from 67 km2 to 8052 km2 as shown in fig 1 a and table 1 appendix around 20 of the catchments have sizes above 4000 km2 the catchments are mainly forested with some proportions of agricultural lands and limited influence of urban areas see appendix table 1 the catchments runoff ratio that is the annual runoff by the annual precipitation ratio has a minimum of 0 33 a maximum of 0 64 and a median of 0 44 see appendix table 1 perennial snow cover is absent for most catchments and does not exceed 3 of the surface area for individual catchments berghuijs et al 2014 the precipitation in the eastern us is of low seasonality fig 1 b coopersmith et al 2012 sawicz et al 2011 the mean monthly precipitation has limited fluctuation through seasons whereas storm characteristics in particular storm intensity have systematic seasonal variation hershfield 1961 orographic thunderstorms are common in the appalachian mountains and produce large rainfall accumulations that may exceed 600 mm for 6 h storms erskine 1951 eisenlohr 1952 miller 1990 smith et al 1996 at the headwater scale orographic thunderstorms lead to large floods that may exceed the 500 year return period such as the event of november 1985 in central appalachian see miller 1990 the appalachian mountains create a contrast in elevations as shown by the digital elevation model dem in fig 2 catchments with low relief are mainly located in the eastern coast and in the state of georgia while the interior catchments have higher relief the maximum elevation across the region is 2029 m above sea level m a s l and the minimum is 93 m a s l fig 2 this area of low elevation refers to a wetland in florida that lies below sea level in this study we do not describe the detailed geomorphology and geology descriptors i e impermeable areas spring horizon intermittent streams covering such a large region because of limited availability the variation in soil texture and structure across the study region affects the soil hydrologic properties and so the flow response wood et al 1984 fig 2 illustrates the spatial pattern of the main hydrologic groups hgb soil with medium infiltration rate and hgc soil with slow infiltration rate wood et al 1984 note that there is a gradual decrease of hgb soils from the southern to northern regions in mid latitudes the soil is a combination of hgb and hgc while in northeast it becomes predominantly hgc 3 methods our analysis of the regional variation of fdcs covered two main dimensions i the study of fdc shapes in the context of landscape properties acting as a filter for precipitation at the catchment scale and ii detailed analyses of the spatial pattern of the fdcs using flow components and runoff generation mechanisms prior to the fdc analyses we grouped the study catchments into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics in order to control for climate and isolate the effect of landscape properties on the regional variation of fdcs we diagnosed the seasonality of storm characteristics in each catchment this has been achieved by storm separation of hourly precipitation see section 3 1 below we analyzed the slope of the fdcs sfdcs and their regional variation i e the slope of the fdc is surrogate of the flow variability sawicz et al 2011 see section 3 4 of this manuscript for more details on how the slope of the fdc is calculated and defined we defined categories of flow variability across study catchments based on the average value of sfdcs then we investigated the differences in fdcs from the interaction of catchment filter with precipitation variability we assessed the effect of catchment filter from the spatial pattern of fdcs and the precipitation duration curves pdcs using as guidance the conceptual framework of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the slopes of the precipitation duration curve pdc are considered a surrogate of precipitation variability the catchment filter effect on the precipitation collectively represent the impact of the landscape properties i e soil hydrologic properties surface topography and vegetation type and the geology structure the limited availability of detailed descriptors of the vegetation i e age density species and the geology suggests we focus in combination to the storm characteristics on the impact of the landscape properties and the soil moisture storage capacity smsc we calibrated the sac sma model to predict the daily soil moisture and estimate the smsc at the catchment scale the sac sma model has been applied worldwide and particularly in the different hydro climate regimes of the united states koren et al 2003 it allows for more detailed flow simulations by separating flow into runoff components namely the direct runoff surface runoff interflow and baseflow van werkhoven et al 2008 burnash 1995 we utilised the flow components provided by sac sma simulations to meet the second dimension of our research goal we also determined the predominant runoff generation mechanisms after we investigated the topographic index ti distribution at the catchment scale these process based investigations explained the physical reasons for the regional variation of the fdcs at this level we reassessed the effect of the catchment filter on precipitation pdc to determine the flow component fdc that is directly affected by the precipitation variability fig 3 summarizes the several steps of our study 3 1 storm separation we obtained hourly rainfall data from the mopex database that is available for each study catchment we separated the hourly rainfall into storm and inter storm periods using an automated objective algorithm the separation criterion is a specified minimum dry period between consecutive events equal to 6 h erskine 1951 eisenlohr 1952 miller 1990 smith et al 1996 which is similar to what other researchers have adopted hershfield 1961 and huff 1967 used 6 h koutsoyiannis and foufoula georgiou 1993 used 7 h robinson and sivapalan 1997 used 7 h in a study area belonging to the appalachian region the pulse events of intensity equal or lower than 0 01 mm hour are considered as part of a no event period the storm separation generated a time series of storm intensity storm duration and storm depth subsequently we looked at the mean monthly change of the storm depth storm intensity and the storm duration we had to analyze the behaviour of the change more closely in order to classify the catchments into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics from this perspective using climate indices and a synoptic based approach i e verdon kidd and kiem 2009 would not help us to get detailed knowledge of the storm characteristics our approach serves the goal of our study i e understanding the controls of the fdc shapes at regional scale 3 2 simulation of soil moisture calibration of sac sma under the mopex project default sac sma parameters a priori parameters have been estimated for each catchment in the dataset to facilitate model calibration koren et al 2003 after calibration we used the sac sma model output to estimate daily soil moisture and the flow component fdc the basic design of the model centers on a two layer soil structure a relatively thin upper layer and usually a much thicker lower layer that supplies moisture to meet the evapotranspiration demands koren et al 2003 each layer consists of tension and free water storages the a priori sac sma model parameters available in mopex were estimated using soil information from a statsgo soil texture map koren et al 2003 eleven parameters from a total of thirteen were estimated using soil physical relationships soil water content θs field capacity θfld and wilting point θwlt in 11 soil layers koren et al 2003 the other two parameters do not have a physical meaning adimp and pctim deal with the fraction of impervious areas in a catchment the default ranges by sac sma were initially used for these two parameters thus the model simulations of flows and soil moisture account for the role of the impervious areas we calibrated the sac sma model parameters using the shuffle complex algorithm sce ua with 10 000 iterations sorooshian et al 1993 this algorithm is extensively used for sac sma calibration to achieve different research goals such as studying model parameter transferability e g gan and burges 2006 and building a large database for the continental us e g newman et al 2015 similar to gan and burges 2006 and koren et al 2003 we constrained the calibration to the a priori value of each parameter to keep physical consistency and reduce equifinality we set 35 as the range of deviations allowed from the default parameters this range is larger than the range used in koren et al 2003 i e 25 we set this interval to allow for more variability around the default parameters and in the parameters space that is used by the sce ua algorithm to find the global optimum the model was calibrated for the period 1948 1963 the objective function minimized rmse root mean square error between daily observed and simulated flows the model calibration performance was evaluated by nash sutcliffe coefficient ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 the catchments with the highest ns were tested for validation and considered in the analyses using a sample of 100 catchments for calibration those with ns lower than 0 50 were disregarded from the study the eliminated catchments should have a minimal effect on our outcomes i e environmental controls of the fdcs the same ns based criterion was used by berghuijs et al 2014 for analysis of regional water balance in the continental us in this study the catchment sample decreased from 100 to 73 and the efficiency of daily simulated flows ranged from 0 50 and 0 92 the average ns value was 0 72 at lower efficiency mainly peaks of winter december and early spring february were underestimated overall the model performance was satisfactory in this study sac sma simulation helped in predicting the time series of daily flow components and daily soil moisture 3 3 soil moisture storage capacity smsc the soil moisture storage capacity smsc is a surrogate of root zone depth as described in gao et al 2014 it is a reservoir that acts as a dynamic buffer that moderates flows and retains tension water for plant use fenicia et al 2008 zhao and liu 1995 therefore smsc was calculated using daily soil moisture sm estimates from the sac sma model every year each catchment has a maximum and minimum value of sm the difference between the two figures is equivalent to the reservoir of catchment water storage capacity gao et al 2014 the median storage capacity for each catchment was determined and taken as representative 3 4 slope of the empirical fdc the slope of the fdc sfdc is a surrogate of the flow variability in time sawicz et al 2011 it is calculated between the 33rd and 66th flow quantile since at semi log scale this represents a relatively linear part of the fdc yadav et al 2007 zhang et al 2008 the entire daily record of the 50 year on average length was used to construct the empirical fdcs and to calculate their slopes a high slope value indicates a variable flow regime while a small value means a more damped flow response sawicz et al 2011 the sfdc is defined as 1 sfdc ln q 33 ln q 66 0 66 0 33 where sfdc is the slope of the flow duration curve q33 is the streamflow value at the 33rd percentile and q66 is its value at the 66th percentile we normalized the empirical fdcs by the mean annual daily flows as in yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and yaeger et al 2012 before we calculated the slopes of the curves 3 5 precipitation duration curve and catchment filter the pdc is constructed in the same way as the fdc but instead of daily flows we used daily precipitation smakhtin and masse 2000 the entire daily record of 50 years on average was used to construct the empirical pdcs and calculate their slopes spdc we normalized the pdcs by their respective mean daily precipitation before we calculated the slopes unlike fdc the slope of the pdc usually dips at a smaller percentile than the total 100 because precipitation may be null for many days in a year smakhtin and masse 2000 then the most linear part of the spdc calculation will not be equal to that used for sfdc instead it will depend on the precipitation records the linear portion of pdc across the study catchments ranged between 10 and 30 according to the conceptual framework of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the precipitation is filtered by the catchment system to generate daily flows of a given variability here we assumed that the catchment filter can be assessed using the ratio of sfdc to spdc higher values of this ratio correspond to sfdc values that are closer to spdc this also corresponds to weaker catchment filters leading to high flow variability 3 6 topographic index distribution for each catchment analyses of the topographic index ti are helpful to explore the predominant runoff generation ti represents the propensity of a point within a catchment to generate saturation excess overland flow beven and kirkby 1979 due to a topographic control on surface and subsurface flows rice and hornberger 1998 ti was first defined by beven and kirkby 1979 as follows 1 ti ln a tan β where ti is the topographic index of a point pixel within a watershed α is the specific upslope area per unit contour length β is the local topographic slope angle acting at the point in this study ti was calculated at the pixel level using a dem of 30 m resolution and algorithms necessary for the determination of specific upslope area a and the local slope angle β rousseau et al 2005 hentati et al 2010 the ti calculation uses the properties of the stream network namely the flow directions and the flow accumulation which both help to identify the riparian zone see hentati et al 2010 finer details about the stream network dynamics and the stream connectivity are difficult to get for each watershed therefore the effects of intermittent streams and whether they affect the predominant runoff generation mechanism and the flow response are not considered in our calculations of the topographic index and goes beyond the scope of our study the frequency of ti distribution was then determined for each catchment after classification of ti pixel values the differences in the ti frequency distribution at the catchment scale illustrates the wide differences in topographic properties between study catchments and consequently the effect of topography on the flow response according to beven and kirkby 1979 and beven and wood 1983 large values of ti in tails of the distribution indicate the likelihood of runoff being generated by saturation excess overland flow whereas smaller values in the tails hint to predominant subsurface processes in the runoff generation the flow response depends also on the soil infiltration properties and permeability price 2011 ameli et al 2015 therefore our analyses of the runoff generation mechanism using ti serve to reveal the predominant mechanism that takes place as a response to topography while we acknowledge the effect of other factors i e permeability on the flow response we use the spatial pattern of the soil hydrologic properties as indicative of the soil infiltration rates and permeability wood et al 1984 the combination between the soil hydrologic properties and the ti analyses helped in understanding the effect of the runoff generation mechanisms on the regional flow response and the shapes of fdc 4 results 4 1 effects of landscape properties on filtering the precipitation and inducing regional variation of the fdcs 4 1 1 climate clusters the fig 4 a illustrates the catchments classified into three clusters according to monthly changes of average daily storm intensity storm duration and storm depth the storm intensity had the most systematic regional variation across the eastern us compared to the rest of storm metrics therefore it was the criterion that helped to classify the study catchments into three clusters or geographically defined regions of homogeneous storm characteristics the c3 cluster fig 4 b had a peak storm intensity in summer july in c2 the storm intensity had no seasonality fig 4 c however in c1 fig 4 d we observed two peaks a first one in summer and a second in late winter meanwhile the storm depth seasonality was similar in c2 and c1 clusters declining dramatically during the summer and increasing during the fall and winter in the c3 cluster northeast the storm depth was marginally higher in the summer compared to the fall and winter seasons the duration did not exhibit a seasonal pattern and its variation is correlated to storm intensity fluctuations smaller storm intensities corresponded to larger durations and vice versa the storms in c3 and c2 clusters had the longest duration 24 h while in c1 the duration did not go beyond 18 h 4 1 2 precipitation variability from slopes of precipitation duration curves on average the pdc curves dip at 70 of time exceedance in the c1 and c2 clusters and at 80 for the c3 cluster in the northeastern us fig 5 b d and c respectively these high precipitation percentiles are illustrative of the humid climate in the eastern us three catchments in the c3 cluster dip at 50 they are highlighted by a rectangle in fig 4 a these catchments have a larger number of days with zero precipitation than the rest of the catchments in the same cluster the map for each of these three catchments is in the same range of the average value in the c3 cluster 1100 mm the cumulative distribution function cdfs of spdcs in each catchment for each cluster are shown in fig 5 a the clusters of c1 and c2 have the steepest pdcs high variability of precipitation in c3 the precipitation is less variable because of flatter pdcs fig 5 a 4 1 3 soil moisture storage capacity the smsc soil moisture storage capacity was classified into two groups based on the average of 73 catchments in fig 6 a the figure shows that lowland areas i e in north carolina georgia and some catchments in virginia and pennsylvania have above average smscs compared to highland areas i e high elevations of appalachian mountains where smscs are below average the c1 georgia and c2 clusters are regions where most of the catchments have high smsc compared to catchments in c3 fig 6 b overall smsc increases along north south and west east directions the forest cover was the lowest in proportions in c2 and c3 fig 6 c the smscs were the smallest in the c3 because of catchments with highest mean elevations fig 6 d and poor drained soils highest rates of hgc soils fig 6 e the smsc was significantly negatively correlated p values 0 05 to forest cover catchment mean elevation and hgc soils fig 6 f h consequently smsc is affected by the interaction between forest cover topography and soil hydrologic properties in c2 the smsc increased as the infiltration rates increased lower hgc fig 6 e and the mean elevation decreased fig 6 a in c1 the smsc was the largest with low mean elevations fig 6 d and well drained soils lower hgc fig 6 e the catchments at high elevation happened to be the most forested fig 6 c the smsc decreased at the most forested catchments fig 6 f 4 1 4 the regional variation of the fdc categories of flow variability the fdc slopes were grouped into two categories sfdcs below and above average fig 7 a shows the non spatial correlation of sfdcs with climate clusters which demonstrates the dominant effect of catchments landscape properties in the regional variation of fdcs the sfdc decreases from northern to southern regions the sfdc is correlated with catchment latitude via a statistically significant relationship r2 0 076 r 0 27 p value 0 05 we do not show the figure of the regression for conciseness the sfdc also decreases in a west east direction fig 7 a which explains the low r2 of the sfdc latitude relationship fig 7 b c and d illustrate the fdc of each catchment classified into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics the steepest fdcs highest sfdc values are mostly located in the c3 cluster and in some catchments from c1 and c2 fig 7 e most catchments in c1 and c2 had small sfdcs in fig 7 f and 7 g the change in the flow variability sfdc is related to the change in soil moisture storage capacity smsc and soil hydrologic properties hgc p value 0 05 we notice that there is high variability of the sfdc in the 200 300 mm range of the smsc the smsc explains only 4 5 r2 0 045 of the total variability of the sfdc thus in the 200 300 mm range of the smsc the fdc may have low or large value of the slopes this hints at other factors that caused this variability also there is high variability around hgc 0 20 and a small decrease of the sfdc for hgc beyond the 70 we admit that in addition to the soil infiltration rates indicated by proportions of the hgc and properties of the smsc the structure of the subsurface geology and the deep groundwater would have contributed to this variability the spatial pattern of sfdc shows that in the northeastern us c3 most catchments have high flow variability large sfdcs and small smscs at high elevations where hgc soils are predominant fig 2 b the few catchments in c1 south east and c2 center with large sfdcs had small smscs and soils with medium to slow infiltration rates half hgc and half hgb they are mainly located in kentucky and the interior parts of virginia fig 7 a two main particularities in the spatial pattern of the fdcs are worth mentioning first there were few catchments in c2 where small smsc was associated with limited flow variability small sfdc these catchments highlighted by a rectangle in fig 7 a have predominant hgb soils fig 2 second few catchments in north carolina and south georgia highlighted by oval shape in fig 7 a had large flow variability high sfdc in soils with large smsc and slow infiltration rates hgc and hgd fig 3 4 1 5 effect of catchment filter on precipitation and flow duration curves after we analyzed the spatial pattern of the sfdc that changes proportionally to patterns of the landscape properties mean elevation hgc forest cover and the smsc we explore the pattern of the catchment filter the catchment filter helps to implicitly measure the effect of the catchment system in filtering the precipitation and in generating flow characterized by some level of variability a value of the sfdc according to the way it is calculated ratio of the sfdc by the spdc it points collectively to the effect of all the factors that contribute to filter the precipitation i e landscape properties deep groundwater and the geology structure in fig 8 a the filter effect increased from the northern to southern regions the weakest filters were found in the c3 cluster where the sfdc to spdc ratio was above average fig 8 a and b the filters in most catchments from c1 and c2 had below average ratios fig 8 b the cdfs representing the catchment filters in c1 and c2 illustrate the extent to which they have similar landscape characteristics fig 8 b the spatial pattern of the catchment filters in fig 8 a reflects that of fdc in fig 7 a hence the fdc shapes are a mirror of the catchment filter effect on the pdc the characteristics of the catchment filters are related to the soil hydrologic properties and soil moisture storage capacity fig 8 c and d the effect of the catchment filters on precipitation became more pronounced as hgc rates decreased and smsc increased p value 0 05 4 2 process understanding of the fdc regional variation 4 2 1 aspect of flow component fdcs fig 9 displays the fdcs of each flow component with regard to sfdc categories high sfdc versus low sfdc in fig 7 a the slopes of the baseflow fdcs are of larger values in fig 9 a for sites with high sfdcs than those in fig 9 b for sites with low sfdcs we calculated the slope of the median baseflow fdc in each category it was larger in the category of large sfdcs slope 3 55 than that of small sfdcs slope 2 42 fig 9 a and b this suggests that the total flow variability is partly caused by the baseflow variability interflow has a more pronounced contribution to total flow in catchments with large sfdcs compared to those with flat small sfdcs in fact it dips between 20 and 70 of the flow percentile for high sfdc category whereas this happens between 30 and 55 for low sfdc category fig 9 b and e respectively the normalized median curves confirm these differences fig 10 a it dips at 47 and at 35 in 10 b the surface flow fdcs in the upper tail and until 40 of the distribution are flatter for catchments with small flow variability small sfdcs in fig 9 b compared to those with high flow variability large sfdc catchments category in fig 9 a this flow lasts longer and has less irregularities at the lower tail for catchments exhibiting large sfdcs it dips between 85 and 95 when sfdc is large and between 60 and 80 in when sfdc is small the normalized surface flow fdcs in both categories were consistent with the differences in the upper tail where surface flow fdc is more regular in the large sfdc category whereas it showed an inflexion at 40 in the small sfdc category fig 10 a and b respectively consequently high flow variability stems from a highly variable baseflow a predominant interflow and a highly variable surface flow however in catchments where the response is dampened small sfdcs the baseflow and surface flow are less variable and interflow contributes less to the total flow variability 4 2 2 predominant runoff generation mechanism across the eastern us from fig 11 the ti distributions separated into three distinct groups according to differences in the runoff generation mechanisms across the study catchments fig 11 a three main categories were distinguished the left skewd the middle and the right skewed in fig 11 b the catchments in the right skewed ti distribution have large ti values in their tails which suggests predominant saturation excess overland flow curve with dashed lines they spread over the coastal plain and piedmont regions fig 11 a however catchments from the left skewed ti distribution have smaller values in their tails which illustrates the prevalent effect of subsurface stromflow over the saturation excess overland flow fig 11 b these are mountainous catchments from the appalachians fig 11 a with regard to the middle ti distribution it is hard to distinguish a prevalent mechanism both mechanisms could be important in their effect on the flow response the differences of flow component indices and their fdcs across ti categories explained the pattern of the runoff mechanisms the baseflow indices were consistent fig 12 a and d however according to the cdfs of the surface flow index this latter is higher in catchments with dominant satuartion excess overland flow right skewed and to some exent the middle ti clusters fig 12 d the subsurface flow and interflow indices are larger in catchments with predominant subsurface runoff processes left skewed ti cluster cdfs in fig 12 c and f respectively fig 12 compares the fdc flow components using typical catchments in each ti category the interflow was dominant as a result of prevalent subsurface runoff processes that is it dips at 50 and 35 of the distribution in left skewed and middle ti category in fig 13 a and c respectively the interflow effect on the response becomes of lesser importance whenever the saturation excess is dominant i e interflow dips at 30 of the distribution in fig 13 b 4 2 3 fdc regional variation in relation to the pattern of runoff generation mechanisms from fig 11 the catchments with predominant subsurface processes have large sfdcs fig 7 a and limited soil moisture storage capacity smsc fig 6 a in catchments with large smsc fig 6 a the prevalent saturation excess overland flow decreases the sfdcs fig 7 a it is worth mentioning that in some catchments highlighted by an oval shape in fig 11 a with predominant saturation excess and large smsc fig 6 a the sfdcs are of large values fig 7 a also few catchments with predominant subsurface processes and limited smsc highlighted by square shape in fig 11 a exhibited low flow variability small sfdcs fig 7 a this seems to conflict with the general pattern of the relationship between fdc shapes and predominant runoff generation mechanism other factors interacted with the topography i e soil structure the soils in catchments highlighted by an oval shape is a combination of hgc and hgb proportions fig 2 moreover the soils in catchments highlighted by a square shape are well drained hgb in fig 2 these combinations are pointing out to the following whenever saturation excess is predominant the limited water infiltration could make the flow response less dampened also under predominant subsurface processes the high infiltration rate mitigates the flow response in order to better understand the effect of the infiltration rate on the runoff processes and the fdc shape we used the parameter permutations between two catchments of different soil properties hgc versus hgb and located in the piedmont region highlighted with ovale shape in fig 8 a a detailed description of the catchments main characteristics is provided in table 1 appendix the saturation excess is predominant in both catchments the calibrated parameters of the catchment with poor drainage conditions fig 14 a are used to simulate flows for the catchment with predominant hgb fig 14 b the total flow fdc diverge in catchment number 02349500 from the base conditions fig 14 c the interflow shifted upward while baseflow diverged from base conditions the surface flow curve kept the same shape after parameter permutation hence the change in the fdc shapes of interflow and baseflow steepened the total flow fdc 4 2 4 flow components of the fdc with regards to precipitation process understanding of the catchment filter effect the effect of the catchment filter on precipitation precipitation duration curve pdc could be demonstrated through the aspect of subsurface and surface processes from figs 13 and 14 the surface flow is most sensitive to pdc the pdc and the surface flow fdc dip at the same percentile contrary to the subsurface flow components interflow and baseflow they seem to be less dependent on precipitation and rather more dependent on subsurface processes such as the groundwater and the deep percolation properties of the soils note that the surface flow fdc is almost parallel to the pdc in catchments with predominant subsurface processes and poorly drained soils fig 13 a and c however according to fig 13 b and 14 b the surface flow fdc deviates from the pdc at the upper tail in catchments with small sfdcs under conditions of predominant saturation excess and well drained soils hgb hence the catchment filter although it seems to directly affect subsurface processes appears to affect surface flow response in catchments with limited flow variability 5 discussion the goal of this paper was to elucidate the spatial pattern of fdcs over the eastern us and to evaluate the interaction between climate and landscape properties with respect to runoff processes in order to provide a comprehensive physical understanding of the regional variation of fdcs we analyzed rainfall runoff data from 73 mopex catchments these catchments were classified into clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics in order to control for climate and better inspect the effect of landscape properties the storm intensity revealed the most distinct systematic seasonal variation across catchments and was used as a criterion for the classification the use of other climatic variables e g precipitation and temperature for climate classification in past studies from the us were less relevant to delineate zones of similar climate e g fovell and fovell 1993 our cluster delineation using storms was consistent with hershfield 1961 where in the northeastern us c3 cluster the storm intensity has a peak in the summer in the center it is evenly distributed through seasons c2 cluster and in the southeast state of georgia in c1 cluster it shows two peaks during the summer and spring seasons the climate classification by coopersmith et al 2012 in the us split our study area into two clusters based on a combination of climate indices e g aridity precipitation seasonality peak of precipitation day and the average runoff most likely the storm characteristics help to elucidate more details about climate homogeneity which is critically needed for the study of interaction between climate and landscape properties 5 1 to what extent the diversity of fdc shapes can be explained by climate and landscape properties we found that in the cluster of low precipitation variability flat pdc in the northeastern us c3 cluster fig 5 a the flows had high variability large sfdcs fig 7 e also in clusters of high precipitation variability steep pdc in the central regions c2 cluster fig 5 a and in southeastern us c1 cluster in georgia the flows had low variability small sfdcs fig 7 e this finding underlines the effect of the catchments filter when interacting with the precipitation in the process of flow generation as a result of the effect of the catchment filter the overall pattern was a decrease in the value of slope of fdcs from northern to southern regions and from west to east directions statistical significant correlation of the sfdc with the latitude p value 0 05 in this study mainly we reveal the effect of the interaction between the soil moisture storage capacity smsc the soil drainage conditions and the topography in characterizing the catchment filter figs 6 and 8 whose spatial pattern fig 8 a mirrored the regional variation of the fdc fig 7 a in past fdc regionalization studies some of these landscape properties mean elevation soil types and land cover have been used as explanatory variables to regionalize fdc without being explicitly analyzed in terms of their effect on the flow variability for example arora et al 2005 used the mean elevation to distinguish between regions of different fdcs sefton and howarth 1998 deployed a combination of landscape characteristics e g topography soil types climate and land cover for fdc regionalization most of the large small sfdcs are located at high low elevation fig 7 a however there are few catchments in c1 and c2 clusters despite they are at high low elevation they have small large sfdcs highlighted by square and an oval shape in fig 7 a respectively in the following we discuss first the reasons for large small sfdcs at high low elevation we found that most of the catchments in c1 and c2 acted as a strong precipitation filter fig 8 b due to large smsc figs 6 b and 8 c and large soil infiltration rates figs 6 e and 8 d whereas the catchment filter in c3 was weaker fig 8 b because of small smsc at high elevation figs 6 b and 8 c and poorly drained soils figs 6 e and 8 d a study by swift et al 1988 demonstrated that the decreasing soil depth in steep topography resulted in less opportunity to store soil moisture before a rain also swift et al 1988 study suggested that at higher elevation there is a limited evapotranspiration demand in our study region we found that the potential evapotranspiration pet decreased with elevation which supports the idea of decreased et at high elevation and its effect on enhancing the flow variability the figure of the pet spatial pattern was not shown for conciseness in conditions of catchments at high elevation butt et al 2001 stated that the steep topography indicates the hydraulic gradient of shallow soils these physical explanations that combine the decrease of the soil moisture storage capacity with the decrease of et and the increase of the hydraulic gradient under conditions of steep topography corroborate our findings and help to understand the controls of large values of the sfdcs at high elevations in catchments of the c3 cluster and a few in c1 and c2 clusters our results also underscored the effect of the soil properties on shapes of the fdcs the increase in the hgc proportions steepened the slope of the fdcs fig 7 g according to price 2011 the influence of soil characteristics on water storage can be understood by the tight correlations between soil properties and topography the soil properties play a significant role in the rate of soil moisture loss due to surface or subsurface topographic gradients dodd and lauenroth 1997 yeakley et al 1998 therefore large values of slope of the fdcs at high elevations in c3 and in a few catchments from c1 and c2 could be related to the interaction of shallow soils with poor drainage conditions this effect is maximized in c3 where the sfdcs were the largest fig 7 e and close to the precipitation variability slope of pdc fig 8 a in contrast to conditions of large sfdcs the mitigated flow response small sfdcs in most catchments from c1 and c2 could be explained by the interaction of flat topography with soils of high infiltration rates hgb the increased water storage capacity large smsc dampened the flow variability despite the large precipitation variability we should mention that in our study the effect of the vegetation cover on the flow variability was overall not as explicit as the effect of topography and soil drainage conditions in fact the contrast in types of the vegetation cover between the study catchments is not as pronounced as it is for topography and soil hydrologic properties the vegetation cover is consistent and decreases in few catchments in piedmonts and the southeastern us see fig 8 in berghuijs et al 2014 therefore the vegetation cover effect was rather implicit to that of soil moisture storage capacity statistically significant correlation between smsc and forest cover proportions in fig 6 f with regard to conditions of large sfdcs at low elevations in southern georgia in c1 and in the east coast in c2 and small sfdcs at high elevations in c2 fig 7 a this finding could explain the considerable scatter we found for the sfdc smsc correlation p value 0 05 fig 7 f compared to the sfdc hgc relationship p value 0 05 fig 7 e the decrease in smsc due to elevation while it is associated with large sfdcs should not be taken as a general pattern there are other factors apart from the elevation that control the fdc shapes we conjecture the effect of the groundwater implicitly considered in soil moisture simulations of the sac sma model and the geology structure that are not investigated because of limited data availability nonetheless the landscape properties i e soil hydrologic properties forest cover interacting with the smsc pattern help in framing an explanation the smsc correlates with the forest cover mean elevation and soil hydrologic properties fig 6 f h at high elevations small smsc in conditions of small sfdcs the large infiltration rate allows for the rain water to move downward to the root zone in presence of forest cover the water might have been used by the forest i e transpiration and interception to allow for additional storage as et takes place bonell 1993 hence less water is stored in the soil leading to dry antecedent moisture conditions prior to the rain event it has been shown repeatedly particularly by isotope hydrology that pre event conditions mainly the antecedent moisture conditions affect the flow response mcdonnell 1990 sklash and farvolen 1979 in a study by burt and swank 1992 the forest cover explicitly reduced the flow response by affecting flow magnitudes and their respective frequency the fdcs were of lower value of the slope compared to those from other vegetation types the dry antecedent moisture conditions due to the effect of the forest cover mitigates the flow for all ranges of the precipitation events small and extremes this effect remains true for small to medium flows based on deterministic chronological pairing approach bathurst 2014 as well as for extreme flows based on stochastic frequency pairing approach birkinshaw et al 2011 fig 8 crooks and davies 2001 fig 6 reynard et al 2001 fig 5 therefore it appears that in the few fully forested catchments at high elevations the small sfdcs are related to the effect of the interaction between the forest cover and the large infiltration rate on the antecedent moisture conditions and consequently on the flows magnitude and frequency with regard to the condition of large sfdcs at low elevations most likely the low infiltration rates dominant hgc soils did not allow to damp the flow response despite the large smsc one should not forget the effect of below surface geology and its role to advance the understanding of the flow variability controls particularly in mountainous areas i e di matteo et al 2017 kelson and wells 1989 this dimension is again not covered in the present research because of lack of data our results from the empirical analysis partially agree with the hypothesis of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 that stems from a theoretical numerical study where it has been suggested that slope of the fdcs in shallow soils are steeper than those in deep soils it is true that most catchments in the present study region have large small sfdcs at high elevations in conditions of small large smsc however the exceptions we found make the generalization hampered by the soil hydrologic properties in addition to other factors related to the subsurface geology one may suggest that when smsc is large and the soil is poorly drained the flow variability could be high close to precipitation variability because of limited infiltration rates the fdcs can be of low values of the slope despite of the small smsc if the soil is well drained the effect of landscape properties on steepening the fdcs is maximized in c3 cluster if the poor drainage conditions and small smscs on steep topography are combined the several hypotheses that emerge from our empirical analyses require further testing using several degrees of landscape complexity when interacting with the climate 5 2 process based understanding of the spatial pattern of fdcs the process based analyses of the spatial pattern of sfdcs revealed that catchments with large sfdcs mainly in c3 cluster and in few catchments from c1 and c2 have a larger proportion of interflow and steep slope of the surface flow fdcs figs 9 a 10 a than catchments with small sfdcs the runoff flow components have different velocities usually surface flow is the fastest response followed by interflow and baseflow previous studies found that subsurface flow sum of interflow and baseflow can be as fast as surface flow e g sklash and farvolen 1979 these properties imply that high flow variability large sfdcs can be related to the predominance of fast flow components on the response also we found that more variable total flow corresponds with steeper slope of the baseflow fdcs as well as larger slopes of median baseflow fdcs see fig 10 this result suggests that baseflow characteristics vary with catchment conditions and although it is a slow response it also affects the overall flow variability this hints at the effect of groundwater associated with the geology of soils below surface i e di matteo et al 2017 the ti analyses showed that most catchments with large sfdcs had left skewed ti distributions with small values in their tails this fact leads to predominant subsurface flow processes in the runoff generation routine beven and kirkby 1979 illustrated by large interflow index hinting at limited groundwater effect the predominant landscape properties in catchments with large sfdcs limited smsc steep topography and poor drainage conditions and the properties of the surface and interflow responses indicate that the fdc shape illustrates the effect of limited runoff contributing area small tis in tails likely the hydraulic gradient is the major regulator of the response hewlett and hibbert 1967 another significant aspect deals with the effect of soil infiltration rates in the runoff processes a combination of hgb and hgc or fully hgc in catchments of large sfdcs the surface flow fdcs were of more regular shape than in catchments of small sfdcs all dip at 80 in fig 9 c versus 60 to 80 in fig 9 f the small infiltration rates in catchments with large sfdcs mostly located in hillslopes suggest that the infiltration excess overland flow is dominant in the process of surface flow generation beven and wood 1983 guebert and gardner 2001 found that on steep slope catchments the surface flow response becomes faster when it is dominated by the infiltration excess mechanism therefore the large sfdcs illustrate the culminated effect of the infiltration excess surface flow and the interflow the effect of this combination could be of major impact in c3 catchments due to larger proportions of hgc soils compared to the rest of catchments in c1 and c2 of the same large sfdc category with respect to the small sfdcs that represent most catchments in c1 and c2 the proportion of interflow from the total flow is low fig 10 b the surface flow fdcs at the upper tail as well as the median slope of the baseflow fdcs are flat see fig 10 b in these catchments the increase of tis in the tails make the ti distributions right skewed fig 11 b ti increases as contributing area increases and slope angle decreases see eq 1 hinting to a well developed riparian zone beven and wood 1983 usually the more developed this zone the deeper the soils allowing for more infiltration until saturation the runoff response under these conditions is dominated by saturation excess overland flow the excess water runs as surface runoff due to saturation excess overland flow beven and wood 1983 the aspect of runoff processes in most catchments from c1 and c2 and the landscape properties large smscs and high proportions of hgb soils suggest that the saturation excess dampens the flow response as a result of flat topography and large infiltration rates likely the increase of groundwater levels in catchments with small sfdcs at low elevations slows down the surface flow limits the interflow contribution and enhances the baseflow as pointed out in the previous section 5 1 the fdcs could be flat in conditions of small smsc and well drained soils the ti analyses classified these catchments highlighted by square shape in fig 11 a under a predominant subsurface runoff processes category likewise other catchments with prevalent saturation excess have small sfdcs in presence of poorly drained soils highlighted by oval shape in fig 11 a both findings support the idea about the influence of infiltration rate in affecting the runoff processes in the literature the infiltration rate is associated with soil depth topography and hydrologic characteristics weiler and mcdonnell 2007 and it is a chief regulator of the flow response guebert and gardner 2001 therefore in the catchments with small values of the smsc and the sfdc the impact of the predominant subsurface stormflow at hillslopes could have been lessened by the high infiltration rates that reduced the interflow contribution fig 12 f respectively under similar conditions guebert and gardner 2001 stated that on catchments at high elevation the landscape features in combination with high infiltration rate may produce a significant overland flow by saturation excess mechanism the saturation in hillslope catchments is controlled by both the topography and the permeability of soil layers graham et al 2010 more research is required to elucidate the relative role of saturation excess on the flow response when subsurface stormflow is dominant in hillslope catchments of well drained soils the results from parameter permutations between catchments at low elevations and of opposite soil hydrologic properties hgb versus hgc explained the case of large sfdcs at low elevations the lower infiltration rate steepened the total flow fdc because the interflow shifted upward and the baseflow diverged from base conditions fig 14 c this outcome is consistent with beven and germann 1982 who stated that fine soil texture limits groundwater influence also bonell 1993 reported that in forest environments the infiltration excess overland flow may occur in combination with saturation excess overland flow owing to properties of lower infiltration therefore a predominant saturation excess may lead to a less dampened response because of limited drainage conditions this is probably the most plausible physical explanation for the shapes of fdcs in the few catchments we question here with regard to the effect of the pdcs on the flow component fdcs as a response to the interaction with the catchment filter the subsurface flow fdcs were not sensitive to the precipitation behaviour but were rather directly affected by the catchment conditions only surface flow fdc tracked the pdc as suggested by yokoo and sivapalan 2011 however in typical catchments with small sfdcs the surface flow fdc and pdc were not parallel as in the theoretical study of yokoo and sivapalan 2011 but rather diverged at the upper tail 40 of the surface flow percentile figs 13 b and 14 b therefore for conditions of dampened flow catchment characteristics have a major role in filtering the precipitation even at the level of a fast response 6 conclusions the state of knowledge about fdcs lacked physical understanding about the controls underpinning their regional variation our study helped to advance our physical understanding by investigating the interaction of climate and landscape properties and the innate runoff processes responsible for the disparities in the shapes of fdcs using 73 catchments from the eastern us we highlighted strong regional differences within and across clusters of homogeneous storm characteristics the fdc shapes were attributed to the filter effect of landscape properties on precipitation this effect was pronounced so that regions with high precipitation variability had limited flow variability small sfdc on the other hand the regions with low precipitation variability had the highest flow variability large sfdc the flow response was dampened small sfdc in catchments at low elevations of well drained soils and large storage capacity these characteristics led to predominant saturation excess overland flow that allowed for more infiltration to lower layers enhanced baseflow and limited interflow the largest slope of the fdcs were associated with steep topography soils of small storage capacity and low infiltration rates this interaction led to dominant subsurface stormflow and surface flow generated by infiltration excess overland flow this paper also demonstrated that the effect of soil infiltration rate on fdc shapes was pronounced such that small large sfdcs at low high elevations is not always a general pattern at low elevation and large soil moisture storage capacity the catchments with predominant saturation excess experienced high flow variability large sfdcs because of poor drainage conditions also in shallow well drained soils at high elevations the prevalent subsurface stormflow led to limited flow variability and small sfdcs for all of the process based analyses the surface flow was the flow component most directly affected by the precipitation variability however this relationship became less important in catchments with small sfdcs this result suggests that both the subsurface flow components interflow and baseflow and the surface flow are highly affected by the dominant filter effect dictated by the landscape properties the limited availability of detailed descriptors of geology geomorphology and the groundwater levels covering a large region points out that we are also limited with respect to understanding subsurface controls see as example di matteo et al 2017 more limitations deal with the need to investigate in more detail the impact of the stream hydrological properties and the vegetation type i e species age density on the fdc shapes our results need to be complemented by an investigation of the effect of the catchments geomorphology and the vegetation type with regard to whether our analysis of the fdc controls have considered the non stationarity in streamflow response caused by either land use or climate variability i e milly et al 2008 our study catchments have limited anthropogenic activities therefore non stationarity in streamflow is due mainly to natural fluctuation caused by enso el niñosouthern oscillation sivapalan and samuel 2009 the fifty years of observed flow data would be subject to cyclical fluctuations of wet and dry years consequently our physical understanding of the fdc controls could potentially change depending on whether we investigated only flow records representative of dry or wet years one of the potential changes would deal with more visible differences in the shapes of the fdc that illustrates more explicitly the effect of groundwater levels we recommend to address the effect of enso on understanding the fdc controls in future studies also one should mention in addition to the enso effect that the fdc controls we quantify in this study may not hold in the future under non stationarity caused by future anthropogenic climate or land use change despite the limitations the physical understanding we gained is key for future works related to process based fdc predictions this research venue will further advance the understanding and can be used to solve issues of predictions in ungauged basins following our empirical approach more research is needed to study the regional change of flow variability in other regions within the us and elsewhere around the world to either corroborate or refute our hypothesized conclusions and address the limitations of our analysis we believe that our empirical study can be aided by numerical experiments such as yokoo and sivapalan

7388,multi objective hydrological model calibration can represent a valuable solution to reduce model equifinality and parameter uncertainty the soil and water assessment tool swat model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments however the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins this work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches the first two procedures are single objective calibration procedures for which all parameters of the swat model were calibrated according to river discharge alone procedures i and ii differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters the first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin the third procedure is a multi objective calibration in which we considered snow water equivalent swe information at two different spatial scales i e subbasin and elevation band in addition to discharge measurements we tested these approaches in the upper adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available only the set of parameters obtained with this multi objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and swe these findings offer the large community of swat users a strategy to improve swat modeling in alpine catchments keywords swat model adige snow water equivalent alpine catchment multi objective calibration 1 introduction multi objective calibration of hydrological models has proven useful in producing reliable predictions of several hydrological components and reducing model equifinality and uncertainty bekele and nicklow 2007 hanzer et al 2016 lu et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 snow observations represent an optimal dataset to calibrate hydrological models in conjunction with streamflow since they are available in many alpine catchments in terms of snow depth values and often have higher spatial resolution than river discharge gauging stations moreover snow dynamics play a key role in determining the seasonal characteristics of river discharge which further affects other hydrology related processes like erosion hydropower operation water supply as well as flood prevention cunderlik and ouarda 2009 pradhanang et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 zampieri et al 2013 therefore in order to conduct a comprehensive and reliable hydrological investigation in alpine catchments it is not only important to focus on river discharge but it is also necessary to accurately describe the snow processes endrizzi et al 2006 grusson et al 2015 hanzer et al 2016 troin and caya 2014 warscher et al 2013 hence a multi objective calibration approach considering both discharge and snow measurements can be a feasible and useful method to improve the application of hydrological models like the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 in alpine catchments swat is one of the most comprehensive and applied hydrological models abbaspour et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 golmohammadi et al 2017 liu et al 2016 malagò et al 2016 shen et al 2012 tuo et al 2016 as outlined in the present work swat adopts a specific approach to describe snow processes the same snow water equivalent swe value is assigned to all hydrological response units hru in a subbasin and this value is derived from the weighted sum of the swe computed for each elevation band in a subbasin therefore output time series of swe are available at two spatial scales for the entire subbasin the average subbasin swe and for each elevation band to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have taken these two snow outputs into account to evaluate the performance of the swat snow module fu et al 2014 2015 grusson et al 2015 pradhanang et al 2011 and no study has included the snow information of subbasin and elevation band scales into model calibration processes previous studies mostly assigned a unique set of snow parameters to an entire basin e g fu et al 2014 2015 rahman et al 2013 without considering the heterogeneous morphology encountered in large 1000 km2 catchments egli 2011 egli and jonas 2009 moreover multi objective model calibration has been attempted in swat considering water quality soil moisture evapotranspiration or glacier information along with streamflow abbaspour et al 2007 bekele and nicklow 2007 cao et al 2006 lu et al 2014 maringanti et al 2011 omani et al 2017 pfannerstill et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 white and chaubey 2005 but snow data which are very important information in snow dominated catchments to represent snow dynamics have rarely been used due to the typical lack of swe time series in snow dominated catchments swat model parameters are generally estimated using discharge records alone e g levesque et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 wang and melesse 2005 since river discharge is the combination of the contributions of different hydrological components calibration based on discharge alone can easily lead to the problem of model equifinality beven 2006 hanzer et al 2016 in this work for the first time in the framework of multi objective swat model calibration we take advantage of a simple empirical regression equation which has recently been proposed to convert snow depth data into snow water equivalent pistocchi 2016 the conversion equation is useful since swe is the typical variable modeled in hydrological models while snow depth is the most common information about the snowpack daily swe data of both subbasin and elevation band scales are computed based on snow depth measurements and further applied in the multi objective calibration procedure we compare then three approaches to calibrate swat model parameters in alpine catchments two are classical single objective calibration procedures while the third one is a novel multi objective calibration the novelties in the latter approach include the use of swe data derived from snow depth measurements and the use of these swe information at two spatial scales subbasin and elevation band to calibrate the model along with discharge the possibility of modeling both discharge dynamics and changes in swe allows us to verify whether it is possible to improve model performance in alpine catchments considering multiple datasets for calibration the specific objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the effect of using the same or different snow model parameters for different subbasins on model performance considering a single objective discharge based calibration procedure 2 propose a multi objective calibration procedure involving both discharge and two spatial scales of snow output for swat modeling in snow dominated alpine catchments 3 assess the model performances of single objective and multi objective procedures in the upper adige catchment an important alpine basin in northeast italy 4 compare the behavior of major hydrological components between the single objective and multi objective procedures 2 material and method 2 1 study area the upper adige river basin closed at bronzolo 6875 km2 is a typical alpine catchment located in the northeastern italian alps fig 1 it has a large elevation range 223 m a s l 3865 m a s l and is characterized by steep slopes and sharp hydro climatic gradients callegari et al 2015 from late october to april snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation in this area and the snow cover duration is elevation dependent marcolini et al 2017b as a consequence snowmelt water is the dominant contributor to streamflow in the spring mei et al 2014 2016 penna et al 2014 land uses of the river basin are mainly forest 55 8 grassland and pasture 21 3 and barren land 11 5 the main soil types are loamy sand 45 5 silty clay 21 5 and sand 17 3 with 13 major hydropower plants present in the catchment several subbasins are affected by hydropeaking fig 1 further information about the catchment is provided in the recent review of chiogna et al 2016 2 2 computation of snow water equivalent values based on data availability for the period 2005 2010 we selected 44 snow measurement stations recording daily snow depth values in the upper adige river basin fig 1 and table s1 in the supplementary material these snow data represent a subset of the data used by adler et al 2015 and marcolini et al 2017b to analyze climatic changes occurring in this region the available time series have been quality checked and their homogeneity has been tested using the standard normal homogeneity test marcolini et al 2017a in order to make use of these snow data for swat model calibration two types of swe data were computed starting with the available snow depth observations the mean subbasin scale swe sub swe and the swe of each station a detailed description of the calculations is given in appendix a here we illustrate the main steps of the procedure qualitatively the subbasin scale swe values were calculated from the mean snow depth data hs computed for each of the 20 subbasins fig 1 as follows first daily hs measurements were interpolated using a simple power law model to establish a correlation between hs and elevation the interpolated values were then used to compute a mean subbasin snow depth and finally these values were converted into swe data using the equation suggested by pistocchi 2016 for the temporal evolution of snow density the swe values for each snow station were computed by multiplying the snow depth observations by the temporal evolution of snow density according to the equation suggested by pistocchi 2016 the computed sub swe and the swe of each station were then used to calibrate and validate the swat model the sub swe time series were compared to the subbasin swe output of swat while the swe values for each snow station were compared qualitatively to the corresponding elevation band swat output 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model description the swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is a comprehensive time continuous semi distributed process based model arnold et al 2012a 1998 it can be used to model the water cycle erosion vegetation growth and water quality in large river basins and to assess the effects of climate change and water resources management abbaspour et al 2015 dile et al 2016 yang et al 2016 swat divides river basins into subbasins composed of hrus which are characterized by different combinations of land use soil characteristics and topography the hydrological cycle is calculated based on water balance which is highly affected by climate input such as daily precipitation and maximum minimum air temperature using daily input time series swat simulates the daily monthly and yearly fluxes of water and solutes in river basins the water yield is routed through the streams and reservoirs along the river network even though swat was originally developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in large complex catchments its application in mountainous river basins is not rare ahl et al 2008 debele et al 2010 grusson et al 2015 rostamian et al 2008 troin and caya 2014 it has for example been used to support regional water management practices such as flood control yang et al 2014 hydropower management malagò et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 and assessment of climate change adaptation schemes pradhanang et al 2011 swat uses the elevation band method to consider the orographic effects on precipitation and temperature in mountainous areas up to ten elevation bands can be defined in each subbasin this method has been applied in several snow dominated alpine catchments and proven useful and essential grusson et al 2015 malagò et al 2015 morán tejeda et al 2014 pradhanang et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 in this work six elevation bands were applied 2 3 2 snow package the snow module of swat is based on the temperature index approach hock 2003 neitsch et al 2011 walter et al 2005 and it is able to simulate changes in swe for several user defined elevation bands although more complex snow modules have been tested in previous studies no significant improvement has been observed debele et al 2010 meng et al 2015 swat provides snow output in the form of snowmelt and swe with identical units of precipitation pradhanang et al 2011 a detailed description and equations of the snow packages are available in the swat user s manual neitsch et al 2011 among the snow parameters table 1 smfmx should be larger than smfmn in our study area because smfmx is the maximum melt factor in the northern hemisphere and the minimum melt factor in the southern hemisphere which is explained in the swat i o files arnold et al 2012b in swat the user can choose to assign either a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin or define a different set of snow parameters for each subbasin for the latter case the source code has to be modified the files readsub f and readsno f contain an inappropriate constraint negative and zero values of sftmp and smtmp are not allowed at the subbasin scale this is contradictory to the swat official documentation arnold et al 2012b which defines the physical range for sftmp and smtmp between 5 and 5 e g grusson et al 2015 swat output files provide swe values for each elevation band in the output snw file in the following we refer to this swe output as eb swe elevation band snow water equivalent each elevation band covers an area with a range of elevations and the swe depends on snow depth which is elevation dependent therefore the eb swe output cannot be calibrated to fit exactly with the data available for a single monitoring station still a qualitative comparison is feasible snow outputs snowmelt and swe are stored in the output hru file at the hru scale swat assigns the elevation weighted swe value of the subbasin to all hrus within a subbasin therefore the same swe is assigned to each hru this swe output of swat represents an average swe value for the entire subbasin detailed information is provided in the supplementary material this subbasin specific value can be used for model calibration by comparing it to the subbasin swe that is computed using eq a5 this swe output in output hru is hereafter referred to as sub swe snowmelt values are not ideal for model calibration because their measurements are rarely available 2 4 model setup arcswat 2012 version 664 with an interface in arcgis was used to set up the model for the upper adige river basin with 20 subbasins fig 1 the datasets used in the model are listed in table 2 based on the availability of snow data and discharge records the model considered the time frame from 2005 to 2010 all snow stations are located at a relatively low elevation below 2000 m a s l due to the lack of high elevation stations we cannot observe the effect described by grünewald et al 2014 in which snow depth increases with elevation up to a certain altitude where it displays a distinct peak followed by a decrease at the highest elevations in most subbasins snow depth measurements are available for stations located at similar elevations table s1 eight gauging stations fig 1 provide effective discharge records for the investigated time frame among them five stations record the natural streamflow of four headwater subbasins 1 2 7 8 and 11 two subbasins 3 and 4 are affected by the upstream subbasins and one subbasin 20 records the total streamflow behavior at the end of the entire basin in this work the simulations were performed at the daily scale 2 5 model calibration and evaluation in order to mitigate the effects of the initial conditions a time frame of 516 days 01 01 2005 05 31 2006 was used as a warm up period calibration began on 06 01 2006 and lasted until 05 31 2008 while validation was performed during the time period 06 01 2008 05 31 2010 the parameters to be calibrated table 1 were selected according to the one at a time sensitivity analysis in swat cup abbaspour 2015 three calibration procedures were applied i all the parameters reported in table 1 were calibrated according to discharge records using an automatic calibration procedure and basin scale snow parameters were estimated to assign the same set of values to the entire basin ii all parameters were calibrated automatically to reproduce the discharge measurements as in procedure i unlike procedure i snow parameters were calibrated at the subbasin scale to consider the spatial variability of the snow processes an additional manual calibration was required when automatic calibration led to unrealistic parameter sets such a step was necessary when smfmx values that were estimated using automatic calibration were lower than smfmn values which is not correct for the northern hemisphere where the study area is located iii subbasin scale snow parameters and the other parameters were calibrated manually so that the sub swe output eq s1 in the supplementary material fit the subbasin average swe as defined in eq a5 and the streamflow simulation fit the discharge records meanwhile a qualitative comparison between eb swe and the swe values computed for each monitoring station eq a3 was also taken into account for parameter modification starting with the initial ranges of parameters reported in table 1 the automatic calibration was performed with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 2007 in swat cup abbaspour 2015 to narrow down and target the effective range of each parameter sufi 2 is based on a semi automated inverse modeling procedure with the implementation of a combined calibration uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2015 the initial parameter ranges were defined following the swat documentation arnold et al 2012b and studies of neighboring alpine catchments grusson et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 for each iteration 1000 simulations were run after each iteration the ranges of the parameters were modified and generally narrowed down according to both the suggested values of the program abbaspour et al 2004 2007 and their initial limitations the goodness of fit between the modeled and the observed discharge was computed for each gauged subbasin during both the calibration and validation periods the goodness of fit between sub swe and the subbasin average swe defined in eq a5 for each subbasin was calculated during both periods furthermore the simulated eb swe was qualitatively compared to the data of each station belonging to a specific elevation band the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 the coefficient of determination r2 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used as goodness of fit indicators for the best simulation

first is a headwater catchment not affected by hydropeaking and the second integrates the processes occurring in the entire river basin and it is not heavily affected by hydropeaking graphic results are displayed for calibration procedures ii and iii in order to focus on the comparison between the single objective and multi objective calibration strategies model performances for all three calibration procedures and all subbasins are provided in tables 3 1 model performance using calibration procedure i as shown in table 3 calibration procedure i resulted in at least satisfactory model performances nse 0 5 in simulating river discharge during the calibration period during validation the discharge of all gauged subbasins except for subbasins 7 and 11 were also well reproduced with nse 0 5 comparing simulated and observed river discharge for all gauging stations and for the entire simulation period fig 2 a a close fit was observed with an r2 value of 0 92 underestimation of streamflow occurred for river discharge values larger than 250 m3 s the mean absolute value of pbias for streamflow was 8 42 considering the entire period table 3 despite the good performance in reproducing river discharge the agreement between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe was unsatisfactory nse 0 5 for most subbasins 70 of the subbasins during the calibration period and 50 during the validation period in addition the absolute values of pbias for sub swe were higher than 50 for 65 of the subbasins during calibration and for 50 of the subbasins during validation considering the entire period and all subbasins poor agreement was shown between the sub swe and the swe computed according to eq a5 fig 2d thus the parameters of procedure i calibrated according to discharge were able to reproduce river discharge but failed to capture the behavior of swe at the subbasin scale 3 2 model performance using calibration procedure ii calibration procedure ii differs from calibration procedure i in that it defines subbasin specific snow parameters the calibrated parameters of procedure ii showed performances as good as procedurei in simulating river discharge during both calibration and validation periods table 4 this procedure also obtained unsatisfactory performances during validation for subbasins 7 and 11 still the r2 value between model simulation and all available streamflow observations fig 2b was equal to 0 91 in this case the model underestimated streamflow with values larger than 300 m3 s considering the entire period the mean absolute value of pbias was 7 75 for streamflow simulations with respect to the subbasin swe unsatisfactory results nse 0 5 were obtained for 70 of the subbasins during calibration and 50 of the subbasins during validation the absolute value of pbias higher than 50 occurred for 65 of the subbasins during calibration and 50 of the subbasins during validation as shown in fig 2e poor agreement was also observed between all the sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe generally no improvements were observed in simulating the subbasin averaged swe even though different sets of snow parameters were assigned to each subbasin to consider local differences in snow dynamics also in this case the model calibrated according to discharge was only able to reproduce streamflow dynamics adequately figs 3 and 4 show the detailed model performances of subbasins 2 and 20 respectively we focused on river discharge subbasin scale swe and elevation band scale swe compared to monitoring station values the daily discharge behavior obtained using the calibrated parameters of procedure ii was well captured at subbasin 2 fig 3a most of the peaks were closely reproduced while base flow was slightly underestimated in contrast the subbasin averaged swe values were overestimated fig 3c with on average 59 longer snow seasons this result indicates that a much larger amount of snow accumulation was simulated at subbasin 2 in comparison to the subbasin averaged swe reference a larger amount of snow accumulated in the subbasin could lead to a large amount of snowmelt water contributing to the discharge during the melting season the eb swe of lower elevation areas bands 1 and 2 well matched the swe values computed converting measured hs values using eq a3 of the three available snow stations in subbasin 2 fig 3e and g as previously mentioned eb swe is a representative value for a range of elevations whereas the station observation can only represent one point among these elevations the swe time series of the snow stations at subbasin 2 were considered to be well reproduced by the model for the higher elevation areas band 3 6 of subbasin 2 no snow stations were available the simulated eb swe values are displayed in fig 3i the highest elevation area band 6 in particular displayed a much larger swe amount and longer snow cover duration than the other elevation bands in fact the sub swe is the weighted mean of the eb swe of all the elevation bands eq s1 therefore the overestimation of sub swe observed in subbasin 2 fig 3c could be explained by the overestimation of swe at elevation bands 3 through 6 fig 3i considering subbasin 20 the simulated discharge reproduced the general behavior of the observations well fig 4a daily fluctuations stemming from hydropeaking were not captured since the reservoir module was not used in the model due to the lack of information about reservoir management fig 4c displays the subbasin swe of subbasin 20 the snow covered periods were well captured the simulation underestimated the subbasin scale swe during the calibration period during validation simulated sub swe fit quite well with the swe of the 2008 2009 snow season but overestimated the maximum swe values for the snow season 2009 2010 regarding the eb swe simulations they matched with the swe of the monitoring station moelten during the first three snow seasons 2006 2009 but they were much higher than the station swe values for the snow season 2009 2010 3 3 model performance using calibration procedure iii a third calibration procedure was developed to meet both good performances in subbasin swe and river discharge simulations as well as suitable matches between eb swe and swe values obtained converting the hs observations of the corresponding snow stations this procedure was able to reproduce both subbasin swe and river discharge properly table 5 the simulated river discharge values fit well with the observations as shown by the at least satisfactory model performances nse 0 5 for all the gauged subbasins during both the calibration and validation periods table 5 procedure iii appeared to lead to a more accurate set of model parameters than procedures i and ii since subbasins 7 and 11 also displayed satisfactory results during the validation period such a conclusion however should be supported by a systematic comparison to be performed in a larger set of alpine river basins in addition the scatterplot displayed in fig 2c shows good agreement between observed and simulated values r2 0 89 underestimation of river discharge was observed for values larger than 300 m3 s fig 2c the mean absolute value of pbias for streamflow simulations was 4 63 the agreement between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe was at least satisfactory nse 0 5 for all 20 subbasins during both the calibration and validation periods table 5 good model performance 0 65 nse 0 75 was achieved for 75 of the subbasins during calibration and 75 of the subbasins reached very good model performance 0 75 nse 1 00 during validation in addition absolute pbias values were smaller than 50 during the entire simulation period for 95 of swe considering the entire period and all subbasins close agreement was reached between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe with an r2 of 0 85 fig 2f the multi objective based calibration procedure was able to capture the behavior of both river discharge and averaged swe of each subbasin well the model performance of procedure iii for subbasins 2 and 20 is also displayed in figs 3 and 4 respectively for subbasin 2 the multi objective calibrated parameters led to a good fit between simulated and observed discharge values fig 3b most peaks and base flow were well estimated the simulated sub swe fit quite well with the subbasin average swe capturing the length of the snow seasons and providing a satisfactory estimate of the swe amount fig 3d eb swe simulation results for bands 1 and 2 fig 3f and h were similar to those obtained in procedure ii a noticeable difference between model results obtained using procedure ii and procedure iii was observed for elevation bands from 3 to 6 using calibration procedure iii snow cover duration fig 3j did not increase as much as when using calibration procedure ii leading to an improved agreement between sub swe and subbasin average swe for subbasin 20 the simulated discharge fit well with the observations fig 4b except for the fluctuations during the winter season caused by hydropeaking although the subbasin mean swe values displayed a large variability between calibration and validation periods the model calibrated using procedure iii closely followed the observations fig 4d the simulated snow seasons matched well the values computed using eq a5 fig 4f shows a close match between simulated eb swe and the swe of the snow station converted using eq a3 calibration procedure iii allows us to reproduce swe and streamflow appropriately both in low snow accumulation years and in high snow accumulation years 3 4 validation of swat model results against snow depth observations a final validation step was implemented to compare the hs observations of the 40 snow gauges within the basin fig 1 to the model results obtained using calibration procedure ii and iii the swe time series of the model output were converted into hs values using eqs a3 and a4 to simplify the comparison we classified the observations and the corresponding model results into six classes according to 300 m elevation intervals i e class 1 stations from 300 m a s l to 600 m a s l class 2 from 600 m a s l to 900 m a s l and so on we then computed the mean snow depth between november 1st and april 30th for the entire simulation period hs for each elevation class as shown in fig 5 observed hs values presented a positive correlation with the elevations which can be reproduced with a power law as given in eq a1 the model results of procedure iii captured very well the mean behavior of the observations of the elevation areas for classes 2 through 5 where 82 5 of the snow stations were located table s1 while slight deviations were observed for classes 1 and 6 results of procedure ii captured well the mean behavior of the observations for classes 3 and 4 corresponding to 57 5 of the snow stations table s1 it is particularly relevant to observe that calibration procedure ii performed poorly for class 5 1500 m a s l 1800 m a s l this is the most sensitive elevation for snow variability in the adige catchment as evidenced by marcolini et al 2017b therefore procedure iii performed better in reproducing the observed snow dynamics than procedure ii as shown in table 6 evident differences were observed between the multi objective and single objective calibration procedures in reproducing snow pack characteristics such as snow cover duration scd snow peak value spv and snow peak day spd the two single objective procedures i and ii led to similar errors for all three snow characteristics during both the calibration and validation periods their values were higher than those obtained by the multi objective approach iii among them mape values of scd and spv obtained by procedure i and ii were three and two times higher respectively than the corresponding values obtained using procedure iii the mape values of spd were close among the results of the three procedures and procedure iii still led to the smallest values generally procedure iii performed better in reproducing the snow pack characteristics than procedures i and ii the absolute percentage error of scd spv and spd for each subbasin are provided in the supplementary material table s2 s4 for all calibration procedures 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different snow parameterizations on discharge based single objective calibration tables 3 4 and fig 2 show that the set of parameters obtained using calibration procedures i and ii both led to equally good performances in simulating the river discharge but failed to reproduce the subbasin average swe in most subbasins the definition of subbasin specific snow parameters in procedure ii led to a higher r2 fig 2d and e and smaller mape of scd and spv table 6 than procedure i however the improvements were minor therefore we can conclude that assigning subbasin specific snow parameters does not significantly improve the model performance of snow simulations when calibrating all model parameters according to river discharge records considering a single objective calibration procedure the defined set of subbasin specific snow parameters could still not fit the specific snow conditions of each subbasin moreover river discharge in subbasins 3 6 9 10 12 14 15 and 17 was highly affected by hydropeaking which cannot be reproduced by our hydrological model due to the lack of input data using discharge based single objective calibration the identified optimal set of snow parameters was also influenced by this source of uncertainty thus the model calibrated according to discharge only could not properly capture the snow observations in the upper adige catchment therefore the swat model calibrated using a single objective approach was not able to reproduce both snow and discharge dynamics independently of the scale at which snow parameters were defined 4 2 importance of applying a multi objective calibration procedure in alpine catchments calibration procedures i and ii displayed quite similar model performances we will now focus only on procedure ii in comparison to procedure iii since they both define subbasin specific snow parameters the multi objective calibration approach offered using procedure iii resulted in much better model performances than the single objective procedure especially in reproducing snow dynamics as shown in tables 3 5 the calibrated parameters of procedure iii led to acceptable simulations for streamflow in all gauged subbasins during the entire period in contrast procedure ii could not reproduce the discharge of subbasins 7 and 11 during validation more importantly the use of procedure iii allowed us to simulate the subbasin swe of each subbasin properly with at least satisfactory performance while the use of a single objective procedure failed to reproduce swe adequately in most subbasins moreover including snow data during calibration allowed us to reproduce important properties better such as snow cover duration in the catchment and peak snow accumulation table 6 considering the overall performance of the models both calibration procedures were able to reproduce the discharge records with similar r2 fig 2b and c the underestimation of high streamflow discharge values could be ascribed to the impact of river damming without data to implement the reservoir module all these models were not able to simulate the high discharge and hydropeaking effects properly the comparisons of model performances in subbasins 2 and 20 further illustrated the positive effect of using a multi objective calibration approach as shown in section 3 subbasin 2 represented a headwater subbasin with natural flow and subbasin 20 represented the outlet of the river basin in addition subbasin 2 was a snow dominated alpine subbasin with high elevation areas and subbasin 20 was dominated by low elevation areas 800 m based on the hydrographs procedures ii and iii presented an equally good ability in simulating the discharge time series for both subbasins fig 3a and b and fig 4a and b however swe simulations were quite different between the two procedures at both the high elevation and the low elevation subbasins this can lead to distinct interpretations about the hydrological modeling behaviors caused by different calibration approaches in subbasin 2 fig 3 procedures ii and iii performed equally well in qualitatively matching the swe of snow stations converted using eq a3 but different subbasin average swe were obtained procedure ii led to a large overestimation of the subbasin swe and much longer snow seasons due to the overestimation of swe for high elevations fig 3i procedure iii led to a close fit between sub swe and subbasin averaged swe references although the amounts of subbasin swe were very different between calibration and validation periods the values of swe during validation were almost twice as high as the calibration values as a consequence the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow was very different in the model that was calibrated using the single objective calibration procedure compared to the multi objective procedure this was shown by comparing the snowmelt results of the two procedures fig 6 a and fig 7 the cumulated snowmelt simulated by calibration procedure ii reached 2333 mm which was almost twice as much as the amount simulated by procedure iii during the entire period fig 7 the simulated and observed cumulative discharge in the case of procedure iii fit closely fig 7 despite the larger snowmelt contribution to streamflow the results of procedure ii still underestimated the cumulative behaviors of discharge records fig 7a these results show that although the simulated discharge values may look reasonable they can be inaccurate in terms of the relative contribution of runoff components in other words the multi objective calibration approach reduced model equifinality beven 2006 hanzer et al 2016 considering subbasin 20 fig 4 there was no significant difference between the simulated sub swe of procedure ii and procedureiii although improvements were observed during the calibration period of procedureiii the predicted snowmelt was similar between the two procedures as observed in fig 6b in this low elevation subbasin however the contribution of snowmelt was not as relevant as for subbasin 2 in general the snow and elevation band parameters obtained using procedure iii allowed us to reproduce snow dynamics at both subbasin and elevation band spatial scales better than those of procedure ii since snow data were considered during model calibration moreover a multi objective model calibration allowed us to obtain a more robust estimate of snow parameters than a single objective calibration in subbasins affected by hydropeaking the lack of data to implement the reservoir module of swat led to inaccurate streamflow predictions in subbasins affected by hydropower production which consequently affected the snow parameters that were calibrated according to river discharge lastly the final validation of section 3 4 from another perspective further confirmed the better snow dynamic simulation ability of calibration procedure iii compared to procedure ii which closely matched the snow measurements of the river basin the way swat models snow processes the computation of subbasin mean swe and the conversion from hs to swe present some limitations which to some extent justify the discrepancy between swe model results and observations first the snow module of swat uses a non distributed temperature index based approach neitsch et al 2011 whereas in reality snow dynamics are highly dependent on several site specific conditions such as exposure to wind land cover and solar radiation endrizzi et al 2006 hiemstra et al 2002 moreover the uncertainty in estimating swe by the equation proposed by pistocchi 2016 is about 13 we should also consider the uncertainty of the climate and temperature input in mountainous regions duan et al 2016 tuo et al 2016 the epistemic uncertainty of the model structure abbaspour et al 2007 and of the snow package itself and the uncertainty propagated from hydropower operation majone et al 2016 5 conclusion modeling snow processes is of great importance in snow dominated alpine river basins like the upper adige river basin a discharge based single objective calibration approach is not capable of simulating snow dynamics reasonably well regardless of whether the spatial variability of snow parameters is considered in the parameterization or not by referring to river discharge alone the model has a high chance of obtaining streamflow simulations that are in good agreement with the observations but are composed of unreliable contributions of different hydrological processes in the end this would result in inappropriate considerations for water resources management plans and policies due to the rapid development of measurement devices and remote sensing techniques snow data are available or become available for many snow dominated alpine basins and therefore represent an optimal dataset for model calibration to integrate streamflow observations the multi objective calibration procedure proposed in this work was based on the inclusion of swe time series in the calibration procedure of swat measurement of swe values are rare in alpine catchments and continuous swe time series are generally not available to overcome this important limitation in the multi objective calibration approach we used the simple empirical equation proposed by pistocchi 2016 to convert snow depth observations into swe values moreover swe time series at both the subbasin and the elevation band scales were computed which allowed us to take advantage of the swat model structure to reproduce the spatial variability of snow dynamics properly one disadvantage of the multi objective calibration procedure compared to the single objective approach is the time required for model calibration as a payoff however model predictions are much more robust and reliable which in the end is the most important goal to be achieved by a hydrological model the multi objective calibration procedure was superior to the single objective procedures we therefore conclude that it is crucial to apply a multi objective calibration procedure in hydrological modeling of alpine catchments since 1 when snow data of different spatial scales were included in the calibration the multi objective procedure was able to capture snow dynamics very well as a major hydrological component an improved simulation of snow dynamics is fundamental for alpine hydrology 2 multi objective calibration also reproduced river discharge properly not only by fitting the observations very well in terms of statistical metrics and hydrographs but also by simulating discharge with a reasonable snowmelt contribution multi objective calibration hence allowed us to reduce model equifinality and uncertainty 3 we believe that a multi objective calibration procedure could reduce the parameter uncertainty that is propagated from hydropeaking effects by providing more reasonable and reliable snow and elevation band parameters according to snow data of different spatial scales to better explore this point however a specific uncertainty analysis should be performed in the future with the support of hydropower operation data but it is beyond the scope of this work finally to facilitate multi objective modeling applications in snow dominated catchments the automatic calibration software swat cup abbaspour 2015 could be further developed in particular an automatic rejection criterion could be introduced when the parameter set converges to a maximum snow melt factor smaller than the minimum snow melt factor moreover it would be useful to allow the user to select the elevation band

7388,multi objective hydrological model calibration can represent a valuable solution to reduce model equifinality and parameter uncertainty the soil and water assessment tool swat model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments however the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins this work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches the first two procedures are single objective calibration procedures for which all parameters of the swat model were calibrated according to river discharge alone procedures i and ii differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters the first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin the third procedure is a multi objective calibration in which we considered snow water equivalent swe information at two different spatial scales i e subbasin and elevation band in addition to discharge measurements we tested these approaches in the upper adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available only the set of parameters obtained with this multi objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and swe these findings offer the large community of swat users a strategy to improve swat modeling in alpine catchments keywords swat model adige snow water equivalent alpine catchment multi objective calibration 1 introduction multi objective calibration of hydrological models has proven useful in producing reliable predictions of several hydrological components and reducing model equifinality and uncertainty bekele and nicklow 2007 hanzer et al 2016 lu et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 snow observations represent an optimal dataset to calibrate hydrological models in conjunction with streamflow since they are available in many alpine catchments in terms of snow depth values and often have higher spatial resolution than river discharge gauging stations moreover snow dynamics play a key role in determining the seasonal characteristics of river discharge which further affects other hydrology related processes like erosion hydropower operation water supply as well as flood prevention cunderlik and ouarda 2009 pradhanang et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 zampieri et al 2013 therefore in order to conduct a comprehensive and reliable hydrological investigation in alpine catchments it is not only important to focus on river discharge but it is also necessary to accurately describe the snow processes endrizzi et al 2006 grusson et al 2015 hanzer et al 2016 troin and caya 2014 warscher et al 2013 hence a multi objective calibration approach considering both discharge and snow measurements can be a feasible and useful method to improve the application of hydrological models like the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 in alpine catchments swat is one of the most comprehensive and applied hydrological models abbaspour et al 2015 francesconi et al 2016 golmohammadi et al 2017 liu et al 2016 malagò et al 2016 shen et al 2012 tuo et al 2016 as outlined in the present work swat adopts a specific approach to describe snow processes the same snow water equivalent swe value is assigned to all hydrological response units hru in a subbasin and this value is derived from the weighted sum of the swe computed for each elevation band in a subbasin therefore output time series of swe are available at two spatial scales for the entire subbasin the average subbasin swe and for each elevation band to the best of our knowledge only a few studies have taken these two snow outputs into account to evaluate the performance of the swat snow module fu et al 2014 2015 grusson et al 2015 pradhanang et al 2011 and no study has included the snow information of subbasin and elevation band scales into model calibration processes previous studies mostly assigned a unique set of snow parameters to an entire basin e g fu et al 2014 2015 rahman et al 2013 without considering the heterogeneous morphology encountered in large 1000 km2 catchments egli 2011 egli and jonas 2009 moreover multi objective model calibration has been attempted in swat considering water quality soil moisture evapotranspiration or glacier information along with streamflow abbaspour et al 2007 bekele and nicklow 2007 cao et al 2006 lu et al 2014 maringanti et al 2011 omani et al 2017 pfannerstill et al 2017 rajib et al 2016 white and chaubey 2005 but snow data which are very important information in snow dominated catchments to represent snow dynamics have rarely been used due to the typical lack of swe time series in snow dominated catchments swat model parameters are generally estimated using discharge records alone e g levesque et al 2008 rahman et al 2013 wang and melesse 2005 since river discharge is the combination of the contributions of different hydrological components calibration based on discharge alone can easily lead to the problem of model equifinality beven 2006 hanzer et al 2016 in this work for the first time in the framework of multi objective swat model calibration we take advantage of a simple empirical regression equation which has recently been proposed to convert snow depth data into snow water equivalent pistocchi 2016 the conversion equation is useful since swe is the typical variable modeled in hydrological models while snow depth is the most common information about the snowpack daily swe data of both subbasin and elevation band scales are computed based on snow depth measurements and further applied in the multi objective calibration procedure we compare then three approaches to calibrate swat model parameters in alpine catchments two are classical single objective calibration procedures while the third one is a novel multi objective calibration the novelties in the latter approach include the use of swe data derived from snow depth measurements and the use of these swe information at two spatial scales subbasin and elevation band to calibrate the model along with discharge the possibility of modeling both discharge dynamics and changes in swe allows us to verify whether it is possible to improve model performance in alpine catchments considering multiple datasets for calibration the specific objectives of this study are to 1 investigate the effect of using the same or different snow model parameters for different subbasins on model performance considering a single objective discharge based calibration procedure 2 propose a multi objective calibration procedure involving both discharge and two spatial scales of snow output for swat modeling in snow dominated alpine catchments 3 assess the model performances of single objective and multi objective procedures in the upper adige catchment an important alpine basin in northeast italy 4 compare the behavior of major hydrological components between the single objective and multi objective procedures 2 material and method 2 1 study area the upper adige river basin closed at bronzolo 6875 km2 is a typical alpine catchment located in the northeastern italian alps fig 1 it has a large elevation range 223 m a s l 3865 m a s l and is characterized by steep slopes and sharp hydro climatic gradients callegari et al 2015 from late october to april snowfall is the dominant form of precipitation in this area and the snow cover duration is elevation dependent marcolini et al 2017b as a consequence snowmelt water is the dominant contributor to streamflow in the spring mei et al 2014 2016 penna et al 2014 land uses of the river basin are mainly forest 55 8 grassland and pasture 21 3 and barren land 11 5 the main soil types are loamy sand 45 5 silty clay 21 5 and sand 17 3 with 13 major hydropower plants present in the catchment several subbasins are affected by hydropeaking fig 1 further information about the catchment is provided in the recent review of chiogna et al 2016 2 2 computation of snow water equivalent values based on data availability for the period 2005 2010 we selected 44 snow measurement stations recording daily snow depth values in the upper adige river basin fig 1 and table s1 in the supplementary material these snow data represent a subset of the data used by adler et al 2015 and marcolini et al 2017b to analyze climatic changes occurring in this region the available time series have been quality checked and their homogeneity has been tested using the standard normal homogeneity test marcolini et al 2017a in order to make use of these snow data for swat model calibration two types of swe data were computed starting with the available snow depth observations the mean subbasin scale swe sub swe and the swe of each station a detailed description of the calculations is given in appendix a here we illustrate the main steps of the procedure qualitatively the subbasin scale swe values were calculated from the mean snow depth data hs computed for each of the 20 subbasins fig 1 as follows first daily hs measurements were interpolated using a simple power law model to establish a correlation between hs and elevation the interpolated values were then used to compute a mean subbasin snow depth and finally these values were converted into swe data using the equation suggested by pistocchi 2016 for the temporal evolution of snow density the swe values for each snow station were computed by multiplying the snow depth observations by the temporal evolution of snow density according to the equation suggested by pistocchi 2016 the computed sub swe and the swe of each station were then used to calibrate and validate the swat model the sub swe time series were compared to the subbasin swe output of swat while the swe values for each snow station were compared qualitatively to the corresponding elevation band swat output 2 3 swat model 2 3 1 model description the swat model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is a comprehensive time continuous semi distributed process based model arnold et al 2012a 1998 it can be used to model the water cycle erosion vegetation growth and water quality in large river basins and to assess the effects of climate change and water resources management abbaspour et al 2015 dile et al 2016 yang et al 2016 swat divides river basins into subbasins composed of hrus which are characterized by different combinations of land use soil characteristics and topography the hydrological cycle is calculated based on water balance which is highly affected by climate input such as daily precipitation and maximum minimum air temperature using daily input time series swat simulates the daily monthly and yearly fluxes of water and solutes in river basins the water yield is routed through the streams and reservoirs along the river network even though swat was originally developed to quantify the impact of land management practices in large complex catchments its application in mountainous river basins is not rare ahl et al 2008 debele et al 2010 grusson et al 2015 rostamian et al 2008 troin and caya 2014 it has for example been used to support regional water management practices such as flood control yang et al 2014 hydropower management malagò et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 and assessment of climate change adaptation schemes pradhanang et al 2011 swat uses the elevation band method to consider the orographic effects on precipitation and temperature in mountainous areas up to ten elevation bands can be defined in each subbasin this method has been applied in several snow dominated alpine catchments and proven useful and essential grusson et al 2015 malagò et al 2015 morán tejeda et al 2014 pradhanang et al 2011 rahman et al 2013 in this work six elevation bands were applied 2 3 2 snow package the snow module of swat is based on the temperature index approach hock 2003 neitsch et al 2011 walter et al 2005 and it is able to simulate changes in swe for several user defined elevation bands although more complex snow modules have been tested in previous studies no significant improvement has been observed debele et al 2010 meng et al 2015 swat provides snow output in the form of snowmelt and swe with identical units of precipitation pradhanang et al 2011 a detailed description and equations of the snow packages are available in the swat user s manual neitsch et al 2011 among the snow parameters table 1 smfmx should be larger than smfmn in our study area because smfmx is the maximum melt factor in the northern hemisphere and the minimum melt factor in the southern hemisphere which is explained in the swat i o files arnold et al 2012b in swat the user can choose to assign either a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin or define a different set of snow parameters for each subbasin for the latter case the source code has to be modified the files readsub f and readsno f contain an inappropriate constraint negative and zero values of sftmp and smtmp are not allowed at the subbasin scale this is contradictory to the swat official documentation arnold et al 2012b which defines the physical range for sftmp and smtmp between 5 and 5 e g grusson et al 2015 swat output files provide swe values for each elevation band in the output snw file in the following we refer to this swe output as eb swe elevation band snow water equivalent each elevation band covers an area with a range of elevations and the swe depends on snow depth which is elevation dependent therefore the eb swe output cannot be calibrated to fit exactly with the data available for a single monitoring station still a qualitative comparison is feasible snow outputs snowmelt and swe are stored in the output hru file at the hru scale swat assigns the elevation weighted swe value of the subbasin to all hrus within a subbasin therefore the same swe is assigned to each hru this swe output of swat represents an average swe value for the entire subbasin detailed information is provided in the supplementary material this subbasin specific value can be used for model calibration by comparing it to the subbasin swe that is computed using eq a5 this swe output in output hru is hereafter referred to as sub swe snowmelt values are not ideal for model calibration because their measurements are rarely available 2 4 model setup arcswat 2012 version 664 with an interface in arcgis was used to set up the model for the upper adige river basin with 20 subbasins fig 1 the datasets used in the model are listed in table 2 based on the availability of snow data and discharge records the model considered the time frame from 2005 to 2010 all snow stations are located at a relatively low elevation below 2000 m a s l due to the lack of high elevation stations we cannot observe the effect described by grünewald et al 2014 in which snow depth increases with elevation up to a certain altitude where it displays a distinct peak followed by a decrease at the highest elevations in most subbasins snow depth measurements are available for stations located at similar elevations table s1 eight gauging stations fig 1 provide effective discharge records for the investigated time frame among them five stations record the natural streamflow of four headwater subbasins 1 2 7 8 and 11 two subbasins 3 and 4 are affected by the upstream subbasins and one subbasin 20 records the total streamflow behavior at the end of the entire basin in this work the simulations were performed at the daily scale 2 5 model calibration and evaluation in order to mitigate the effects of the initial conditions a time frame of 516 days 01 01 2005 05 31 2006 was used as a warm up period calibration began on 06 01 2006 and lasted until 05 31 2008 while validation was performed during the time period 06 01 2008 05 31 2010 the parameters to be calibrated table 1 were selected according to the one at a time sensitivity analysis in swat cup abbaspour 2015 three calibration procedures were applied i all the parameters reported in table 1 were calibrated according to discharge records using an automatic calibration procedure and basin scale snow parameters were estimated to assign the same set of values to the entire basin ii all parameters were calibrated automatically to reproduce the discharge measurements as in procedure i unlike procedure i snow parameters were calibrated at the subbasin scale to consider the spatial variability of the snow processes an additional manual calibration was required when automatic calibration led to unrealistic parameter sets such a step was necessary when smfmx values that were estimated using automatic calibration were lower than smfmn values which is not correct for the northern hemisphere where the study area is located iii subbasin scale snow parameters and the other parameters were calibrated manually so that the sub swe output eq s1 in the supplementary material fit the subbasin average swe as defined in eq a5 and the streamflow simulation fit the discharge records meanwhile a qualitative comparison between eb swe and the swe values computed for each monitoring station eq a3 was also taken into account for parameter modification starting with the initial ranges of parameters reported in table 1 the automatic calibration was performed with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 2007 in swat cup abbaspour 2015 to narrow down and target the effective range of each parameter sufi 2 is based on a semi automated inverse modeling procedure with the implementation of a combined calibration uncertainty analysis abbaspour 2015 the initial parameter ranges were defined following the swat documentation arnold et al 2012b and studies of neighboring alpine catchments grusson et al 2015 rahman et al 2013 for each iteration 1000 simulations were run after each iteration the ranges of the parameters were modified and generally narrowed down according to both the suggested values of the program abbaspour et al 2004 2007 and their initial limitations the goodness of fit between the modeled and the observed discharge was computed for each gauged subbasin during both the calibration and validation periods the goodness of fit between sub swe and the subbasin average swe defined in eq a5 for each subbasin was calculated during both periods furthermore the simulated eb swe was qualitatively compared to the data of each station belonging to a specific elevation band the

first is a headwater catchment not affected by hydropeaking and the second integrates the processes occurring in the entire river basin and it is not heavily affected by hydropeaking graphic results are displayed for calibration procedures ii and iii in order to focus on the comparison between the single objective and multi objective calibration strategies model performances for all three calibration procedures and all subbasins are provided in tables 3 1 model performance using calibration procedure i as shown in table 3 calibration procedure i resulted in at least satisfactory model performances nse 0 5 in simulating river discharge during the calibration period during validation the discharge of all gauged subbasins except for subbasins 7 and 11 were also well reproduced with nse 0 5 comparing simulated and observed river discharge for all gauging stations and for the entire simulation period fig 2 a a close fit was observed with an r2 value of 0 92 underestimation of streamflow occurred for river discharge values larger than 250 m3 s the mean absolute value of pbias for streamflow was 8 42 considering the entire period table 3 despite the good performance in reproducing river discharge the agreement between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe was unsatisfactory nse 0 5 for most subbasins 70 of the subbasins during the calibration period and 50 during the validation period in addition the absolute values of pbias for sub swe were higher than 50 for 65 of the subbasins during calibration and for 50 of the subbasins during validation considering the entire period and all subbasins poor agreement was shown between the sub swe and the swe computed according to eq a5 fig 2d thus the parameters of procedure i calibrated according to discharge were able to reproduce river discharge but failed to capture the behavior of swe at the subbasin scale 3 2 model performance using calibration procedure ii calibration procedure ii differs from calibration procedure i in that it defines subbasin specific snow parameters the calibrated parameters of procedure ii showed performances as good as procedurei in simulating river discharge during both calibration and validation periods table 4 this procedure also obtained unsatisfactory performances during validation for subbasins 7 and 11 still the r2 value between model simulation and all available streamflow observations fig 2b was equal to 0 91 in this case the model underestimated streamflow with values larger than 300 m3 s considering the entire period the mean absolute value of pbias was 7 75 for streamflow simulations with respect to the subbasin swe unsatisfactory results nse 0 5 were obtained for 70 of the subbasins during calibration and 50 of the subbasins during validation the absolute value of pbias higher than 50 occurred for 65 of the subbasins during calibration and 50 of the subbasins during validation as shown in fig 2e poor agreement was also observed between all the sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe generally no improvements were observed in simulating the subbasin averaged swe even though different sets of snow parameters were assigned to each subbasin to consider local differences in snow dynamics also in this case the model calibrated according to discharge was only able to reproduce streamflow dynamics adequately figs 3 and 4 show the detailed model performances of subbasins 2 and 20 respectively we focused on river discharge subbasin scale swe and elevation band scale swe compared to monitoring station values the daily discharge behavior obtained using the calibrated parameters of procedure ii was well captured at subbasin 2 fig 3a most of the peaks were closely reproduced while base flow was slightly underestimated in contrast the subbasin averaged swe values were overestimated fig 3c with on average 59 longer snow seasons this result indicates that a much larger amount of snow accumulation was simulated at subbasin 2 in comparison to the subbasin averaged swe reference a larger amount of snow accumulated in the subbasin could lead to a large amount of snowmelt water contributing to the discharge during the melting season the eb swe of lower elevation areas bands 1 and 2 well matched the swe values computed converting measured hs values using eq a3 of the three available snow stations in subbasin 2 fig 3e and g as previously mentioned eb swe is a representative value for a range of elevations whereas the station observation can only represent one point among these elevations the swe time series of the snow stations at subbasin 2 were considered to be well reproduced by the model for the higher elevation areas band 3 6 of subbasin 2 no snow stations were available the simulated eb swe values are displayed in fig 3i the highest elevation area band 6 in particular displayed a much larger swe amount and longer snow cover duration than the other elevation bands in fact the sub swe is the weighted mean of the eb swe of all the elevation bands eq s1 therefore the overestimation of sub swe observed in subbasin 2 fig 3c could be explained by the overestimation of swe at elevation bands 3 through 6 fig 3i considering subbasin 20 the simulated discharge reproduced the general behavior of the observations well fig 4a daily fluctuations stemming from hydropeaking were not captured since the reservoir module was not used in the model due to the lack of information about reservoir management fig 4c displays the subbasin swe of subbasin 20 the snow covered periods were well captured the simulation underestimated the subbasin scale swe during the calibration period during validation simulated sub swe fit quite well with the swe of the 2008 2009 snow season but overestimated the maximum swe values for the snow season 2009 2010 regarding the eb swe simulations they matched with the swe of the monitoring station moelten during the first three snow seasons 2006 2009 but they were much higher than the station swe values for the snow season 2009 2010 3 3 model performance using calibration procedure iii a third calibration procedure was developed to meet both good performances in subbasin swe and river discharge simulations as well as suitable matches between eb swe and swe values obtained converting the hs observations of the corresponding snow stations this procedure was able to reproduce both subbasin swe and river discharge properly table 5 the simulated river discharge values fit well with the observations as shown by the at least satisfactory model performances nse 0 5 for all the gauged subbasins during both the calibration and validation periods table 5 procedure iii appeared to lead to a more accurate set of model parameters than procedures i and ii since subbasins 7 and 11 also displayed satisfactory results during the validation period such a conclusion however should be supported by a systematic comparison to be performed in a larger set of alpine river basins in addition the scatterplot displayed in fig 2c shows good agreement between observed and simulated values r2 0 89 underestimation of river discharge was observed for values larger than 300 m3 s fig 2c the mean absolute value of pbias for streamflow simulations was 4 63 the agreement between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe was at least satisfactory nse 0 5 for all 20 subbasins during both the calibration and validation periods table 5 good model performance 0 65 nse 0 75 was achieved for 75 of the subbasins during calibration and 75 of the subbasins reached very good model performance 0 75 nse 1 00 during validation in addition absolute pbias values were smaller than 50 during the entire simulation period for 95 of swe considering the entire period and all subbasins close agreement was reached between sub swe and the subbasin averaged swe with an r2 of 0 85 fig 2f the multi objective based calibration procedure was able to capture the behavior of both river discharge and averaged swe of each subbasin well the model performance of procedure iii for subbasins 2 and 20 is also displayed in figs 3 and 4 respectively for subbasin 2 the multi objective calibrated parameters led to a good fit between simulated and observed discharge values fig 3b most peaks and base flow were well estimated the simulated sub swe fit quite well with the subbasin average swe capturing the length of the snow seasons and providing a satisfactory estimate of the swe amount fig 3d eb swe simulation results for bands 1 and 2 fig 3f and h were similar to those obtained in procedure ii a noticeable difference between model results obtained using procedure ii and procedure iii was observed for elevation bands from 3 to 6 using calibration procedure iii snow cover duration fig 3j did not increase as much as when using calibration procedure ii leading to an improved agreement between sub swe and subbasin average swe for subbasin 20 the simulated discharge fit well with the observations fig 4b except for the fluctuations during the winter season caused by hydropeaking although the subbasin mean swe values displayed a large variability between calibration and validation periods the model calibrated using procedure iii closely followed the observations fig 4d the simulated snow seasons matched well the values computed using eq a5 fig 4f shows a close match between simulated eb swe and the swe of the snow station converted using eq a3 calibration procedure iii allows us to reproduce swe and streamflow appropriately both in low snow accumulation years and in high snow accumulation years 3 4 validation of swat model results against snow depth observations a final validation step was implemented to compare the hs observations of the 40 snow gauges within the basin fig 1 to the model results obtained using calibration procedure ii and iii the swe time series of the model output were converted into hs values using eqs a3 and a4 to simplify the comparison we classified the observations and the corresponding model results into six classes according to 300 m elevation intervals i e class 1 stations from 300 m a s l to 600 m a s l class 2 from 600 m a s l to 900 m a s l and so on we then computed the mean snow depth between november 1st and april 30th for the entire simulation period hs for each elevation class as shown in fig 5 observed hs values presented a positive correlation with the elevations which can be reproduced with a power law as given in eq a1 the model results of procedure iii captured very well the mean behavior of the observations of the elevation areas for classes 2 through 5 where 82 5 of the snow stations were located table s1 while slight deviations were observed for classes 1 and 6 results of procedure ii captured well the mean behavior of the observations for classes 3 and 4 corresponding to 57 5 of the snow stations table s1 it is particularly relevant to observe that calibration procedure ii performed poorly for class 5 1500 m a s l 1800 m a s l this is the most sensitive elevation for snow variability in the adige catchment as evidenced by marcolini et al 2017b therefore procedure iii performed better in reproducing the observed snow dynamics than procedure ii as shown in table 6 evident differences were observed between the multi objective and single objective calibration procedures in reproducing snow pack characteristics such as snow cover duration scd snow peak value spv and snow peak day spd the two single objective procedures i and ii led to similar errors for all three snow characteristics during both the calibration and validation periods their values were higher than those obtained by the multi objective approach iii among them mape values of scd and spv obtained by procedure i and ii were three and two times higher respectively than the corresponding values obtained using procedure iii the mape values of spd were close among the results of the three procedures and procedure iii still led to the smallest values generally procedure iii performed better in reproducing the snow pack characteristics than procedures i and ii the absolute percentage error of scd spv and spd for each subbasin are provided in the supplementary material table s2 s4 for all calibration procedures 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different snow parameterizations on discharge based single objective calibration tables 3 4 and fig 2 show that the set of parameters obtained using calibration procedures i and ii both led to equally good performances in simulating the river discharge but failed to reproduce the subbasin average swe in most subbasins the definition of subbasin specific snow parameters in procedure ii led to a higher r2 fig 2d and e and smaller mape of scd and spv table 6 than procedure i however the improvements were minor therefore we can conclude that assigning subbasin specific snow parameters does not significantly improve the model performance of snow simulations when calibrating all model parameters according to river discharge records considering a single objective calibration procedure the defined set of subbasin specific snow parameters could still not fit the specific snow conditions of each subbasin moreover river discharge in subbasins 3 6 9 10 12 14 15 and 17 was highly affected by hydropeaking which cannot be reproduced by our hydrological model due to the lack of input data using discharge based single objective calibration the identified optimal set of snow parameters was also influenced by this source of uncertainty thus the model calibrated according to discharge only could not properly capture the snow observations in the upper adige catchment therefore the swat model calibrated using a single objective approach was not able to reproduce both snow and discharge dynamics independently of the scale at which snow parameters were defined 4 2 importance of applying a multi objective calibration procedure in alpine catchments calibration procedures i and ii displayed quite similar model performances we will now focus only on procedure ii in comparison to procedure iii since they both define subbasin specific snow parameters the multi objective calibration approach offered using procedure iii resulted in much better model performances than the single objective procedure especially in reproducing snow dynamics as shown in tables 3 5 the calibrated parameters of procedure iii led to acceptable simulations for streamflow in all gauged subbasins during the entire period in contrast procedure ii could not reproduce the discharge of subbasins 7 and 11 during validation more importantly the use of procedure iii allowed us to simulate the subbasin swe of each subbasin properly with at least satisfactory performance while the use of a single objective procedure failed to reproduce swe adequately in most subbasins moreover including snow data during calibration allowed us to reproduce important properties better such as snow cover duration in the catchment and peak snow accumulation table 6 considering the overall performance of the models both calibration procedures were able to reproduce the discharge records with similar r2 fig 2b and c the underestimation of high streamflow discharge values could be ascribed to the impact of river damming without data to implement the reservoir module all these models were not able to simulate the high discharge and hydropeaking effects properly the comparisons of model performances in subbasins 2 and 20 further illustrated the positive effect of using a multi objective calibration approach as shown in section 3 subbasin 2 represented a headwater subbasin with natural flow and subbasin 20 represented the outlet of the river basin in addition subbasin 2 was a snow dominated alpine subbasin with high elevation areas and subbasin 20 was dominated by low elevation areas 800 m based on the hydrographs procedures ii and iii presented an equally good ability in simulating the discharge time series for both subbasins fig 3a and b and fig 4a and b however swe simulations were quite different between the two procedures at both the high elevation and the low elevation subbasins this can lead to distinct interpretations about the hydrological modeling behaviors caused by different calibration approaches in subbasin 2 fig 3 procedures ii and iii performed equally well in qualitatively matching the swe of snow stations converted using eq a3 but different subbasin average swe were obtained procedure ii led to a large overestimation of the subbasin swe and much longer snow seasons due to the overestimation of swe for high elevations fig 3i procedure iii led to a close fit between sub swe and subbasin averaged swe references although the amounts of subbasin swe were very different between calibration and validation periods the values of swe during validation were almost twice as high as the calibration values as a consequence the contribution of snowmelt to streamflow was very different in the model that was calibrated using the single objective calibration procedure compared to the multi objective procedure this was shown by comparing the snowmelt results of the two procedures fig 6 a and fig 7 the cumulated snowmelt simulated by calibration procedure ii reached 2333 mm which was almost twice as much as the amount simulated by procedure iii during the entire period fig 7 the simulated and observed cumulative discharge in the case of procedure iii fit closely fig 7 despite the larger snowmelt contribution to streamflow the results of procedure ii still underestimated the cumulative behaviors of discharge records fig 7a these results show that although the simulated discharge values may look reasonable they can be inaccurate in terms of the relative contribution of runoff components in other words the multi objective calibration approach reduced model equifinality beven 2006 hanzer et al 2016 considering subbasin 20 fig 4 there was no significant difference between the simulated sub swe of procedure ii and procedureiii although improvements were observed during the calibration period of procedureiii the predicted snowmelt was similar between the two procedures as observed in fig 6b in this low elevation subbasin however the contribution of snowmelt was not as relevant as for subbasin 2 in general the snow and elevation band parameters obtained using procedure iii allowed us to reproduce snow dynamics at both subbasin and elevation band spatial scales better than those of procedure ii since snow data were considered during model calibration moreover a multi objective model calibration allowed us to obtain a more robust estimate of snow parameters than a single objective calibration in subbasins affected by hydropeaking the lack of data to implement the reservoir module of swat led to inaccurate streamflow predictions in subbasins affected by hydropower production which consequently affected the snow parameters that were calibrated according to river discharge lastly the final validation of section 3 4 from another perspective further confirmed the better snow dynamic simulation ability of calibration procedure iii compared to procedure ii which closely matched the snow measurements of the river basin the way swat models snow processes the computation of subbasin mean swe and the conversion from hs to swe present some limitations which to some extent justify the discrepancy between swe model results and observations first the snow module of swat uses a non distributed temperature index based approach neitsch et al 2011 whereas in reality snow dynamics are highly dependent on several site specific conditions such as exposure to wind land cover and solar radiation endrizzi et al 2006 hiemstra et al 2002 moreover the uncertainty in estimating swe by the equation proposed by pistocchi 2016 is about 13 we should also consider the uncertainty of the climate and temperature input in mountainous regions duan et al 2016 tuo et al 2016 the epistemic uncertainty of the model structure abbaspour et al 2007 and of the snow package itself and the uncertainty propagated from hydropower operation majone et al 2016 5 conclusion modeling snow processes is of great importance in snow dominated alpine river basins like the upper adige river basin a discharge based single objective calibration approach is not capable of simulating snow dynamics reasonably well regardless of whether the spatial variability of snow parameters is considered in the parameterization or not by referring to river discharge alone the model has a high chance of obtaining streamflow simulations that are in good agreement with the observations but are composed of unreliable contributions of different hydrological processes in the end this would result in inappropriate considerations for water resources management plans and policies due to the rapid development of measurement devices and remote sensing techniques snow data are available or become available for many snow dominated alpine basins and therefore represent an optimal dataset for model calibration to integrate streamflow observations the multi objective calibration procedure proposed in this work was based on the inclusion of swe time series in the calibration procedure of swat measurement of swe values are rare in alpine catchments and continuous swe time series are generally not available to overcome this important limitation in the multi objective calibration approach we used the simple empirical equation proposed by pistocchi 2016 to convert snow depth observations into swe values moreover swe time series at both the subbasin and the elevation band scales were computed which allowed us to take advantage of the swat model structure to reproduce the spatial variability of snow dynamics properly one disadvantage of the multi objective calibration procedure compared to the single objective approach is the time required for model calibration as a payoff however model predictions are much more robust and reliable which in the end is the most important goal to be achieved by a hydrological model the multi objective calibration procedure was superior to the single objective procedures we therefore conclude that it is crucial to apply a multi objective calibration procedure in hydrological modeling of alpine catchments since 1 when snow data of different spatial scales were included in the calibration the multi objective procedure was able to capture snow dynamics very well as a major hydrological component an improved simulation of snow dynamics is fundamental for alpine hydrology 2 multi objective calibration also reproduced river discharge properly not only by fitting the observations very well in terms of statistical metrics and hydrographs but also by simulating discharge with a reasonable snowmelt contribution multi objective calibration hence allowed us to reduce model equifinality and uncertainty 3 we believe that a multi objective calibration procedure could reduce the parameter uncertainty that is propagated from hydropeaking effects by providing more reasonable and reliable snow and elevation band parameters according to snow data of different spatial scales to better explore this point however a specific uncertainty analysis should be performed in the future with the support of hydropower operation data but it is beyond the scope of this work finally to facilitate multi objective modeling applications in snow dominated catchments the automatic calibration software swat cup abbaspour 2015 could be further developed in particular an automatic rejection criterion could be introduced when the parameter set converges to a maximum snow melt factor smaller than the minimum snow melt factor moreover it would be useful to allow the user to select the elevation band

7389,a quantitative framework for characterizing the intensity of the water cycle over land is presented and illustrated using a spatially distributed water balance model of the conterminous united

storage adjusted runoff q as the sum of actual runoff q and the rate of change in soil moisture storage δs δt positive or negative during the time step of interest the q indicator is demonstrated to be mathematically complementary to wci in a manner that allows graphical interpretation of their relationship for the purposes of this study the indicators were demonstrated using long term spatially distributed model simulations with an annual time step wci was found to increase over most of the conus between the 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 periods driven primarily by increases in p in portions

increasing rates of ocean evaporation terrestrial evapotranspiration and precipitation p quan et al 2004 huntington 2006 2010 rawlins et al 2010 syed et al 2010 giorgi et al 2011 durack et al 2012 kramer et al 2015 we define intensification as an increase in the flux of water between existing ocean atmosphere terrestrial freshwater and cryospheric pools the scientific basis for warming induced intensification is that 1 evaporation increases with increasing temperature provided water is not limiting and 2 warmer air holds more moisture the relation between surface air temperature and atmospheric water vapor is described by the clausius clapeyron equation which indicates that water vapor will increase by about 7 per degree k rise in temperature held and soden 2000 2006 allen and

latitude storm tracks moving poleward and strengthening similarly trenberth 2011 reported that in general there have been decreases in precipitation in the subtropics and tropics outside of the monsoon trough and increases in precipitation at higher latitudes notably over north america eurasia and argentina these observational studies and modeling studies reviewed in chou et al 2013 and

drying is observed more generally in the subtropics and wetting in northern latitudes zhang et al 2007 marvel and bonfils 2013 while there are many uncertainties in the future hydrologic responses of land areas to further climate warming it is becoming increasingly clear that historically wetter energy limited areas are more sensitive to change than drier water limited areas kumar et al 2016 there

demand and increased leaf area are taken into account frank et al 2015 ultimately growth responses are further complicated by acclimation responses e g hungate et al 2006 shaw et al 2002 körner 2006

heavy downpours and flooding could cause severe erosion and sedimentation that degrade soils and decrease productivity nearing et al 2004 1 3 study motivation and objectives there is presently no single widely accepted indicator of wci over land that is derived from a quantitative statement of the landscape water balance and is also applicable at all spatial and temporal scales this reflects the fact that the three main approaches to water cycle intensification originated in the meteorology climatology community and therefore focus upon the atmospheric portion of the water cycle these three approaches quantify 1 changes in the area averaged vertically integrated atmospheric water budget 2 changes in the residence time of water in the atmosphere and 3 combinations of 1 and 2 e g trenberth 1999 trenberth et al 2005 bosilovich et al 2005 feng et al 2017 while such approaches are generally cognizant of the downstream effects of water cycle intensification on terrestrial hydrologic processes such as runoff soil moisture storage groundwater recharge floods and hydrologic drought they do not explicitly focus upon these processes therefore our first motivation is to describe water cycle intensification from the standpoint of the terrestrial portion of the water cycle as expressed in the landscape water budget equation see section 2 1 below in so doing we seek to integrate our terrestrial approach with the atmospheric approach 1 described above specifically the change in water vapor storage in approach 1 is shown to equal aet minus p during a time step bosilovich et al 2005 our proposed terrestrial approach by contrast tracks changes in runoff and soil moisture in the geospatially explicit landscape unit immediately below an atmospheric control volume however as we show in section 2 1 below landscape runoff plus change in soil moisture equals p aet during a time step the close linkage between atmospheric approach 1 and our terrestrial approach is evident from these relationships a decrease in atmospheric storage aet p during a time step is associated with an equivalent increase in runoff plus soil moisture storage conversely an increase in atmospheric storage aet p during a time step is associated with an equivalent decrease in runoff plus soil moisture storage our second motivation is to broaden the perspective of the hydrologic community concerning hydrologic responses to climate change this community has tended to focus on long term changes in runoff as the dominant indicator of hydrologic response milly et al 2005 dai et al 2009 mccabe and wolock 2011a by contrast we propose a more general framework that encompasses changes in runoff soil moisture storage and wci over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in accord with these motivations our specific objectives are to i derive an indicator of wci using the terms of the terrestrial water balance equation ii define this indicator in relation to runoff and soil moisture change and iii provide an initial demonstration of how it may be used to improve understanding of hydrologic response to climate variation and change at the multi decadal time scale by tracking this and related indicators over time it may be possible to identify areas where hydrologic conditions e g soil moisture groundwater recharge runoff and streamflow are particularly vulnerable to climate change and where long term strategies of adaptive management may be beneficial 2 hydrologic response to climate change a new indicator framework 2 1 runoff water cycle intensity and the local hydroclimatic regime the proposed indicator framework is based on three concepts i runoff ii water cycle intensity and iii the local hydroclimatic regime first consider runoff a fundamental concept in hydrology as well as the most widely used indicator of hydrologic response to climate change milly et al 2005 dai et al 2009 mccabe and wolock 2011a huntington and billmire 2014 kramer et al 2015 we begin with a statement of the terrestrial water balance eq 1 1 p aet q δs δt where p precipitation aet actual evapotranspiration q actual runoff surface water discharge and δs δt change in soil moisture storage positive negative or zero where all terms are averaged across a landscape hydrologic unit hu of any specified size over a time period or step of any specified duration in units of l3 l2 t or l t e g mm day for the purposes of this study we assume that all storage change during a time step occurs as soil moisture change runoff q is defined by rearranging eq 1 2 q p aet δs δt we define q as the storage adjusted runoff equal at all times to q δs δt and also p aet eq 3 3 q q δs δt p aet q is used in preference to q in our framework because it explicitly indicates the relative importance of actual runoff q and soil moisture change δs δt in the overall hu response to changing p and et conditions during a time step for example q may assume negative values on a transient basis during seasonal or longer term dry periods when aet is greater than p and the excess aet demand is met by depletion of soil moisture runoff q alone by contrast must always be greater than or equal to zero and therefore provides less information about the response of the hu during dry periods a similar situation pertains during wet periods when the importance of soil moisture accretion relative to q can be discerned finally q p aet and is therefore mathematically complementary to water cycle intensity as will be described further below second we define the water cycle intensity wci as 4 wci p aet where all terms are averaged across a landscape unit over a specified time step of any duration in l t units our definition of wci is applicable at any temporal scale e g sub daily to multi decadal or spatial scale for which observed or simulated values of p and aet are available wci mathematically complements runoff the most widely used hydrologic indicator of water cycle response to climate change whereas storage adjusted runoff q quantifies the difference between the two drivers of the water cycle p and aet wci quantifies their sum this enables a coupled graphical representation of the overall response of the water cycle to climate change at a landscape unit of interest fig 1 a b our definition of intensity as the sum of system inflow and outflow derives from an analogous intensity indicator in the water use literature weiskel et al 2007 it should be noted that wci is both similar to and distinct from the hydroclimatic intensity hy int indicator of giorgi et al 2011 defined as follows hy int int dsl where int the mean annual p intensity on wet days for a given year normalized to the long term average p intensity for the period of record and dsl the mean annual dry spell length for a given year in days normalized to the long term average dry spell length for the period of record days with p 1 mm are considered wet days with p 1 mm are considered dry hy int is useful for quantifying changes in precipitation intensity and the length of intervening dry spells relative to a selected period of record increases in both of these variables are considered likely meteorological consequences of long term atmospheric warming giorgi et al 2014 hegerl et al 2015 im et al 2016 like hy int wci is also expected to be sensitive to coupled changes in both p and aet especially if a short time scale daily to hourly is used in the quantification of p and aet wci differs from hy int in using l t units in its complementary relationship to runoff also expressed in l t units and in its applicability at a wide range of temporal scales sub daily to multi decadal finally we introduce the concept of the local hydroclimatic regime defined as the particular combination of p and aet that characterizes the climate of a landscape unit over a time step of interest the landscape units are geospatially explicit for example the topographically defined 2 through 8 digit hydrologic units hus of the conus seaber et al 1987 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml huc250k xml landscape units may also be defined using high resolution landscape grids like those used in our demonstration below daly et al 2008 for data see http prism oregonstate edu a local hydroclimatic regime may be represented graphically by its p aet position on a two dimensional p vs aet plotting space fig 1a when p aet e g fig 1a point 1 q p aet is 0 and the regime will plot on or to the left of the p aet line when aet p during the annual dry season or during droughts a regime will plot to the right of this line under these conditions aet in excess of p is supplied strictly by depletion of soil moisture during the time step that is q 0 q p aet δs δt and δs δt 0 for the sake of simplicity in this initial presentation of the wci framework the present study relies upon a finely discretized water balance model forced only by local precipitation soil moisture storage and temperature see section 3 below for this reason we use the term local hydroclimatic regime inflows to a landscape unit from external human and natural sources such as irrigation imports and natural surface water and groundwater inflows weiskel et al 2007 2014 are excluded from consideration we recognize that irrigation imports and natural inflows can affect evapotranspiration fluxes and wci in moisture limited environments weiskel et al 2014 examples include portions of western china xue et al 2017 and the conus lo and famiglietti 2013 future applications of our intensity framework could address this limitation by explicitly incorporating irrigation imports and natural inflows into the landscape water balance eq 1 together with remotely sensed or model based evapotranspiration estimates e g jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 for time periods when this information is available 2 2 characterizing hydrologic response to climate change temporal change in a local hydroclimatic regime from time period t1 to time period t2 is represented on the plotting space by a vector connecting the regime at t1 to the regime at t2 see examples a b and c fig 1b the components of this change vector are δp and δaet and they may be positive negative or zero moreover as is clear from eqs 3 and 4 q and wci are each distinct functions of the two variables p and aet when graphed q p aet is a plane that increases from the lower right to the upper left corner of the p aet space fig 1b blue contours q is negative to the right of the p aet line zero along this line and positive to the left of the line the wci p aet plane increases from a minimum value of zero at the origin to high positive values at the upper right fig 1b red contours the gradients of the q and wci planes are equal in magnitude and orthogonal to each other the complementary relation between δq and δwci facilitates a deeper understanding of hydrologic response to climate change for example change in climate represented by δp and δaet has two potential consequences for the local hydrology change in storage adjusted runoff q and change in wci both of these changes occur in the vertical z dimension of fig 1b indicated by the blue and red contours of q and wci respectively moreover both changes can be represented without distortion on the p vs aet plane of the regime space because the gradients of the q and wci planes are equal and orthogonal to each other the vectors δq and δwci fig 1b indicate the respective magnitudes of change in storage adjusted runoff and water cycle intensity and together express the overall hydrologic response of the hu to changes in p and aet 3 methods monthly temperature and p data provided on a 4 kilometer km by 4 km grid for the period january 1895 through december 2014 were obtained from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism dataset daly et al 2008 for data see http prism oregonstate edu prism uses location elevation coastal proximity topographic factors and orographic effectiveness of the terrain in regression analysis to interpolate grid cell temperature and p between meteorological stations daly et al 2008 temperature and p data for all grid cells in the conus 481 639 prism grid cells were used as input to a monthly time step water balance model to estimate monthly δq where δq is defined as the flow per unit area delivered from each grid cell to streams and rivers in units of mm per month the water balance model used in this study reflects hydroclimatic concepts originally developed by thornthwaite 1948 1957 this model has been enhanced over the decades the updated version used in this study is described by mccabe and wolock 2011a b model parameters inputs and outputs for this updated version may be obtained at https doi org 10 5066 f71v5cwn the only inputs to the model are monthly time step temperature and precipitation the model includes concepts of water supply precipitation and demand potential evapotranspiration pet which is estimated from temperature and latitude seasonality in supply and demand snow accumulation and melt and soil moisture storage the hamon pet equation hamon 1961 is used to estimate pet because this model only requires inputs of monthly temperature it can be widely applied in both time and space as temperature data are available for many sites and for long periods of time the hamon pet equation has been evaluated and compared with a number of other models and is considered to provide reliable monthly pet estimates federer et al 1996 vörösmarty et al 1998 lu et al 2005 in a study of five pet models for use with global water balance models federer et al 1996 found that hamon pet estimates agreed with estimates from other models across a wide range of climates in addition vörösmarty et al 1998 compared 11 different pet models for a wide range of climatic conditions across the conterminous u s and found that hamon pet estimates were similar to more input detailed models there are certain limitation in the use of the hamon s pet equation because it does not account for long term trends in radiation wild 2009 relative humidity willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 variation in pet resulting from trends in these climate variables may explain part of the scatter in the relation between measured versus modeled aet shown in fig s2 however milly and dunne 2017 showed little variability in mean pet aet or runoff among several models including hamon over the 20th and early 21st centuries suggesting that more complex models that incorporate more climate variables made little difference another recent analysis has suggested that the use of energy only pet estimation may be advisable to avoid pet change biases such as overestimation of anthropogenic climate change drying milly and dunne 2016 additionally given the scarcity of long term observational data and uncertainties inherent in spatial interpolations we believe that hamon s pet equation is the most appropriate choice for pet when using the wb model across conus in the water balance model monthly temperature also is used to determine the proportions of monthly p that are rain and snow precipitation that is snow is accumulated in a snow pack and snow melt also is computed using a temperature threshold method rainfall is used to compute direct q aet soil moisture storage recharge and surplus which eventually becomes q when the sum of rainfall and snow melt for a month is less than pet aet is equal to the sum of rainfall snow melt and the amount of moisture that can be removed from the soil the fraction of soil moisture storage that can be removed as aet decreases linearly with decreasing soil moisture storage that is water becomes more difficult to remove from the soil as the soil becomes drier and less moisture is available for aet when the sum of rainfall and snow melt exceeds pet in a given month aet is equal to pet water in excess of pet replenishes soil moisture storage when soil moisture storage exceeds capacity during a given month the excess water becomes surplus and eventually becomes q for additional details of the water balance model see mccabe and markstrom 2007 as previously noted the water balance model parameters used for this study were taken from parameter sets developed in previous studies mccabe and wolock 2011a mccabe and wolock 2011b the parameter set includes 1 a parameter that specifies the fraction of monthly p that becomes direct q 2 temperature thresholds that determine the proportions of monthly p that are rain and or snow 3 a snow melt factor that controls the melt rate of the snow pack and 4 a parameter that specifies how much surplus in a month becomes q each of the aforementioned parameters is assumed not to vary across space that is only a single value for each parameter is specified everywhere only soil moisture storage capacity varied spatially this parameter was computed using the available water capacity values from the state soil geographic data base statsgo dataset and by assuming a one meter rooting depth for data see http soils usda gov survey geography statsgo the water balance model has been evaluated and verified in several previous studies mccabe and wolock 2008 gray and mccabe 2010 mccabe and wolock 2011a mccabe and wolock 2011b to complement previous verifications of the water balance model we performed an additional verification of the reliability of the water balance model for this study for the analyses in this study we use prism derived annual p and water balance estimated mean annual aet for the computation of wci therefore we performed an evaluation of the ability of the water balance model to estimate mean annual aet and q because measured aet data are not available for many locations nor for long records based on the assumption that mean annual aet is equal to mean annual p minus mean annual q aet p q we compared aet computed using measured mean annual p minus measured mean annual q aetm with aet computed using measured mean annual p minus water balance estimated mean annual q aetwb we also compared measured mean annual q qm with water balance estimated mean annual q qwb this verification involved the use of measured p measured q and water balance estimated aet and q because water balance estimated aet and q solely are driven by climatic factors a verification of the water balance model required measured q from basins that are largely free of anthropogenic effects such as reservoir operations diversion irrigation withdrawals etc we used measured q and p from a set of basins in the conus identified as having minimal anthropogenic influences gages ii dataset falcone 2011 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml gagesii sept2011 xml from these basins we selected 256 basins that have complete data for the period 1951 through 2015 fig s1 the 256 basins cover a range of sizes and climatic and physiographic regions across the conterminous u s table s1 results indicated a correlation between aetm and aetwb for all 256 sites of 0 80 p 0 01 with a bias mean aetwb minus mean aetm of 13 mm a percent bias bias mean aetm 100 of 2 1 and a nash sutcliffe statistic of 0 63 fig s2 for q the comparison between measured and estimated values indicated a correlation of 0 98 a bias of 13 mm a percent bias of 2 1 and a nash sutcliffe statistic of 0 97 these results indicate that the water balance model reliably estimates mean annual aet and q for the 256 sites details on the model its limitations and goodness of fit measures are described in mccabe and wolock 2011a monthly climatic and water balance output data were aggregated to compute the average annual temperature p aet q and δs δt during two 30 yr time periods 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 to facilitate plotting differences between these periods at the 4 km grid spatial scale of the prism data these periods were chosen because they characterize the first and last 30 years of the 70 yr historical record that we chose to investigate and because they are comparable to the 30 yr climate normals that the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa uses to characterize average climate the 4 km data were aggregated to larger spatial scales to permit regional analyses specifically the conus 4 km data were aggregated to the 2 109 8 digit hydrologic unit huc 8 and the 18 2 digit huc 2 spatial scales seaber et al 1987 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml huc250k xml to better characterize the temporal changes in these climate variables at regional spatial scale we also performed a clustering analysis to reduce the 2109 8 digit hu time series in conus to a small number with similar temporal variability in wci the clustering method used was based on correlations between time series of wci i e p aet for each 8 digit hu a correlation threshold of 0 5 was used to perform the initial grouping of the time series into clusters clusters that included at least 100 hus 5 of all sites were retained for additional clustering steps because hierarchical clustering methods can include observations in one cluster early in the clustering process that better fit into another cluster an additional step was used to improve the clustering of the wci time series this step involved computing the correlation of the time series of wci for each hu with the mean wci time series for each cluster additionally in this step the time series for all hus were ultimately assigned to the cluster with which they were most highly correlated even if the correlation was below the threshold of 0 5 used in the initial clustering process the clustering process resulted in 9 clusters fig 2 for the most part the clusters are geographically coherent and were similar to that reported by mccabe and wolock 2016 for runoff efficiency in the conus for each cluster the median of the correlation values between the hu time series of wci and the mean wci time series for each cluster ranged between 0 69 and 0 74 with the 25th percentile of the distribution of correlations for all clusters above 0 59 and the 75th percentile of the correlations above 0 76 fig 3 additionally almost all of the correlations for each cluster are statistically significant at a 99 percent confidence level after completing the clustering process mean time series of annual wci temperature p and aet were computed for each cluster and analyzed for two time periods 1945 to 2014 and 1900 to 2014 we then used the nonparametric mann kendall test for the presence of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend and reported the nonparametric sen s slope for linear trends salmi 2002 for climate variables for each cluster 4 results and discussion average annual p increased in most of the conus with the exception of the southeast and parts of the northwest between the two time periods of 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 the largest increases in p were in the northeast and central u s and the largest decreases were in the coastal northwest southeastern u s and northern idaho fig 4 a the location of all states in the conus are shown in the supporting information fig s3 the spatial pattern of increasing and decreasing p over time is similar to the pattern shown in peterson et al 2013 in spite of the substantially different time periods and differences in datasets the exception is coastal oregon and washington that do not show decreasing trends in peterson et al 2013 for 1909 2008 but do show decreasing trends in our study comparing 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 the spatial pattern of changes in precipitation over time trends are broadly consistent with jung et al 2013 including decreases in coastal pacific northwest jung et al 2013 covered a similar time period 1951 2010 but was based on a set of 255 discrete catchments average annual aet also increased over most of conus between the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 generally increasing in areas where p had increased fig 4b c the spatial pattern of changes in aet were broadly similar with jung et al 2013 apart from areas in the southeastern u s where there were only a few small catchments in the jung et al dataset increases in aet were greatest in new mexico and parts of west texas and west central oklahoma and adjacent south central kansas and parts of the dakotas decreases in aet were greatest in the southeast particularly in georgia northern florida north and south carolina and arkansas areas of decreasing aet were also present in most western states sun et al 2016 project similar spatial patterns of change in et for conus from 1979 to 2007 to 2031 2060 using an ecohydrological model and dynamically downscaled climate data of the hadcm3 model under the ipcc sres a2 emission scenario annual average pet derived from surface air temperature also increased over most of conus between these two 30 yr time periods fig 4c however in general in the humid northeastern united states p increased substantially more in magnitude than did pet fig 4a 4c in the southeastern united states p decreased substantially more in magnitude than pet increased in magnitude therefore in the eastern united states between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 the magnitude of the changes in p were much greater than the changes in pet the increases in pet over most of conus show a lack of spatial coherence with changes in aet fig 4b c this indicates the importance of change in p compared with changes in pet temperature in explaining observed changes in aet this finding is also consistent with the fact that between the two 30 yr periods 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 aet was moisture limited under moisture limited conditions the budyko hypothesis as recently interpreted by yang et al 2006 indicates that increases in p should result in increases in aet the relative importance of changes in p compared with changes in pet for explaining changes in aet is also consistent with teuling et al 2009 teuling et al 2009 found that trends in radiation global dimming and brightening are expected to impact et only in regions where et correlates with radiation e g central europe but not in north america where the correlation is weak average annual wci increased over most of conus between the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 with a spatial pattern similar to that of p fig 4d the exception is that increases in wci in parts of western texas new mexico and north and south dakota appear to be more closely related to patterns of change in aet fig 4b the spatial coherence and the similarity in magnitudes of changes in wci overall compared with the substantially smaller changes in aet indicate that the changes in wci were mostly associated with changes in p a p associated increase in wci where aet also increases e g most of new england and parts of the upper midwest southern kansas and northcentral oklahoma is consistent with example a1 a2 fig 1b similarly a p associated decrease in wci where both p and aet decrease e g southeastern u s and coastal northwestern u s would be consistent with example b1 b2 fig 1b the spatial coherence in these wci changes is evident when changes in p and aet are plotted for the individual 8 digit hus within the various 2 digit hu water resource regions fig 5 for example most of the 8 digit hus in the northeast hus 01 and 02 fig 5b experienced relatively large increases in p and smaller increases in aet by contrast most of the 8 digit hus in the southeast hu 03 experienced more variable changes fig 5b with a relatively small net decrease in both p and aet overall fig 5c fig 5c shows the mean vectors of change for hus 01 and 02 03 and 13 where the vectors terminate at the average δp and δaet values note the difference in scale between fig 5b and c in new mexico and extreme west texas hu 13 increases in aet were strongly controlled by available moisture accordingly increases in aet were nearly equivalent to increases in p this resulted in strong increases in wci except for 8 digit hus in the rio grande headwaters in south central colorado fig 5b and c these headwater hus plot above the set of points clustered along the p aet line less commonly some areas of the conus show a decrease in p and an increase in aet e g parts of south florida upper peninsula michigan fig 4a b that correspond to example c1 c2 fig 1b these latter areas are examples where wci is decreasing due to larger decreases in p than increases in aet over most of the conus the change in p has had more influence on the change in wci than has change in aet this is shown by comparing the ratio of the changes in p to the changes in aet over the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 fig s4 changes in p have been particularly important in the coastal northwest where large decreases in p have resulted in large decreases in wci by contrast mountainous areas in the northeast and many areas in the midwest have experienced large increases in p that resulted in large increases in wci in some of the areas where aet has had more influence than p on the change in wci parts of new mexico west texas and north and south dakota wci increased because the increase in aet was greater than the increase in p or in some cases the decrease in p in other areas where aet has had more influence than p on the change in wci parts of arizona kansas and southern georgia wci decreased decreases in average july through september soil moisture storage δs δt between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 fig 6 storage adjusted runoff q fig s5 or both indicate a potential for aridification in some regions of the western and southeastern conus drying can result from decreases in p or increases in aet and will depend on the seasonal pattern of decreases in p the seasonality of changes in p will affect the relative magnitude of the q and soil moisture responses for example if decreases in p are primarily in summer months soil moisture will likely decrease more than if decreases in p occur primarily in winter thirty year average soil moisture in july through september decreased between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 in the range of 10 to 87 mm in some areas of western and southeastern u s and in the northernmost midwest fig 6 decreases in soil moisture would most likely occur in summer months in areas where aet increases drawing down soil moisture and precipitation does not increase the spatial pattern of decreasing soil moisture storage is broadly consistent with a recent study of long term 1893 2013 trends in aridity over conus that also found increasing aridity in the western united states and along the southeastern atlantic coast and decreasing aridity in the northeast and midwest finkel et al 2016 the spatial pattern of trends in soil moisture storage is largely consistent with the trends in the palmer drought severity index for 1950 2008 sheffield et al 2012 where the largest increases are observed in the southeastern northwestern and extreme upper midwestern u s and decreases are observed in the northeastern and much of the midwestern u s increased aridity in these areas is also consistent with a recent global analysis of trends in p pet during 1948 to 2008 that showed expansion of drylands feng and fu 2013 an ensemble of climate model projections has indicated that increasing temperature will become progressively more important than changes in p in further expansion of drylands in the western conus feng and fu 2013 whereas our analysis shows that decreases in p are more important than increases in aet in explaining drying decrease in soil moisture storage i e negative δs δt between the two time periods evaluated climate modeling suggests that temperature driven increases in aet are likely to become more important in the future change in p is driving the change in aridity over most of conus as is evident from the map of the absolute value of the ratio of δp to δaet fig s4 for example in new england northern missouri iowa and southern wisconsin δp is substantially larger than δaet these large increases in p fig 4a result in decreased aridity fig 6 in the coastal pacific northwest there were large decreases in p fig 4a and relatively small changes in aet fig 4a b resulting in large increases in aridity by contrast in parts of western texas new mexico central oklahoma and southern kansas there were modest increases in p fig 4a accompanied by somewhat larger increases in aet fig 4b resulting in a modest increase in aridity fig 6 in southern georgia δaet was also greater than δp but in this case aet decreased resulting in an increase in aridity average annual storage adjusted runoff q increased between the two periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 in most of the eastern conus with the exception of many parts of the southeast and northwest fig s5 most areas in the western united states showed little change in q with the exception of part of the northwest and the upper peninsula michigan where there were large decreases in p fig 4a and q fig s5 temporal trends in climate variables for clusters fig 2 with similar temporal variability in wci for the period 1945 2014 table 1 were broadly geographically consistent with differences between the 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 time periods that were shown in fig 4 for p all clusters showed increasing trends except in the northwest c 1 and the southeast c 9 but the increases were significant in only the northeast c 8 and the upper midwest c 4 similarly aet increased in all clusters except the southeast and the trends were significant in only the northeast upper midwest and in montana wyoming western and central dakotas c 3 trends in wci followed the same patterns as trends in p and aet as with p negative trends were observed for wci in the southeast and northwest although these trends were not significant temperature increased in all clusters except the southeast and central conus c 7 and trends were significant in northwest c 1 southwest c 2 and montana wyoming western and central dakotas c 3 annual average soil moisture storage generally increased except in the northwest c 1 and the southeast c 9 but the increases were significant only in the upper midwest c 4 average soil moisture storage in june july and august decreased in the northwest southeast southwest and montana wyoming western and central dakotas but the decreases were only significant in the northwest summer soil moisture increased but not significantly in the other clusters analysis of longer term trends 1900 2014 for these clusters indicate very similar geographic patterns as the 1945 2014 period but the trends were found to be increasing significantly in more than twice as many of the clusters and p values were lower table 2 six of the 9 clusters had significantly increasing wci for 1900 2014 over the longer time period p and wci increased though not significantly in the northwest and southeast whereas trends in these variables since 1945 were decreasing in these clusters average annual soil moisture storage increased in all clusters except in the northwest c 1 and southwest c 2 and the increases were significant in the upper midwest c 4 texas southern oklahoma eastern new mexico c 6 and central conus c 7 soil moisture storage in june july and august decreased in clusters 1 2 3 8 and 9 significantly in the southwest c 2 and increased in clusters 4 5 6 and 7 but none of the increasing trends were significant given the complexity of the climate system and the dependence on the specific time period over which trends are assessed it is not surprising that there are major differences in trends between the two periods 1900 2014 and 1945 2014 that were analyzed tracking the evolution of wci over a specific region and simulating future climate and wci with a suite of gcms known to have skill in reproducing historical trends could be a practical way to gain insight into the range of future changes in hydrologic conditions likely to occur in a region of interest 5 conclusion we define a new indicator of water cycle intensity wci based on the terrestrial water balance equation we then describe its mathematical relation to runoff and soil moisture change and demonstrate the relevance of the indicator for the continental united states in regions where the water cycle is intensifying δwci 0 or weakening δwci 0 the causes may be examined by analyzing the sign and magnitude of changes in its constituent variables p and aet monitoring wci over time could provide information on the sign magnitude interannual variability and persistence of hydroclimatic change and may indicate areas that are particularly vulnerable if these changes persist in the 21st century in areas where wci is increasing due primarily to increases in p and where there are corresponding increases in storage adjusted runoff q there may be increased risk of flooding erosion landslides and pests and pathogens that thrive in more humid conditions in areas where changes in p and aet indicate long term decreases in q and soil moisture storage aridification is indicated ongoing aridification could increase the risk of fire in forest

7389,a quantitative framework for characterizing the intensity of the water cycle over land is presented and illustrated using a spatially distributed water balance model of the conterminous united states conus we approach water cycle intensity wci from a landscape perspective wci is defined as the sum of precipitation p and actual evapotranspiration aet over a spatially explicit landscape unit of interest averaged over a specified time period step of interest the time step may be of any length for which data or simulation results are available e g sub daily to multi decadal we define the storage adjusted runoff q as the sum of actual runoff q and the rate of change in soil moisture storage δs δt positive or negative during the time step of interest the q indicator is demonstrated to be mathematically complementary to wci in a manner that allows graphical interpretation of their relationship for the purposes of this study the indicators were demonstrated using long term spatially distributed model simulations with an annual time step wci was found to increase over most of the conus between the 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 periods driven primarily by increases in p in portions of the western and southeastern conus q decreased because of decreases in q and soil moisture storage analysis of wci and q at temporal scales ranging from sub daily to multi decadal could improve understanding of the wide spectrum of hydrologic responses that have been attributed to water cycle intensification as well as trends in those responses keywords intensification of the water cycle water cycle intensity water balance model evapotranspiration aridification 1 introduction 1 1 intensification of the water cycle climate change is intensifying or speeding up the global water cycle by increasing rates of ocean evaporation terrestrial evapotranspiration and precipitation p quan et al 2004 huntington 2006 2010 rawlins et al 2010 syed et al 2010 giorgi et al 2011 durack et al 2012 kramer et al 2015 we define intensification as an increase in the flux of water between existing ocean atmosphere terrestrial freshwater and cryospheric pools the scientific basis for warming induced intensification is that 1 evaporation increases with increasing temperature provided water is not limiting and 2 warmer air holds more moisture the relation between surface air temperature and atmospheric water vapor is described by the clausius clapeyron equation which indicates that water vapor will increase by about 7 per degree k rise in temperature held and soden 2000 2006 allen and ingram 2002 allan and soden 2008 this relation underlies the water vapor feedback that amplifies warming associated with the radiative forcing caused by carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and other gases held and soden 2000 water cycle intensification is complicated by seasonal chou et al 2013 and regional marvel and bonfils 2013 variability in evaporation and p as well as by interannual variability largely in response to ocean atmosphere teleconnections trenberth et al 1998 trenberth 2011 eicker et al 2016 quan et al 2004 reported that changes in the tropical hadley cell consisting of increased equatorial oceanic rainfall and a general drying in tropical subtropical land masses was associated with an intensification of the water cycle boucher et al 2013 reported in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ar5 wg1 7 6 2 that there is some observational evidence that the sub tropical dry zones are expanding both as a result of the tropical convergence zones narrowing and mid latitude storm tracks moving poleward and strengthening similarly trenberth 2011 reported that in general there have been decreases in precipitation in the subtropics and tropics outside of the monsoon trough and increases in precipitation at higher latitudes notably over north america eurasia and argentina these observational studies and modeling studies reviewed in chou et al 2013 and marvel and bonfils 2013 provide support for the hypothesis that wet regions get wetter and dry regions get drier wwdd as a consequence of climate warming held and soden 2006 some recent studies have argued that the wwdd response is too simplistic responses are substantially less robust over land than over oceans and on a global basis many wet land areas are actually getting drier roderick et al 2014 greve et al 2014 byrne and o gorman 2015 greve and seneviratne 2015 other recent studies have found evidence in support of wwdd over many land areas including substantial parts of the continental united states greve et al 2014 chou et al 2013 kumar et al 2015 polson et al 2016 wu and lau 2016 the observations of wwdd are consistent for zonal means particularly in the northern hemisphere where drying is observed more generally in the subtropics and wetting in northern latitudes zhang et al 2007 marvel and bonfils 2013 while there are many uncertainties in the future hydrologic responses of land areas to further climate warming it is becoming increasingly clear that historically wetter energy limited areas are more sensitive to change than drier water limited areas kumar et al 2016 there is uncertainty regarding historical trends in drought dai et al 2004 dai 2013 sheffield et al 2012 a recent study suggests substantial regional variations in drought in the conterminous united states conus such that upper midwest louisiana southeastern united states us and western us have experienced increasing drought in recent decades 1979 2013 darren et al 2015 by contrast new england pacific northwest upper great plains and ohio river valley experienced decreasing drought over this period darren et al 2015 regional variations in precipitation over specific time periods can lead to

sherwood 2012 dunne et al 2013 matthews et al 2017 the potential for increased frequency of drought as well as long term gradual aridification feng and fu 2013 fu and feng 2014 can potentially reduce crop yields in non irrigated areas that are already prone to water limitations and increase water demands in irrigated areas easterling et al 2007 and likely reduce forest productivity settele et al 2014 droughts would be exacerbated by higher temperatures because of increases in crop water requirements under warmer temperatures hatfield et al 2008 lobell and field 2007 some studies have shown that atmospheric elevated co2 eco2 can lead to increases in water use efficiency keenan et al 2013 roderick et al 2015 however that does not necessarily translate into increasing plant growth e g van der sleen et al 2015 in fact in a recent study across europe a eco2 resulted in a decrease in wue increase in transpiration when other drivers such as lengthening growing season enhanced evaporative demand and increased leaf area are taken into account frank et al 2015 ultimately growth responses are further complicated by acclimation responses e g hungate et al 2006 shaw et al 2002 körner 2006

heavy downpours and flooding could cause severe erosion and sedimentation that degrade soils and decrease productivity nearing et al 2004 1 3 study motivation and objectives there is presently no single widely accepted indicator of wci over land that is derived from a quantitative statement of the landscape water balance and is also applicable at all spatial and temporal scales this reflects the fact that the three main approaches to water cycle intensification originated in the meteorology climatology community and therefore focus upon the atmospheric portion of the water cycle these three approaches quantify 1 changes in the area averaged vertically integrated atmospheric water budget 2 changes in the residence time of water in the atmosphere and 3 combinations of 1 and 2 e g trenberth 1999 trenberth et al 2005 bosilovich et al 2005 feng et al 2017 while such approaches are generally cognizant of the downstream effects of water cycle intensification on terrestrial hydrologic processes such as runoff soil moisture storage groundwater recharge floods and hydrologic drought they do not explicitly focus upon these processes therefore our first motivation is to describe water cycle intensification from the standpoint of the terrestrial portion of the water cycle as expressed in the landscape water budget equation see section 2 1 below in so doing we seek to integrate our terrestrial approach with the atmospheric approach 1 described above specifically the change in water vapor storage in approach 1 is shown to equal aet minus p during a time step bosilovich et al 2005 our proposed terrestrial approach by contrast tracks changes in runoff and soil moisture in the geospatially explicit landscape unit immediately below an atmospheric control volume however as we show in section 2 1 below landscape runoff plus change in soil moisture equals p aet during a time step the close linkage between atmospheric approach 1 and our terrestrial approach is evident from these relationships a decrease in atmospheric storage aet p during a time step is associated with an equivalent increase in runoff plus soil moisture storage conversely an increase in atmospheric storage aet p during a time step is associated with an equivalent decrease in runoff plus soil moisture storage our second motivation is to broaden the perspective of the hydrologic community concerning hydrologic responses to climate change this community has tended to focus on long term changes in runoff as the dominant indicator of hydrologic response milly et al 2005 dai et al 2009 mccabe and wolock 2011a by contrast we propose a more general framework that encompasses changes in runoff soil moisture storage and wci over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in accord with these motivations our specific objectives are to i derive an indicator of wci using the terms of the terrestrial water balance equation ii define this indicator in relation to runoff and soil moisture change and iii provide an initial demonstration of how it may be used to improve understanding of hydrologic response to climate variation and change at the multi decadal time scale by tracking this and related indicators over time it may be possible to identify areas where hydrologic conditions e g soil moisture groundwater recharge runoff and streamflow are particularly vulnerable to climate change and where long term strategies of adaptive management may be beneficial 2 hydrologic response to climate change a new indicator framework 2 1 runoff water cycle intensity and the local hydroclimatic regime the proposed indicator framework is based on three concepts i runoff ii water cycle intensity and iii the local hydroclimatic regime first consider runoff a fundamental concept in hydrology as well as the most widely used indicator of hydrologic response to climate change milly et al 2005 dai et al 2009 mccabe and wolock 2011a huntington and billmire 2014 kramer et al 2015 we begin with a statement of the terrestrial water balance eq 1 1 p aet q δs δt where p precipitation aet actual evapotranspiration q actual runoff surface water discharge and δs δt change in soil moisture storage positive negative or zero where all terms are averaged across a landscape hydrologic unit hu of any specified size over a time period or step of any specified duration in units of l3 l2 t or l t e g mm day for the purposes of this study we assume that all storage change during a time step occurs as soil moisture change runoff q is defined by rearranging eq 1 2 q p aet δs δt we define q as the storage adjusted runoff equal at all times to q δs δt and also p aet eq 3 3 q q δs δt p aet q is used in preference to q in our framework because it explicitly indicates the relative importance of actual runoff q and soil moisture change δs δt in the overall hu response to changing p and et conditions during a time step for example q may assume negative values on a transient basis during seasonal or longer term dry periods when aet is greater than p and the excess aet demand is met by depletion of soil moisture runoff q alone by contrast must always be greater than or equal to zero and therefore provides less information about the response of the hu during dry periods a similar situation pertains during wet periods when the importance of soil moisture accretion relative to q can be discerned finally q p aet and is therefore mathematically complementary to water cycle intensity as will be described further below second we define the water cycle intensity wci as 4 wci p aet where all terms are averaged across a landscape unit over a specified time step of any duration in l t units our definition of wci is applicable at any temporal scale e g sub daily to multi decadal or spatial scale for which observed or simulated values of p and aet are available wci mathematically complements runoff the most widely used hydrologic indicator of water cycle response to climate change whereas storage adjusted runoff q quantifies the difference between the two drivers of the water cycle p and aet wci quantifies their sum this enables a coupled graphical representation of the overall response of the water cycle to climate change at a landscape unit of interest fig 1 a b our definition of intensity as the sum of system inflow and outflow derives from an analogous intensity indicator in the water use literature weiskel et al 2007 it should be noted that wci is both similar to and distinct from the hydroclimatic intensity hy int indicator of giorgi et al 2011 defined as follows hy int int dsl where int the mean annual p intensity on wet days for a given year normalized to the long term average p intensity for the period of record and dsl the mean annual dry spell length for a given year in days normalized to the long term average dry spell length for the period of record days with p 1 mm are considered wet days with p 1 mm are considered dry hy int is useful for quantifying changes in precipitation intensity and the length of intervening dry spells relative to a selected period of record increases in both of these variables are considered likely meteorological consequences of long term atmospheric warming giorgi et al 2014 hegerl et al 2015 im et al 2016 like hy int wci is also expected to be sensitive to coupled changes in both p and aet especially if a short time scale daily to hourly is used in the quantification of p and aet wci differs from hy int in using l t units in its complementary relationship to runoff also expressed in l t units and in its applicability at a wide range of temporal scales sub daily to multi decadal finally we introduce the concept of the local hydroclimatic regime defined as the particular combination of p and aet that characterizes the climate of a landscape unit over a time step of interest the landscape units are geospatially explicit for example the topographically defined 2 through 8 digit hydrologic units hus of the conus seaber et al 1987 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml huc250k xml landscape units may also be defined using high resolution landscape grids like those used in our demonstration below daly et al 2008 for data see http prism oregonstate edu a local hydroclimatic regime may be represented graphically by its p aet position on a two dimensional p vs aet plotting space fig 1a when p aet e g fig 1a point 1 q p aet is 0 and the regime will plot on or to the left of the p aet line when aet p during the annual dry season or during droughts a regime will plot to the right of this line under these conditions aet in excess of p is supplied strictly by depletion of soil moisture during the time step that is q 0 q p aet δs δt and δs δt 0 for the sake of simplicity in this initial presentation of the wci framework the present study relies upon a finely discretized water balance model forced only by local precipitation soil moisture storage and temperature see section 3 below for this reason we use the term local hydroclimatic regime inflows to a landscape unit from external human and natural sources such as irrigation imports and natural surface water and groundwater inflows weiskel et al 2007 2014 are excluded from consideration we recognize that irrigation imports and natural inflows can affect evapotranspiration fluxes and wci in moisture limited environments weiskel et al 2014 examples include portions of western china xue et al 2017 and the conus lo and famiglietti 2013 future applications of our intensity framework could address this limitation by explicitly incorporating irrigation imports and natural inflows into the landscape water balance eq 1 together with remotely sensed or model based evapotranspiration estimates e g jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 for time periods when this information is available 2 2 characterizing hydrologic response to climate change temporal change in a local hydroclimatic regime from time period t1 to time period t2 is represented on the plotting space by a vector connecting the regime at t1 to the regime at t2 see examples a b and c fig 1b the components of this change vector are δp and δaet and they may be positive negative or zero moreover as is clear from eqs 3 and 4 q and wci are each distinct functions of the two variables p and aet when graphed q p aet is a plane that increases from the lower right to the upper left corner of the p aet space fig 1b blue contours q is negative to the right of the p aet line zero along this line and positive to the left of the line the wci p aet plane increases from a minimum value of zero at the origin to high positive values at the upper right fig 1b red contours the gradients of the q and wci planes are equal in magnitude and orthogonal to each other the complementary relation between δq and δwci facilitates a deeper understanding of hydrologic response to climate change for example change in climate represented by δp and δaet has two potential consequences for the local hydrology change in storage adjusted runoff q and change in wci both of these changes occur in the vertical z dimension of fig 1b indicated by the blue and red contours of q and wci respectively moreover both changes can be represented without distortion on the p vs aet plane of the regime space because the gradients of the q and wci planes are equal and orthogonal to each other the vectors δq and δwci fig 1b indicate the respective magnitudes of change in storage adjusted runoff and water cycle intensity and together express the overall hydrologic response of the hu to changes in p and aet 3 methods monthly temperature and p data provided on a 4 kilometer km by 4 km grid for the period january 1895 through december 2014 were obtained from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism dataset daly et al 2008 for data see http prism oregonstate edu prism uses location elevation coastal proximity topographic factors and orographic effectiveness of the terrain in regression analysis to interpolate grid cell temperature and p between meteorological stations daly et al 2008 temperature and p data for all grid cells in the conus 481 639 prism grid cells were used as input to a monthly time step water balance model to estimate monthly δq where δq is defined as the flow per unit area delivered from each grid cell to streams and rivers in units of mm per month the water balance model used in this study reflects hydroclimatic concepts originally developed by thornthwaite 1948 1957 this model has been enhanced over the decades the updated version used in this study is described by mccabe and wolock 2011a b model parameters inputs and outputs for this updated version may be obtained at https doi org 10 5066 f71v5cwn the only inputs to the model are monthly time step temperature and precipitation the model includes concepts of water supply precipitation and demand potential evapotranspiration pet which is estimated from temperature and latitude seasonality in supply and demand snow accumulation and melt and soil moisture storage the hamon pet equation hamon 1961 is used to estimate pet because this model only requires inputs of monthly temperature it can be widely applied in both time and space as temperature data are available for many sites and for long periods of time the hamon pet equation has been evaluated and compared with a number of other models and is considered to provide reliable monthly pet estimates federer et al 1996 vörösmarty et al 1998 lu et al 2005 in a study of five pet models for use with global water balance models federer et al 1996 found that hamon pet estimates agreed with estimates from other models across a wide range of climates in addition vörösmarty et al 1998 compared 11 different pet models for a wide range of climatic conditions across the conterminous u s and found that hamon pet estimates were similar to more input detailed models there are certain limitation in the use of the hamon s pet equation because it does not account for long term trends in radiation wild 2009 relative humidity willett et al 2008 and wind speed mcvicar et al 2012 variation in pet resulting from trends in these climate variables may explain part of the scatter in the relation between measured versus modeled aet shown in fig s2 however milly and dunne 2017 showed little variability in mean pet aet or runoff among several models including hamon over the 20th and early 21st centuries suggesting that more complex models that incorporate more climate variables made little difference another recent analysis has suggested that the use of energy only pet estimation may be advisable to avoid pet change biases such as overestimation of anthropogenic climate change drying milly and dunne 2016 additionally given the scarcity of long term observational data and uncertainties inherent in spatial interpolations we believe that hamon s pet equation is the most appropriate choice for pet when using the wb model across conus in the water balance model monthly temperature also is used to determine the proportions of monthly p that are rain and snow precipitation that is snow is accumulated in a snow pack and snow melt also is computed using a temperature threshold method rainfall is used to compute direct q aet soil moisture storage recharge and surplus which eventually becomes q when the sum of rainfall and snow melt for a month is less than pet aet is equal to the sum of rainfall snow melt and the amount of moisture that can be removed from the soil the fraction of soil moisture storage that can be removed as aet decreases linearly with decreasing soil moisture storage that is water becomes more difficult to remove from the soil as the soil becomes drier and less moisture is available for aet when the sum of rainfall and snow melt exceeds pet in a given month aet is equal to pet water in excess of pet replenishes soil moisture storage when soil moisture storage exceeds capacity during a given month the excess water becomes surplus and eventually becomes q for additional details of the water balance model see mccabe and markstrom 2007 as previously noted the water balance model parameters used for this study were taken from parameter sets developed in previous studies mccabe and wolock 2011a mccabe and wolock 2011b the parameter set includes 1 a parameter that specifies the fraction of monthly p that becomes direct q 2 temperature thresholds that determine the proportions of monthly p that are rain and or snow 3 a snow melt factor that controls the melt rate of the snow pack and 4 a parameter that specifies how much surplus in a month becomes q each of the aforementioned parameters is assumed not to vary across space that is only a single value for each parameter is specified everywhere only soil moisture storage capacity varied spatially this parameter was computed using the available water capacity values from the state soil geographic data base statsgo dataset and by assuming a one meter rooting depth for data see http soils usda gov survey geography statsgo the water balance model has been evaluated and verified in several previous studies mccabe and wolock 2008 gray and mccabe 2010 mccabe and wolock 2011a mccabe and wolock 2011b to complement previous verifications of the water balance model we performed an additional verification of the reliability of the water balance model for this study for the analyses in this study we use prism derived annual p and water balance estimated mean annual aet for the computation of wci therefore we performed an evaluation of the ability of the water balance model to estimate mean annual aet and q because measured aet data are not available for many locations nor for long records based on the assumption that mean annual aet is equal to mean annual p minus mean annual q aet p q we compared aet computed using measured mean annual p minus measured mean annual q aetm with aet computed using measured mean annual p minus water balance estimated mean annual q aetwb we also compared measured mean annual q qm with water balance estimated mean annual q qwb this verification involved the use of measured p measured q and water balance estimated aet and q because water balance estimated aet and q solely are driven by climatic factors a verification of the water balance model required measured q from basins that are largely free of anthropogenic effects such as reservoir operations diversion irrigation withdrawals etc we used measured q and p from a set of basins in the conus identified as having minimal anthropogenic influences gages ii dataset falcone 2011 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml gagesii sept2011 xml from these basins we selected 256 basins that have complete data for the period 1951 through 2015 fig s1 the 256 basins cover a range of sizes and climatic and physiographic regions across the conterminous u s table s1 results indicated a correlation between aetm and aetwb for all 256 sites of 0 80 p 0 01 with a bias mean aetwb minus mean aetm of 13 mm a percent bias bias mean aetm 100 of 2 1 and a nash sutcliffe statistic of 0 63 fig s2 for q the comparison between measured and estimated values indicated a correlation of 0 98 a bias of 13 mm a percent bias of 2 1 and a nash sutcliffe statistic of 0 97 these results indicate that the water balance model reliably estimates mean annual aet and q for the 256 sites details on the model its limitations and goodness of fit measures are described in mccabe and wolock 2011a monthly climatic and water balance output data were aggregated to compute the average annual temperature p aet q and δs δt during two 30 yr time periods 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 to facilitate plotting differences between these periods at the 4 km grid spatial scale of the prism data these periods were chosen because they characterize the first and last 30 years of the 70 yr historical record that we chose to investigate and because they are comparable to the 30 yr climate normals that the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa uses to characterize average climate the 4 km data were aggregated to larger spatial scales to permit regional analyses specifically the conus 4 km data were aggregated to the 2 109 8 digit hydrologic unit huc 8 and the 18 2 digit huc 2 spatial scales seaber et al 1987 for data see https water usgs gov gis metadata usgswrd xml huc250k xml to better characterize the temporal changes in these climate variables at regional spatial scale we also performed a clustering analysis to reduce the 2109 8 digit hu time series in conus to a small number with similar temporal variability in wci the clustering method used was based on correlations between time series of wci i e p aet for each 8 digit hu a correlation threshold of 0 5 was used to perform the initial grouping of the time series into clusters clusters that included at least 100 hus 5 of all sites were retained for additional clustering steps because hierarchical clustering methods can include observations in one cluster early in the clustering process that better fit into another cluster an additional step was used to improve the clustering of the wci time series this step involved computing the correlation of the time series of wci for each hu with the mean wci time series for each cluster additionally in this step the time series for all hus were ultimately assigned to the cluster with which they were most highly correlated even if the correlation was below the threshold of 0 5 used in the initial clustering process the clustering process resulted in 9 clusters fig 2 for the most part the clusters are geographically coherent and were similar to that reported by mccabe and wolock 2016 for runoff efficiency in the conus for each cluster the median of the correlation values between the hu time series of wci and the mean wci time series for each cluster ranged between 0 69 and 0 74 with the 25th percentile of the distribution of correlations for all clusters above 0 59 and the 75th percentile of the correlations above 0 76 fig 3 additionally almost all of the correlations for each cluster are statistically significant at a 99 percent confidence level after completing the clustering process mean time series of annual wci temperature p and aet were computed for each cluster and analyzed for two time periods 1945 to 2014 and 1900 to 2014 we then used the nonparametric mann kendall test for the presence of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend and reported the nonparametric sen s slope for linear trends salmi 2002 for climate variables for each cluster 4 results and discussion average annual p increased in most of the conus with the exception of the southeast and parts of the northwest between the two time periods of 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 the largest increases in p were in the northeast and central u s and the largest decreases were in the coastal northwest southeastern u s and northern idaho fig 4 a the location of all states in the conus are shown in the supporting information fig s3 the spatial pattern of increasing and decreasing p over time is similar to the pattern shown in peterson et al 2013 in spite of the substantially different time periods and differences in datasets the exception is coastal oregon and washington that do not show decreasing trends in peterson et al 2013 for 1909 2008 but do show decreasing trends in our study comparing 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 the spatial pattern of changes in precipitation over time trends are broadly consistent with jung et al 2013 including decreases in coastal pacific northwest jung et al 2013 covered a similar time period 1951 2010 but was based on a set of 255 discrete catchments average annual aet also increased over most of conus between the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 generally increasing in areas where p had increased fig 4b c the spatial pattern of changes in aet were broadly similar with jung et al 2013 apart from areas in the southeastern u s where there were only a few small catchments in the jung et al dataset increases in aet were greatest in new mexico and parts of west texas and west central oklahoma and adjacent south central kansas and parts of the dakotas decreases in aet were greatest in the southeast particularly in georgia northern florida north and south carolina and arkansas areas of decreasing aet were also present in most western states sun et al 2016 project similar spatial patterns of change in et for conus from 1979 to 2007 to 2031 2060 using an ecohydrological model and dynamically downscaled climate data of the hadcm3 model under the ipcc sres a2 emission scenario annual average pet derived from surface air temperature also increased over most of conus between these two 30 yr time periods fig 4c however in general in the humid northeastern united states p increased substantially more in magnitude than did pet fig 4a 4c in the southeastern united states p decreased substantially more in magnitude than pet increased in magnitude therefore in the eastern united states between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 the magnitude of the changes in p were much greater than the changes in pet the increases in pet over most of conus show a lack of spatial coherence with changes in aet fig 4b c this indicates the importance of change in p compared with changes in pet temperature in explaining observed changes in aet this finding is also consistent with the fact that between the two 30 yr periods 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 aet was moisture limited under moisture limited conditions the budyko hypothesis as recently interpreted by yang et al 2006 indicates that increases in p should result in increases in aet the relative importance of changes in p compared with changes in pet for explaining changes in aet is also consistent with teuling et al 2009 teuling et al 2009 found that trends in radiation global dimming and brightening are expected to impact et only in regions where et correlates with radiation e g central europe but not in north america where the correlation is weak average annual wci increased over most of conus between the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 with a spatial pattern similar to that of p fig 4d the exception is that increases in wci in parts of western texas new mexico and north and south dakota appear to be more closely related to patterns of change in aet fig 4b the spatial coherence and the similarity in magnitudes of changes in wci overall compared with the substantially smaller changes in aet indicate that the changes in wci were mostly associated with changes in p a p associated increase in wci where aet also increases e g most of new england and parts of the upper midwest southern kansas and northcentral oklahoma is consistent with example a1 a2 fig 1b similarly a p associated decrease in wci where both p and aet decrease e g southeastern u s and coastal northwestern u s would be consistent with example b1 b2 fig 1b the spatial coherence in these wci changes is evident when changes in p and aet are plotted for the individual 8 digit hus within the various 2 digit hu water resource regions fig 5 for example most of the 8 digit hus in the northeast hus 01 and 02 fig 5b experienced relatively large increases in p and smaller increases in aet by contrast most of the 8 digit hus in the southeast hu 03 experienced more variable changes fig 5b with a relatively small net decrease in both p and aet overall fig 5c fig 5c shows the mean vectors of change for hus 01 and 02 03 and 13 where the vectors terminate at the average δp and δaet values note the difference in scale between fig 5b and c in new mexico and extreme west texas hu 13 increases in aet were strongly controlled by available moisture accordingly increases in aet were nearly equivalent to increases in p this resulted in strong increases in wci except for 8 digit hus in the rio grande headwaters in south central colorado fig 5b and c these headwater hus plot above the set of points clustered along the p aet line less commonly some areas of the conus show a decrease in p and an increase in aet e g parts of south florida upper peninsula michigan fig 4a b that correspond to example c1 c2 fig 1b these latter areas are examples where wci is decreasing due to larger decreases in p than increases in aet over most of the conus the change in p has had more influence on the change in wci than has change in aet this is shown by comparing the ratio of the changes in p to the changes in aet over the two time periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 fig s4 changes in p have been particularly important in the coastal northwest where large decreases in p have resulted in large decreases in wci by contrast mountainous areas in the northeast and many areas in the midwest have experienced large increases in p that resulted in large increases in wci in some of the areas where aet has had more influence than p on the change in wci parts of new mexico west texas and north and south dakota wci increased because the increase in aet was greater than the increase in p or in some cases the decrease in p in other areas where aet has had more influence than p on the change in wci parts of arizona kansas and southern georgia wci decreased decreases in average july through september soil moisture storage δs δt between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 fig 6 storage adjusted runoff q fig s5 or both indicate a potential for aridification in some regions of the western and southeastern conus drying can result from decreases in p or increases in aet and will depend on the seasonal pattern of decreases in p the seasonality of changes in p will affect the relative magnitude of the q and soil moisture responses for example if decreases in p are primarily in summer months soil moisture will likely decrease more than if decreases in p occur primarily in winter thirty year average soil moisture in july through september decreased between 1945 and 1974 and 1985 to 2014 in the range of 10 to 87 mm in some areas of western and southeastern u s and in the northernmost midwest fig 6 decreases in soil moisture would most likely occur in summer months in areas where aet increases drawing down soil moisture and precipitation does not increase the spatial pattern of decreasing soil moisture storage is broadly consistent with a recent study of long term 1893 2013 trends in aridity over conus that also found increasing aridity in the western united states and along the southeastern atlantic coast and decreasing aridity in the northeast and midwest finkel et al 2016 the spatial pattern of trends in soil moisture storage is largely consistent with the trends in the palmer drought severity index for 1950 2008 sheffield et al 2012 where the largest increases are observed in the southeastern northwestern and extreme upper midwestern u s and decreases are observed in the northeastern and much of the midwestern u s increased aridity in these areas is also consistent with a recent global analysis of trends in p pet during 1948 to 2008 that showed expansion of drylands feng and fu 2013 an ensemble of climate model projections has indicated that increasing temperature will become progressively more important than changes in p in further expansion of drylands in the western conus feng and fu 2013 whereas our analysis shows that decreases in p are more important than increases in aet in explaining drying decrease in soil moisture storage i e negative δs δt between the two time periods evaluated climate modeling suggests that temperature driven increases in aet are likely to become more important in the future change in p is driving the change in aridity over most of conus as is evident from the map of the absolute value of the ratio of δp to δaet fig s4 for example in new england northern missouri iowa and southern wisconsin δp is substantially larger than δaet these large increases in p fig 4a result in decreased aridity fig 6 in the coastal pacific northwest there were large decreases in p fig 4a and relatively small changes in aet fig 4a b resulting in large increases in aridity by contrast in parts of western texas new mexico central oklahoma and southern kansas there were modest increases in p fig 4a accompanied by somewhat larger increases in aet fig 4b resulting in a modest increase in aridity fig 6 in southern georgia δaet was also greater than δp but in this case aet decreased resulting in an increase in aridity average annual storage adjusted runoff q increased between the two periods of 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 in most of the eastern conus with the exception of many parts of the southeast and northwest fig s5 most areas in the western united states showed little change in q with the exception of part of the northwest and the upper peninsula michigan where there were large decreases in p fig 4a and q fig s5 temporal trends in climate variables for clusters fig 2 with similar temporal variability in wci for the period 1945 2014 table 1 were broadly geographically consistent with differences between the 1945 1974 and 1985 2014 time periods that were shown in fig 4 for p all clusters showed increasing trends except in the northwest c 1 and the southeast c 9 but the increases were significant in only the northeast c 8 and the upper midwest c 4 similarly aet increased in all clusters except the southeast and the trends were significant in only the northeast upper midwest and in montana wyoming western and central dakotas c 3 trends in wci followed the same patterns as trends in p and aet as with p negative trends were observed for wci in the southeast and northwest although these trends were not significant temperature increased in all clusters except the southeast and central conus c 7 and trends were significant in northwest c 1 southwest c 2 and montana wyoming western and central dakotas c 3 annual average soil moisture storage generally increased except in the northwest c 1 and the southeast c 9 but the increases were significant only in the upper midwest c 4 average soil moisture storage in june july and august decreased in the northwest southeast southwest and montana wyoming western and central dakotas but the decreases were only significant in the northwest summer soil moisture increased but not significantly in the other clusters analysis of longer term trends 1900 2014 for these clusters indicate very similar geographic patterns as the 1945 2014 period but the trends were found to be increasing significantly in more than twice as many of the clusters and p values were lower table 2 six of the 9 clusters had significantly increasing wci for 1900 2014 over the longer time period p and wci increased though not significantly in the northwest and southeast whereas trends in these variables since 1945 were decreasing in these clusters average annual soil moisture storage increased in all clusters except in the northwest c 1 and southwest c 2 and the increases were significant in the upper midwest c 4 texas southern oklahoma eastern new mexico c 6 and central conus c 7 soil moisture storage in june july and august decreased in clusters 1 2 3 8 and 9 significantly in the southwest c 2 and increased in clusters 4 5 6 and 7 but none of the increasing trends were significant given the complexity of the climate system and the dependence on the specific time period over which trends are assessed it is not surprising that there are major differences in trends between the two periods 1900 2014 and 1945 2014 that were analyzed tracking the evolution of wci over a specific region and simulating future climate and wci with a suite of gcms known to have skill in reproducing historical trends could be a practical way to gain insight into the range of future changes in hydrologic conditions likely to occur in a region of interest 5 conclusion we define a new indicator of water cycle intensity wci based on the terrestrial water balance equation we then describe its mathematical relation to runoff and soil moisture change and demonstrate the relevance of the indicator for the continental united states in regions where the water cycle is intensifying δwci 0 or weakening δwci 0 the causes may be examined by analyzing the sign and magnitude of changes in its constituent variables p and aet monitoring wci over time could provide information on the sign magnitude interannual variability and persistence of hydroclimatic change and may indicate areas that are particularly vulnerable if these changes persist in the 21st century in areas where wci is increasing due primarily to increases in p and where there are corresponding increases in storage adjusted runoff q there may be increased risk of flooding erosion landslides and pests and pathogens that thrive in more humid conditions in areas where changes in p and aet indicate long term decreases in q and soil moisture storage aridification is indicated ongoing aridification could increase the risk of fire in forest and shrublands reduced productivity of croplands and grasslands loss of perennial streams and associated ecosystems and increased demand for irrigation acknowledgments primary funding for this work
