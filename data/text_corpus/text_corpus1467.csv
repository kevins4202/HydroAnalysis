7335,urban runoff negatively impacts the receiving streams and different solutions have been proposed in literature to limit the effect of urbanization on the water balance these solutions suggest to manage urban runoff in order to switch from a post development river hydrograph high peak and short duration back again to a pre development hydrograph low peak and high duration combined sewer overflows csos represent severe pollutant sources for receiving streams due to the combination of first flush of roads and sewers and black water conveyed by combined sewer systems constructed wetlands for cso treatment cso cws are adopted with increasing frequency for reducing pollutant inputs to streams moreover these systems exhibit the characteristic to behave similarly to ponds wetlands and bioretention systems that provide flood mitigation by decreasing the intensity of peak flows this work aims to show the additional ecosystem service provided by cso cws in term of limitation of the hydraulic impact of cso on stream hydrograph a mathematical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real case study situated in gorla maggiore italy which includes vertical flow subsurface beds vf as first stage and a free water surface bed fws as second stage the model simulates the unsaturated flow within vf and the accumulation of water on the top of vf and within fws results show a satisfactory lamination performance of the system for both single and up to 5 consecutive flood events with a peak flow reduction ranging from 52 7 to 95 4 withdrawn of flow rate from the river in order to cope with long dry period does not significantly affect the lamination performances the considered cso cw exhibits an excellent lamination efficiency also during more intense floods events with a peak flow reduction of 86 2 for a cso event with return period of 10 years the flow rate frequency density function determined by the cso cw is more shifted towards lower values compared to untreated csos these results indicate that cso cws work properly in terms of reduction of cso urbanization impact on stream hydrology keywords constructed wetland combined sewer overflow flood mitigation flood reduction sustainable urban drainage system ecosystem service 1 introduction the increase of impervious surfaces in urban catchments during the last century has deeply changed the water balance of these areas reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration and dramatically increasing the volume of urban runoff and the discharge of wastewater woods ballard et al 2015 in order to limit the environmental impact of urbanization on water balance different practices have been proposed in literature under different terms including sustainable urban drainage systems suds water sensitive urban design wsud best management practices bmps or low impact development lid fletcher et al 2014 despite different nomenclatures all these approaches share the concept that a proper sustainable management of urban runoff is mandatory to preserve the receiving water body fletcher et al 2013 the adoption of such approaches is important because urban runoffs are characterized by short events with high peak flows which may cause problems such as downstream flooding streambank erosion and stream downcutting if directly discharged in a stream fletcher et al 2013 liu et al 2014 hence it is important to promote sustainable drainage solutions for limiting the impact of urban runoff on rivers since they aim to modify the river hydrograph from a post development state high peak flow and short duration back again to a pre development one low peak flow and high duration as shown in fig 1 fletcher et al 2013 to this aim the proposed techniques can be divided in two groups retention type techniques attenuation of outflow and infiltration type techniques baseflow restoration palhegyi 2010 burns et al 2012 fletcher et al 2013 combined sewer systems are commonly used to drain both urban domestic wastewater and stormwater in a unified sewer channel network conveying a unique wastewater to an end of pipe centralized treatment plant e g barco et al 2008 however combined sewers cannot be designed to convey high discharges generated by rain events due to economic constraints hence combined sewer overflow cso infrastructures are installed in the combined sewer network to limit the amount of wastewater conveyed during rain events guaranteeing good performances of the end of pipe wastewater treatment plant and avoiding flooding of urban area meyer et al 2013 usually csos are directly discharged in receiving water bodies strongly contributing to river pollution and to the so called urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 indeed a cso is affected both by a first flush effect deletic 1998 bach et al 2010 due to road and sewer washout and by a continuous input of pollutants from domestic wastewaters this situation leads to high organic nitrogen and suspended solids loads which need to be treated to preserve the river ecosystem barco et al 2008 additionally csos also pose concerns for their hydraulic impact on receiving streams as they are characterized by flood events with short durations and high peak flows in analogy with urban runoff from impervious catchments hence csos should be carefully managed also with sustainable practices for flood reduction according with recent multidisciplinary approaches e g ashley et al 2013 liquete et al 2016 constructed wetlands cws are a wastewater treatment technology that mimic physical chemical and biological processes occurring in natural wetlands to improve water quality vymazal 2011 due to low operation and maintenance costs cws are recently starting to be considered as a valuable technique to treat in loco csos before discharging into streams different schemes are reported in literature from extensive solutions based on free water surface systems proposed in usa tao et al 2014 to more compact vertical subsurface systems tested in europe meyer et al 2013 particularly three european approaches are identified by meyer et al 2013 i sedimentation tank plus vertical retention sand filters in germany uhl and dittmer 2005 ii alternate feeding vertical flow systems in france pálfy et al 2017a iii vertical subsurface flow plus free water surface system in italy masi et al 2017 hence constructed wetlands for combined sewer overflow cso cws are designed to provide an important ecosystem service in terms of river water quality defense against urban environmental impact due to the cso cw removal efficiencies of organic and nitrogen loads pathogens and micropollutants tondera et al 2013 tondera 2017 pálfy et al 2017a masi et al 2017 beside preserving water quality cso cws also provide other ecosystem services such as flood mitigation biodiversity increase and social aggregation opportunities around green areas liquete et al 2016 masi et al 2017 the aim of this study is to focus on one of these additional ecosystem services i e flood reduction cso data are collected from a real case study to be the input of a new a mathematical model in this way we simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real cso cw investigating the cso cw effectiveness on flood mitigation the aim is to show that from a hydraulic point of view cso cws provide similar benefits of wetlands or ponds used for sustainable drainage of urban runoff woods ballard et al 2015 contributing to return to a pre development river hydrograph fletcher et al 2013 liu et al 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the case study is located at gorla maggiore in northern italy 46 n 9 e fig 2 a the cso cw has been designed to fulfill different multidisciplinary goals masi et al 2017 i treating first flush according to lombardia region law requirements 50 m3 per hectare of impervious surface of catchment served by the sewer network ii partially treating also cso volumes higher than first flush called second flush iii storing the second flush for hydraulic protection of the receiving stream olona river iv increasing biodiversity iv providing area for recreation the impervious surface interested by the sewer and the first flush volume have been estimated by the designers in 20 hectares and 987 m3 respectively as to second flush a cso flood hydrograph for a rain event with a return period of 10 years was estimated during the design phase to this aim designers assumed a chicago hyetograph with duration equal to three times the concentration time of the drained area 38 min and peak flow occurring at 40 of the total duration the estimated 10 year return period flood hydrograph is characterized by peak flow duration and volume of 3480 ls 1 2 2 h and 10 712 m3 respectively the cso cw has been designed according to the scheme shown in fig 2 which includes meyer et al 2013 masi et al 2017 i four vertical subsurface flow vf cws designed for treating first flush up to 640ls 1 ii a free water surface flow fws cw with multiple aims of post treatment of first flush treatment of second flush up to 3500 ls 1 and hydraulic buffering tank iii a weir to discharge treated cso water volumes to the olona river from the fws before being introduced into the system wastewater is also pre treated with a mechanical bar screen and a grit chamber design parameters minimum residence times and minimum horizontal velocity at maximum flow rate equal to 90 s and 0 4 m s respectively to remove floating materials and grit the vf beds have been designed according to the so called french type approach morvannou et al 2013 i e a highly permeable filtering medium gravel planted with phragmitas australis in which filtration constitutes the main removal process the average depth of each vf bed is 0 62 m with a maximum ponding water depth of 0 2 m and surface area with size 30x31 m corresponding to a total area of 3720 m2 an evenly feeding distribution over the vf surface area of influent cso volume is realized with small concrete channels along the length of the bed and equally spaced with a span of 5 m this prevents the risk of preferential horizontal flow in case of low influent load fed by a single pipe at one side of the bed as recently observed by pálfy et al 2017c the average depth of the fws is 0 6 m for a corresponding area of 3174 m2 which is reduced to 2380 m2 when plants are excluded i e fraction of volume occupied by water in fws assumed equal to 0 75 kadlec and wallace 2009 during intense flood events the fws area is extended up to 7200 m2 and a maximum height of 1 7 m is reached maximum additional storage volume of 7920 m3 both vf and fws stages are regulated with sluice gates and are equipped with overflow weirs towards the fws and the olona river respectively the sluice gates are designed to maintain a permanent water layer both within the vf beds and in the fws in order to avoid complete drying and to support the ecological habitat during low rainfall periods the sluice gate of vf beds is realized with a throttle valve positioned on the outlet pipe limiting the effluent pipe area in order to guarantee the design effluent flow rate the cso cw was designed also to be included in a park for recreational activities therefore the designers have decided to feed the fws with a portion of river discharge through an additional channel diverting a flow rate from the olona river in this way the risk of water stagnation of water and mosquito proliferation due to excessive et and long dry periods is avoided preserving the recreational potential of the park the diverted flow is limited to a maximum of 5 l s which is compatible with the ecological flow of the olona river and does not let work the fws as an additional flood area for the peak river flow the overall system including the flow diverted from the river to fed the fws works by gravity and the theoretical hydraulic retention time corresponds to 36 h 2 2 dataset the dataset used as input of the hydraulic model regards the cso flow rates registered at the gorla maggiore cso cw between march 2014 and august 2014 the cso flow rates were measured by an automatic sonar sensor with sampling frequency of 15 min the sampling period represents the six months of 2014 in which the cso cw of gorla maggiore has received most frequent cso events a total number of 70 cso peaks defined by a single raising and falling phase of flow with a minimum duration of 30 min have been registered in the analyzed period as shown in fig 3 this dataset includes single cso peaks with different durations volumes and peak flow rates and also cso events with a sequence of 2 to 5 consecutive cso peaks on the basis of these 70 peaks a statistical characterization of the cso peaks has been performed and the results are summarized in table 1 2 3 hydraulic model different models have been proposed and used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of cw for csos meyer and dittmer 2015 and pálfy et al 2017b developed two modelling tools to simulate german and french cw solutions to treat csos meyer et al 2013 called rsf and orage respectively these models simulate the flow dynamics of cso cws as a continuously stirred tank reactors in series the hydrus software package has been also used to simulate both german and french cso cw schemes henrichs et al 2007 2009 pálfy et al 2016 however all these modelling studies concentrated mainly on the simulation of pollutant removal moreover both german and french cso cw solutions use only subsurface flow cws meyer et al 2013 consequently none of the models are adequate to simulate the hybrid cso cw investigated by this work therefore a new hydraulic model has been developed to investigate the flood mitigation ecosystem service of the selected case study the hydraulic scheme of the vf beds is reported in fig 4 negligible delay from the beginning of cso event and the feeding of the cw is assumed i e no delay due to preliminary stages and feeding system first flush flow rate of cso events q cso 1 is considered uniformly distributed on the vf top and vertically flowing through the beds neglecting possible preferential flow at low flow rates the treated cso flow is collected at the bottom of the vf beds and sent to the fws q vf 1 a permanent water layer is maintained at the vf bottom with an outflow gate which firstly activates with a weir functioning only when water level within the vf increases over a threshold level h vf we the flow rate from the vf to the fws q vf 1 is calculated with a weir law q h 3 2 or a sluice gate law q h 1 2 for a water table level in the vf lower or higher than the sluice gate height respectively during severe flood events water can also pond at the top of the vf bed and activate the overflow towards the fws q vf 2 when the maximum ponding water height h pw max is reached the assumption of cso flow rate evenly distributed among the four vf beds allows us to consider a unique equivalent area a vf for all the vf beds the procedure to determine flow rate routing within the cso cw is now described the total cso flow rate q cso is divided into first and second flush as follows 1 q cso 1 q cso q cso q cso lim q cso lim q cso q cso lim 2 q cso 2 0 q cso q cso lim q cso q cso lim q cso q cso lim where q cso lim is the cso flow rate limit value to activate the second flush and q cso 2 is the second flush the water flow is assumed one dimensional for vf beds which are modeled as a uniform layer the vertical infiltration rate q is modeled according to the darcy s law for unsaturated flow bear and cheng 2010 3 q k s e φ z where k s e is the hydraulic conductivity s e θ θ r θ s θ r is the effective saturation φ ψ z is the piezometric head ψ is the pressure head z is the the elevation and θ θ r and θ s are the actual the residual and the saturated water content of the porous medium respectively the saturated water content θ s is assumed to be equal to the vf porosity the van genuchten 1980 formulation is assumed for the water retention curve θ ψ and for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k s e 4 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ n m ψ 0 θ s ψ 0 5 k k s s e 0 5 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 h

neglected due to the installation of aeration pipes within vf beds the deposit layer molle et al 2006 morvannou et al 2013 typical of french type vf used for domestic wastewater is here neglected due to no continuous feeding and sand removal from the pre treatment stages the spatio temporal distributions of q s e and ψ in response to cso events are obtained resolving the water mass balance equation i e the richards equation bear and cheng 2010 6 θ t q z where root water uptake is not considered due to the short duration of the cso events similarly to the approaches used to simulate runoff from saturated soils e g van dam and feddes 2000 different boundary conditions are assigned at the vf top to simulate the switch between complete infiltration and water ponding 7 vf top bound

q vf 2 a vf q z h vf where q vf 2 is the overflow flow rate towards fws which occurs when h pw equals the maximum ponding water depth h pw max the simplified geometry considered for the fws is shown in fig 4 when the water volume stored in the fws is larger than a threshold value v 1 an additional area around the central part of the fws is flooded thus increasing the buffering capacity of the system in this way the buffer tank functioning of the fws during intense cso events is properly simulated by the model fws influent loads are given by gate and overflow effluent vf flow rates q vf 1 and q vf 2 respectively cso second flush q cso 2 and the flow rate from the river to feed the fws during long dry periods q r the fws effluent is controlled by a weir sluice gate q fws 1 and by a safety weir overflow q fws 2 the effluent gate and the safety weir overflow activate only when the fws level h exceeds the corresponding limit heights h 1 and h 2 the weir sluice gate functioning allows both to maintain a permanent water layer for a proper ecological fws functioning kadlec and wallace 2009 and to reduce the cso hydraulic impact on the receiving river by attenuating the peak flow discharge the volume v that is stored within the fws is simulated by solving the following zero dimensional mass balance equation 10 dv dt q vf 1 q vf 2 q cso 2 q r q et q fws 1 q fws 2 and the fws water level is found as 11 h v a 1 v v 1 v 1 a 1 v v 1 a 2 v v 1 where a 1 and a 2 are the projected areas corresponding to the two volumes v 1 and v 2 v v 1 into which the fws is divided fig 4 to

2 5 simulation strategy and parameter assumptions the effectiveness of the cso cw on flood reduction is investigated as follows a the response to a single representative cso peak is simulated to show the cso cw hydraulic behavior and attenuation capacity in normal conditions b up to five consecutive cso peaks each one equal to the representative cso peak are simulated to investigate the cso cw capability to attenuate cso hydrographs under more stressful conditions c the supply of diverted river flow to face the evapotranspiration of fws during long dry periods is accounted to estimate the effect on cso hydrograph attenuation of this design option d the 10 year return period cso event is simulated to verify the cso cw lamination efficiency under flood condition e the response to the cso time series observed between march 2014 and august 2014 i e all the 70 cso peaks registered comprehensive of the corresponding dry periods is simulated to estimate the dynamic behavior of the overall attenuation effect for each simulation values of the model parameters are set as reported in table 2 cw geometry and cso partitioning between first and second flush are set according to design values from the cso cw of gorla maggiore unsaturated flow parameters are assigned the values estimated from laboratory experiments on french vf systems developed by morvannou et al 2013 except for the residual water content which is obtained from the laboratory experiments proposed by fournel et al 2013 to reproduce the typical accumulation of material within pores of vf beds for cso treatment the limit value to consider the top of vf bed in saturated conditions s e lim is assumed equal to 0 999 to improve the numerical stability of the solver for sake of simplicity evapotranspiration and influent flow rate from river are separately investigated in section 3 3 and neglected in other simulations all simulations are performed with a finite element approach using comsol multiphysics software 3 results 3 1 single cso peak a statistical analysis of the cso events recorded between march 2014 and august 2014 is performed to identify the characteristics of a representative mean peak on the basis of the results resumed in table 1 a cso mean peak is defined the volume of the representative cso peak is assumed equal to the statistical mean of the 70 cso peaks i e 883 m3 as to the distribution of the cso volume we have assumed a triangular hydrograph with duration equal to the mean duration of cso peaks i e 2 4 h in order to be as mush similar as possible to the real sampled cso peaks the rising phase duration has been chosen shorter than the one of the falling phase both the rising and falling phases durations have been chosen according to the average rising and falling phases of the sampled cso peaks i e 38 and 62 respectively a simulation s 1 is run for a single cso mean peak in input to the cso cw the initial conditions are φ t 0 h vf we i e the vf beds are saturated in the bottom layer below the outflow gate and v t 0 v 1 for vf and fws respectively the spatio temporal profiles of effective saturation s e are presented in fig 5 the vf beds display the following filling draining behavior i a fast top down filling due to infiltration in unsaturated porous media during the rising phase of the cso hydrograph fig 5 left panel ii a fast bottom up saturation when the infiltrating water front reaches the saturated layer fig 5 central panel mainly driven by the outflow limitation of the sluice gate and similar to the filling mechanism of a simple tank iii a slow draining phase at the end of cso peak controlled by the flow rate from the outflow sluice gate fig 5 right panel these results elucidate the complex hydraulic behavior of the cso cw with the bed initially functioning as a storage tank whose filling is delayed by the time required by water to infiltrate within the empty unsaturated porous medium the subsequent slow draining phase is designed to guarantee the required residence time for first flush treatment with a simultaneous benefit in terms of cso hydrograph attenuation as shown in fig 6 indeed the vf beds are able to satisfactorily attenuate a single cso mean peak fig 6 reducing peak flow by 95 4 of the inflow value increasing the hydrograph duration by a factor of 21 and storing 92 of the peak volume see a b c values in table 3 3 2 consecutive peaks four additional simulations denoted as s 2 to s 5 respectively are run by imposing a sequence of two to five consecutive cso mean peaks as inflow to the cso cw where the cso mean peak is set as defined in s 1 simulation initial conditions are maintained as in simulation s 1 this choice was made in accordance with the maximum number of consecutive cso peaks within a single cso event registered between march 2014 and august 2014 the presence of multiple consecutive peaks alters the cso cw functioning through the activation of the vf overflow q vf 2 as shown in fig 7 for five consecutive cso peaks s 5 temporal evolutions of outflow rates from vf and fws and accumulated water heights in the case of different consecutive cso peaks are pictured in fig 8 the high residence time requested to treat the cso first flush does not allow water from the first cso peak to be completely drained before the arrival of the next peak in this way the ponding water depth above vf beds h pw reaches its maximum value since the second cso peak fig 8 d causing a constant effluent flow rate from the vf outflow gate q vf 1 up to the end of the last cso event fig 8 a the second consecutive cso peak also activates the vf overflow q vf 2 discharging the majority of the influent cso water with no attenuation fig 8 b consequently the fws water depth h rapidly increases fig 8 e as well as the flow rate q fws 1 discharged by the cso cw to the receiving river fig 8 c although the occurrence of multiple cso peaks triggers vf overflow and increases fws effluent flow rate the cso hydrograph attenuation is very good as shown in fig 7 and resumed in fig 9 and table 3 the peak flow reduction ranges between 52 7 and 95 4 always remaining satisfactorily high fig 9 upper panel the cso hydrograph is quite prolonged even for five consecutive cso peaks with a duration that is 5 7 times longer than inflow loads fig 9 middle panel despite a decrease in relevance the vf beds are able to store 29 4 of the cso volume even in case of five consecutive peaks fig 9 lower panel at the same time the fws provides a remarkable storage capacity even for the most stressful case storage coefficient for simulation s 5 equal to 32 8 fig 9 lower panel resulting in a low volume discharged to the river without attenuation only 37 8 of un stored volume for simulation s 5 3 3 evapotranspiration and flow rate supply from the river the oscillation of water table in fws treatment plants is considered a positive characteristics of these systems it increases biodiversity and makes system behavior more similar to natural wetlands however the combination of a long dry period and high evapotranspiration et could reduce the fws water volume and increase stagnation compromising the ecosystem functioning and negatively affecting both fws treatment performance and recreational activity kadlec and wallace 2009 due to the aim of creating a park for recreational activity the designers opted for the additional feeding of fws with flow from the olona river in this section we investigate the effect of this option on cso hydrograph attenuation two additional simulations are performed with and without flow from the river both simulations include et and a long dry period before the cso event only the most stressful case is investigated i e five consecutive cso mean peaks s 5 et and s 5 et r for simulation without and with flow rate from the river respectively a constant flow rate of 5 l s is considered to be supplied from the river in s 5 et r in accordance with the design value the dry period is set equal to 27 days which corresponds to the duration of the longest period without precipitation registered between march 2014 to august 2014 a constant evapotraspiration rate of 8 3 mm d being this value assumed by the designers on the basis of the hargreaves formulation and of the climatic conditions at the site initial conditions are maintained as in simulation s 1 effluent flow rates from the cso cw system and fws water depths for simulations s 5 et and s 5 et r are reported in fig 10 and the resulting attenuation of the cso hydrograph is resumed in table 3 without water supply from the river the fws is able to store a larger water volume during the first part of the cso event due to the initially lower depth driven by et fig 10 upper panel however the maximum fws water level is almost the same for both s 5 et and s 5 et r fig 10 lower panel moreover the outflow discharge with the extra water supply from the river of simulation s 5 et r is very similar to the case of s 5 with neither river water uptake nor et consequently the cso hydrograph attenuation of s 5 and s 5 et r are very close table 3 these results indicate that the multiple aims of fws both biodiversity increase and recreational activities can be obtained through supply of flow rate from the river without compromising the efficiency in attenuating cso hydrograph 3 4 high return period event in order to understand the cso cw functioning during extreme rain event the design cso event for a return period of 10 years is used as influent load in a simulation denoted as s tr 10 outflow discharge rates from the cso cw system are displayed in fig 11 while coefficient values of cso hydrograph attenuation are resumed in table 3 as shown in fig 11 the flood event activates the second flush when the flow rate is higher than q lim 2 nd 640 l s however the maximum fws water depth reaches 167 cm and does not activate the fws overflow in accordance with the design expectations despite the critical conditions the cso cw exhibits a very good performance in cso hydrograph attenuation fig 11 with a peak flow reduction of 86 2 a 27 fold increase in hydrograph duration and a storage coefficient of 82 9 table 3 in term of stored water volumes the vf effect is lower than for other simulations but it is still not negligible with a storage of 12 of the inflow volume 3 5 observed time series of cso events the cso cw response to the time series of 70 cso peaks registered between march 2014 and august 2014 is simulated to perform a statistical analysis of the cso cw capability to attenuate cso hydrograph the time series and the frequency density function fdf of the cso flow rates are compared with those of the simulated outflow rates from the cso cw in fig 12 the cso cw system releases a smoother flow hydrograph to the river system that is closer to pre development conditions fig 12 left panel the beneficial effects of the cso cw are also highlighted by the comparison between fdfs fig 12 right panel with a shift toward lower flow values after attenuation moreover the fdf is more asymmetrical and skewed toward low flow values indicating a higher probability to have lower flow rate these results are quantitatively confirmed by the lower values of both mean 112 6 ls 1 and 14 4 ls 1 for cso and cso cw respectively and standard deviation 111 9 ls 1 and 23 9 ls 1 for cso and cso cw respectively of cso cw compared to cso confirming a reduction of the average flow rate discharged to the river promoted by cso cws 4 discussion and conclusions the proposed model simulates the hydraulic functioning of multistage hybrid cso cws providing a better comprehension of the system the model assumes a 1d approach following the richards equation which provides the advantages to simulate delay in filling of the porous media due to the initial unsaturated conditions of the beds future research is needed to compare the use of richards equation with a simpler zero dimensional mass balance equation approach to compare the possibility to simplify the model on the other hand the chosen approach assumes a evenly distribution of cso on the bed surface and neglects the possible preferential flows which can occur in vf systems morvannou et al 2013 a detailed data campaign is requested to verify the theoretical outcomes described in our work the mathematical model presented in this work can also be an interesting future tool for designers indeed the model can be used to quantitatively demonstrate the hydraulic detention capacity and show the internal hydraulic functioning of the considered system to public authorities and stakeholders helping to give confidence on the adequacy of cw for cso treatment wetland and ponds are well known sustainable urban drainage solutions adopted to attenuate the negative impact of urban runoff on receiving water bodies woods ballard et al 2015 although cso cws are designed to improve water quality by treating pollutant loads associated with cso events our work suggests that cso cws also provide a flood mitigation service similar to the one promoted by wetlands and ponds used to urban runoff control the investigated cso cw of gorla maggiore is able to smooth out single cso mean peaks reducing the peak flow by 95 increasing 21 times the event duration and temporarily storing 92 of the influent volume these benefits have been confirmed to hold for different stress conditions with a peak reduction of 53 and 86 for 5 consecutive cso mean peaks and for a cso event with a return period of 10 years respectively the cso cw modifies the frequency distribution of influent flow rates due to cso events increasing the occurrence of low flow rates released to the river the mean effluent flow rate is expected to pass from 113 112 ls 1 for cso to 14 24 ls 1 for cso cw the reduction of peak flows and the increased duration of flood events are expected to promote the restoration of pre development stream hydrograph in accordance with the aims of bioretention techniques used for urban runoff fletcher et al 2013 finally highlighting the advantage of employing cso cws for flood reduction besides for improvement of river water quality this work also stresses the opportunity for cw designers to follow a multidisciplinary approach which considers all the ecosystem services provided by cso cws liquete et al 2016 reynaud et al 2016 masi et al 2017 such as the reduction of the hydraulic impact of urbanization on the receiving stream caused by both cso flashiness and poor water quality acknowledgments the data used in this work have been collected under the openness project operationalisation of natural capital and ecosystem services www

7335,urban runoff negatively impacts the receiving streams and different solutions have been proposed in literature to limit the effect of urbanization on the water balance these solutions suggest to manage urban runoff in order to switch from a post development river hydrograph high peak and short duration back again to a pre development hydrograph low peak and high duration combined sewer overflows csos represent severe pollutant sources for receiving streams due to the combination of first flush of roads and sewers and black water conveyed by combined sewer systems constructed wetlands for cso treatment cso cws are adopted with increasing frequency for reducing pollutant inputs to streams moreover these systems exhibit the characteristic to behave similarly to ponds wetlands and bioretention systems that provide flood mitigation by decreasing the intensity of peak flows this work aims to show the additional ecosystem service provided by cso cws in term of limitation of the hydraulic impact of cso on stream hydrograph a mathematical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real case study situated in gorla maggiore italy which includes vertical flow subsurface beds vf as first stage and a free water surface bed fws as second stage the model simulates the unsaturated flow within vf and the accumulation of water on the top of vf and within fws results show a satisfactory lamination performance of the system for both single and up to 5 consecutive flood events with a peak flow reduction ranging from 52 7 to 95 4 withdrawn of flow rate from the river in order to cope with long dry period does not significantly affect the lamination performances the considered cso cw exhibits an excellent lamination efficiency also during more intense floods events with a peak flow reduction of 86 2 for a cso event with return period of 10 years the flow rate frequency density function determined by the cso cw is more shifted towards lower values compared to untreated csos these results indicate that cso cws work properly in terms of reduction of cso urbanization impact on stream hydrology keywords constructed wetland combined sewer overflow flood mitigation flood reduction sustainable urban drainage system ecosystem service 1 introduction the increase of impervious surfaces in urban catchments during the last century has deeply changed the water balance of these areas reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration and dramatically increasing the volume of urban runoff and the discharge of wastewater woods ballard et al 2015 in order to limit the environmental impact of urbanization on water balance different practices have been proposed in literature under different terms including sustainable urban drainage systems suds water sensitive urban design wsud best management practices bmps or low impact development lid fletcher et al 2014 despite different nomenclatures all these approaches share the concept that a proper sustainable management of urban runoff is mandatory to preserve the receiving water body fletcher et al 2013 the adoption of such approaches is important because urban runoffs are characterized by short events with high peak flows which may cause problems such as downstream flooding streambank erosion and stream downcutting if directly discharged in a stream fletcher et al 2013 liu et al 2014 hence it is important to promote sustainable drainage solutions for limiting the impact of urban runoff on rivers since they aim to modify the river hydrograph from a post development state high peak flow and short duration back again to a pre development one low peak flow and high duration as shown in fig 1 fletcher et al 2013 to this aim the proposed techniques can be divided in two groups retention type techniques attenuation of outflow and infiltration type techniques baseflow restoration palhegyi 2010 burns et al 2012 fletcher et al 2013 combined sewer systems are commonly used to drain both urban domestic wastewater and stormwater in a unified sewer channel network conveying a unique wastewater to an end of pipe centralized treatment plant e g barco et al 2008 however combined sewers cannot be designed to convey high discharges generated by rain events due to economic constraints hence combined sewer overflow cso infrastructures are installed in the combined sewer network to limit the amount of wastewater conveyed during rain events guaranteeing good performances of the end of pipe wastewater treatment plant and avoiding flooding of urban area meyer et al 2013 usually csos are directly discharged in receiving water bodies strongly contributing to river pollution and to the so called urban stream syndrome walsh et al 2005 indeed a cso is affected both by a first flush effect deletic 1998 bach et al 2010 due to road and sewer washout and by a continuous input of pollutants from domestic wastewaters this situation leads to high organic nitrogen and suspended solids loads which need to be treated to preserve the river ecosystem barco et al 2008 additionally csos also pose concerns for their hydraulic impact on receiving streams as they are characterized by flood events with short durations and high peak flows in analogy with urban runoff from impervious catchments hence csos should be carefully managed also with sustainable practices for flood reduction according with recent multidisciplinary approaches e g ashley et al 2013 liquete et al 2016 constructed wetlands cws are a wastewater treatment technology that mimic physical chemical and biological processes occurring in natural wetlands to improve water quality vymazal 2011 due to low operation and maintenance costs cws are recently starting to be considered as a valuable technique to treat in loco csos before discharging into streams different schemes are reported in literature from extensive solutions based on free water surface systems proposed in usa tao et al 2014 to more compact vertical subsurface systems tested in europe meyer et al 2013 particularly three european approaches are identified by meyer et al 2013 i sedimentation tank plus vertical retention sand filters in germany uhl and dittmer 2005 ii alternate feeding vertical flow systems in france pálfy et al 2017a iii vertical subsurface flow plus free water surface system in italy masi et al 2017 hence constructed wetlands for combined sewer overflow cso cws are designed to provide an important ecosystem service in terms of river water quality defense against urban environmental impact due to the cso cw removal efficiencies of organic and nitrogen loads pathogens and micropollutants tondera et al 2013 tondera 2017 pálfy et al 2017a masi et al 2017 beside preserving water quality cso cws also provide other ecosystem services such as flood mitigation biodiversity increase and social aggregation opportunities around green areas liquete et al 2016 masi et al 2017 the aim of this study is to focus on one of these additional ecosystem services i e flood reduction cso data are collected from a real case study to be the input of a new a mathematical model in this way we simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real cso cw investigating the cso cw effectiveness on flood mitigation the aim is to show that from a hydraulic point of view cso cws provide similar benefits of wetlands or ponds used for sustainable drainage of urban runoff woods ballard et al 2015 contributing to return to a pre development river hydrograph fletcher et al 2013 liu et al 2014 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the case study is located at gorla maggiore in northern italy 46 n 9 e fig 2 a the cso cw has been designed to fulfill different multidisciplinary goals masi et al 2017 i treating first flush according to lombardia region law requirements 50 m3 per hectare of impervious surface of catchment served by the sewer network ii partially treating also cso volumes higher than first flush called second flush iii storing the second flush for hydraulic protection of the receiving stream olona river iv increasing biodiversity iv providing area for recreation the impervious surface interested by the sewer and the first flush volume have been estimated by the designers in 20 hectares and 987 m3 respectively as to second flush a cso flood hydrograph for a rain event with a return period of 10 years was estimated during the design phase to this aim designers assumed a chicago hyetograph with duration equal to three times the concentration time of the drained area 38 min and peak flow occurring at 40 of the total duration the estimated 10 year return period flood hydrograph is characterized by peak flow duration and volume of 3480 ls 1 2 2 h and 10 712 m3 respectively the cso cw has been designed according to the scheme shown in fig 2 which includes meyer et al 2013 masi et al 2017 i four vertical subsurface flow vf cws designed for treating first flush up to 640ls 1 ii a free water surface flow fws cw with multiple aims of post treatment of first flush treatment of second flush up to 3500 ls 1 and hydraulic buffering tank iii a weir to discharge treated cso water volumes to the olona river from the fws before being introduced into the system wastewater is also pre treated with a mechanical bar screen and a grit chamber design parameters minimum residence times and minimum horizontal velocity at maximum flow rate equal to 90 s and 0 4 m s respectively to remove floating materials and grit the vf beds have been designed according to the so called french type approach morvannou et al 2013 i e a highly permeable filtering medium gravel planted with phragmitas australis in which filtration constitutes the main removal process the average depth of each vf bed is 0 62 m with a maximum ponding water depth of 0 2 m and surface area with size 30x31 m corresponding to a total area of 3720 m2 an evenly feeding distribution over the vf surface area of influent cso volume is realized with small concrete channels along the length of the bed and equally spaced with a span of 5 m this prevents the risk of preferential horizontal flow in case of low influent load fed by a single pipe at one side of the bed as recently observed by pálfy et al 2017c the average depth of the fws is 0 6 m for a corresponding area of 3174 m2 which is reduced to 2380 m2 when plants are excluded i e fraction of volume occupied by water in fws assumed equal to 0 75 kadlec and wallace 2009 during intense flood events the fws area is extended up to 7200 m2 and a maximum height of 1 7 m is reached maximum additional storage volume of 7920 m3 both vf and fws stages are regulated with sluice gates and are equipped with overflow weirs towards the fws and the olona river respectively the sluice gates are designed to maintain a permanent water layer both within the vf beds and in the fws in order to avoid complete drying and to support the ecological habitat during low rainfall periods the sluice gate of vf beds is realized with a throttle valve positioned on the outlet pipe limiting the effluent pipe area in order to guarantee the design effluent flow rate the cso cw was designed also to be included in a park for recreational activities therefore the designers have decided to feed the fws with a portion of river discharge through an additional channel diverting a flow rate from the olona river in this way the risk of water stagnation of water and mosquito proliferation due to excessive et and long dry periods is avoided preserving the recreational potential of the park the diverted flow is limited to a maximum of 5 l s which is compatible with the ecological flow of the olona river and does not let work the fws as an additional flood area for the peak river flow the overall system including the flow diverted from the river to fed the fws works by gravity and the theoretical hydraulic retention time corresponds to 36 h 2 2 dataset the dataset used as input of the hydraulic model regards the cso flow rates registered at the gorla maggiore cso cw between march 2014 and august 2014 the cso flow rates were measured by an automatic sonar sensor with sampling frequency of 15 min the sampling period represents the six months of 2014 in which the cso cw of gorla maggiore has received most frequent cso events a total number of 70 cso peaks defined by a single raising and falling phase of flow with a minimum duration of 30 min have been registered in the analyzed period as shown in fig 3 this dataset includes single cso peaks with different durations volumes and peak flow rates and also cso events with a sequence of 2 to 5 consecutive cso peaks on the basis of these 70 peaks a statistical characterization of the cso peaks has been performed and the results are summarized in table 1 2 3 hydraulic model different models have been proposed and used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of cw for csos meyer and dittmer 2015 and pálfy et al 2017b developed two modelling tools to simulate german and french cw solutions to treat csos meyer et al 2013 called rsf and orage respectively these models simulate the flow dynamics of cso cws as a continuously stirred tank reactors in series the hydrus software package has been also used to simulate both german and french cso cw schemes henrichs et al 2007 2009 pálfy et al 2016 however all these modelling studies concentrated mainly on the simulation of pollutant removal moreover both german and french cso cw solutions use only subsurface flow cws meyer et al 2013 consequently none of the models are adequate to simulate the hybrid cso cw investigated by this work therefore a new hydraulic model has been developed to investigate the flood mitigation ecosystem service of the selected case study the hydraulic scheme of the vf beds is reported in fig 4 negligible delay from the beginning of cso event and the feeding of the cw is assumed i e no delay due to preliminary stages and feeding system first flush flow rate of cso events q cso 1 is considered uniformly distributed on the vf top and vertically flowing through the beds neglecting possible preferential flow at low flow rates the treated cso flow is collected at the bottom of the vf beds and sent to the fws q vf 1 a permanent water layer is maintained at the vf bottom with an outflow gate which firstly activates with a weir functioning only when water level within the vf increases over a threshold level h vf we the flow rate from the vf to the fws q vf 1 is calculated with a weir law q h 3 2 or a sluice gate law q h 1 2 for a water table level in the vf lower or higher than the sluice gate height respectively during severe flood events water can also pond at the top of the vf bed and activate the overflow towards the fws q vf 2 when the maximum ponding water height h pw max is reached the assumption of cso flow rate evenly distributed among the four vf beds allows us to consider a unique equivalent area a vf for all the vf beds the procedure to determine flow rate routing within the cso cw is now described the total cso flow rate q cso is divided into first and second flush as follows 1 q cso 1 q cso q cso q cso lim q cso lim q cso q cso lim 2 q cso 2 0 q cso q cso lim q cso q cso lim q cso q cso lim where q cso lim is the cso flow rate limit value to activate the second flush and q cso 2 is the second flush the water flow is assumed one dimensional for vf beds which are modeled as a uniform layer the vertical infiltration rate q is modeled according to the darcy s law for unsaturated

neglected due to the installation of aeration pipes within vf beds the deposit layer molle et al 2006 morvannou et al 2013 typical of french type vf used for domestic wastewater is here neglected due to no continuous feeding and sand removal from the pre treatment stages the spatio temporal distributions of q s e and ψ in response to cso events are obtained resolving the water mass balance

runoff from saturated soils e g van dam and feddes 2000 different boundary conditions are assigned at the vf top to simulate the switch between complete infiltration and water ponding 7 vf top bound

q vf 2 a vf q z h vf where q vf 2 is the overflow flow rate towards fws which occurs when h pw equals the maximum ponding water depth h pw max the simplified geometry considered for the fws is shown in fig 4 when the water volume stored in the fws is larger than a threshold value v 1 an additional area around the central part of the fws is flooded thus increasing the buffering capacity of the system in this way the buffer tank functioning of the fws during intense cso events is properly simulated by the model fws influent loads are given by gate and overflow effluent vf flow rates q vf 1

allows both to maintain a permanent water layer for a proper ecological fws functioning kadlec and wallace 2009 and to reduce the cso hydraulic impact on the receiving river by attenuating the peak

2 5 simulation strategy and parameter assumptions the effectiveness of the cso cw on flood reduction is investigated as follows a the response to a single representative cso peak is simulated to show the cso cw hydraulic behavior and attenuation capacity in normal conditions b up to five consecutive cso peaks each one equal to the representative cso peak are simulated to investigate the cso cw capability to attenuate cso hydrographs under more stressful conditions c the supply of diverted river flow to face the evapotranspiration of fws during long dry periods is accounted to estimate the effect on cso hydrograph attenuation of this design option d the 10 year return period cso event is simulated to verify the cso cw lamination efficiency under flood condition e the response to the cso time series observed between march 2014 and august 2014 i e all the 70 cso peaks registered comprehensive of the corresponding dry periods is simulated to estimate the dynamic behavior of the overall attenuation effect for each simulation values of the model parameters are set as reported in table 2 cw geometry and cso partitioning between first and second flush are set according to design values from the cso cw of gorla maggiore unsaturated flow parameters are assigned the values estimated from laboratory experiments on french vf systems developed by morvannou et al 2013 except for the residual water content which is obtained from the laboratory experiments proposed by fournel et al 2013 to reproduce the typical accumulation of material within pores of vf beds for cso treatment the limit value to consider the top of vf bed in saturated conditions s e lim is assumed equal to 0 999 to improve the numerical stability of the solver for sake of simplicity evapotranspiration and influent flow rate from river are separately investigated in section 3 3 and neglected in other simulations all simulations are performed with a finite element approach using comsol multiphysics software 3 results 3 1 single cso peak a statistical analysis of the cso events recorded between march 2014 and august 2014 is performed to identify the characteristics of a representative mean peak on the basis of the results resumed in table 1 a cso mean peak is defined the volume of the representative cso peak is assumed equal to the statistical mean of the 70 cso peaks i e 883 m3 as to the distribution of the cso volume we have assumed a triangular hydrograph with duration equal to the mean duration of cso peaks i e 2 4 h in order to be as mush similar as possible to the real sampled cso peaks the rising phase duration has been chosen shorter than the one of the falling phase both the rising and falling phases durations have been chosen according to the average rising and falling phases of the sampled cso peaks i e 38 and 62 respectively a simulation s 1 is run for a single cso mean peak in input to the cso cw the initial conditions are φ t 0 h vf we i e the vf beds are saturated in the bottom layer below the outflow gate and v t 0 v 1 for vf and fws respectively the spatio temporal profiles of effective saturation s e are presented in fig 5 the vf beds display the following filling draining behavior i a fast top down filling due to infiltration in unsaturated porous media during the rising phase of the cso hydrograph fig 5 left panel ii a fast bottom up saturation when the infiltrating water front reaches the saturated layer fig 5 central panel mainly driven by the outflow limitation of the sluice gate and similar to the filling mechanism of a simple tank iii a slow draining phase at the end of cso peak controlled by the flow rate from the outflow sluice gate fig 5 right panel these results elucidate the complex hydraulic behavior of the cso cw with the bed initially functioning as a storage tank whose filling is delayed by the time required by water to infiltrate within the empty unsaturated porous medium the subsequent slow draining phase is designed to guarantee the required residence time for first flush treatment with a simultaneous benefit in terms of cso hydrograph attenuation as shown in fig 6 indeed the vf beds are able to satisfactorily attenuate a single cso mean peak fig 6 reducing peak flow by 95 4 of the inflow value increasing the hydrograph duration by a factor of 21 and storing 92 of the peak volume see a b c values in table 3 3 2 consecutive peaks four additional simulations denoted as s 2 to s 5 respectively are run by imposing a sequence of two to five consecutive cso mean peaks as inflow to the cso cw where the cso mean peak is set as defined in s 1 simulation initial conditions are maintained as in simulation s 1 this choice was made in accordance with the maximum number of consecutive cso peaks within a single cso event registered between march 2014 and august 2014 the presence of multiple consecutive peaks alters the cso cw functioning through the activation of the vf overflow q vf 2 as shown in fig 7 for five consecutive cso peaks s 5 temporal evolutions of outflow rates from vf and fws and accumulated water heights in the case of different consecutive cso peaks are pictured in fig 8 the high residence time requested to treat the cso first flush does not allow water from the first cso peak to be completely drained before the arrival of the next peak in this way the ponding water depth above vf beds h pw reaches its maximum value since the second cso peak fig 8 d causing a constant effluent flow rate from the vf outflow gate q vf 1 up to the end of the last cso event fig 8 a the second consecutive cso peak also activates the vf overflow q vf 2 discharging the majority of the influent cso water with no attenuation fig 8 b consequently the fws water depth h rapidly increases fig 8 e as well as the flow rate q fws 1 discharged by the cso cw to the receiving river fig 8 c although the occurrence of multiple cso peaks triggers vf overflow and increases fws effluent flow rate the cso hydrograph attenuation is very good as shown in fig 7 and resumed in fig 9 and table 3 the peak flow reduction ranges between 52 7 and 95 4 always remaining satisfactorily high fig 9 upper panel the cso hydrograph is quite prolonged even for five consecutive cso peaks with a duration that is 5 7 times longer than inflow loads fig 9 middle panel despite a decrease in relevance the vf beds are able to store 29 4 of the cso volume even in case of five consecutive peaks fig 9 lower panel at the same time the fws provides a remarkable storage capacity even for the most stressful case storage coefficient for simulation s 5 equal to 32 8 fig 9 lower panel resulting in a low volume discharged to the river without attenuation only 37 8 of un stored volume for simulation s 5 3 3 evapotranspiration and flow rate supply from the river the oscillation of water table in fws treatment plants is considered a positive characteristics of these systems it increases biodiversity and makes system behavior more similar to natural wetlands however the combination of a long dry period and high evapotranspiration et could reduce the fws water volume and increase stagnation compromising the ecosystem functioning and negatively affecting both fws treatment performance and recreational activity kadlec and wallace 2009 due to the aim of creating a park for recreational activity the designers opted for the additional feeding of fws with flow from the olona river in this section we investigate the effect of this option on cso hydrograph attenuation two additional simulations are performed with and without flow from the river both simulations include et and a long dry period before the cso event only the most stressful case is investigated i e five consecutive cso mean peaks s 5 et and s 5 et r for simulation without and with flow rate from the river respectively a constant flow rate of 5 l s is considered to be supplied from the river in s 5 et r in accordance with the design value the dry period is set equal to 27 days which corresponds to the duration of the longest period without precipitation registered between march 2014 to august 2014 a constant evapotraspiration rate of 8 3 mm d being this value assumed by the designers on the basis of the hargreaves formulation and of the climatic conditions at the site initial conditions are maintained as in simulation s 1 effluent flow rates from the cso cw system and fws water depths for simulations s 5 et and s 5 et r are reported in fig 10 and the resulting attenuation of the cso hydrograph is resumed in table 3 without water supply from the river the fws is able to store a larger water volume during the first part of the cso event due to the initially lower depth driven by et fig 10 upper panel however the maximum fws water level is almost the same for both s 5 et and s 5 et r fig 10 lower panel moreover the outflow discharge with the extra water supply from the river of simulation s 5 et r is very similar to the case of s 5 with neither river water uptake nor et consequently the cso hydrograph attenuation of s 5 and s 5 et r are very close table 3 these results indicate that the multiple aims of fws both biodiversity increase and recreational activities can be obtained through supply of flow rate from the river without compromising the efficiency in attenuating cso hydrograph 3 4 high return period event in order to understand the cso cw functioning during extreme rain event the design cso event for a return period of 10 years is used as influent load in a simulation denoted as s tr 10 outflow discharge rates from the cso cw system are displayed in fig 11 while coefficient values of cso hydrograph attenuation are resumed in table 3 as shown in fig 11 the flood event activates the second flush when the flow rate is higher than q lim 2 nd 640 l s however the maximum fws water depth reaches 167 cm and does not activate the fws overflow in accordance with the design expectations despite the critical conditions the cso cw exhibits a very good performance in cso hydrograph attenuation fig 11 with a peak flow reduction of 86 2 a 27 fold increase in hydrograph duration and a storage coefficient of 82 9 table 3 in term of stored water volumes the vf effect is lower than for other simulations but it is still not negligible with a storage of 12 of the inflow volume 3 5 observed time series of cso events the cso cw response to the time series of 70 cso peaks registered between march 2014 and august 2014 is simulated to perform a statistical analysis of the cso cw capability to attenuate cso hydrograph the time series and the frequency density function fdf of the cso flow rates are compared with those of the simulated outflow rates from the cso cw in fig 12 the cso cw system releases a smoother flow hydrograph to the river system that is closer to pre development conditions fig 12 left panel the beneficial effects of the cso cw are also highlighted by the comparison between fdfs fig 12 right panel with a shift toward lower flow values after attenuation moreover the fdf is more asymmetrical and skewed toward low flow values indicating a higher probability to have lower flow rate these results are quantitatively confirmed by the lower values of both mean 112 6 ls 1 and 14 4 ls 1 for cso and cso cw respectively and standard deviation 111 9 ls 1 and 23 9 ls 1 for cso and cso cw respectively of cso cw compared to cso confirming a reduction of the average flow rate discharged to the river promoted by cso cws 4 discussion and conclusions the proposed model simulates the hydraulic functioning of multistage hybrid cso cws providing a better comprehension of the system the model assumes a 1d approach following the richards equation which provides the advantages to simulate delay in filling of the porous media due to the initial unsaturated conditions of the beds future research is needed to compare the use of richards equation with a simpler zero dimensional mass balance equation approach to compare the possibility to simplify the model on the other hand the chosen approach assumes a evenly distribution of cso on the bed surface and neglects the possible preferential flows which can occur in vf systems morvannou et al 2013 a detailed data campaign is requested to verify the theoretical outcomes described in our work the mathematical model presented in this work can also be an interesting future tool for designers indeed the model can be used to quantitatively demonstrate the hydraulic detention capacity and show the internal hydraulic functioning of the considered system to public authorities and stakeholders helping to give confidence on the adequacy of cw for cso treatment wetland and ponds are well known sustainable urban drainage solutions adopted to attenuate the negative impact of urban runoff on receiving water bodies woods ballard et al 2015 although cso cws are designed to improve water quality by treating pollutant loads associated with cso events our work suggests that cso cws also provide a flood mitigation service similar to the one promoted by wetlands and ponds used to urban runoff control the investigated cso cw of gorla maggiore is able to smooth out single cso mean peaks reducing the peak flow by 95 increasing 21 times the event duration and temporarily storing 92 of the influent volume these benefits have been confirmed to hold for different stress conditions with a peak reduction of 53 and 86 for 5 consecutive cso mean peaks and for a cso event with a return period of 10 years respectively the cso cw modifies the frequency distribution of influent flow rates due to cso events increasing the occurrence of low flow rates released to the river the mean effluent flow rate is expected to pass from 113 112 ls 1 for cso to 14 24 ls 1 for cso cw the reduction of peak flows and the increased duration of flood events are expected to promote the restoration of pre development stream hydrograph in accordance with the aims of bioretention techniques used for urban runoff fletcher et al 2013 finally highlighting the advantage of employing cso cws for flood reduction besides for improvement of river water quality this work also stresses the opportunity for cw designers to follow a multidisciplinary approach which considers all the ecosystem services provided by cso cws liquete et al 2016 reynaud et al 2016 masi et al 2017 such as the reduction of the hydraulic impact of urbanization on the receiving stream caused by both

7336,hydrological processes regulating sediment transport from land to sea have been widely studied however anthropogenic factors controlling the river flow sediment regime and subsequent response of the estuary are still poorly understood here we conducted a multi timescale analysis on flow and sediment discharges during the period 1967 2014 for the two tributaries of the jiulong river in southeast china the long term flow sediment relationship remained linear in the north river throughout the period while the linearity showed a remarkable change after 1995 in the west river largely due to construction of dams and reservoirs in the upland watershed over short timescales rainstorm events caused the changes of suspended sediment concentration ssc in the rivers regression analysis using synchronous ssc data in a wet season 2009 revealed a delayed response average 5 days of the estuary to river input and a box model analysis established a quantitative relationship to further describe the response of the estuary to the river sediment input over multiple timescales the short term response is determined by both the vertical ssc salinity changes and the sediment trapping rate in the estuary however over the long term the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary the results of this study indicate that human activities e g dams have substantially altered sediment delivery patterns and river estuary interactions at multiple timescales keywords suspended sediment mountainous river estuary dam construction jiulong river 1 introduction rivers convey a large amount of land derived sediments to estuaries adjacent continental shelves and sometimes the deep sea through complicated processes over various timescales liu et al 2008 milliman et al 2007 meade 1996 milliman and syvitski 1992 milliman and meade 1983 although there is little doubt about the importance of river sediment delivery to estuaries and coasts understanding the nature and magnitude of river changes which influence estuaries and the subsequent response including particularly timescale effects remain a challenge lane et al 2007 dearing and jones 2003 walling 1983 it is well understood that sediment delivery to the sea by small mountainous rivers differs from large rivers mountainous rivers play important roles in the transfer of terrigenous sediment to the global ocean milliman and syvitski 1992 shaping the short term and long term characters of the coast and seafloor milliman et al 2007 syvitski and saito 2007 during a pooling data study on sediment discharges by global rivers to the sea milliman and syvitski 1992 pointed out that the small mountainous rivers in south asia including southeast china as classified by these authors and oceania stood out as an exception in comparison to other regions they generally have very high sediment yields and are sensitive to human disturbance and climate changes the delivery of suspended sediment to the sea from many of the world s rivers has drastically decreased as a result of human activities over the last decades particularly the construction of dams and reservoirs resulting in sediment retention e g li et al 2012 milliman and farnsworth 2011 meade and moody 2010 dai et al 2009 due to their small size and generally steep gradient small rivers in the south asia are also more sensitive to human activities and episodic events e g rainstorms and typhoons huang et al 2013 milliman et al 2007 kao et al 2005 milliman and kao 2005 syvitski et al 2005 lin et al 2002 river sediment flux to the sea has been estimated by a variety of studies mainly based on gauging stations data dai et al 2008 walling and fang 2003 milliman and syvitski 1992 meybeck 1988 in order to improve the precision of estimates the linkage between the river input at gauging stations and the estuary output should be established some models have been used to estimate the suspended sediment transported from tributaries passing dams over a short time period wall et al 2008 david et al 2006 but further improvements are required to include the effects of tidal transport at the estuary at multiple timescales a small mountainous river and its estuary form a simple system for such a conceptual model to be established the main purposes of our study are 1 to identify primary factors influencing the flow and sediment discharges of a small mountainous river under intense human impacts and 2 to establish the relationship between the river input and estuary output over multiple timescales based on river estuarine synchronous data and box model analysis as the second largest river in fujian province of china the jiulong river s annual sediment yield averages about 2 5 mt this is a typical mountainous river in southeast china with a catchment basin greatly affected by various human activities such as hydropower station construction and land use changes in addition the estuary of the jiulong river is dominated by macro tides therefore the significant river inputs encounter a strong tidal force within the estuary resulting in a complex process of mass water and sediments exchange the riverine inputs under intensive human impacts together with the significant tidal force into the estuary provides an ideal case to study the linkage between riverine input and estuary response this paper is arranged as follows 1 analyses of flow discharge and sediment discharge data of jiulong river between 1967 and 2014 in order to understand the short term episodic medium term seasonal and long term 50 years river input changes and their controlling factors 2 understand the linkages between river input and estuary response over a wet season 3 supplementary cruise survey data to provide the basis for model analysis and 4 box model analysis to establish the relationship between river input and estuary output over multiple timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the area under investigation is the jiulong river and its estuary located on the western side of the taiwan strait southeast china fig 1 the watershed includes two major river reaches namely the north river and west river the north river covers a watershed area of 9640 km2 with a total length of 297 km and an average elevation of 613 m the west river watershed area covers 3940 km2 with a total length of 172 km and an average elevation of 402 m zhang et al 2015 annual precipitation averages 1400 1800 mm of which 70 occurs between april and september this region is also affected by intense typhoon occurrence 1 35 per year mainly between july and september xu and hong 2000 the soil erosion modulus of the catchment in 2002 was estimated to be 2730 tons km 2 yr 1 huang et al 2004 and total soil erosion decreased 5 from 1989 to 2003 due to land use changes jiang et al 2007 the jiulong river is an important source of hydroelectricity for the watershed more than 100 hydropower stations on the river were constructed mostly after 1995 although this number increases remarkably if small hydropower stations in remote tributaries are also included wang et al 2010 zhu 2008 there are six major dam reservoirs primarily for hydropower generation and flood control in the main stem of the north river while in the west river most dams which are relatively small are located in tributaries rather than in the main stem it has been noted that the dam density of the west river is 1 35 times that of the north river with a large number of small dams constructed after 1995 zhang et al 2015 human activities especially cascade hydropower development fig 1 contributed more to the streamflow regime in the jiulong river watershed than climate changes zhang et al 2015 in addition the management of large reservoirs differs from that of small dams in terms of flushing operations large reservoirs serve as flood controls during the wet season and the sediments trapped within those reservoirs are flushed out during flooding events in contrast the operation of small reservoirs in the west river is hardly conducted for economic reasons personal communication with jiulong river reservoir management office the jiulong river estuary fig 1 has a number of islands located on its seaward side which provide shelter from oceanic wave activity the water depth within the estuary is generally 15 m at lowest low water datum with extensive intertidal mudflats within the main channel and along the coastline the winds are mainly from the ne and nne and contribute to the generation of local waves with a maximum significant wave height of 1 8 m lin et al 2009 the mean tidal range is 3 9 m with a maximum range of 6 4 m ji 2006 jiang and wai 2005 from the upper reach to haimen water circulation is mainly dominated by river inflow whilst the outside of jiyu island is controlled by tides wang 2013 suspended sediment in the lower estuary shows a main pathway to the south side of the main channel whilst the tidal water enters from the north side two high turbidity zones have been observed this estuary one is located to the west of haimen island and the other to the west of jiyu island wang et al 2005 cai et al 1999 2 2 data collection and data processing this study employs three types of data long term daily river flow discharge and sediment discharge data obtained from two gauging stations from 1967 to 2014 medium term suspended sediment concentration data from a buoy turbidity sensor covering the wet season in 2009 and short term cruise survey data between 2008 and 2010 long term data include daily flow discharge m3 s 1 and daily suspended sediment discharge or sediment flux kg s 1 over a 47 year period 1967 2014 from two gauging stations named punan hydrological station and zhengdian hydrological station punan hydrological station is located in the downstream of the north river where the drainage area is 8490 km2 and zhengdian hydrological station is situated in the downstream of the west river where the drainage area is 3419 km2 these two stations therefore account for more than 80 of the total watershed area of the jiulong river flow discharge and suspended sediment discharge were measured according to the chinese national standard criteria all discharge data were estimated at the same gauging cross section within the errors of 2 5 flow discharge and 3 0 suspended sediment discharge the flow discharge was estimated by a combination of flow profile data and water level data water samples were taken from a consistent gauging section across the full water column suspended sediment concentration was determined gravimetrically as the difference between the pre weighed and filtered after oven drying to constant weight the sediment discharge is calculated by the mass passing a certain gauging section over a unit time as the following equation 1 q s n i 1 q w i c i where qs kg s 1 is sediment discharge qw i is flow discharge m3 s 1 and c i is the suspended sediment concentration mg l 1 at a depth interval i the monthly seasonal and annual data of suspended sediment discharge and flow discharge were averaged from these daily data and the uncertainty was measured by standard deviation of the monthly seasonal and annual data over the measurement period wet season is defined as the period between april and september with the remaining months counted as dry season the monthly data for flow discharge and sediment discharge are summed throughout the two periods to estimate the proportion of wet and dry seasons flow discharge and sediment discharge of the two gauging stations over a wet season in 2009 were converted into ssc sediment discharge divided by flow discharge to allow for a comparison with buoy data a buoy equipped with a turbidity sensor was released close to jiyu island by xiamen oceans and fisheries bureau and operated between 17th april and 26th september 2009 fig 1 ssc data at hourly intervals were provided by the oceans and fisheries bureau after calibrating the turbidity data using surface water samples ssc 9 4857 turbidity r2 0 95 a low pass filter was created by a matlab software package to remove the tidal cycle signal at jiyu island and the time series data were subsequently averaged into daily values as the tidal filtered ssc of the estuary five cruise surveys were conducted to cover a series of stations from the river above longhai downstream along a river estuary transect fig 1 in august and november 2008 may and late june 2009 and early july 2010 on board water samples were collected using 5 l niskin bottles model qccc 5 national ocean technology center china at each station from the surface 0 1 h h water depth and the bottom 0 9 h for ssc measurement ssc was measured by passing a known sample volume through a pre weighed 0 45 μm glass fiber filter followed by drying and weighing tucker 1988 during the cruise in july 2010 water samples were immediately transported back to the laboratory to analyze the grain size using a laser malvern mastersizer 2000 granulometer range 0 02 2000 µm following a standard procedure tucker 1988 due to the hot weather and the subsequent rapid algae bloom in the water samples most of the samples were found not suitable for grain size analysis thus only part of the grain size data were obtained and used in this study a spss software package was used for 1 regression analyses of the relationship between annual flow discharge and annual sediment discharge of the north river and the west river between 1967 and 2014 and 2 nonlinear and linear multiple regression analyses to examine the relationship between the river input and estuary output over a wet season in 2009 using the daily ssc data from the north river west river and jiyu buoy after filtering for tides null hypothesis test was adopted and p value was used to determine the significant level for all tests 3 results 3 1 monthly river flow and sediment discharge the monthly flow discharge and sediment discharge data are presented in fig 2 overall both the north river and west river show the characteristics of mountainous rivers with remarkable periodic changes between 1967 and 2014 the average value of monthly flow discharge of the north river 262 9 212 8 m3 s 1 was more than twice that of the west river 122 2 94 7 m3 s 1 in contrast the average values of monthly sediment discharges between 1967 and 2014 were 70 9 119 0 kg s 1 and 73 3 83 8 kg s 1 for the north river and west river respectively so the two rivers contributed almost equally to the sediment discharge from river catchment to coastal water there were notable changes in sediment discharge after 1995 both for the north river and west river as the sediment discharge shifted from a continuous increase to a discontinuous status fig 2 altogether the variation in the sediment discharge of the north river shows a total reduction of 11 after 1995 in comparison with the previous average value but the west river shows a remarkable sediment reduction of 82 on average after this date despite similar flow discharges from both rivers these patterns indicate that the behavior of sediment delivery by the two rivers has changed considerably since 1995 the accumulative curves between flow discharge and sediment discharge is usually used to indicate the turning points of a river system in delivering water and sediment fig 3 illustrates the changes of the two rivers over a period of 47 years based on monthly data the turning point for the west river can be readily identified to have taken place between 1994 and 1995 and this period is consistent with the pattern of the monthly time series fig 3b however the accumulative curve of the north river does not show a clear turning point after 1995 the curve changes into several segments and the general trend is only slightly altered 3 2 annual flow and sediment discharge the annually averaged flow discharge and sediment discharge data during the study period are displayed in fig 4 a remarkable reduction in sediment discharge from the west river can be seen after 1995 whilst the north river demonstrates a greater inter annual variation after 1995 before 1995 the north river contributed 8 37 109 tons of water and 2 34 106 tons of sediment per year whilst the west river delivered 3 83 109 tons of water and 3 58 106 tons of sediment per year to the estuary however after 1995 although the flow discharge of both rivers remained similar the annual sediment mass delivered by the north river slightly decreased to 2 09 106 tons but there was a much more pronounced reduction in the west river sediment to 6 60 105 tons per year the north river was the primary contributor of fresh water to the estuary throughout the period of observation whilst the primary contributor of sediment to the estuary changed after 1995 from the west river to the north river the relationships between flow discharge and sediment discharge indicate the system behavior features of water and sediment delivery fig 5 a good linear relationship r2 0 53 p 0 001 between flow discharge and sediment discharge can be identified in the north river throughout the period 1967 2014 implying a stable system delivering sediments by river flows in a linear way fig 5a in contrast the west river shows a swift in flow sediment relationship as revealed by the two clustered groups in fig 5b the clustered data between 1967 and 1995 illustrate a much higher ratio between sediment discharge and flow discharge than those of the clustered data between 1995 and 2014 the linear regression of the data 1967 1994 r2 0 23 p 0 013 gives a much lower significance level than the regression after 1995 r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 5b considering the significance level of the north river a significant level of 0 01 is adopt for the null hypothesis test to differ the linearity of the system therefore before 1995 the west river was more like a natural system and the relationship between the flow and sediment transport was more scattered as in a nonlinear system since 1995 however this river has been altered into a linear system similar to the north river 3 3 seasonal patterns in flow and sediment discharges the seasonal patterns of the north river and west river are displayed in fig 6 using mean values and standard deviations from january to december over a period of 47 years overall a wet period with relatively high flow discharge and sediment discharge is observed from both rivers between april and september approximately 80 of sediment transport and 73 of flow discharge occurs in the wet season as calculated by the total wet season amount divided by the total amount of the year two peaks occurring in june and august correspond to the plum rain season in the early summer and peak typhoon season in the late summer and this pattern is consistent with previous studies huang 2008 a comparison of the data for 1967 1994 and 1995 2014 also indicates considerable differences fig 6 both the flow discharge and sediment discharge of the two rivers during the period 1967 1994 showed a high peak in june together with a much smoother peak in august this pattern has changed since 1995 as the flow and sediment discharges now form two nearly equal peaks in june and august 3 4 the long transect ssc variation revealed by cruise surveys there is a considerable variation in ssc and salinity from the upper to lower estuary fig 7 these variations confine the turbidity maximum zone between a6 and a9 see fig 1 for location information the turbidity maximum zone can be identified by high suspended sediment concentration as pointed out by previous studies dyer et al 2004 uncles and stephens 1993 although the movement of this zone is associated with various conditions the range of turbidity maximum zone revealed by this study is consistent with other studies wang et al 2005 cai et al 1999 therefore it can be inferred that jiyu island can be regarded as a transition zone from river dominance to tidal dominance i e marking the seaward boundary of the estuary secondly the cruise ssc data also reveal the changes between top and bottom layers fig 7 overall the ssc in the bottom layer is higher than that of the top layer but with a limited mean range of 20 the bottom layer ssc of a8 in june 2009 shows an extraordinary high value and this is probably caused by the occasional presence of fluid muds near the bottom the grain size data are also present in table 1 the suspended sediment particles are mainly clays and silts as the medium grain size is very low and the sediments are relatively uniform in terms of constituents between a3 and a9 the particles become slightly coarser due to the increased influence of tides outside of jiyu island a4 and a8 are the only stations to provide a comparison between top and bottom layers but show a relatively uniform distribution overall the suspended sediments transported from the rivers to the estuary remain relatively stable in terms of constituents and vertical distribution unless they encounter tidal flows outside jiyu island 3 5 synchronous ssc data of the gauging stations and estuary over a wet season the daily data of the punan zhengdian and jiyu stations are shown in fig 8 covering a wet season in 2009 the north river shows an overall high ssc level with episodic peaks the significant peaks mainly appeared in june and july and coincide well with recorded rainstorm events fig 8a the west river shows a similar pattern to the north river in response to rainstorm events but with much less magnitude fig 8b the ssc increase at the hydrological stations generally shows a delay of 1 2 days for both rivers after the rainstorm occurs three typhoons occurred during this period but did not have significant influence on the flow and sediment concentration data of these river sites the ssc at jiyu is in general lower than at the two river sites as shown by fig 7 there are no direct links between recorded peaks and rainstorm events but typhoon events appeared to slightly increase the ssc at the estuary which might be associated with wave induced resuspension fig 8c this pattern implies a more complicated process of sediment transport through the estuary particularly the turbidity maximum zone in order to understand the link between the ssc at the river reach and the ssc in the estuary nonlinear regression analysis on multiple variables was undertaken to statistically test the response of the ssc at jiyu to the river input a nonlinear multiple regression model was established eq 2 at a confidence level of 95 using the daily ssc data of jiyu sscj north river sscn and west river sscw 2 ssc j 0 42 ssc w 0 002 ssc w 2 0 00007 ssc n 2 0 12 ssc n 54 08 a scale analysis on the sensitivity of each term was further conducted for eq 2 using the data during the wet season of 2009 overall the mean ssc was 38 mg l 1 for the jiyu station 111 mg l 1 for the north river and 53 mg l 1 for the west river therefore the scale analysis of these terms is shown as eqs 3 and 3 3 o 10 1 o 10 1 10 1 o 10 3 10 2 o 10 5 10 4 o 10 1 10 2 o 10 1 3 o 10 1 o 10 0 o 10 1 o 10 1 o 10 1 o 10 1 as such the second and third terms on the right of the equation the squared terms can be neglected during this specific period only linear terms and the constant remain in the simplified regression model therefore a linear multiple regression model can be used to evaluate the response of the estuary to the river input during the wet season in 2009 due to the distance between the hydrological stations and jiyu island a lag in response should be considered in the regression tests but the time length is unknown for simplicity a maximum lag of 10 days was considered for the regression tests and the lowest p value with relatively high r value was taken as the criteria for best fit over the 10 day delay fig 9 red circles mark the best fit results both the north river and west river show good linear relationships p value 0 05 with the jiyu data when the lag is taken into account fig 9 a and b however a notable difference exists between the suspended sediments from the north and west rivers the lag between the north river and jiyu was found to be 2 days p value 0 035 whilst the lag between the west river and jiyu was 7 days p value 0 022 it appears that the suspended sediment input from the north river affects the estuary jiyu in a more rapid way low p values of the first several days of lag and then disappears afterwards in contrast the estuary responds to the west river input with a longer lag but with a stronger signal p value 0 022 fig 9b in order to quantify the individual contribution of the north river and the west river a multiple regression model was also tested and the results are plotted in fig 9c given the samples the multiple regression test rejects the null hypothesis test with a p value 0 025 when the lag was 5 days therefore the response of the estuary to the inflow of the north river and west river has an average lag of 5 days the change of suspended sediment in the river reach required such a time span for the signal to pass the upper reach of the estuary and the turbidity maximum zone and eventually reached the boundary of the estuary 4 discussion 4 1 primary factors affecting sediment delivery from river to estuary numerous factors including climate soil erosion and human activities can affect the river flow and sediment discharge woods 2003 milliman and syvitski 1992 for a small mountainous river the precipitation and rainstorms associated with climate change catchment dynamics relevant to sediment yield and sediment retention due to dams and reservoirs stand out as sensitive factors particularly for those controlled by the dry wet seasonal monsoon climate and episodic weather events thus precipitation rainstorms soil erosion and construction of dams and reservoirs are discussed here to extract the most important factors affecting sediment discharge and delivery from jiulong river including the 82 reduction in the west river and 11 reduction in the north river after 1995 huang et al 2013 collected precipitation data from the jiulong river watershed between 1954 and 2010 and discovered a fairly slight increase of precipitation over this period the annual frequency of rainstorms was found to be correlated with precipitation over a long timescale in their study a study of stalagmite records reconstructed the precipitation curves and also showed an increase after 1990 1995 together with a considerable change over century scales jiang et al 2012 a more detailed analysis of the rainstorm frequency records between 1971 and 2004 in this region also confirmed a relatively stable pattern of rainstorm frequency chen 2007 therefore precipitation and rainstorm frequency related to climate change are less likely to be the main factor for the sediment discharge changes in the jiulong river over the studied period but they might be more important over the longer term centuries it should also be noted that the precipitation data discussed above include the entire catchment area and there is a possible difference between the north river and west river secondly land use changes also affect the long term flow sediment relationship of rivers khoi and suetsugi 2012 the household contract responsibility system was formulated in fujian province in the late 1970s and spread widely during the early 1980s and this policy greatly stimulated local agricultural production ye and huang 2009 however the total area used for agriculture has been shrinking since 1996 because the economic benefits from food crops has decreased huang et al 2012 ye and huang 2009 in addition the prevention of land erosion by planting grasses or trees commenced by local governments in 1990s particularly in the catchment of the west river could also have contributed to the decline of sediment yield jiang et al 2007 land use change and its influence on sediment yields can be evaluated using soil erosion modulus huang et al 2004 estimated soil erosion to be 2503 tons km2 yr 1 based on gis and usle analyses a similar method was also adopted in a longer term study from 1989 to 2003 and a decrease of 5 in soil erosion modulus was found during this period jiang et al 2007 it appears that the catchment dynamics related to soil erosion and land use changes only account for a small proportion of sediment discharge reduction over the long term however our study shows that over the short term within the wet season of 2009 the ssc peaks in the estuary jiyu following the peak at river sites punan and zhengdian episodic climate events rainstorm particularly continuous rainstorms show a considerable influence on the sediment transport of this mountainous river this is because the surface sediment erosion within river catchments is usually caused by overland flow or seepage associated with heavy rainfalls garcíaruiz 2010 dams and reservoirs can not only alter the natural streamflow regime by the reduction of peak flow and flood frequency but also trap the sediments to fill reservoirs huang et al 2013 takahashi and nakamura 2011 the retention in upstream dams can substantially alter the water and suspended sediment transport patterns dai et al 2008 finger et al 2006 however with operation of flushing most of the fine suspended particles can be flushed out to reach lower streams finger et al 2006 more than 100 hydropower stations have been constructed along the north river and the west river wang et al 2010 in 1994 a series of national government policies were released to encourage the construction of privately owned small hydropower stations and a large number of small hydropower dams were constructed along the jiulong river thereafter more than 90 of the small hydropower stations currently in use are privately owned personal communication with the local hydraulic bureau in the west river those small hydropower stations in the upper stream area do not flush out sediment trapped in their reservoirs for economical reasons resulting in considerable sediment retention and consequent decrease 82 in sediment delivery to the estuary in contrast the north river where most of the major hydropower stations are located has been maintained regular operations of hydraulic flushes during flood seasons as a consequent there is only a slight decrease 11 in sediment discharge after 1995 in a study on the long term river sediment transport pattern in the red river watershed vietnam dang et al 2010 also identified a similar change of sediment flow discharge linearity to our results in their study the linearity between the annual sediment discharge and the annual flow discharge decreased after dam reservoir disturbance the accumulative curve of the jiulong river fig 3 also shows a similar decrease in the slope as the yangtze river which has been attributed to the construction of large dam reservoirs wang et al 2008 however unlike previous studies this anthropogenic effect on the sediment transport of the jiulong river is more pronounced with high density but small dam reservoirs based on the discussion above we conclude that the long term variation of sediment yield in the west river 82 reduction and the north river 11 reduction is most likely to be caused by dams and reservoirs and is consistent with the global trend wang et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling and fang 2003 4 2 sediment transport across maximum turbidity zone response of the estuary to river input the primary factor affecting the sediment discharge from the river to the estuary has been identified in this study but how the sediment discharge causes changes in the estuary over multiple timescales remains unsolved mass balance concepts and continuity equations have long been adopted for coastal studies and in particular box model studies knudsen 1900 in our study water mass conservation is considered as well as sediment mass conservation thus the momentum balance can be ignored assuming a steady balance a simplified box model was set up between the river reach and the estuary fig 10 to consider the response of the estuary to the river sediment input at different timescales it should be noted that the processes e g flocculation occurring within an estuarine maximum turbidity zone can be highly complex brenon and hir 1999 uncles and stephens 1993 and so the box model represents a highly simplified scenario the west boundary of the box model is located at site a3 fig 1 where the north river meets the west river and the east boundary of the box is at jiyu island the river input from the north river and west river and the seawater pumped in by tides are considered to be the main factors controlling the model evaporation water mass loss along the transport pathway and the addition from the other small tributary the south river are neglected for simplicity q r s r and c r are defined as the flow discharge salinity and suspended sediment concentration of the river input q i s i and c r are the same variables for the sea input by tides q 0 s 0 and c 0 are the net output variables of the estuary f c is the sediment trapped in this system which can be roughly estimated by the total area of the estuary seabed a and the sedimentation rate r the water mass balance gives 4 q r q i q 0 the salinity balance gives 5 q r s r q i s

get 11 c r c 0 1 c i c 0 c 0 s i s 0 s 0 f c q r c 0 11 c r c 0 1 ssc vertical change salininty vertical change 1 sediment trapping by estuary river sediment input eqs 11 and 11 describes the response of the estuary to the river input over multiple timescales the suspended sediment response behavior is determined by the sediment trapping passing rate within the estuary and the vertical structure of suspended sediments salinity at the seaward boundary of the estuary secondly the suspended sediment concentration at the estuary varies with river sediment input in a linear way when the sediment trapping rate keeps the same varying pace with the sediment salinity vertical structure of the estuary therefore the estuary responds to the river input sometimes in a linear way with a response lag as observed by fig 9 over a long period the response of the estuary to river inputs from the north river and west river can be compared because the estuarine end condition and the average sediment trapping rate can be considered to be the same under those conditions greater river sediment input will increase the suspended sediment in the estuary before 1995 the west river contributed more sediment input to the jiulong river and thus the estuary condition was mainly a response to the west river input after 1995 the north river input became more important in affecting the suspended sediment concentration in the estuary in order to test the long term response of the estuary to the river input the river input before and after 1995 was regarded as the main variable for the box model to test the data of the salinity and the ssc under the partially mixed condition of the estuary s i 25 s 0 15 c i 100 mg l 1 c 0 10 mg l 1 wang et al 2013 were used to estimate the change of f c before and after 1995 the calculation based on eq 6 showed that before 1995 the total amount of sediment trapped annually within the area between the two hydrological stations and the outer boundary of the estuary jiyu was 7 4 106 tons including 5 9 106 tons of sediments from river input however after 1995 the total amount of sediment trapped by the estuary decreased to 5 1 106 tons including 3 6 106 tons from the river thus the percentage of marine sediments increased from 20 to 30 after 1995 at the seasonal scale eq 11 should be considered under separate dry season and wet season scenarios during the dry season the estuary is well mixed and the vertical change of salinity is very limited whilst the vertical change of ssc could be considerable due to the resuspension of sediments near the sea bed therefore the vertical structure term could be much greater than the sediment trapping rate term resulting in a minor response of the estuary during wet seasons the response of the estuary to the river input is determined by both the sediment trapping term and the vertical structure term and the paces between those two terms can cause a delayed response of the estuary under this scenario the river sediment input quantity is less important but the pace match is regulating the response of the estuary as such a delayed response is expected as revealed by the regression analysis on the synchronous data in the wet season of 2009 section 3 5 at short timescales rainstorm events are the primary factor affecting sediment transport from the river to the estuary section 3 5 and cause the estuary to become stratified guo and jiang 2010 used a roms model to simulate suspended sediment transport during a rainstorm river input flow discharge 1600 m3 s 1 and found the suspended sediment concentration showed a reduction from the surface to the seabed s i 28 s 0 8 c i 120 mg l 1 c 0 100 mg l 1 c r 460 mg l 1 the estimated sedimentation rate was 17 1 cm yr 1 which is significantly higher than the long term sedimentation rate observed 2 6 cm yr 1 liu et al 2012 during rainstorm periods the estuary mainly serves as a trap to the river input due to the large input of fresh water the total exchange flow is inhibited and pushed seaward thus a large amount of sediment has to settle down before reaching the estuary and this might cause the delayed suspended sediment response in the estuary fig 9 previous studies on other river estuary systems with dam construction have revealed that the primary influences of river input on the estuary can be classified into two types 1 salt wedge dynamic changes in the estuary for example hydropower stations on the ebro river in spain have been found to increase the salt wedge frequency during middle flow discharge conditions ibàñez et al 2015 and 2 channel scours in the lower estuary such as the trinity river in the usa phillips et al 2005 these two folders of influences have been both included into our model eq 11 in a simple way using the ssc as a tracer and these consequences are eventually the responses of the estuary to the river suspended sediment input 5 conclusions we combined long term flow discharge and sediment discharge from the jiulong river with measured ssc data at its estuary during a wet season to investigate the flow sediment relationship and response of the estuary to the river input at multiple timescales based on time series analyses and box model estimates the primary findings are summarized as follows 1 a remarkable change in 1995 was revealed by the long term data in terms of the flow and sediment transport by those two rivers before 1995 the north river was the primary convey for flow discharge whilst the west river delivered more sediment after 1995 however the sediment discharge by the west river decreased considerably and the north river became the main path for flow and sediment delivery 2 the annual flow discharge and sediment discharge data showed a linear relationship for the north river throughout 1967 2014 whilst the flow sediment relationship of the west river switched from non linear to linear after 1995 the most likely reason for this change was the construction of small dams and reservoirs in the west river after 1995 3 the synchronous ssc data of the river ssc input and the estuary ssc data were analyzed by a regression model which revealed a delayed response of 5 days in the estuary to the river input in addition rainstorm events have a pronounced influence on rivers 4 a box model was established to quantitatively describe the response of the estuary to the river input over multiple timescales the model revealed that over a long time period the magnitude of river input determines the output of the estuary overall the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary over shorter time scales the relative changes of vertical ssc and salinity together with the sediment trapping rate control the sediment response of the estuary acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41376082 41676098

7336,hydrological processes regulating sediment transport from land to sea have been widely studied however anthropogenic factors controlling the river flow sediment regime and subsequent response of the estuary are still poorly understood here we conducted a multi timescale analysis on flow and sediment discharges during the period 1967 2014 for the two tributaries of the jiulong river in southeast china the long term flow sediment relationship remained linear in the north river throughout the period while the linearity showed a remarkable change after 1995 in the west river largely due to construction of dams and reservoirs in the upland watershed over short timescales rainstorm events caused the changes of suspended sediment concentration ssc in the rivers regression analysis using synchronous ssc data in a wet season 2009 revealed a delayed response average 5 days of the estuary to river input and a box model analysis established a quantitative relationship to further describe the response of the estuary to the river sediment input over multiple timescales the short term response is determined by both the vertical ssc salinity changes and the sediment trapping rate in the estuary however over the long term the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary the results of this study indicate that human activities e g dams have substantially altered sediment delivery patterns and river estuary interactions at multiple timescales keywords suspended sediment mountainous river estuary dam construction jiulong river 1 introduction rivers convey a large amount of land derived sediments to estuaries adjacent continental shelves and sometimes the deep sea through complicated processes over various timescales liu et al 2008 milliman et al 2007 meade 1996 milliman and syvitski 1992 milliman and meade 1983 although there is little doubt about the importance of river sediment delivery to estuaries and coasts understanding the nature and magnitude of river changes which influence estuaries and the subsequent response including particularly timescale effects remain a challenge lane et al 2007 dearing and jones 2003 walling 1983 it is well understood that sediment delivery to the sea by small mountainous rivers differs from large rivers mountainous rivers play important roles in the transfer of terrigenous sediment to the global ocean milliman and syvitski 1992 shaping the short term and long term characters of the coast and seafloor milliman et al 2007 syvitski and saito 2007 during a pooling data study on sediment discharges by global rivers to the sea milliman and syvitski 1992 pointed out that the small mountainous rivers in south asia including southeast china as classified by these authors and oceania stood out as an exception in comparison to other regions they generally have very high sediment yields and are sensitive to human disturbance and climate changes the delivery of suspended sediment to the sea from many of the world s rivers has drastically decreased as a result of human activities over the last decades particularly the construction of dams and reservoirs resulting in sediment retention e g li et al 2012 milliman and farnsworth 2011 meade and moody 2010 dai et al 2009 due to their small size and generally steep gradient small rivers in the south asia are also more sensitive to human activities and episodic events e g rainstorms and typhoons huang et al 2013 milliman et al 2007 kao et al 2005 milliman and kao 2005 syvitski et al 2005 lin et al 2002 river sediment flux to the sea has been estimated by a variety of studies mainly based on gauging stations data dai et al 2008 walling and fang 2003 milliman and syvitski 1992 meybeck 1988 in order to improve the precision of estimates the linkage between the river input at gauging stations and the estuary output should be established some models have been used to estimate the suspended sediment transported from tributaries passing dams over a short time period wall et al 2008 david et al 2006 but further improvements are required to include the effects of tidal transport at the estuary at multiple timescales a small mountainous river and its estuary form a simple system for such a conceptual model to be established the main purposes of our study are 1 to identify primary factors influencing the flow and sediment discharges of a small mountainous river under intense human impacts and 2 to establish the relationship between the river input and estuary output over multiple timescales based on river estuarine synchronous data and box model analysis as the second largest river in fujian province of china the jiulong river s annual sediment yield averages about 2 5 mt this is a typical mountainous river in southeast china with a catchment basin greatly affected by various human activities such as hydropower station construction and land use changes in addition the estuary of the jiulong river is dominated by macro tides therefore the significant river inputs encounter a strong tidal force within the estuary resulting in a complex process of mass water and sediments exchange the riverine inputs under intensive human impacts together with the significant tidal force into the estuary provides an ideal case to study the linkage between riverine input and estuary response this paper is arranged as follows 1 analyses of flow discharge and sediment discharge data of jiulong river between 1967 and 2014 in order to understand the short term episodic medium term seasonal and long term 50 years river input changes and their controlling factors 2 understand the linkages between river input and estuary response over a wet season 3 supplementary cruise survey data to provide the basis for model analysis and 4 box model analysis to establish the relationship between river input and estuary output over multiple timescales 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area the area under investigation is the jiulong river and its estuary located on the western side of the taiwan strait southeast china fig 1 the watershed includes two major river reaches namely the north river and west river the north river covers a watershed area of 9640 km2 with a total length of 297 km and an average elevation of 613 m the west river watershed area covers 3940 km2 with a total length of 172 km and an average elevation of 402 m zhang et al 2015 annual precipitation averages 1400 1800 mm of which 70 occurs between april and september this region is also affected by intense typhoon occurrence 1 35 per year mainly between july and september xu and hong 2000 the soil erosion modulus of the catchment in 2002 was estimated to be 2730 tons km 2 yr 1 huang et al 2004 and total soil erosion decreased 5 from 1989 to 2003 due to land use changes jiang et al 2007 the jiulong river is an important source of hydroelectricity for the watershed more than 100 hydropower stations on the river were constructed mostly after 1995 although this number increases remarkably if small hydropower stations in remote tributaries are also included wang et al 2010 zhu 2008 there are six major dam reservoirs primarily for hydropower generation and flood control in the main stem of the north river while in the west river most dams which are relatively small are located in tributaries rather than in the main stem it has been noted that the dam density of the west river is 1 35 times that of the north river with a large number of small dams constructed after 1995 zhang et al 2015 human activities especially cascade hydropower development fig 1 contributed more to the streamflow regime in the jiulong river watershed than climate changes zhang et al 2015 in addition the management of large reservoirs differs from that of small dams in terms of flushing operations large reservoirs serve as flood controls during the wet season and the sediments trapped within those reservoirs are flushed out during flooding events in contrast the operation of small reservoirs in the west river is hardly conducted for economic reasons personal communication with jiulong river reservoir management office the jiulong river estuary fig 1 has a number of islands located on its seaward side which provide shelter from oceanic wave activity the water depth within the estuary is generally 15 m at lowest low water datum with extensive intertidal mudflats within the main channel and along the coastline the winds are mainly from the ne and nne and contribute to the generation of local waves with a maximum significant wave height of 1 8 m lin et al 2009 the mean tidal range is 3 9 m with a maximum range of 6 4 m ji 2006 jiang and wai 2005 from the upper reach to haimen water circulation is mainly dominated by river inflow whilst the outside of jiyu island is controlled by tides wang 2013 suspended sediment in the lower estuary shows a main pathway to the south side of the main channel whilst the tidal water enters from the north side two high turbidity zones have been observed this estuary one is located to the west of haimen island and the other to the west of jiyu island wang et al 2005 cai et al 1999 2 2 data collection and data processing this study employs three types of data long term daily river flow discharge and sediment discharge data obtained from two gauging stations from 1967 to 2014 medium term suspended sediment concentration data from a buoy turbidity sensor covering the wet season in 2009 and short term cruise survey data between 2008 and 2010 long term data include daily flow discharge m3 s 1 and daily suspended sediment discharge or sediment flux kg s 1 over a 47 year period 1967 2014 from two gauging stations named punan hydrological station and zhengdian hydrological station punan hydrological station is located in the downstream of the north river where the drainage area is 8490 km2 and zhengdian hydrological station is situated in the downstream of the west river where the drainage area is 3419 km2 these two stations therefore account for more than 80 of the total watershed area of the jiulong river flow discharge and suspended sediment discharge were measured according to the chinese national standard criteria all discharge data were estimated at the same gauging cross section within the errors of 2 5 flow discharge and 3 0 suspended sediment discharge the flow discharge was estimated by a combination of flow profile data and water level data water samples were taken from a consistent gauging section across the full water column suspended sediment concentration was determined gravimetrically as the difference between the pre weighed and filtered after oven drying to constant weight the sediment discharge is calculated by the mass passing a certain gauging section over a unit time as the following equation 1 q s n i 1 q w i c i where qs kg s 1 is sediment discharge qw i is flow discharge m3 s 1 and c i is the suspended sediment concentration mg l 1 at a depth interval i the monthly seasonal and annual data of suspended sediment discharge and flow discharge were averaged from these daily data and the uncertainty was measured by standard deviation of the monthly seasonal and annual data over the measurement period wet season is defined as the period between april and september with the remaining months counted as dry season the monthly data for flow discharge and sediment discharge are summed throughout the two periods to estimate the proportion of wet and dry seasons flow discharge and sediment discharge of the two gauging stations over a wet season in 2009 were converted into ssc sediment discharge divided by flow discharge to allow for a comparison with buoy data a buoy equipped with a turbidity sensor was released close to jiyu island by xiamen oceans and fisheries bureau and operated between 17th april and 26th september 2009 fig 1 ssc data at hourly intervals were provided by the oceans and fisheries bureau after calibrating the turbidity data using surface water samples ssc 9 4857 turbidity r2 0 95 a low pass filter was created by a matlab software package to remove the tidal cycle signal at jiyu island and the time series data were subsequently averaged into daily values as the tidal filtered ssc of the estuary five cruise surveys were conducted to cover a series of stations from the river above longhai downstream along a river estuary transect fig 1 in august and november 2008 may and late june 2009 and early july 2010 on board water samples were collected using 5 l niskin bottles model qccc 5 national ocean technology center china at each station from the surface 0 1 h h water depth and the bottom 0 9 h for ssc measurement ssc was measured by passing a known sample volume through a pre weighed 0 45 μm glass fiber filter followed by drying and weighing tucker 1988 during the cruise in july 2010 water samples were immediately transported back to the laboratory to analyze the grain size using a laser malvern mastersizer 2000 granulometer range 0 02 2000 µm following a standard procedure tucker 1988 due to the hot weather and the subsequent rapid algae bloom in the water samples most of the samples were found not suitable for grain size analysis thus only part of the grain size data were obtained and used in this study a spss software package was used for 1 regression analyses of the relationship between annual flow discharge and annual sediment discharge of the north river and the west river between 1967 and 2014 and 2 nonlinear and linear multiple regression analyses to examine the relationship between the river input and estuary output over a wet season in 2009 using the daily ssc data from the north river west river and jiyu buoy after filtering for tides null hypothesis test was adopted and p value was used to determine the significant level for all tests 3 results 3 1 monthly river flow and sediment discharge the monthly flow discharge and sediment discharge data are presented in fig 2 overall both the north river and west river show the characteristics of mountainous rivers with remarkable periodic changes between 1967 and 2014 the average value of monthly flow discharge of the north river 262 9 212 8 m3 s 1 was more than twice that of the west river 122 2 94 7 m3 s 1 in contrast the average values of monthly sediment discharges between 1967 and 2014 were 70 9 119 0 kg s 1 and 73 3 83 8 kg s 1 for the north river and west river respectively so the two rivers contributed almost equally to the sediment discharge from river catchment to coastal water there were notable changes in sediment discharge after 1995 both for the north river and west river as the sediment discharge shifted from a continuous increase to a discontinuous status fig 2 altogether the variation in the sediment discharge of the north river shows a total reduction of 11 after 1995 in comparison with the previous average value but the west river shows a remarkable sediment reduction of 82 on average after this date despite similar flow discharges from both rivers these patterns indicate that the behavior of sediment delivery by the two rivers has changed considerably since 1995 the accumulative curves between flow discharge and sediment discharge is usually used to indicate the turning points of a river system in delivering water and sediment fig 3 illustrates the changes of the two rivers over a period of 47 years based on monthly data the turning point for the west river can be readily identified to have taken place between 1994 and 1995 and this period is consistent with the pattern of the monthly time series fig 3b however the accumulative curve of the north river does not show a clear turning point after 1995 the curve changes into several segments and the general trend is only slightly altered 3 2 annual flow and sediment discharge the annually averaged flow discharge and sediment discharge data during the study period are displayed in fig 4 a remarkable reduction in sediment discharge from the west river can be seen after 1995 whilst the north river demonstrates a greater inter annual variation after 1995 before 1995 the north river contributed 8 37 109 tons of water and 2 34 106 tons of sediment per year whilst the west river delivered 3 83 109 tons of water and 3 58 106 tons of sediment per year to the estuary however after 1995 although the flow discharge of both rivers remained similar the annual sediment mass delivered by the north river slightly decreased to 2 09 106 tons but there was a much more pronounced reduction in the west river sediment to 6 60 105 tons per year the north river was the primary contributor of fresh water to the estuary throughout the period of observation whilst the primary contributor of sediment to the estuary changed after 1995 from the west river to the north river the relationships between flow discharge and sediment discharge indicate the system behavior features of water and sediment delivery fig 5 a good linear relationship r2 0 53 p 0 001 between flow discharge and sediment discharge can be identified in the north river throughout the period 1967 2014 implying a stable system delivering sediments by river flows in a linear way fig 5a in contrast the west river shows a swift in flow sediment relationship as revealed by the two clustered groups in fig 5b the clustered data between 1967 and 1995 illustrate a much higher ratio between sediment discharge and flow discharge than those of the clustered data between 1995 and 2014 the linear regression of the data 1967 1994 r2 0 23 p 0 013 gives a much lower significance level than the regression after 1995 r2 0 80 p 0 001 fig 5b considering the significance level of the north river a significant level of 0 01 is adopt for the null hypothesis test to differ the linearity of the system therefore before 1995 the west river was more like a natural system and the relationship between the flow and sediment transport was more scattered as in a nonlinear system since 1995 however this river has been altered into a linear system similar to the north river 3 3 seasonal patterns in flow and sediment discharges the seasonal patterns of the north river and west river are displayed in fig 6 using mean values and standard deviations from january to december over a period of 47 years overall a wet period with relatively high flow discharge and sediment discharge is observed from both rivers between april and september approximately 80 of sediment transport and 73 of flow discharge occurs in the wet season as calculated by the total wet season amount divided by the total amount of the year two peaks occurring in june and august correspond to the plum rain season in the early summer and peak typhoon season in the late summer and this pattern is consistent with previous studies huang 2008 a comparison of the data for 1967 1994 and 1995 2014 also indicates considerable differences fig 6 both the flow discharge and sediment discharge of the two rivers during the period 1967 1994 showed a high peak in june together with a much smoother peak in august this pattern has changed since 1995 as the flow and sediment discharges now form two nearly equal peaks in june and august 3 4 the long transect ssc variation revealed by cruise surveys there is a considerable variation in ssc and salinity from the upper to lower estuary fig 7 these variations confine the turbidity maximum zone between a6 and a9 see fig 1 for location information the turbidity maximum zone can be identified by high suspended sediment concentration as pointed out by previous studies dyer et al 2004 uncles and stephens 1993 although the movement of this zone is associated with various conditions the range of turbidity maximum zone revealed by this study is consistent with other studies wang et al 2005 cai et al 1999 therefore it can be inferred that jiyu island can be regarded as a transition zone from river dominance to tidal dominance i e marking the seaward boundary of the estuary secondly the cruise ssc data also reveal the changes between top and bottom layers fig 7 overall the ssc in the bottom layer is higher than that of the top layer but with a limited mean range of 20 the bottom layer ssc of a8 in june 2009 shows an extraordinary high value and this is probably caused by the occasional presence of fluid muds near the bottom the grain size data are also present in table 1 the suspended sediment particles are mainly clays and silts as the medium grain size is very low and the sediments are relatively uniform in terms of constituents between a3 and a9 the particles become slightly coarser due to the increased influence of tides outside of jiyu island a4 and a8 are the only stations to provide a comparison between top and bottom layers but show a relatively uniform distribution overall the suspended sediments transported from the rivers to the estuary remain relatively stable in terms of constituents and vertical distribution unless they encounter tidal flows outside jiyu island 3 5 synchronous ssc data of the gauging stations and estuary over a wet season the daily data of the punan zhengdian and jiyu stations are shown in fig 8 covering a wet season in 2009 the north river shows an overall high ssc level with episodic peaks the significant peaks mainly appeared in june and july and coincide well with recorded rainstorm events fig 8a the west river shows a similar pattern to the north river in response to rainstorm events but with much less magnitude fig 8b the ssc increase at the hydrological stations generally shows a delay of 1 2 days for both rivers after the rainstorm occurs three typhoons occurred during this period but did not have significant influence on the flow and sediment concentration data of these river sites the ssc at jiyu is in general lower than at the two river sites as shown by fig 7 there are no direct links between recorded peaks and rainstorm events but typhoon events appeared to slightly increase the ssc at the estuary which might be associated with wave induced resuspension fig 8c this pattern implies a more complicated process of sediment transport through the estuary particularly the turbidity maximum zone in order to understand the link between the ssc at the river reach and the ssc in the estuary nonlinear regression analysis on multiple variables was undertaken to statistically test the response of the ssc at jiyu to the river input a nonlinear multiple regression model was established eq 2 at a confidence level of 95 using the daily ssc data of jiyu sscj north river sscn and west river sscw 2 ssc j 0 42 ssc w 0 002 ssc w 2 0 00007 ssc n 2 0 12 ssc n 54 08 a scale analysis on the sensitivity of each term was further conducted for eq 2 using the data during the wet season of 2009 overall the mean ssc was 38 mg l 1 for the jiyu station 111 mg l 1 for the north river and 53 mg l 1 for the west river therefore the scale analysis of these terms is shown as eqs 3 and 3 3 o 10 1 o 10 1 10 1 o 10 3 10 2 o 10 5 10 4 o 10 1 10 2 o 10 1 3 o 10 1 o 10 0 o 10 1 o 10 1 o 10 1 o 10 1 as such the second and third terms on the right of the equation the squared terms can be neglected during this specific period only linear terms and the constant remain in the simplified regression model therefore a linear multiple regression model can be used to evaluate the response of the estuary to the river input during the wet season in 2009 due to the distance between the hydrological stations and jiyu island a lag in response should be considered in the regression tests but the time length is unknown for simplicity a maximum lag of 10 days was considered for the regression tests and the lowest p value with relatively high r value was taken as the criteria for best fit over the 10 day delay fig 9 red circles mark the best fit results both the north river and west river show good linear relationships p value 0 05 with the jiyu data when the lag is taken into account fig 9 a and b however a notable difference exists between the suspended sediments from the north and west rivers the lag between the north river and jiyu was found to be 2 days p value 0 035 whilst the lag between the west river and jiyu was 7 days p value 0 022 it appears that the suspended sediment input from the north river affects the estuary jiyu in a more rapid way low p values of the first several days of lag and then disappears afterwards in contrast the estuary responds to the west river input with a longer lag but with a stronger signal p value 0 022 fig 9b in order to quantify the individual contribution of the north river and the west river a multiple regression model was also tested and the results are plotted in fig 9c given the samples the multiple regression test rejects the null hypothesis test with a p value 0 025 when the lag was 5 days therefore the response of the estuary to the inflow of the north river and west river has an average lag of 5 days the change of suspended sediment in the river reach required such a time span for the signal to pass the upper reach of the estuary and the turbidity maximum zone and eventually reached the boundary of the estuary 4 discussion 4 1 primary factors affecting sediment delivery from river to estuary numerous factors including climate soil erosion and human activities can affect the river flow and sediment discharge woods 2003 milliman and syvitski 1992 for a small mountainous river the precipitation and rainstorms associated with climate change catchment dynamics relevant to sediment yield and sediment retention due to dams and reservoirs stand out as sensitive factors particularly for those controlled by the dry wet seasonal monsoon climate and episodic weather events thus precipitation rainstorms soil erosion and construction of dams and reservoirs are discussed here to extract the most important factors affecting sediment discharge and delivery from jiulong river including the 82 reduction in the west river and 11 reduction in the north river after 1995 huang et al 2013 collected precipitation data from the jiulong river watershed between 1954 and 2010 and discovered a fairly slight increase of precipitation over this period the annual frequency of rainstorms was found to be correlated with precipitation over a long timescale in their study a study of stalagmite records reconstructed the precipitation curves and also showed an increase after 1990 1995 together with a considerable change over century scales jiang et al 2012 a more detailed analysis of the rainstorm frequency records between 1971 and 2004 in this region also confirmed a relatively stable pattern of rainstorm frequency chen 2007 therefore precipitation and rainstorm frequency related to climate change are less likely to be the main factor for the sediment discharge changes in the jiulong river over the studied period but they might be more important over the longer term centuries it should also be noted that the precipitation data discussed above include the entire catchment area and there is a possible difference between the north river and west river secondly land use changes also affect the long term flow sediment relationship of rivers khoi and suetsugi 2012 the household contract responsibility system was formulated in fujian province in the late 1970s and spread widely during the early 1980s and this policy greatly stimulated local agricultural production ye and huang 2009 however the total area used for agriculture has been shrinking since 1996 because the economic benefits from food crops has decreased huang et al 2012 ye and huang 2009 in addition the prevention of land erosion by planting grasses or trees commenced by local governments in 1990s particularly in the catchment of the west river could also have contributed to the decline of sediment yield jiang et al 2007 land use change and its influence on sediment yields can be evaluated using soil erosion modulus huang et al 2004 estimated soil erosion to be 2503 tons km2 yr 1 based on gis and usle analyses a similar method was also adopted in a longer term study from 1989 to 2003 and a decrease of 5 in soil erosion modulus was found during this period jiang et al 2007 it appears that the catchment dynamics related to soil erosion and land use changes only account for a small proportion of sediment discharge reduction over the long term however our study shows that over the short term within the wet season of 2009 the ssc peaks in the estuary jiyu following the peak at river sites punan and zhengdian episodic climate events rainstorm particularly continuous rainstorms show a considerable influence on the sediment transport of this mountainous river this is because the surface sediment erosion within river catchments is usually caused by overland flow or seepage associated with heavy rainfalls garcíaruiz 2010 dams and reservoirs can not only alter the natural streamflow regime by the reduction of peak flow and flood frequency but also trap the sediments to fill reservoirs huang et al 2013 takahashi and nakamura 2011 the retention in upstream dams can substantially alter the water and suspended sediment transport patterns dai et al 2008 finger et al 2006 however with operation of flushing most of the fine suspended particles can be flushed out to reach lower streams finger et al 2006 more than 100 hydropower stations have been constructed along the north river and the west river wang et al 2010 in 1994 a series of national government policies were released to encourage the construction of privately owned small hydropower stations and a large number of small hydropower dams were constructed along the jiulong river thereafter more than 90 of the small hydropower stations currently in use are privately owned personal communication with the local hydraulic bureau in the west river those small hydropower stations in the upper stream area do not flush out sediment trapped in their reservoirs for economical reasons resulting in considerable sediment retention and consequent decrease 82 in sediment delivery to the estuary in contrast the north river where most of the major hydropower stations are located has been maintained regular operations of hydraulic flushes during flood seasons as a consequent there is only a slight decrease 11 in sediment discharge after 1995 in a study on the long term river sediment transport pattern in the red river watershed vietnam dang et al 2010 also identified a similar change of sediment flow discharge linearity to our results in their study the linearity between the annual sediment discharge and the annual flow discharge decreased after dam reservoir disturbance the accumulative curve of the jiulong river fig 3 also shows a similar decrease in the slope as the yangtze river which has been attributed to the construction of large dam reservoirs wang et al 2008 however unlike previous studies this anthropogenic effect on the sediment transport of the jiulong river is more pronounced with high density but small dam reservoirs based on the discussion above we conclude that the long term variation of sediment yield in the west river 82 reduction and the north river 11 reduction is most likely to be caused by dams and reservoirs and is consistent with the global trend wang et al 2015 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling and fang 2003 4 2 sediment transport across maximum turbidity zone response of the estuary to river input the primary factor affecting the sediment discharge from the river to the estuary has been identified in this study but how the sediment discharge causes changes in the estuary over multiple timescales remains unsolved mass balance concepts and continuity equations have long been adopted for coastal studies and in particular box model studies knudsen 1900 in our study water mass conservation is considered as well as sediment mass conservation thus the momentum balance can be ignored assuming a steady balance a simplified box model was set up between the river reach and the estuary fig 10 to consider the response of the estuary to the river sediment input at different timescales it should be noted that the processes e g flocculation occurring within an estuarine maximum turbidity zone can be highly complex brenon and hir 1999 uncles and stephens 1993 and so the box model represents a highly simplified scenario the west boundary of the box model is located at site a3 fig 1 where the north river meets the west river and the east boundary of the box is at jiyu island the river input from the north river and west river and the seawater pumped in by tides are considered to be the main factors controlling the model evaporation water mass loss along the transport pathway and the addition from the other small tributary the south river are neglected for simplicity q r s r and c r are defined as the flow discharge salinity and suspended sediment concentration of the river input q i s i and c r are the same variables for the sea input by tides q 0 s 0 and c 0 are the net output variables of the estuary f c is the sediment trapped in this system which can be roughly estimated by the total area of the estuary seabed a and the sedimentation rate r the water mass balance gives 4 q r q i q 0 the salinity balance gives 5 q r s r q i s

get 11 c r c 0 1 c i c 0 c 0 s i s 0 s 0 f c q r c 0 11 c r c 0 1 ssc vertical change salininty vertical change 1 sediment trapping by estuary river sediment input eqs 11 and 11 describes the response of the estuary to the river input over multiple timescales the suspended sediment response behavior is determined by the sediment trapping passing rate within the estuary and the vertical structure of suspended sediments salinity at the seaward boundary of the estuary secondly the suspended sediment concentration at the estuary varies with river sediment input in a linear way when the sediment trapping rate keeps the same varying pace with the sediment salinity vertical structure of the estuary therefore the estuary responds to the river input sometimes in a linear way with a response lag as observed by fig 9 over a long period the response of the estuary to river inputs from the north river and west river can be compared because the estuarine end condition and the average sediment trapping rate can be considered to be the same under those conditions greater river sediment input will increase the suspended sediment in the estuary before 1995 the west river contributed more sediment input to the jiulong river and thus the estuary condition was mainly a response to the west river input after 1995 the north river input became more important in affecting the suspended sediment concentration in the estuary in order to test the long term response of the estuary to the river input the river input before and after 1995 was regarded as the main variable for the box model to test the data of the salinity and the ssc under the partially mixed condition of the estuary s i 25 s 0 15 c i 100 mg l 1 c 0 10 mg l 1 wang et al 2013 were used to estimate the change of f c before and after 1995 the calculation based on eq 6 showed that before 1995 the total amount of sediment trapped annually within the area between the two hydrological stations and the outer boundary of the estuary jiyu was 7 4 106 tons including 5 9 106 tons of sediments from river input however after 1995 the total amount of sediment trapped by the estuary decreased to 5 1 106 tons including 3 6 106 tons from the river thus the percentage of marine sediments increased from 20 to 30 after 1995 at the seasonal scale eq 11 should be considered under separate dry season and wet season scenarios during the dry season the estuary is well mixed and the vertical change of salinity is very limited whilst the vertical change of ssc could be considerable due to the resuspension of sediments near the sea bed therefore the vertical structure term could be much greater than the sediment trapping rate term resulting in a minor response of the estuary during wet seasons the response of the estuary to the river input is determined by both the sediment trapping term and the vertical structure term and the paces between those two terms can cause a delayed response of the estuary under this scenario the river sediment input quantity is less important but the pace match is regulating the response of the estuary as such a delayed response is expected as revealed by the regression analysis on the synchronous data in the wet season of 2009 section 3 5 at short timescales rainstorm events are the primary factor affecting sediment transport from the river to the estuary section 3 5 and cause the estuary to become stratified guo and jiang 2010 used a roms model to simulate suspended sediment transport during a rainstorm river input flow discharge 1600 m3 s 1 and found the suspended sediment concentration showed a reduction from the surface to the seabed s i 28 s 0 8 c i 120 mg l 1 c 0 100 mg l 1 c r 460 mg l 1 the estimated sedimentation rate was 17 1 cm yr 1 which is significantly higher than the long term sedimentation rate observed 2 6 cm yr 1 liu et al 2012 during rainstorm periods the estuary mainly serves as a trap to the river input due to the large input of fresh water the total exchange flow is inhibited and pushed seaward thus a large amount of sediment has to settle down before reaching the estuary and this might cause the delayed suspended sediment response in the estuary fig 9 previous studies on other river estuary systems with dam construction have revealed that the primary influences of river input on the estuary can be classified into two types 1 salt wedge dynamic changes in the estuary for example hydropower stations on the ebro river in spain have been found to increase the salt wedge frequency during middle flow discharge conditions ibàñez et al 2015 and 2 channel scours in the lower estuary such as the trinity river in the usa phillips et al 2005 these two folders of influences have been both included into our model eq 11 in a simple way using the ssc as a tracer and these consequences are eventually the responses of the estuary to the river suspended sediment input 5 conclusions we combined long term flow discharge and sediment discharge from the jiulong river with measured ssc data at its estuary during a wet season to investigate the flow sediment relationship and response of the estuary to the river input at multiple timescales based on time series analyses and box model estimates the primary findings are summarized as follows 1 a remarkable change in 1995 was revealed by the long term data in terms of the flow and sediment transport by those two rivers before 1995 the north river was the primary convey for flow discharge whilst the west river delivered more sediment after 1995 however the sediment discharge by the west river decreased considerably and the north river became the main path for flow and sediment delivery 2 the annual flow discharge and sediment discharge data showed a linear relationship for the north river throughout 1967 2014 whilst the flow sediment relationship of the west river switched from non linear to linear after 1995 the most likely reason for this change was the construction of small dams and reservoirs in the west river after 1995 3 the synchronous ssc data of the river ssc input and the estuary ssc data were analyzed by a regression model which revealed a delayed response of 5 days in the estuary to the river input in addition rainstorm events have a pronounced influence on rivers 4 a box model was established to quantitatively describe the response of the estuary to the river input over multiple timescales the model revealed that over a long time period the magnitude of river input determines the output of the estuary overall the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary over shorter time scales the relative changes of vertical ssc and salinity together with the sediment trapping rate control the sediment response of the estuary acknowledgments this research was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant numbers 41376082 41676098

7337,groundwater and surface water interactions are regulated by catchment characteristics and complex inter and intra annual variations in climatic conditions that are not yet fully understood our objective was to investigate the influence of catchment characteristics and freeze thaw processes on surface and groundwater interactions in a boreal landscape the krycklan catchment in sweden we used a numerical modelling approach and sub catchment evaluation method to identify and evaluate fundamental catchment characteristics and processes the model reproduced observed stream discharge patterns of the 14 sub catchments and the dynamics of the 15 groundwater wells with an average accumulated discharge error of 1 15 standard deviation and an average groundwater level mean error of 0 1 m 0 23 m standard deviation we show how peatland characteristics dampen the effect of intense rain and how soil freeze thaw processes regulate surface and groundwater partitioning during snowmelt with these results we demonstrate the importance of defining understanding and quantifying the role of landscape heterogeneity and sub catchment characteristics for accurately representing catchment hydrological functioning keywords runoff generation mike she krycklan water balance soil frost catchment 1 introduction interactions between surface waters and groundwater are controlled by several complex and interacting processes that relate to biological and physical characteristics of the catchment as well as intra and inter annual variations in climatic conditions knutsson and morfeldt 2002 sophocleous 2002 woods 2006 however surface and sub surface hydrological systems are commonly treated as separate components of catchments graham and butts 2005 to advance our predictive capabilities we need to consider interactions between these two hydrological systems as demonstrated by several studies using both field based empirical analyses kalbus et al 2006 kuraś et al 2008 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 and numerical modelling bosson et al 2012 destouni 2007 dogrul et al 2016 lindgren et al 2004 yang et al 2017 this requires assessments of the impact of sub catchment heterogeneity and the partitioning of water across space and time brooks et al 2012a 2012b catchment responses to inter and intra annual variations of climate are in part regulated by landscape characteristics including variations in geology topography and vegetation nippgen et al 2011 sivapalan 2003 woods 2006 catchment geology affects the partitioning of surface and sub surface hydrological pathways through differences in soil porosity and the degree of soil saturation wu and selvadurai 2016 whereas local to regional topography strongly controls sub surface flow pathways at least in areas underlain by glacial drift rodhe and seibert 1999 in such areas the convergence of topography is an important mechanism causing spatial gradients in soil saturation grabs et al 2009 at larger scales this results in the partitioning of water into more recent and older groundwater contributions to river discharge tiwari et al 2017 vegetation is of fundamental importance for regulating losses through evapotranspiration et which varies naturally across a seasonal cycle the effects of vegetation are clearly seen in areas experiencing deforestation which commonly results in step increases in runoff andreassian 2004 but also in areas with shallow groundwater where transpiration has been shown to strongly influence the groundwater dynamics during dry periods bosson et al 2008 climatic conditions also play an important role in catchment hydrological responses in high latitude environments climatic conditions such as seasonal water storage snow melt and frozen soils drive annual patterns in catchment hydrology niu and yang 2006 snow depth is a major factor regulating ground temperature and consequently soil frost as the snow cover insulates the ground from cold air temperatures during the winter goodrich 1982 hardy et al 2001 oni et al 2017 frozen soils with high soil moisture content can act as an almost impermeable layer preventing infiltration and thaw more slowly than soils with lower water content brooks et al 2012b french 2007 woo 2012 the effect of soil frost is especially important during snowmelt events because the frozen ground allows only a limited amount of water to infiltrate and consequently produces more overland flow than with unfrozen soils brooks et al 2012b iwata et al 2011 orradottir et al 2008 depending on soil and vegetation characteristics the timing and potential influence of snow and soil frost processes on streamflow generation can differ between neighboring catchments with similar climates a common assumption in modelling runoff generation is that similar sub catchments situated close to each other respond in similar ways to hydrological forcing for example one common method for estimating volumetric discharge is to use the ratio of catchment areas to scale the observed discharge from one catchment to estimate the discharge from a similar catchment without observations archfield and vogel 2010 however as shown by karlsen et al 2016a b there can be large variability in area specific discharge between nearby sub catchments with seemingly similar characteristics the specific discharge variability can range up to an order of magnitude both on shorter and longer time scales suggesting that adjacent catchments may function very differently it has also been argued that the method of studying hydrological functioning on a whole watershed basis without process based insights into the contributions of their parts leaves a large gap in our understanding of surface and groundwater interactions and of the origin of runoff contributions payn et al 2012 to mechanistically describe the hydrology of catchments and enable accurate predictions of water quantity we need to move beyond previous attempts at modelling and include sub catchment specific information on hydrological functioning to improve our conceptual and mechanistic understanding of the role of sub catchment variability on high latitude watershed hydrology we quantified spatial and temporal variations in the various contributing parts as well as including representations of some dominant winter related processes to do this we used an empirically data rich boreal catchment the krycklan catchment that has available results from three decades of detailed hydrological and biogeochemical investigations from a large set of nested catchments laudon et al 2013 to undertake this investigation we used the integrated surface sub surface hydrological mike she model graham and butts 2005 previously mike she has successfully been applied in similar studies of temperate areas where winter processes largely could be ignored bosson et al 2012 2013 and in periglacial areas johansson et al 2015 where deep permafrost and active layer processes strongly influence the catchment hydrology however the mike she model has not previously been applied to catchment systems where seasonal soil frost and large snow accumulation and subsequent melt must be taken into account the main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that we need to consider sub catchment characteristics in combination with freeze thaw processes to explain differences in discharge and surface groundwater flow partitioning in a northern boreal catchment 2 methods 2 1 general site description krycklan 64 23 n 19 77 e 67 9 km2 is an extensively studied catchment used for multi disciplinary hydrology and ecology research and monitoring in northern boreal sweden laudon et al 2013 located in the subarctic climate zone kryklan has 30 year mean annual precipitation p and evapotranspiration et of 614 mm and 303 mm respectively laudon et al 2013 snow accumulates from late october to early may in most years resulting in a 30 year average annual snow cover of 167 days laudon and ottosson löfvenius 2016 the catchment area which is covered to 87 by forest consisting mainly of scots pine pinus sylvestris and norway spruce picea abies spans elevations from 405 m a s l in the northwest to 114 m a s l at the outlet in the southeastern part of the catchment the total sediment depth in the area varies between 5 and 40 m laudon et al 2013 sandy and silty tills are the dominant sediment types in the area particulary at higher altitudes where the tills are intertwined with lakes and peatlands which are in turn underlain by finer sediments fig 1 a due to higher hydraulic conductivity k in the upper part of the soil profile the main lateral transport of groundwater is assumed to occur in the first half meter of the till amvrosiadi et al 2017 bishop et al 2011 ågren et al 2014 at lower altitudes in the catchment sandy and silty glacial deposits with high k are the most common sediments fig 1a small streams both naturally formed and man made to improve forest productivity during the early 20th century ditching era connect the sub catchments to the river network hasselquist and lidberg 2017 kuglerová et al 2014 oni et al 2015 2 2 input data based on locally observed data and literature values on hydraulic properties table 2 and the conceptual model fig 1c a numerical model was established in mike she graham and butts 2005 we calibrated the mike she model based on time series of stream discharge and groundwater head data table 1 for the period 2009 01 01 to 2012 12 31 the mike she model consists of four compartments overland flow ol stream network unsaturated uz and saturated zone sz all components run simultaneously and exchange water between the different compartments during the simulation with a maximum time step of 1 h for the ol and uz compartments 3 h for the sz compartment and 5 s for the stream network compartment the horizontal resolution was set to 50 50 m and the vertical resolution varied from a couple of centimeters to several meters depending on depth soil type and saturation the model consists of 10 computational layers cls in general following the stratigraphy of the soil fig 1c three of the cls are located in the bedrock and seven in the soil due to the nature of the numerical implementation of et and uz processes in mike she the uppermost cl needs to have a thickness sufficient to capture the influence of et dynamics and the capillary rise of groundwater in this model application the thickness was set to 2 5 m resulting in an averaging of the shallowest part of the soil stratigraphy into one cl in the model to account for the observed high hydraulic conductivity in the upper 0 5 m of the till amvrosiadi et al 2017 bishop et al 2011 ågren et al 2014 a drainage function was activated in the model using the same method as implemented by bosson et al 2008 meteorological data drive the mike she model as they provide the upper boundary condition these data comprise locally observed time varying air temperature t p and pet table 3 p was corrected for wind and adhesion losses following alexandersson 2003 a no flow bottom boundary condition was applied at 100 m depth we assumed that surface and groundwater divides coincide applying no flow boundary conditions on the lateral boundaries except for the areas with postglacial sand in the low topography areas of the catchment fig 1a and b a fixed head was used in the western and eastern parts of the postglacial deposits at the catchment boundaries the fixed head boundary corresponded to the water level of nearby lakes at the western boundary and a mean value of groundwater head measurements at site c16 at the southeast boundary fig 1a cycling one hydrological year until quasi steady state conditions were reached defined the initial conditions for the model 2 3 modelling procedure and calibration we calibrated the mike she model based on time series of daily stream discharge and groundwater head data table 1 for the period 2009 01 01 to 2012 12 31 fourteen sub catchments have continuously monitored stream discharge karlsen et al 2016b the five sub catchments c2 c4 c5 c7 and c16 fig 1 are among the most studied locations within the catchment and together cover a representative range of the krycklan landscape heterogeneity laudon and sponseller 2017 these sub catchments were therefore used for calibration of our model while the remaining nine were used for model validation laudon et al 2013 fig 1 groundwater levels used for calibration and validation in this study have been manually measured at 15 groundwater wells using different intervals of measurement ranging from weekly to annual fig 1b table 1b hereafter base case b c refers to the mike she model described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 based on the methodology developed by aneljung and gustafsson 2007 and bosson et al 2008 the model was calibrated using four main steps each step resulted in an updated model version fig 2 although some of the sub catchments were the main targets for parts of the calibration the full scale model was run through all steps thus changes made in a calibration step were evaluated for specific sub catchments where the investigated process or characteristics were clearly propagated in the result but were then applied to the whole model domain the errors in discharge and hydraulic groundwater head results can be quantified by various methods bosson et al 2008 henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 and the choice of error estimation method depends on the main purpose of the model for this study the water balance and general model performance were the main interests which motivated the use of accumulated discharge error in all steps and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse as error estimation metrics for the discharge results in later steps appendix c if nse is below zero the observed mean is a better predictor than the model itself and if nse reaches its maximum value of one the model gives a perfect fit to observations krause and boyle 2005 henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 therefore the objective of the calibration was to achieve a nse value above zero and to minimize the accumulated discharge error to approximately 15 which we defined as satisfactory in relation to measurement uncertainties bosson et al 2008 groundwater heads are usually described using mean error me or mean absolute error mae and the accepted me and mae depends on the groundwater head variation of the catchment in the case of krycklan the groundwater head varied by approximately 1 2 m at each observation point by using the accumulated discharge error target of 15 the me and mae target for the groundwater head should be within 0 3 m it is recommended by henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 that use should be made of the performance criterion β that expresses the over under prediction in relation to the groundwater head difference in the full scale model range appendix c if the model has high fidelity β should have a value less than 0 01 the following section describes each step of the calibration procedure fig 2 with the aim of achieving the defined calibration targets 2 3 1 step 1 water balance on catchment and annual scale the first calibration target was to capture the overall water balance wb for the entire catchment the stream discharge at the krycklan outlet c16 fig 1a and previous studies on the long term water balance were used as calibration data the annual pet table 3 was higher than the estimated et presented in laudon et al 2013 500 mm compared to 300 mm earlier mike she studies showed that the pet used as input data was very similar to the simulated total et bosson et al 2008 applying the original pet data would have resulted in too much water being lost by et processes the lack of data on vegetation specific transpiration parameters motivated our decision to base the sensitivity analyses on the calculated pet input data instead of analyzing the et parameters used in mike she kristensen and jensen 1975 therefore the analysis was based on different magnitudes of reduced pet with the main target being to minimize the accumulated discharge error 2 3 2 step 2 groundwater head on a catchment and annual scale in the second calibration step fig 2 a sensitivity analysis was made of the hydrological properties of the dominant soil types in the area by increasing and decreasing their respective initial vertical horizontal hydraulic conductivity by a maximum factor of ten appendix a table a1 the main target was to minimize accumulated discharge error and the groundwater head mae and me 2 3 3 evaluation of steps 1 and 2 after steps 1 and 2 an evaluation was made to understand how the calibration at the full catchment scale had affected the water balance at a sub catchment scale the evaluation focused on the representative sub catchments c2 c4 c5 and c7 fig 1d calculated and observed discharges were analyzed using the accumulated discharge error the nse values and a visual analysis of the concordance between the observed and simulated discharge time series the analysis was made to ensure that the changes made in steps 1 and 2 were favorable also at the sub catchment scale 2 3 4 step 3 groundwater head and surface runoff at a sub catchment and intra annual scale in step 3 fig 2 the effects of hydraulic properties of the soils in the representative sub catchments were further analyzed peat is a dominant soil type in both c4 and c5 and also affects c7 only a few observations of peat have been made in krycklan including hydraulic properties depth and vegetation of the mires at sites c4 and c5 laudon et al 2013 lidman et al 2013 observations indicate a high porosity of the peat which results in high storage capacity in the peat dominated sub catchments therefore in step 3 an analysis of the influence of peat properties including drainable pore space and hydraulic conductivity appendix a table a2 was performed in this step our focus was on increasing nse for the discharge results while also making a visual comparison of simulated and measured time series 2 3 5 step 4 the influence of soil frost processes previous studies in krycklan indicate that the hydrological pathways during spring flood differ between forest dominated and mire dominated catchments with higher event water ratios in the latter laudon et al 2007 peralta tapia et al 2015 based on this observation a conceptual model was defined that specified the difference in the dominant hydrological processes related to soil freezing between mires and forest dominated areas fig 3 although there is no thermal component in mike she there is a method for implementing soil frost processes as presented by bosson et al 2010 and tested for permafrost areas by johansson et al 2015 in summary three main processes were identified as important in describing the hydrology under frozen conditions i ice accumulation on the ground surface ii reduced infiltration capacity of frozen soil and iii reduced transport capacity when soil is frozen in this study we focused on ii and iii since they are relevant for seasonally frozen conditions during the winter and spring these processes are described in the model by time varying properties of infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity driven by soil and air temperature bosson et al 2010 to analyze the range of effects from implementing such frost process representation for peatland and forest dominated areas we developed six sub cases 4a f table 4 stemming from the conceptual model fig 3 the purpose was to evaluate the impact of the level of frozen soil saturation on the infiltration and transport capacity during snowmelt observations indicate saturated conditions and water on the ground surface at the peatlands peralta tapia et al 2015 due to data limitations we therefore assumed that the thermal regime in the peatlands follows the same pattern as the lake ice in the catchment i e the duration of frost in the peatlands was modelled using time lapse photos of lake ice break up and air temperature data in the forested areas the frost duration was governed by the observed soil temperature data and we therefore assumed that the soil is affected by soil frost for temperatures below 0 c at a depth of 10 cm when data were missing at 10 cm depth data from 5 cm depth were used a reduced transport capacity was assumed during frozen soil conditions and the extra transport capacity in the upper 0 5 m of the model was reduced to zero during this period our main target for this step was to obtain a low accumulation of discharge errors and to achieve high values of nse for the stream discharge while also minimizing mae and me for the groundwater heads 3 results 3 1 step 1 water balance on a catchment and annual scale for the base case model the simulated accumulated discharge was 44 lower than observed and approximately 80 of the p left the model as et during the simulated years of 2009 2011 which was more than the long term annual average of 50 reported from the catchment laudon et al 2013 reducing the pet had a positive effect both on matching the accumulated discharge at c16 as well as on the conforming more closely to the observed overall water balance tables 5 and 6 a to reach a water balance in which approximately 50 of the p converts to et on the full catchment scale the pet had to be reduced to 40 of the original input data table 3 after this change of the pet step 1 the accumulated discharge error was reduced to 3 and the ratio between the actual evaporation and p was reduced to approximately 50 table 5 note that during 2012 when an annual p of 880 mm was experienced the evapotranspiration precipitation ratio was lower than 50 after the reduction of the pet the reduced pet was used in later calibration steps since it gave the optimal water balance result for c16 3 2 step 2 groundwater head on a catchment and annual scale the groundwater calibration in step 2 focused mainly on the hydraulic properties of the dominant soil types in the area till silt clay and sand a reduction of the hydrological conductivities in the upper parts of the till had a positive effect on prediction of the groundwater heads and dynamics around site c7 fig 4 a and b and on the me and mae values table 6b an increase of the horizontal conductivity in the sand and the vertical conductivity in the silt clay resulted in the groundwater heads reaching the observed values in wells 501 and 601 fig 4c and d the changes also gave a positive effect at c16 concerning peak stream discharge during intense rain e g autumn of 2012 fig 4e 3 3 evaluation of step 1 and 2 the model efficiency values nse increased for all sub catchments when comparing results from step 1 and step 2 table 6 however c4 still had a value below zero which indicates that the model is not accurately representing this sub catchment these calibration steps step 1 and step 2 affected c2 and c7 the most for example the c2 accumulated discharge error reduced from 28 to 6 table 6a and the impact of rain events on peak stream discharges was also reduced e g during the autumn of 2012 fig 5 a in that sense calibration step 2 improved the results of step 1 in contrast sites c4 and c5 exhibited smaller changes than for c2 and c7 both in peak stream discharges during rain events and accumulated discharge table 6a and fig 5a d in summary we could see the largest differences between step 1 and step 2 in the forest dominated sub catchments 3 4 step 3 groundwater head and surface runoff at a sub catchment and intra annual scale in step 3 a higher porosity and storage capacity of peat was introduced in the model this had a positive effect on the modelling results obtained for sites c4 and c5 by reducing the peak discharges during rain events fig 6 a b and generally increasing the model efficiency for all sites except for site c5 table 6a however a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat also reduced the amount of water reaching the streams during snowmelt which increased the accumulated discharge error in spring fig 7 c and appendix b table b1 a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat also provided the streams at site c4 and c5 with more water as groundwater flow than upstream flow during snowmelt as compared with case 2 fig 7d in summary a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat improved the results during rain events but worsened the results during spring especially for c5 which had the largest accumulated flow reduction from an error of 21 to 41 appendix b table b1 3 5 step 4 the influence of soil frost processes reducing the infiltration rate during winter for the peatlands resulted in a higher proportion of water arriving as overland flow to the stream during snowmelt fig 7d and e by also applying a decreased transport capacity of the soil even less water infiltrated during snowmelt and in total more water arrived to the peatland streams which is in line with empirical observations laudon et al 2007 compared with peatlands introduction of soil frost processes in the model did not improve the result for areas dominated by forest for example a reduction of the transport capacity of the soil resulted in a delayed effect of the snowmelt 7a some of the groundwater wells also exhibited an increased groundwater head during the winter periods fig 7b which has not been observed in the area case 4e had the most promising results increasing the amount of water that the streams received while keeping the nse values for the discharge high and maintaining the me and mae for the groundwater flow at most sites table 6b the effect is mostly visible during the spring period when e g c5 showed a reduction in its accumulated discharge error from 41 to 25 appendix b table b1 3 6 validation and final calibrated values the final model case 4e has a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat with peat that freezes during the winter months it includes a reduction in the extra horizontal flow in the upper part of the peat as well as introducing an impermeable soil frost layer this model case was most successful at both reproducing accumulated discharge at the streams outlets of the sub catchments fig 8 as well as reproducing the groundwater fluctuations and peak discharges during the calibration period table 7 we tested the performance of the model using the validation period of 2013 2014 as well as the remaining nine sub catchments fig 8 and table 6 generally the nse value improved between cases 2 and 3 also the accumulated error improved between case 3 and 4 while keeping the nse values above zero and still higher than in case 2 table 6 the average accumulated discharge error for the calibration catchments c2 c4 c5 c7 and c16 combined was 0 7 for the total model period 2009 2014 with the largest accumulated errors arising from c5 and c7 table 6a which both had a final error above the target of 15 looking at all gauged sites in krycklan however 80 of the catchments had an accumulated discharge error of lower than 15 all with final nse values above zero and with an average nse value of 0 6 furthermore the model appendix b fig b1 has also captured specific discharge patterns for the sub catchments the average mae values for the groundwater head results were approximately 0 3 m for the total model period 2009 2014 and in total 70 of the simulated wells had a mae lower or equal to the 0 3 m target for the simulated years the maximum observed groundwater head 257 m a s l occurred at well 101 and the lowest observed groundwater head 170 m a s l occurred at well 601 giving an overall difference in groundwater head δhmax of 87 m this together with the average me for the total simulated period at 0 12 m gave a β value of 0 0014 which is below the 0 01 target meaning that the simulated values have high fidelity table 6b appendix c 4 discussion our final model of the krycklan catchment was successful in recreating observed accumulated discharge and groundwater patterns on both an inter and intra annual scale this study demonstrates the importance of considering processes and characteristics on a sub catchment scale furthermore the results illustrate that catchments are complex systems with different hydrological processes interacting in both time and space 4 1 overland water and groundwater partitioning generally our model was successful in simulating groundwater and streamflow observations for all years for example site c2 received less specific discharge than c4 and c5 which is in accordance with the empirical data large variability in specific discharge between the krycklan sub catchments has previously also been observed by karlsen et al 2016a b based on 5 years of monitoring data in that case the annual differences in specific discharge among catchments were linked to the spatial variation of snow accumulation and et in this study the variations in specific discharges were explained by the surface and groundwater interactions on an annual and intra annual time scale using a numerical integrated model although the p and et are similar between the sub catchments appendix b fig b2 table b3 the modelled specific discharge varied according to model results appendix b fig b3 the water that is not lost by et or exported as local river discharge mainly contributes to changes in groundwater storage and to groundwater flow exiting the sub catchments the water that leaves its corresponding sub catchment as groundwater flow without adding water to the rivers i e through deeper flow paths explains the variability in recharge to the streams differences in sub catchment characteristics such as soil properties and freeze thaw processes can explain this groundwater flow variability 4 2 model discrepancies the main deviations between observed and calibrated specific discharge are most clearly visible when comparing 2011 and 2013 appendix b table b2 the year 2011 had low p and high et compared with the annual average values resulting in low runoff to the rivers in contrast 2012 had high precipitation and low et resulting in more runoff to the rivers than average although 2013 had precipitation and et values close to the long term annual average laudon et al 2013 the simulated river runoff was higher than observed the explanation for this is the variability in storage where excess water from the wet 2012 remained in the catchment during 2013 resulting in increased modelled runoff even at the sub catchment scale appendix b fig b1 although there were deviations between simulated results and observations the main pattern of specific discharge differences between sub catchments was well captured appendix b fig b1 what was important in achieving this result was our recognition of the role of heterogeneous landscape processes including variability in soil frost to explain the remaining deviations between simulated results and observations we need to further investigate sub catchment processes and characteristics so that model discrepancies can be reduced in future studies the remaining deviations may be due to lack of specific information regarding et differences between sub catchments and this is yet to be included in the model deviations may also occur due to sub catchment characteristics and processes not yet included in the model such as lake ice mainly affecting c5 and c15 and the detailed composition of the glacial deposits mainly affecting c14 4 3 the importance of soil characteristics and soil frost peat is the most influential soil type with regard to its effect on peak stream flows during rain events fig 6 however the importance of this soil type was overlooked in step 1 and step 2 due to the full scale calibration approach adopted which supports the relevance of undertaking sub catchment scale investigations a higher porosity and storage capacity of the peat reduces the impact of peak flows and allows for more infiltration in the area by the introduction of soil frost in the peatland areas more of the water arrived as overland flow increasing the volume of water to the streams fig 7 introduction of peat with higher porosity and storage capacity as well soil frost improved the results in contrast to peatlands neither a reduced infiltration capacity nor a reduced transport capacity improved the result in forest dominated areas by reducing the infiltration capacity of the soil in case 4b more water arrived as overland flow to the streams which is in agreement with observations at the groundwater wells and the gauging stations for the forested sub catchments fig 7a and b reducing the horizontal flow during winter in case 4d delayed the water reaching the streams resulting in a delayed discharge response and smaller fluctuations in groundwater head than were observed fig 7a and b this indicates that soil frost does not significantly influence the groundwater flow in forested areas the low water content at freezing therefore allows snowmelt water to infiltrate the soil despite frozen conditions which is in line with observations nyberg et al 2001 laudon 2004 peralta tapia et al 2015 studies made in continuous and discontinuous permafrost environments have suggested that soil frost reduces infiltration and increases surface runoff during snowmelt hayashi et al 2004 mcnamara et al 1997 metcalfe and buttle 2001 furthermore at krycklan studies including stream water tracer analyses have indicated that soil frost is a significantly important factor for surface and groundwater partitioning especially in peatland areas buffam et al 2007 laudon et al 2007 for example laudon et al 2007 concluded that the composition of surface water and groundwater in streams during spring flood varies depending on landscape characteristics in the sub catchments of the studied area by using a stable isotope analysis of stream water the study suggested that at c2 where till is the main soil type the spring stream water is dominated by groundwater whereas at c4 which is peatland dominated the spring flood is dominated by overland flow we argue that due to a higher saturation level when peatlands freeze the soil becomes less permeable and in some situations impermeable compared with soils with a lower saturation level peralta tapia et al 2015 by introducing soil frost processes in the model and analyzing the effects on surface and groundwater partitioning our study supports the findings of laudon et al 2007 who suggested that catchment characteristics and soil frost processes are important factors concerning surface and groundwater partitioning 4 4 evapotranspiration characteristics pet had the largest influence on the overall water balance by stepwise decreasing the pet more water is partitioned as runoff which allowed results to be obtained that were comparable with the observed data however there are uncertainties concerning the pet these uncertainties originate from the method used to calculate the pet and how the pet is implemented in the model for the whole catchment we used a spatially uniform but time varying pet due to scarce information on the spatial distribution of the et although the model takes differences in the catchment characteristics into account the model calculated et remained approximately the same between sub catchments appendix b table b3 some differences between sub catchments can however be seen when comparing et contributions mainly when comparing interception and surface water evaporation contributions in summary et may have a significant role in creating the model calculated differences in specific discharge between sub catchments since there are some discrepancies between the model and observations in a previous study of the krycklan catchment et was identified as one of the main processes that explained the observed differences in specific discharge between sub catchments karlsen et al 2016a b however since the model in the present study could capture the overall pattern of differences in specific discharges despite the total et being approximately equal between different sub catchments groundwater storage change and deep groundwater flow path may also have significant roles as discussed in section 4 1 5 conclusions in this study we have highlighted the role of sub catchment heterogeneity we found that local variations in hydraulic properties and seasonal processes are important at both a sub catchment and a full catchment scale although there are deviations between simulated results and observations our current mike she model was able to capture the observed differences in groundwater level fluctuations and specific discharge patterns within the krycklan catchment because the simulated et was similar between sub catchments the main factor determining the specific discharge of a sub catchment is its groundwater processes influenced by the hydraulic properties of the soils and soil frost processes we have also shown that these characteristics have important influences on the partitioning of surface water and groundwater which is a key consideration in the further study of biogeochemical cycling in this catchment to capture the different small scale processes this study

7337,groundwater and surface water interactions are regulated by catchment characteristics and complex inter and intra annual variations in climatic conditions that are not yet fully understood our objective was to investigate the influence of catchment characteristics and freeze thaw processes on surface and groundwater interactions in a boreal landscape the krycklan catchment in sweden we used a numerical modelling approach and sub catchment evaluation method to identify and evaluate fundamental catchment characteristics and processes the model reproduced observed stream discharge patterns of the 14 sub catchments and the dynamics of the 15 groundwater wells with an average accumulated discharge error of 1 15 standard deviation and an average groundwater level mean error of 0 1 m 0 23 m standard deviation we show how peatland characteristics dampen the effect of intense rain and how soil freeze thaw processes regulate surface and groundwater partitioning during snowmelt with these results we demonstrate the importance of defining understanding and quantifying the role of landscape heterogeneity and sub catchment characteristics for accurately representing catchment hydrological functioning keywords runoff generation mike she krycklan water balance soil frost catchment 1 introduction interactions between surface waters and groundwater are controlled by several complex and interacting processes that relate to biological and physical characteristics of the catchment as well as intra and inter annual variations in climatic conditions knutsson and morfeldt 2002 sophocleous 2002 woods 2006 however surface and sub surface hydrological systems are commonly treated as separate components of catchments graham and butts 2005 to advance our predictive capabilities we need to consider interactions between these two hydrological systems as demonstrated by several studies using both field based empirical analyses kalbus et al 2006 kuraś et al 2008 zimmer and mcglynn 2017 and numerical modelling bosson et al 2012 destouni 2007 dogrul et al 2016 lindgren et al 2004 yang et al 2017 this requires assessments of the impact of sub catchment heterogeneity and the partitioning of water across space and time brooks et al 2012a 2012b catchment responses to inter and intra annual variations of climate are in part regulated by landscape characteristics including variations in geology topography and vegetation nippgen et al 2011 sivapalan 2003 woods 2006 catchment geology affects the partitioning of surface and sub surface hydrological pathways through differences in soil porosity and the degree of soil saturation wu and selvadurai 2016 whereas local to regional topography strongly controls sub surface flow pathways at least in areas underlain by glacial drift rodhe and seibert 1999 in such areas the convergence of topography is an important mechanism causing spatial gradients in soil saturation grabs et al 2009 at larger scales this results in the partitioning of water into more recent and older groundwater contributions to river discharge tiwari et al 2017 vegetation is of fundamental importance for regulating losses through evapotranspiration et which varies naturally across a seasonal cycle the effects of vegetation are clearly seen in areas experiencing deforestation which commonly results in step increases in runoff andreassian 2004 but also in areas with shallow groundwater where transpiration has been shown to strongly influence the groundwater dynamics during dry periods bosson et al 2008 climatic conditions also play an important role in catchment hydrological responses in high latitude environments climatic conditions such as seasonal water storage snow melt and frozen soils drive annual patterns in catchment hydrology niu and yang 2006 snow depth is a major factor regulating ground temperature and consequently soil frost as the snow cover insulates the ground from cold air temperatures during the winter goodrich 1982 hardy et al 2001 oni et al 2017 frozen soils with high soil moisture content can act as an almost impermeable layer preventing infiltration and thaw more slowly than soils with lower water content brooks et al 2012b french 2007 woo 2012 the effect of soil frost is especially important during snowmelt events because the frozen ground allows only a limited amount of water to infiltrate and consequently produces more overland flow than with unfrozen soils brooks et al 2012b iwata et al 2011 orradottir et al 2008 depending on soil and vegetation characteristics the timing and potential influence of snow and soil frost processes on streamflow generation can differ between neighboring catchments with similar climates a common assumption in modelling runoff generation is that similar sub catchments situated close to each other respond in similar ways to hydrological forcing for example one common method for estimating volumetric discharge is to use the ratio of catchment areas to scale the observed discharge from one catchment to estimate the discharge from a similar catchment without observations archfield and vogel 2010 however as shown by karlsen et al 2016a b there can be large variability in area specific discharge between nearby sub catchments with seemingly similar characteristics the specific discharge variability can range up to an order of magnitude both on shorter and longer time scales suggesting that adjacent catchments may function very differently it has also been argued that the method of studying hydrological functioning on a whole watershed basis without process based insights into the contributions of their parts leaves a large gap in our understanding of surface and groundwater interactions and of the origin of runoff contributions payn et al 2012 to mechanistically describe the hydrology of catchments and enable accurate predictions of water quantity we need to move beyond previous attempts at modelling and include sub catchment specific information on hydrological functioning to improve our conceptual and mechanistic understanding of the role of sub catchment variability on high latitude watershed hydrology we quantified spatial and temporal variations in the various contributing parts as well as including representations of some dominant winter related processes to do this we used an empirically data rich boreal catchment the krycklan catchment that has available results from three decades of detailed hydrological and biogeochemical investigations from a large set of nested catchments laudon et al 2013 to undertake this investigation we used the integrated surface sub surface hydrological mike she model graham and butts 2005 previously mike she has successfully been applied in similar studies of temperate areas where winter processes largely could be ignored bosson et al 2012 2013 and in periglacial areas johansson et al 2015 where deep permafrost and active layer processes strongly influence the catchment hydrology however the mike she model has not previously been applied to catchment systems where seasonal soil frost and large snow accumulation and subsequent melt must be taken into account the main purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that we need to consider sub catchment characteristics in combination with freeze thaw processes to explain differences in discharge and surface groundwater flow partitioning in a northern boreal catchment 2 methods 2 1 general site description krycklan 64 23 n 19 77 e 67 9 km2 is an extensively studied catchment used for multi disciplinary hydrology and ecology research and monitoring in northern boreal sweden laudon et al 2013 located in the subarctic climate zone kryklan has 30 year mean annual precipitation p and evapotranspiration et of 614 mm and 303 mm respectively laudon et al 2013 snow accumulates from late october to early may in most years resulting in a 30 year average annual snow cover of 167 days laudon and ottosson löfvenius 2016 the catchment area which is covered to 87 by forest consisting mainly of scots pine pinus sylvestris and norway spruce picea abies spans elevations from 405 m a s l in the northwest to 114 m a s l at the outlet in the southeastern part of the catchment the total sediment depth in the area varies between 5 and 40 m laudon et al 2013 sandy and silty tills are the dominant sediment types in the area particulary at higher altitudes where the tills are intertwined with lakes and peatlands which are in turn underlain by finer sediments fig 1 a due to higher hydraulic conductivity k in the upper part of the soil profile the main lateral transport of groundwater is assumed to occur in the first half meter of the till amvrosiadi et al 2017 bishop et al 2011 ågren et al 2014 at lower altitudes in the catchment sandy and silty glacial deposits with high k are the most common sediments fig 1a small streams both naturally formed and man made to improve forest productivity during the early 20th century ditching era connect the sub catchments to the river network hasselquist and lidberg 2017 kuglerová et al 2014 oni et al 2015 2 2 input data based on locally observed data and literature values on hydraulic properties table 2 and the conceptual model fig 1c a numerical model was established in mike she graham and butts 2005 we calibrated the mike she model based on time series of stream discharge and groundwater head data table 1 for the period 2009 01 01 to 2012 12 31 the mike she model consists of four compartments overland flow ol stream network unsaturated uz and saturated zone sz all components run simultaneously and exchange water between the different compartments during the simulation with a maximum time step of 1 h for the ol and uz compartments 3 h for the sz compartment and 5 s for the stream network compartment the horizontal resolution was set to 50 50 m and the vertical resolution varied from a couple of centimeters to several meters depending on depth soil type and saturation the model consists of 10 computational layers cls in general following the stratigraphy of the soil fig 1c three of the cls are located in the bedrock and seven in the soil due to the nature of the numerical implementation of et and uz processes in mike she the uppermost cl needs to have a thickness sufficient to capture the influence of et dynamics and the capillary rise of groundwater in this model application the thickness was set to 2 5 m resulting in an averaging of the shallowest part of the soil stratigraphy into one cl in the model to account for the observed high hydraulic conductivity in the upper 0 5 m of the till amvrosiadi et al 2017 bishop et al 2011 ågren et al 2014 a drainage function was activated in the model using the same method as implemented by bosson et al 2008 meteorological data drive the mike she model as they provide the upper boundary condition these data comprise locally observed time varying air temperature t p and pet table 3 p was corrected for wind and adhesion losses following alexandersson 2003 a no flow bottom boundary condition was applied at 100 m depth we assumed that surface and groundwater divides coincide applying no flow boundary conditions on the lateral boundaries except for the areas with postglacial sand in the low topography areas of the catchment fig 1a and b a fixed head was used in the western and eastern parts of the postglacial deposits at the catchment boundaries the fixed head boundary corresponded to the water level of nearby lakes at the western boundary and a mean value of groundwater head measurements at site c16 at the southeast boundary fig 1a cycling one hydrological year until quasi steady state conditions were reached defined the initial conditions for the model 2 3 modelling procedure and calibration we calibrated the mike she model based on time series of daily stream discharge and groundwater head data table 1 for the period 2009 01 01 to 2012 12 31 fourteen sub catchments have continuously monitored stream discharge karlsen et al 2016b the five sub catchments c2 c4 c5 c7 and c16 fig 1 are among the most studied locations within the catchment and together cover a representative range of the krycklan landscape heterogeneity laudon and sponseller 2017 these sub catchments were therefore used for calibration of our model while the remaining nine were used for model validation laudon et al 2013 fig 1 groundwater levels used for calibration and validation in this study have been manually measured at 15 groundwater wells using different intervals of measurement ranging from weekly to annual fig 1b table 1b hereafter base case b c refers to the mike she model described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 based on the methodology developed by aneljung and gustafsson 2007 and bosson et al 2008 the model was calibrated using four main steps each step resulted in an updated model version fig 2 although some of the sub catchments were the main targets for parts of the calibration the full scale model was run through all steps thus changes made in a calibration step were evaluated for specific sub catchments where the investigated process or characteristics were clearly propagated in the result but were then applied to the whole model domain the errors in discharge and hydraulic groundwater head results can be quantified by various methods bosson et al 2008 henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 and the choice of error estimation method depends on the main purpose of the model for this study the water balance and general model performance were the main interests which motivated the use of accumulated discharge error in all steps and the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse as error estimation metrics for the discharge results in later steps appendix c if nse is below zero the observed mean is a better predictor than the model itself and if nse reaches its maximum value of one the model gives a perfect fit to observations krause and boyle 2005 henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 therefore the objective of the calibration was to achieve a nse value above zero and to minimize the accumulated discharge error to approximately 15 which we defined as satisfactory in relation to measurement uncertainties bosson et al 2008 groundwater heads are usually described using mean error me or mean absolute error mae and the accepted me and mae depends on the groundwater head variation of the catchment in the case of krycklan the groundwater head varied by approximately 1 2 m at each observation point by using the accumulated discharge error target of 15 the me and mae target for the groundwater head should be within 0 3 m it is recommended by henriksen and sonnenborg 2005 that use should be made of the performance criterion β that expresses the over under prediction in relation to the groundwater head difference in the full scale model range appendix c if the model has high fidelity β should have a value less than 0 01 the following section describes each step of the calibration procedure fig 2 with the aim of achieving the defined calibration targets 2 3 1 step 1 water balance on catchment and annual scale the first calibration target was to capture the overall water balance wb for the entire catchment the stream discharge at the krycklan outlet c16 fig 1a and previous studies on the long term water balance were used as calibration data the annual pet table 3 was higher than the estimated et presented in laudon et al 2013 500 mm compared to 300 mm earlier mike she studies showed that the pet used as input data was very similar to the simulated total et bosson et al 2008 applying the original pet data would have resulted in too much water being lost by et processes the lack of data on vegetation specific transpiration parameters motivated our decision to base the sensitivity analyses on the calculated pet input data instead of analyzing the et parameters used in mike she kristensen and jensen 1975 therefore the analysis was based on different magnitudes of reduced pet with the main target being to minimize the accumulated discharge error 2 3 2 step 2 groundwater head on a catchment and annual scale in the second calibration step fig 2 a sensitivity analysis was made of the hydrological properties of the dominant soil types in the area by increasing and decreasing their respective initial vertical horizontal hydraulic conductivity by a maximum factor of ten appendix a table a1 the main target was to minimize accumulated discharge error and the groundwater head mae and me 2 3 3 evaluation of steps 1 and 2 after steps 1 and 2 an evaluation was made to understand how the calibration at the full catchment scale had affected the water balance at a sub catchment scale the evaluation focused on the representative sub catchments c2 c4 c5 and c7 fig 1d calculated and observed discharges were analyzed using the accumulated discharge error the nse values and a visual analysis of the concordance between the observed and simulated discharge time series the analysis was made to ensure that the changes made in steps 1 and 2 were favorable also at the sub catchment scale 2 3 4 step 3 groundwater head and surface runoff at a sub catchment and intra annual scale in step 3 fig 2 the effects of hydraulic properties of the soils in the representative sub catchments were further analyzed peat is a dominant soil type in both c4 and c5 and also affects c7 only a few observations of peat have been made in krycklan including hydraulic properties depth and vegetation of the mires at sites c4 and c5 laudon et al 2013 lidman et al 2013 observations indicate a high porosity of the peat which results in high storage capacity in the peat dominated sub catchments therefore in step 3 an analysis of the influence of peat properties including drainable pore space and hydraulic conductivity appendix a table a2 was performed in this step our focus was on increasing nse for the discharge results while also making a visual comparison of simulated and measured time series 2 3 5 step 4 the influence of soil frost processes previous studies in krycklan indicate that the hydrological pathways during spring flood differ between forest dominated and mire dominated catchments with higher event water ratios in the latter laudon et al 2007 peralta tapia et al 2015 based on this observation a conceptual model was defined that specified the difference in the dominant hydrological processes related to soil freezing between mires and forest dominated areas fig 3 although there is no thermal component in mike she there is a method for implementing soil frost processes as presented by bosson et al 2010 and tested for permafrost areas by johansson et al 2015 in summary three main processes were identified as important in describing the hydrology under frozen conditions i ice accumulation on the ground surface ii reduced infiltration capacity of frozen soil and iii reduced transport capacity when soil is frozen in this study we focused on ii and iii since they are relevant for seasonally frozen conditions during the winter and spring these processes are described in the model by time varying properties of infiltration capacity and hydraulic conductivity driven by soil and air temperature bosson et al 2010 to analyze the range of effects from implementing such frost process representation for peatland and forest dominated areas we developed six sub cases 4a f table 4 stemming from the conceptual model fig 3 the purpose was to evaluate the impact of the level of frozen soil saturation on the infiltration and transport capacity during snowmelt observations indicate saturated conditions and water on the ground surface at the peatlands peralta tapia et al 2015 due to data limitations we therefore assumed that the thermal regime in the peatlands follows the same pattern as the lake ice in the catchment i e the duration of frost in the peatlands was modelled using time lapse photos of lake ice break up and air temperature data in the forested areas the frost duration was governed by the observed soil temperature data and we therefore assumed that the soil is affected by soil frost for temperatures below 0 c at a depth of 10 cm when data were missing at 10 cm depth data from 5 cm depth were used a reduced transport capacity was assumed during frozen soil conditions and the extra transport capacity in the upper 0 5 m of the model was reduced to zero during this period our main target for this step was to obtain a low accumulation of discharge errors and to achieve high values of nse for the stream discharge while also minimizing mae and me for the groundwater heads 3 results 3 1 step 1 water balance on a catchment and annual scale for the base case model the simulated accumulated discharge was 44 lower than observed and approximately 80 of the p left the model as et during the simulated years of 2009 2011 which was more than the long term annual average of 50 reported from the catchment laudon et al 2013 reducing the pet had a positive effect both on matching the accumulated discharge at c16 as well as on the conforming more closely to the observed overall water balance tables 5 and 6 a to reach a water balance in which approximately 50 of the p converts to et on the full catchment scale the pet had to be reduced to 40 of the original input data table 3 after this change of the pet step 1 the accumulated discharge error was reduced to 3 and the ratio between the actual evaporation and p was reduced to approximately 50 table 5 note that during 2012 when an annual p of 880 mm was experienced the evapotranspiration precipitation ratio was lower than 50 after the reduction of the pet the reduced pet was used in later calibration steps since it gave the optimal water balance result for c16 3 2 step 2 groundwater head on a catchment and annual scale the groundwater calibration in step 2 focused mainly on the hydraulic properties of the dominant soil types in the area till silt clay and sand a reduction of the hydrological conductivities in the upper parts of the till had a positive effect on prediction of the groundwater heads and dynamics around site c7 fig 4 a and b and on the me and mae values table 6b an increase of the horizontal conductivity in the sand and the vertical conductivity in the silt clay resulted in the groundwater heads reaching the observed values in wells 501 and 601 fig 4c and d the changes also gave a positive effect at c16 concerning peak stream discharge during intense rain e g autumn of 2012 fig 4e 3 3 evaluation of step 1 and 2 the model efficiency values nse increased for all sub catchments when comparing results from step 1 and step 2 table 6 however c4 still had a value below zero which indicates that the model is not accurately representing this sub catchment these calibration steps step 1 and step 2 affected c2 and c7 the most for example the c2 accumulated discharge error reduced from 28 to 6 table 6a and the impact of rain events on peak stream discharges was also reduced e g during the autumn of 2012 fig 5 a in that sense calibration step 2 improved the results of step 1 in contrast sites c4 and c5 exhibited smaller changes than for c2 and c7 both in peak stream discharges during rain events and accumulated discharge table 6a and fig 5a d in summary we could see the largest differences between step 1 and step 2 in the forest dominated sub catchments 3 4 step 3 groundwater head and surface runoff at a sub catchment and intra annual scale in step 3 a higher porosity and storage capacity of peat was introduced in the model this had a positive effect on the modelling results obtained for sites c4 and c5 by reducing the peak discharges during rain events fig 6 a b and generally increasing the model efficiency for all sites except for site c5 table 6a however a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat also reduced the amount of water reaching the streams during snowmelt which increased the accumulated discharge error in spring fig 7 c and appendix b table b1 a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat also provided the streams at site c4 and c5 with more water as groundwater flow than upstream flow during snowmelt as compared with case 2 fig 7d in summary a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat improved the results during rain events but worsened the results during spring especially for c5 which had the largest accumulated flow reduction from an error of 21 to 41 appendix b table b1 3 5 step 4 the influence of soil frost processes reducing the infiltration rate during winter for the peatlands resulted in a higher proportion of water arriving as overland flow to the stream during snowmelt fig 7d and e by also applying a decreased transport capacity of the soil even less water infiltrated during snowmelt and in total more water arrived to the peatland streams which is in line with empirical observations laudon et al 2007 compared with peatlands introduction of soil frost processes in the model did not improve the result for areas dominated by forest for example a reduction of the transport capacity of the soil resulted in a delayed effect of the snowmelt 7a some of the groundwater wells also exhibited an increased groundwater head during the winter periods fig 7b which has not been observed in the area case 4e had the most promising results increasing the amount of water that the streams received while keeping the nse values for the discharge high and maintaining the me and mae for the groundwater flow at most sites table 6b the effect is mostly visible during the spring period when e g c5 showed a reduction in its accumulated discharge error from 41 to 25 appendix b table b1 3 6 validation and final calibrated values the final model case 4e has a high porosity and storage capacity of the peat with peat that freezes during the winter months it includes a reduction in the extra horizontal flow in the upper part of the peat as well as introducing an impermeable soil frost layer this model case was most successful at both reproducing accumulated discharge at the streams outlets of the sub catchments fig 8 as well as reproducing the groundwater fluctuations and peak discharges during the calibration period table 7 we tested the performance of the model using the validation period of 2013 2014 as well as the remaining nine sub catchments fig 8 and table 6 generally the nse value improved between cases 2 and 3 also the accumulated error improved between case 3 and 4 while keeping the nse values above zero and still higher than in case 2 table 6 the average accumulated discharge error for the calibration catchments c2 c4 c5 c7 and c16 combined was 0 7 for the total model period 2009 2014 with the largest accumulated errors arising from c5 and c7 table 6a which both had a final error above the target of 15 looking at all gauged sites in krycklan however 80 of the catchments had an accumulated discharge error of lower than 15 all with final nse values above zero and with an average nse value of 0 6 furthermore the model appendix b fig b1 has also captured specific discharge patterns for the sub catchments the average mae values for the groundwater head results were approximately 0 3 m for the total model period 2009 2014 and in total 70 of the simulated wells had a mae lower or equal to the 0 3 m target for the simulated years the maximum observed groundwater head 257 m a s l occurred at well 101 and the lowest observed groundwater head 170 m a s l occurred at well 601 giving an overall difference in groundwater head δhmax of 87 m this together with the average me for the total simulated period at 0 12 m gave a β value of 0 0014 which is below the 0 01 target meaning that the simulated values have high fidelity table 6b appendix c 4 discussion our final model of the krycklan catchment was successful in recreating observed accumulated discharge and groundwater patterns on both an inter and intra annual scale this study demonstrates the importance of considering processes and characteristics on a sub catchment scale furthermore the results illustrate that catchments are complex systems with different hydrological processes interacting in both time and space 4 1 overland water and groundwater partitioning generally our model was successful in simulating groundwater and streamflow observations for all years for example site c2 received less specific discharge than c4 and c5 which is in accordance with the empirical data large variability in specific discharge between the krycklan sub catchments has previously also been observed by karlsen et al 2016a b based on 5 years of monitoring data in that case the annual differences in specific discharge among catchments were linked to the spatial variation of snow accumulation and et in this study the variations in specific discharges were explained by the surface and groundwater interactions on an annual and intra annual time scale using a numerical integrated model although the p and et are similar between the sub catchments appendix b fig b2 table b3 the modelled specific discharge varied according to model results appendix b fig b3 the water that is not lost by et or exported as local river discharge mainly contributes to changes in groundwater storage and to groundwater flow exiting the sub catchments the water that leaves its corresponding sub catchment as groundwater flow without adding water to the rivers i e through deeper flow paths explains the variability in recharge to the streams differences in sub catchment characteristics such as soil properties and freeze thaw processes can explain this groundwater flow variability 4 2 model discrepancies the main deviations between observed and calibrated specific discharge are most clearly visible when comparing 2011 and 2013 appendix b table b2 the year 2011 had low p and high et compared with the annual average values resulting in low runoff to the rivers in contrast 2012 had high precipitation and low et resulting in more runoff to the rivers than average although 2013 had precipitation and et values close to the long term annual average laudon et al 2013 the simulated river runoff was higher than observed the explanation for this is the variability in storage where excess water from the wet 2012 remained in the catchment during 2013 resulting in increased modelled runoff even at the sub catchment scale appendix b fig b1 although there were deviations between simulated results and observations the main pattern of specific discharge differences between sub catchments was well captured appendix b fig b1 what was important in achieving this result was our recognition of the role of heterogeneous landscape processes including variability in soil frost to explain the remaining deviations between simulated results and observations we need to further investigate sub catchment processes and characteristics so that model discrepancies can be reduced in future studies the remaining deviations may be due to lack of specific information regarding et differences between sub catchments and this is yet to be included in the model deviations may also occur due to sub catchment characteristics and processes not yet included in the model such as lake ice mainly affecting c5 and c15 and the detailed composition of the glacial deposits mainly affecting c14 4 3 the importance of soil characteristics and soil frost peat is the most influential soil type with regard to its effect on peak stream flows during rain events fig 6 however the importance of this soil type was overlooked in step 1 and step 2 due to the full scale calibration approach adopted which supports the relevance of undertaking sub catchment scale investigations a higher porosity and storage capacity of the peat reduces the impact of peak flows and allows for more infiltration in the area by the introduction of soil frost in the peatland areas more of the water arrived as overland flow increasing the volume of water to the streams fig 7 introduction of peat with higher porosity and storage capacity as well soil frost improved the results in contrast to peatlands neither a reduced infiltration capacity nor a reduced transport capacity improved the result in forest dominated areas by reducing the infiltration capacity of the soil in case 4b more water arrived as overland flow to the streams which is in agreement with observations at the groundwater wells and the gauging stations for the forested sub catchments fig 7a and b reducing the horizontal flow during winter in case 4d delayed the water reaching the streams resulting in a delayed discharge response and smaller fluctuations in groundwater head than were observed fig 7a and b this indicates that soil frost does not significantly influence the groundwater flow in forested areas the low water content at freezing therefore allows snowmelt water to infiltrate the soil despite frozen conditions which is in line with observations nyberg et al 2001 laudon 2004 peralta tapia et al 2015 studies made in continuous and discontinuous permafrost environments have suggested that soil frost reduces infiltration and increases surface runoff during snowmelt hayashi et al 2004 mcnamara et al 1997 metcalfe and buttle 2001 furthermore at krycklan studies including stream water tracer analyses have indicated that soil frost is a significantly important factor for surface and groundwater partitioning especially in peatland areas buffam et al 2007 laudon et al 2007 for example laudon et al 2007 concluded that the composition of surface water and groundwater in streams during spring flood varies depending on landscape characteristics in the sub catchments of the studied area by using a stable isotope analysis of stream water the study suggested that at c2 where till is the main soil type the spring stream water is dominated by groundwater whereas at c4 which is peatland dominated the spring flood is dominated by overland flow we argue that due to a higher saturation level when peatlands freeze the soil becomes less permeable and in some situations impermeable compared with soils with a lower saturation level peralta tapia et al 2015 by introducing soil frost processes in the model and analyzing the effects on surface and groundwater partitioning our study supports the findings of laudon et al 2007 who suggested that catchment characteristics and soil frost processes are important factors concerning surface and groundwater partitioning 4 4 evapotranspiration characteristics pet had the largest influence on the overall water balance by stepwise decreasing the pet more water is partitioned as runoff which allowed results to be obtained that were comparable with the observed data however there are uncertainties concerning the pet these uncertainties originate from the method used to calculate the pet and how the pet is implemented in the model for the whole catchment we used a spatially uniform but time varying pet due to scarce information on the spatial distribution of the et although the model takes differences in the catchment characteristics into account the model calculated et remained approximately the same between sub catchments appendix b table b3 some differences between sub catchments can however be seen when comparing et contributions mainly when comparing interception and surface water evaporation contributions in summary et may have a significant role in creating the model calculated differences in specific discharge between sub catchments since there are some discrepancies between the model and observations in a previous study of the krycklan catchment et was identified as one of the main processes that explained the observed differences in specific discharge between sub catchments karlsen et al 2016a b however since the model in the present study could capture the overall pattern of differences in specific discharges despite the total et being approximately equal between different sub catchments groundwater storage change and deep groundwater flow path may also have significant roles as discussed in section 4 1 5 conclusions in this study we have highlighted the role of sub catchment heterogeneity we found that local variations in hydraulic properties and seasonal processes are important at both a sub catchment and a full catchment scale although there are deviations between simulated results and observations our current mike she model was able to capture the observed differences in groundwater level fluctuations and specific discharge patterns within the krycklan catchment because the simulated et was similar between sub catchments the main factor determining the specific discharge of a sub catchment is its groundwater processes influenced by the hydraulic properties of the soils and soil frost processes we have also shown that these characteristics have important influences on the partitioning of surface water and groundwater which is a key consideration in the further study of biogeochemical cycling in this catchment to capture the different small scale processes this study

7338,we used an optimal interpolation oi scheme to generate a reference crop evapotranspiration et o grid forcing meteorological variables and their respective error variance in the iberian peninsula for the period 1989 2011 to perform the oi we used observational data from the spanish meteorological agency aemet and outputs from a physically based climate model to compute et o we used five oi schemes to generate grids for the five observed climate variables necessary to compute et o using the fao recommended form of the penman monteith equation fao pm the granularity of the resulting grids are less sensitive to variations in the density and distribution of the observational network than those generated by other interpolation methods this is because our implementation of the oi method uses a physically based climate model as prior background information about the spatial distribution of the climatic variables which is critical for under observed regions this provides temporal consistency in the spatial variability of the climatic fields we also show that increases in the density and improvements in the distribution of the observational network reduces substantially the uncertainty of the climatic and et o estimates finally a sensitivity analysis of observational uncertainties and network densification suggests the existence of a trade off between quantity and quality of observations keywords reference crop evapotranspiration database optimal interpolation uncertainty estimation regional climate model weather stations 1 introduction estimations of the atmospheric evaporative demand aed are critical for understanding and diagnosing imbalances in the hydrologic supply and demand systems of a region of the available methods to estimate aed the food and agriculture organization recommended form of the penman monteith equation fao pm et o is considered the best and most reliable one the fao pm is a modification of the physically based penman monteith equation proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and has been shown to outperform other methods under a wide range of conditions however this method is data intensive requiring information on air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed simultaneous information on all these variables is often unavailable at monitored locations used for regional aed analysis alternatives to obtain et o estimates using less data demanding models exist often only requiring information on air temperature e g blaney and criddle 1950 priestley and taylor 1972 hargreaves and samani 1985 however as irmak et al 2012 and mcvicar et al 2012 pointed out the information carried by the additional meteorological variables required by the fao pm method are critical to obtain reliable et o estimates hence it is important to find a methodology that permits the generalization of the fao pm calculations to locations for which full information on meteorological conditions is not available a first attempt at this generalization was included in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 recommending a methodology to estimate missing data using stationary relationships between temperature and other variables this method hereinafter referred to as fao pmt is however not devoid of problems due to the assumption of stationarity in the relationship between meteorological variables an alternative approach consists in using spatial interpolation to estimate the value of missing variables at the desired locations using data from nearby stations an option that tomas burguera et al 2017 showed to perform better than fao pmt or other simplified models such as hargreaves and samani at least in the iberian peninsula ip this methodology have been tested in other regions such as greece mardikis et al 2005 china mcvicar et al 2007 austria haslinger and bartsch 2016 or great britain robinson et al 2017 the last two efforts resulted in the development of high spatial resolution 1 km datasets for these countries also in britain prudhomme and williamson 2013 tested the use of hadrm3 q0 to quantify potential evapotranspiration and compared it against the meteorological office rainfall and evaporation calculation system morecs observational grid in the conterminous united states abatzoglou 2013 constructed a fao pm based et o dataset derived from his 4 km resolution daily downscaling of meteorological variables at a much coarser spatial resolution the climate research unit cru ts dataset also offers an estimation of the fao pm et o with global coverage harris et al 2014 while gridded datasets based on spatial interpolation methods are easy to implement the quality of the results is highly dependent on the spatial density of the observational dataset used for interpolation the minimum necessary density of the observational network capable of resolving the meteorological field depends on the spatial variability of the meteorological variable and smoothing of the meteorological field occurs when the observational network is sparse this smoothing is exacerbated in regions of complex terrain silverman and maneta 2016 moreover geostatistical interpolation methods often rest on the assumption that the spatial model the semivariogram is spatially stationary an assumption that is not valid in many practical situations and specially over rugged regions with sparse observational coverage the use of climate grids derived from physically based climate models is an alternative that overcome some of the problems of interpolation methods these models which are commonly used in climatological and meteorological studies have several main advantages the computed meteorological grids have homogeneous and consistent temporal and spatial coverage they capture the dependence covariance between climatic variables and they maintain the physical spatial coherence of the field taking into account the influence of topography on the meteorological variables and reducing the spatial smoothing that is characteristic of classic interpolation methods there are many examples of the use of meteorological outputs from climatologic models to calculate aed ishak et al 2010 used ncar penn state mesoscale model version 5 mm5 to downscale era 40 european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis uppala et al 2005 for estimating et o in a catchment of southwest england similarly srivastava et al 2013 compared the performance of era interim dee et al 2011 and national centers for environmental prediction ncep national center for atmospheric research ncar kalnay et al 1996 reanalysis data downscaled through the weather research and forecasting model wrf to estimate et o strong et al 2017 tested the use of wrf to estimate et o in utah comparing the results against the gridded evapotranspiration estimation gridet framework lewis and allen 2016 and obtaining a good performance despite its advantages the use of physically based climate models data to estimate et o also presents important issues the presence of a bias is very common which is the reason why a bias correction step using ground weather station data is compulsory in forecasting models also most climatologic model products have a coarse resolution and some variables such as wind speed are often poorly estimated or carry high uncertainties a third alternative is to use a mixture of distinct sources of data for estimating et o for instance hart et al 2009 developed a system to estimate et o in california by using weather station data and satellite based estimates of radiation martins et al 2017 used meteorological fields from a reanalysis at 0 5 of spatial resolution to estimate et o but without the bias correction process conducted by sheffield et al 2006 on this dataset the different studies described above use the fao pm approach to generate et o estimates but do not provide a formal quantification of their uncertainty studies that take into account the uncertainty of et o estimations look at it mostly as the variation in an ensemble of models kay and davies 2008 kingston et al 2009 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2016 and do not consider the uncertainty of individual members of the ensemble unfortunately the variance of a model ensemble reflects the uncertainty associated with a finite set of model architectures and does not necessarily reflect the quality of each ensemble member which is critical to interpret patterns emerging form the analysis of individual grids for instance brohan et al 2006 and morice et al 2012 proposed and evaluated distinct methodologies to quantify the uncertainty in the hadcrut3 and hadcrut4 datasets and used this information to evaluate the statistical significance of temporal trends analysis done on these datasets which allowed them to eliminate non significant trends from further analysis and interpretation the quantification of the uncertainty around interpolated climatologic estimates is specially important when interpolation is based on an inhomogeneous or time changing network of observations variations over time in the uncertainty of the reconstructed climatologic field reflects variations in the quality of the observational network for instance changes in the number or location of stations in the network can have important effects on the spatial variance of an interpolated grid an analysis of the variance in a time series of these grids may yield trends easily attributable to a climate processes if information on the uncertainty of the estimates is not available beguería et al 2016 argued that this may be one of the most important handicaps of the application of spatial interpolation techniques for climatologic studies densifications and reorganizations of regional climatologic networks are very common for example the deployment of automatic weather stations in spain accelerated dramatically during the last decade increasing the availability of data for the estimation of et o a few decades back only weather stations from the principal network approximately 100 measured the variables required to compute et o azorin molina et al 2015 while currently more than 700 weather stations are collecting and providing near real time data on these variables since the spatial distribution of aed is a quantity difficult to measure directly studies seeking to identify spatial temporal trends in aed will rely on et o grids reconstructed using the fao pmt approximation which in turn relies on information from weather stations minimizing and controlling the impact of the configuration of the observational network on the resulting grid is important to avoid miss interpreting statistical artifacts as a real climatologic process beyond the increasing availability of observational data for climatologic studies climatologic fields from new physically based climate models at high spatial resolution have become available thanks to international projects like coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 these models often cover a period starting in 1979 similar to the era interim reanalysis product dee et al 2011 the advantage of these products is that they reconstruct climatological fields that are based on atmospheric physics and largely independent from ground observations which overcomes some of the disadvantages of interpolated grids unprecedented data availability and access to computational power facilitate the use of data fusion techniques to obtain improved estimates of et o here we propose to use data assimilation methods to combine information from ground observatories and from physically based climate models to produce improved climatic and et o grids the variance of the resulting grids is less sensitive to the number of available stations in the observational network while ensuring that the grid from climate models are conditioned by actual observations in addition an estimation of their mean error is also provided as a natural by product of the method specifically our methodology is based on optimal interpolation oi which has been extensively used in the analysis of weather forecasts in climatology and in oceanography e g reynolds et al 2002 ruiz arias et al 2015 lusana 2017 oi is a minimum variance estimator that is easy to implement and that takes into account observational and model uncertainties in the final estimates the objective of this paper is to describe the generation of a grid of et o over the ip this grid maximizes the use of all available data while controlling the uncertainty and statistical stability of the resulting grid to achieve this we first used ground observations and a regional climate model within an oi scheme to generate gridded estimates and standard errors of each individual meteorological input variable needed to calculate the fao pm et o then we used this information with the fao pm equation to obtain the optimal et o estimate to quantify the uncertainty of the gridded et o the errors from each individual gridded input variable were propagated through the fao pm equation using a first order method we then analyzed the resulting grids to assess if it reduces some of the problems detected in standard interpolation methods such as kriging 2 dataset daily meteorological data on maximum t max and minimum temperature t min relative humidity rh wind speed w and sunshine duration sd as the best available surrogate for solar radiation which is poorly measured in spain sanchez lorenzo et al 2013 from 1989 to 2011 was provided by the spanish meteorological agency aemet a quality control process was implemented at daily time scale tomas burguera et al 2016 prior to the aggregation to monthly scales following the recommendation of the world meteorological organization wmo 1989 using only weather stations with more than 12 months of data the length of the available record varied between variables and the number of stations were different for each variable and varied over time a substantial increase in the number of stations recording rh and w is noticeable toward the end of the study period as previously highlighted by vicente serrano et al 2014b and azorin molina et al 2016 respectively table 1 summarizes the number of weather stations available after quality control the highest number of weather stations corresponded to temperature the same number of weather stations was available for t min and t max and the minimum to sd no observed meteorological data was used for portugal the regional climate model rcm that we used in this study was hirham version 5 christensen et al 2006 which dynamically downscales the era interim model dee et al 2011 for the cordex project giorgi et al 2009 from this model we extracted gridded outputs for t max t min rh w and sd which are the same variables in the observational dataset the grids covered the ip at monthly temporal resolution and 0 11 spatial resolution for the period 1989 2011 additionally a digital elevation model obtained from the spanish national geographic institute ign was used to evaluate the mean elevation of each grid cell the study area and the location of the main geographic features referenced in this paper are presented in fig 1 3 methods the meteorological variables described above were used as inputs to the penman monteith equation to obtain et o we used the form of the penman monteith equation recommended by fao allen et al 1998 to construct the et o grid from information obtained at meteorological sites we used the method of oi a data assimilation technique commonly used in the atmospheric and ocean sciences the application of the oi algorithm to generate the et o grid can be done in two different ways 1 calculate the et o using fao pm at each point with available observations and then optimally interpolate the resulting et o values to generate the grid and 2 optimally interpolate the five individual meteorological fields needed to calculate et o generate five interpolated grids one per variable and then calculate et o using the fao pm equation in the complete grids previous work tomas burguera et al 2017 has shown that although more computationally demanding the latter approach is preferable at least in the ip and therefore we chose it in this study since in option 2 et o is not directly optimally interpolated the uncertainty of each individual meteorological field needs to be propagated through the fao pm equation to calculate the final uncertainty of the et o estimates 3 1 et o estimation allen et al 1998 adapted the penman monteith equation to a reference crop of height 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean air temperature at 2 m c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the value 0 408 is used to convert from mj m 2 day 1 units to kg m 2 day 1 alternatively mm day 1 some of the previous variables are not directly measured but according to the procedure defined in allen et al 1998 they could be estimated using the meteorological data at hand specifically t r n g e s e a and δ were estimated using sd t max t min and rh the variable u 2 coincided with w the equation eq 1 is usually known as fao pm and is the equation we used to estimate et o at the monthly time step when necessary we shall distinguish between et o computed using rcm data et o b and from oi data et o a 3 2 optimal interpolation the oi equations can be easily derived as a variational problem with the goal of finding a vector of estimates that minimizes the total error variance of the field being estimated wikle and berliner 2007 the estimator is unbiased and linear between the observations and a first guess a priori estimation of the field the general form of the oi equations takes the form 2 x v a x v b k v y v h v x v b k v p v h v h v p v h v r v 1 p v i k v h v p v where the subscript v refers to each one of the meteorological variables used in the penman monteith equation t max t min rh w sd and that we are interested in optimally interpolating notice that we have an independent oi process for each variable x a is a vector of length m representing the final interpolated variable i e the oi estimator for the variable v x b is a vector of length m representing the background or first guess of the field in our case the rcm y is a vector of length n of observations in our case the instrumental data from the weather stations h n m is a sparse binary matrix to project the background data into the observation space k m n is the kalman gain matrix that provides the optimal linear combination between the background and the observations p m m and r n n are the error covariance matrices for the background and the observations respectively p m m is the error covariance matrix of x a and i m m is the identity matrix finally m is the grid size which is invariant and in our case has 3930 cells and n is the number of grid cells with observations which varies with each variable and time step the results are sensitive to the values prescribed for p and r but these quantities are difficult to estimate because the amount of background process uncertainty associated and the observational errors are typically unknown the parameterization of these quantities is explained later in this section oi assumes that both the background and the observations are unbiased with normally distributed errors 3 x v b x v t g v g v n 0 p v y v y v t e v e v n 0 r v where x t is the unknown true value of the meteorological field y t is the unknown true value at grid cells with observations and g and e are random errors normally distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrices p and r respectively p and r are assumed to be independent from each other a condition that is critical for the correct performance of the oi in this study the background estimates of the meteorological fields x v b and p v were obtained from the rcm we assume that the climatologic variables of each month are random variables with stationary variance and that each month in the record is a sample following this assumption and in the absence of better information the inter annual variance of a meteorological variable is the most natural approximation of the uncertainty about the estimation of such variable in a given specific month and year in other words variables with more variance have higher uncertainty this is further discussed in section 4 5 the matrix p j v for each of the 12 months j in the record of n years can then be calculated as 4 p j v 1 n 1 x j b v 1 x j b v x j b v 1 x j b v for j 1 12 where x j b v is a matrix where each column is a cell in the grid and each row is a simulated month j in the record 1 is a column vector of ones of size n and x j b v is a column vector with the monthly means of each cell obtained by averaging the columns of x j b v for simplicity the use of the subscript v to refer to the different meteorological variables is suppressed from now on when necessary explicit references to the variables will be used 3 2 1 observation uncertainty r unlike rcm outputs which provide meteorological estimates that are representative at the grid cell scale ground observations at a location in a cell can be considered a sample of the probability distribution of the variable within that cell this distribution is determined by the spatial variability of the meteorological variable within the cell which is unknown we calculated the observed estimates at each grid cell where at least one weather observation exists and interpreted r as representing the uncertainty associated with the point to grid conversion representational uncertainty in other words r is the uncertainty that the actual measured location is representative of the average conditions of the entire cell representational errors are assumed to be independent i e r is a diagonal matrix and therefore error covariances between stations are zero note that since r is diagonal the combination of observational information imposed by k on the optimally interpolated grid eq 2 is mostly controlled by the covariances of p i e interpolation relies on the spatial covariance of the climatologic process as described by the physics of the model without a direct way to calculate the representational error we chose r to be inversely proportional to the number of stations in the monitored cell 5 r i β n obs where i is the identify matrix of order n β is a fixed scaling parameter that controls the magnitude of r and that will be used to test the impact of representational errors on the results and n obs is the number of observatories used in the estimation of y the higher the number of stations in a cell the lower the representational uncertainty guided by our experience we initially fixed β at 4 5 for t max and t min 9 for rh and w and 0 9 for sd to investigate the impact of scaling r on the results we performed a sensitivity analysis on the choice of β as described in section 3 4 3 3 uncertainty estimation to estimate the uncertainty of et o a we propagated the uncertainty of each one of the meteorological variables through the fao pm equation using a first order method for this we linearized the fao pm equation to obtain its jacobian

conducted multiple oi analyses using a range of values of β to vary de magnitude of r for each interpolated meteorological variable we tested four different values of this scaling parameter that evenly partitioned the range of r from an end member that represents high confidence in the observations r p to a value that represents low confidence r p table 2 shows the spatial mean values of p p which were used as a reference to design the values to scale r lowest and higher values of p are selected from the 12 unique p monthly values β values are chosen to cover the range between a value lower than the lowest p value and a value higher than the highest p value 3 5 spatial correlation with portugal the impact of not using weather observations over portugal was evaluated by analyzing the spatial structure of p and specifically how cells with observations in spain covary and inform climatic estimates over portugal since r is diagonal the spatial structure imposed by the optimal interpolation scheme is to a large extent driven by p to facilitate the spatial analysis we first transformed our covariance matrices into correlation matrices then we analyzed the number of grid points in portugal that correlate with observed grid points in spain with a coefficient higher than 0 75 when grid cells in portugal correlate highly with cells containing observations then these observation can inform the corrections in portugal even though they are located in spain during periods where correlations are lower the quality of the estimates over portugal decrease 4 results 4 1 observational dataset the number of instrumental observations used in the gridding process varied with time as individual stations in the network were added or decommissioned fig 2 presents a time series with the number of grid cells in the domain containing one or more observations for each of the meteorological variables used in the calculation of et o temperature t max and t min had the densest spatial coverage the number of grid cells for which temperature data were available increased from about 1200 in the late 1980s to over 1300 in 1995 from the mid 1990s the number of stations declined steadily and the number grid cells with temperature data was 1100 1150 toward the end of the study period stations that registered rh and w where less common at the start of analysis period in the late 1980s only about 100 grid cells contained information on these variables the number of stations measuring rh and w increased steadily until the mid 2000s when the installation of automatic weather stations aws resulted in a sharp increase in the number of grid cells containing information on the other hand the number of stations measuring sd declined over time from about 90 stations in the late 1980s to less than 70 at the end of the study period this decline was partly due to the obsolescence of the heliographs used to perform the measurements which are being replaced by modern radiometers the reason we did not include information from radiometers is that only heliographs provide a homogeneous dataset that covers the entire study period 4 2 optimally interpolated climatic variables and et o estimates the proposed method produces gridded fields of mean x a and variance σ a 2 estimates for each climate variable and for et o et o a and σ et o a 2 to illustrate the outcome of the process and provide a sense of the typical spatial distribution of the estimates and their associated uncertainty results are presented for one sample month july 1994 fig 3 overall the estimates for all meteorological variables and for et o show spatial structure devoid of the interpolation artefacts often produced by other interpolation methods the expected spatial climatologic patterns of the variables over the ip are captured including very localized windward leeward effects produced by the rugged physiography of mountain regions in this sample month the highest temperatures are located in the southern region of the peninsula and in the ebro valley in the northeast high x rh a values are concentrated in regions close to the coast and along corridors that extend the oceanic influence further inland wind speed x w a is highest in the castilla la mancha region eastern spain and in the ebro valley in northeastern spain where high wind speeds are facilitated by the unobstructed high plateau of castilla and by accelerations of northern winds in the ebro valley due to the interaction between the orographic dipole of the pyrenees mountain range with the morphology of the ebro catchment riosalido et al 1986 finally sunny summers and the compact shape of the ip produce similar mean x sd a estimates in july with the exception of the coastal northern region where mean x sd a values are significantly lower due to persistent cloud cover the climatology described by these variables produces et o a estimates that are higher in the southern region and in the ebro valley and lower in the north and northwest region of the peninsula the uncertainty of these estimates represented as the standard deviation σ a are in general low due to the relatively high number of instrumental observations available and the high spatial correlation of the variables this is especially true for σ t max a and σ t min a for which typical values were lower than 0 3 c σ rh a presents higher values in the southwest and northeast this study did not use observations in portugal which is the reason why these variables show higher uncertainty in the west and southwestern regions of the ip relatively high values of σ w a are present only in the regions with highest wind speeds the northwestern and northern coastal regions where cloud cover is most variable result in the highest values for σ sd a because the fao pm equation is non linear and concave upward uncertainties are amplified in regions of high et o where the function tends to have steeper derivatives to illustrate the typical time series generated by our method for each meteorological variable and for et o a fig 4 presents results for one sample location in central spain the most prominent feature of estimates for x t max a x t min a x sd a and et o a is the expected and marked seasonality with summer peaks and winter lows an inverse seasonality affects x rh a with summer lows and winter peaks whereas x w a does not show seasonality the most interesting information in this figure is the standard deviation of the estimates σ a which shows that uncertainty has a clear dependency on time seasonality for all variables in addition σ rh a and to a lesser degree σ w a exhibit a marked decrease in the standard deviation of the estimates toward the last quarter of the study period while σ sd a shows a moderate increase over time these trends are associated with variations in the number of data points used to perform the interpolation as we will discuss later seasonality and trends in the uncertainty of individual climate variables are propagated to σ et o a which in general also shows a clear seasonality and a decline toward the last quarter of the period 4 3 comparison between oi and the rcm the analysis of differences δ x a x b between the oi and the background rcm is of interest for detecting possible biases in the rcm and also to evaluate the adequacy of the observational network fig 5 shows x a the mean of x a over time and x b the same for x b for each climate variable and for et o et o a and et o b as well as their differences δ in general the rcm tended to underestimate t max δ t max 0 and to overestimate t min δ t min 0 indicating that the rcm describes a shallower annual temperature range than the observations we should keep in mind though that the rcm output represents mean cell estimates which are expected to have a lower variability than the very local point information represented by the observations for rh the oi estimates present higher values δ rh 0 in the southern region of the ip and lower values in the northern part δ rh 0 for w the biggest differences appeared in the north east region specially along the ebro valley lower values of sd δ sd 0 appeared in the northern region which could be related to the presence of low level clouds not easily resolved by rcms the effect of these differences is only modestly apparent in the mean et o of the study period the method corrects an et o b overestimation δ et o 0 in the southern region of the ip and in the ebro valley and corrects an underestimation δ et o 0 in the northern region and mountainous areas et o a presents higher values in the northern region and lower values in the southern region in general it appears that the spatial pattern of δ et o is very similar to the pattern of δ rh suggesting that this variable is a major player in determining the spatial patterns of the atmospheric water demand in the region the domain wide seasonal amount of correction is depicted in fig 6 which presents monthly et o a and et o b in general the mean values are similar except during spring and autumn where et o b seems to overestimate regional mean values the figure also presents the spatial interquartile range here also the largest differences between the two datasets occur during spring and autumn during these months the spatial variability of et o a is smaller than that represented by et o b 4 4 impact of the number of available observations as described in section 4 1 the number of stations providing meteorological information varies over time being most prominent the increase in the number of stations measuring rh and w in standard interpolation methods the granularity of the resulting fields is highly dependent on the number and spatial distribution of the observational data used for interpolation this is a problem because it also generates trends in the dispersion statistics variance kurtosis of the spatial fields we evaluate the extent to which oi reduces this problem by analyzing the impact of the number of observations on the amount of correction that our methods apply to the rcm estimates and on the spatial variance of the corrected fields fig 7 shows time series of the spatial mean of the correction applied to the rcm δ et o the differences are grouped by months to remove the seasonal cycle while a strong variability in the mean correction is detected in some months no trends are apparent in the time series not even in the last quarter of the period when a sharp increase in the number of rh and w weather stations took place we also analyzed if the varying number of stations used in the oi process generated temporal trends in the spatial variability of the et o a field fig 8 shows time series of the standard deviation of the field also grouped by months an inspection of the figure shows that only seasonal patterns exist and that no apparent trends can be identified that reveal an increase or decrease in the variability of the field as the number of observations used for interpolation changed over the years while the mean estimates did not seem sensitive to the number of stations used in the oi process the same was not true for their uncertainty fig 9 show time series of the spatial mean of the uncertainty of meteorological variables σ a and of et o σ et o a in the figure we see that σ et o a follows the same seasonality of the mean values showing higher uncertainty during the summer months and lower in winter but the overall uncertainty decreased over the years as the available information used to condition the rcm field increased the man kendall trend test man 1945 kendall 1975 with a significance level α 0 05 determined that the negative trend in the mean spatial uncertainty σ et o a 2 is significant for all the months except for june table 1 anex the decrease in σ et o a seems to be most related to the sharp decrease in σ rh a and σ w a as the number of observations for these two variables increase this occurs despite the fact that the σ t max a σ t min a and σ sd a increase as the number of available observations declined the highest uncertainty in the temperature estimates occurred during the warmest months of the year with a secondary peak in winter for σ t min a on the other hand σ w a and σ sd a showed higher values in winter and lower values in summer σ rh a showed no seasonality having similar values throughout the year 4 5 impact of r figs 10 and 11 present respectively the time series of the spatial mean of estimates for each meteorological variable x a and of the spatial mean of their associated posterior standard deviation σ a for each of the four tested r matrices in general we found that the results estimates remained robust for the range of r matrices tested and only x w a and x sd a showed relevant differences in the case of x w a differences appeared only in the first years of the study when the number of available observations was similar to those of sd as the number of w observations increased the effect of r on x w a faded out and similar results were obtained for the different matrices on the other hand the sensitivity of x sd a on r remained since the number of observations available of this variable continued to decline this suggests the existence of an observation density threshold beyond which the impact of observation uncertainties on the oi estimation process is limited the magnitude of r has a more severe impact on the spatial mean of the estimate uncertainty σ a as expected larger r values resulted in larger uncertainties with a clear dependency on the number of available observations this effect was most clear on σ rh a and σ w a since these two variables experienced the sharpest increase in the number of observations during the study period it is worth noting that the values of σ rh a at the end of the period in the worst case scenario largest r were similar to those at the start of the period in the best case scenario lowest r which suggests the existence of a trade off between the quantity and the quality of the observations 4 6 portugal correlation analysis fig 12 shows the results of the spatial correlation analysis over portugal for all the variables in two contrasting months january and july the color in each cell indicates with how many of the 600 grid cells over portugal the cell has a correlation higher than 0 75 in january winter large areas of spain show high correlation with portugal in all cases and not surprisingly western spain is the most correlated region with portugal t max and t min are the variables exhibiting the most extensive correlation it is interesting that rh and sd during the month of january show a region of extensive correlation with portugal in the southern face of pyrenees range this is mostly explained by the orographic uplift of southern winds in this region which occur simultaneously with cyclonic conditions affecting the western part of ip on the other hand correlated areas tend to decrease in july summer for all variables and the correlations are more spatially restricted to the western area of spain the decrease in the extension of highly correlated areas is specially acute for sd which is explained by the fact that cloudiness during summer months is often related to local or subregional conditions i e mainly convection and sea fog interacting with coastal areas from these results we consider that obtaining good climatological and et o estimates over portugal using observations located in spain is possible but these estimates are expected to be of better quality during winter when synoptic conditions over ip is highly correlated unfortunately et o estimates are most relevant during the summer months when aed is high fig 6 during summer local conditions become more important and correlations between portugal and the rest of the ip become more fragmented 5 discussion 5 1 meteorological estimates the mean climatic fields presented in fig 5 describe the climatology of the ip the northern and northwestern regions are the wettest and coolest with the lowest values of et o sd and t max and t min and higher values of rh the highest t max and t min are mostly concentrated in the southern half with the guadalquivir river valley standing out with the exception of the ebro river valley in the northeast which forms a depression with a characteristic semi arid local climate obtained values of et o are in concordance with previous studies in the iberian peninsula taking into account that other studies were developed using only a subset of weather stations vicente serrano et al 2014c used 46 weather stations in the spanish part of the ip or only analyzed a subregion in the ip such as vanderlinden et al 2008 and espadafor et al 2011 who analyzed only andalusia the same spatial distribution of et o was detected by some of those previous works the higher values appear in the southern region and the lower values in the northern region of the ip the ebro valley a region located in the north is an exception to this latitudinal pattern showing high values of et o the absolute values detected in our study are quite similar to the values of previous studies with maximum values higher than 1400 mm in the guadalquivir valley and values lower than 1000 mm in the northern region our results show somewhat higher values in the southern region up to 1600 mm at some locations in the guadalquivir valley some reasons for these higher estimates are i we used all the weather stations available ii 1961 2011 period show a clear positive trend in et o as detected by espadafor et al 2011 and vicente serrano et al 2014a and our study period 1989 2011 is the last part of that period because of that we possibly detected higher mean values than previous studies in some regions on the other hand minimum values below 700 mm in mountainous regions would be in agreement with the detection of low values in sierra nevada done by vanderlinden et al 2008 the seasonality of et o fig 6 follows the well known seasonal cycles of t max t min and sd with highest et o in the summer and lowest during the winter months espadafor et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2014c martins et al 2017 the higher spatial variability of summer months was also detected in those previous studies the correction that meteorological observations impose on the background rcm can be analyzed by the differences between the meteorological fields estimated by the oi and those from the rcm these differences often present systematic patterns that can be attributed to biases in the rcm as found by kotlarski et al 2014 but they could also be attributed to the impact of correcting the field with observations that have a footprint smaller than the grid cells the spatial and temporal variability expected from ground observations is larger because their footprint is representative of a region much smaller than that of the grid cell for instance optimally interpolated annual mean values of t max are higher than those of the rcm while mean values of t min are lower indicating that the rcm tends to dampen thermal oscillations in most of the spatial domain this correction is spatially consistent except perhaps in high elevation regions the only variable that shows very contrasting spatial corrections of different sign is rh since oi tend to increase the lower values of rh in the northern half of the ip and decrease the highest values in the south this spatial correction pattern of rh is very similar to the differences in the mean et o field calculated from the oi variables and from the et o calculated from the uncorrected rcm variables which reinforces the conclusions by azorin molina et al 2015 that rh is a key driver of et o in the ip regarding sd annual mean values in the oi field are generally lower than those estimated by the rcm two main factors could help explain differences in sd i the wmo defined sd as the time interval in which the solar radiation exceeds 120 wm 2 wmo 2003 while sd obtained from the rcm considers this the observed sd data is more subjective for the period when the campbell stokes cs recorder was used kerr and tabony 2004 compared the perfomance of cs and automatic sensors obtaining a good agreement but with some differences perhaps because the solar radiation at which the cs starts to record ranges from 106 to 285 w m 2 painter 1981 and ii the general over prediction of solar radiation affecting climate models could also be affecting the rcm used in this study wild et al 2013 in fact our correction of sd values are in concordance with the results obtained for solar radiation by ruiz arias et al 2015 finally while we expected higher spatial variability of w in the observational dataset than in the rcm the annual mean values of the oi fields are lower than those of the rcm wind speed is a complex variable with high local spatial variability that physical models find difficult to capture in fact some authors e g ishak et al 2010 detected that dynamically downscaling a global reanalysis did not improve the quality of the w field with respect to the original reanalysis moreover an experiment using the wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 regional climate model in the north of the ip by jiménez and dudhia 2012 showed that wind speeds calculated at grid points were poor predictors of values observed at the closest ground observatories in the ip martins et al 2017 tested a blended reanalysis developed by sheffield et al 2006 which combined data from distinct sources to obtain a global reanalysis of better quality than any of the individual sources usually the global products have a coarser spatial resolution 0 5 in this case than regional products 0 11 for our product while they used weather observations to validate the results they obtained we preferred not to do that because the value of a weather observation refers to an exact point while the values of oi refer to a grid cell nevertheless as it has been previously explained both the spatial and temporal distribution of our product are coherent with results obtained by previous studies 5 2 uncertainty of estimates our methodology makes a number of assumptions that are worth discussing before interpreting the results we consider that the uncertainty of background rcm estimates p equals to their monthly variance this assumption is based on the idea that monthly estimates of a variable are random variables and that each year in the rcm record is one sample of the variable for each month under this assumption and in the absence of additional information the historical variability the sample variance of the rcm estimates for a given month of the year is the uncertainty around the estimate of this variable note that we are not inferring monthly climatologic means whose uncertainty is represented by the standard error of the mean but values for each particular month in the record so the sample variance the climatological variability and not the standard error is a more appropriate measure of their uncertainty we believe this choice provides a conservative pessimistic estimate of the background uncertainty because it does not leverage information available from previous months an alternative approach to parameterize p would be to use the variance from an ensemble of models e g from the cordex project we argue that this approach would underestimate the actual uncertainty of the estimates because the limited number of models included in the ensemble and because the finite conceptualisations of the reality that they implement sample only a limited range of the actual uncertainty knutti 2010 for this and for its simplicity we preferred to provide the initial estimate of uncertainty from the monthly climatology of the rcm recently the era5 new reanalysis of the ecmwf was made available for the period 2010 2016 and includes a measure of its uncertainty a comparison between both approaches to parameterize p will be possible when the full temporal record in the era5 dataset becomes available hersbach and dee 2016 a second relevant consideration is the prescription of matrix r which represents the error variance of the observations we assumed that observational or instrument errors which are seldom documented are negligible compared to the station representativity error which quantifies the uncertainty associated with the local conditions measured by a given station being representative of the cell where the station is located to approximate this uncertainty we assumed that station errors are independent from each other i e that the matrix r is diagonal and that the uncertainty of each station is inversely proportional to the number of data occurring inside a specific grid cell such that the higher the number of observatories used to estimate the mean value of a grid cell the lower the observational uncertainty for that cell fig 10 shows that variables that are sampled by a large number of stations t min and t max variations in r affect only the uncertainty while the estimates themselves are not affected this is because errors in r are assumed to be unbiased and independent which along with the large number of available stations and the high spatial covariation imposed by p allows for a robust estimation of the spatial field on the other hand variables with a smaller number of observations such as rh w and sd show that variations in r affect both the estimate s uncertainty and the estimates themselves interestingly the case of rh and w both of which experienced a large increase in the number of available observations over time suggests that there is a threshold in the number of observations beyond which the estimates are mostly unaffected by observation uncertainty this is indicative of a trade off between the quantity and the quality of observational information as we will discuss below 5 3 impact of changes in the density of the observational network the generation of meteorological grids using standard interpolation methods such as kriging and other methods based on distance weighting is very sensitive to variations in the number and location of the weather stations used moreover the density and distribution of ground observations necessary to resolve the spatial variability of the climatic field being reconstructed depends on the degree of spatial autocorrelation of the field this is because the covariance of the process determines the size of the region each observation is representative of silverman and maneta 2016 this has non trivial consequences for any climate analysis performed using these grids because the varying number of stations used for interpolation may induce trends in the spatial variability granularity of the meteorological fields that can easily be misinterpreted as being genuinely caused by a climatic process our analysis fig 8 showed that the spatial standard deviation of the fields produced by oi was not as acutely affected by this problem as traditional interpolation methods are as demonstrated in previous studies beguería et al 2016 while the rapid increase in the number of observations affected the estimates of rh w and sd fig 2 the spatial variance of these fields did not show appreciable changes that could be attributed to the densification of the observational network for rh and w which more than doubled the available data in the last 5 years of the study period an increase of the granularity of the field could be expected due to more local effects being detected within the observational network on the other hand sd experienced a steady decrease in the number of grid cells with data with potential impacts on the granularity of the field however we did not find significant temporal trends in the dispersion statistics of the resulting climatic fields a reason for this is that in the oi scheme the information about the spatial variability of the climatic field being reconstructed does not exclusively depend on ground observations as other methods do but also on the rcm variance covariance matrix p which embeds a physically based estimation of the spatial variability of the climatic process over the entire domain including areas sparsely monitored since r is a diagonal matrix the spatial correction performed by oi mostly depends on p i e on the spatial variability of the climate process extracted from the rcm which is available for all grid points and reduces the dependency of the resulting field variance on ground observations on the other hand the uncertainty of the estimates σ a represented on fig 9 was very sensitive to the number of stations used especially for rh and w the sharp increment in the density of the observational network for these variables had a strong impact in reducing σ rh a and σ w a from an algebraic point of view the increase in the number of grid cells containing data affects the calculation of the gain matrix k eq 2 as r decreases p becomes a larger share of the total error variance represented by k informing the updates to increase the amount of correction on the prior estimates i e observations gain influence when the variance update formula is used to calculate the posterior uncertainty of the estimate p k induces a larger reduction in the background uncertainty p similarly a decrease in the number of observations such as in the case of sd results in an increase in σ sd a this also happens albeit to a smaller extent with t max and t min nevertheless the increment in the number of rh and w observations was more important than the decrease in the number of observations in these three variables and the overall uncertainty in the et o estimate σ et o a decreased over the study period 6 conclusions 1 the use of an oi scheme blending background rcm data with observational data from a relatively dense network allowed estimating fields of the variables needed to compute fields of fao pm et o 2 oi also allowed propagating the initial uncertainty of the data to the oi estimated fields which were then propagated through the jacobian of fao pm equation to finally get et o uncertainty fields 3 the granularity of the estimated et o fields as measured through their spatial variance was not affected by changes in the number of stations in the observational network which were noticeable during the study period this can be attributed to the physically coherent information on the spatial structure of the variables provided by the rcm and contrasts with other methods that rely on observational data alone 4 the uncertainty of the meteorological variables and therefore of et o was however sensitive to changes in the number of stations used in this sense we found that in our case study the number and spatial distribution of temperature records was adequate for the spatial resolution of our analysis while a recent increase in the number of air humidity and wind speed stations substantially reduced the uncertainty of computed et o a reduction was found in the number of sunshine duration stations that affected negatively the computation of et o 5 the propagation of uncertainty is a highly relevant issue when constructing meteorological grids but it is often neglected probably due to difficulties in determining the uncertainty of the original data sources in this case a number of assumptions were made to quantify the uncertainties of the rcm and observational data used and their consequences were checked and discussed but other options could be explored acknowledgments this work has been supported by the research project cgl2014 52135 c3 1 r financed by the

7338,we used an optimal interpolation oi scheme to generate a reference crop evapotranspiration et o grid forcing meteorological variables and their respective error variance in the iberian peninsula for the period 1989 2011 to perform the oi we used observational data from the spanish meteorological agency aemet and outputs from a physically based climate model to compute et o we used five oi schemes to generate grids for the five observed climate variables necessary to compute et o using the fao recommended form of the penman monteith equation fao pm the granularity of the resulting grids are less sensitive to variations in the density and distribution of the observational network than those generated by other interpolation methods this is because our implementation of the oi method uses a physically based climate model as prior background information about the spatial distribution of the climatic variables which is critical for under observed regions this provides temporal consistency in the spatial variability of the climatic fields we also show that increases in the density and improvements in the distribution of the observational network reduces substantially the uncertainty of the climatic and et o estimates finally a sensitivity analysis of observational uncertainties and network densification suggests the existence of a trade off between quantity and quality of observations keywords reference crop evapotranspiration database optimal interpolation uncertainty estimation regional climate model weather stations 1 introduction estimations of the atmospheric evaporative demand aed are critical for understanding and diagnosing imbalances in the hydrologic supply and demand systems of a region of the available methods to estimate aed the food and agriculture organization recommended form of the penman monteith equation fao pm et o is considered the best and most reliable one the fao pm is a modification of the physically based penman monteith equation proposed in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 and has been shown to outperform other methods under a wide range of conditions however this method is data intensive requiring information on air temperature relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed simultaneous information on all these variables is often unavailable at monitored locations used for regional aed analysis alternatives to obtain et o estimates using less data demanding models exist often only requiring information on air temperature e g blaney and criddle 1950 priestley and taylor 1972 hargreaves and samani 1985 however as irmak et al 2012 and mcvicar et al 2012 pointed out the information carried by the additional meteorological variables required by the fao pm method are critical to obtain reliable et o estimates hence it is important to find a methodology that permits the generalization of the fao pm calculations to locations for which full information on meteorological conditions is not available a first attempt at this generalization was included in the fao 56 manual allen et al 1998 recommending a methodology to estimate missing data using stationary relationships between temperature and other variables this method hereinafter referred to as fao pmt is however not devoid of problems due to the assumption of stationarity in the relationship between meteorological variables an alternative approach consists in using spatial interpolation to estimate the value of missing variables at the desired locations using data from nearby stations an option that tomas burguera et al 2017 showed to perform better than fao pmt or other simplified models such as hargreaves and samani at least in the iberian peninsula ip this methodology have been tested in other regions such as greece mardikis et al 2005 china mcvicar et al 2007 austria haslinger and bartsch 2016 or great britain robinson et al 2017 the last two efforts resulted in the development of high spatial resolution 1 km datasets for these countries also in britain prudhomme and williamson 2013 tested the use of hadrm3 q0 to quantify potential evapotranspiration and compared it against the meteorological office rainfall and evaporation calculation system morecs observational grid in the conterminous united states abatzoglou 2013 constructed a fao pm based et o dataset derived from his 4

coverage harris et al 2014 while gridded datasets based on spatial interpolation methods are easy to implement the quality of the results is highly dependent on the spatial density of the observational dataset used for interpolation the minimum necessary density of the observational network capable of resolving the meteorological field depends on the spatial variability of the meteorological variable and smoothing of the meteorological field occurs when the observational network is sparse this smoothing is exacerbated in regions of complex terrain silverman and maneta 2016 moreover geostatistical interpolation methods often rest on the assumption that the spatial model the semivariogram is spatially stationary an assumption that is not valid in many practical situations and specially over rugged regions with sparse observational coverage the use of climate grids derived from physically based climate models is an alternative that overcome some of the problems of interpolation methods these models which are commonly used in climatological and meteorological studies have several main advantages the computed meteorological grids have homogeneous and consistent temporal and spatial coverage they capture the dependence covariance between climatic variables and they maintain the physical spatial coherence of the field taking into account the influence of topography on the meteorological variables and reducing the spatial smoothing that is characteristic of classic interpolation methods there are many examples of the use of meteorological outputs from climatologic models to calculate aed ishak et al 2010 used ncar penn state mesoscale model version 5 mm5 to downscale era 40 european centre for medium range weather forecasts re analysis uppala et al 2005 for estimating et o in a catchment of southwest england similarly srivastava et al 2013 compared the performance of era interim dee et al 2011 and national centers for environmental prediction ncep national center for atmospheric research ncar kalnay et al 1996 reanalysis data downscaled through the weather research and forecasting model wrf to estimate et o strong et al 2017 tested the use of wrf to estimate et o in utah comparing the results against the gridded evapotranspiration estimation gridet framework lewis and allen 2016 and obtaining a good performance despite its advantages the use of physically based climate models data to estimate et o also presents important issues the presence of a bias is very common which is the reason why a bias correction step using ground weather station data is compulsory in forecasting models also most climatologic model products have a coarse resolution and some variables such as wind speed are often poorly estimated or carry high uncertainties a third alternative is to use a mixture of distinct sources of data for estimating et o for instance hart et al 2009 developed a system to estimate et o in california by using weather station data and satellite based estimates of radiation martins et al 2017 used meteorological fields from a reanalysis at 0 5 of spatial resolution to estimate et o but without the bias correction process conducted by sheffield et al 2006 on this dataset the different studies described above use the fao pm approach to generate et o estimates but do not provide a formal quantification of their uncertainty studies that take into account the uncertainty of et o estimations look at it mostly as the variation in an ensemble of models kay and davies 2008 kingston et al 2009 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2016 and do not consider the uncertainty of individual members of the ensemble unfortunately the variance of a model ensemble reflects the uncertainty associated with a finite set of model architectures and does not necessarily reflect the quality of each ensemble member which is critical to interpret patterns emerging form the analysis of individual grids for instance brohan et al 2006 and morice et al 2012 proposed and evaluated distinct methodologies to quantify the uncertainty in the hadcrut3 and hadcrut4 datasets and used this information to evaluate the statistical significance of temporal trends analysis done on these datasets which allowed them to eliminate non significant trends from further analysis and interpretation the quantification of the uncertainty around interpolated climatologic estimates is specially important when interpolation is based on an inhomogeneous or time changing network of observations variations over time in the uncertainty of the reconstructed climatologic field reflects variations in the quality of the observational network for instance changes in the number or location of stations in the network can have important effects on the spatial variance of an interpolated grid an analysis of the variance in a time series of these grids may yield trends easily attributable to a climate processes if information on the uncertainty of the estimates is not available beguería et al 2016 argued that this may be one of the most important handicaps of the application of spatial interpolation techniques for climatologic studies densifications and reorganizations of regional climatologic networks are very common for example the deployment of automatic weather stations in spain accelerated dramatically during the last decade increasing the availability of data for the estimation of et o a few decades back only weather stations from the principal network approximately 100 measured the variables required to compute et o azorin molina et al 2015 while currently more than 700 weather stations are collecting and providing near real time data on these variables since the spatial distribution of aed is a quantity difficult to measure directly studies seeking to identify spatial temporal trends in aed will rely on et o grids reconstructed using the fao pmt approximation which in turn relies on information from weather stations minimizing and controlling the impact of the configuration of the observational network on the resulting grid is important to avoid miss interpreting statistical artifacts as a real climatologic process beyond the increasing availability of observational data for climatologic studies climatologic fields from new physically based climate models at high spatial resolution have become available thanks to international projects like coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment cordex giorgi et al 2009 these models often cover a period starting in 1979 similar to the era interim reanalysis product dee et al 2011 the advantage of these products is that they reconstruct climatological fields that are based on atmospheric physics and largely independent from ground observations which overcomes some of the disadvantages of interpolated grids unprecedented data availability and access to computational power facilitate the use of data fusion techniques to obtain improved estimates of et o here we propose to use data assimilation methods to combine information from ground observatories and from physically based climate models to produce improved climatic and et o grids the variance of the resulting grids is less sensitive to the number of available stations in the observational network while ensuring that the grid from climate models are conditioned by actual observations in addition an estimation of their mean error is also provided as a natural by product of the method specifically our methodology is based on optimal interpolation oi which has been extensively used in the analysis of weather forecasts in climatology and in oceanography e g reynolds et al 2002 ruiz arias et al 2015 lusana 2017 oi is a minimum variance estimator that is easy to implement and that takes into account observational and model uncertainties in the final estimates the objective of this paper is to describe the generation of a grid of et o over the ip this grid maximizes the use of all available data while controlling the uncertainty and statistical stability of the resulting grid to achieve this we first used ground observations and a regional climate model within an oi scheme to generate gridded estimates and standard errors of each individual meteorological input variable needed to calculate the fao pm et o then we used this information with the fao pm equation to obtain the optimal et o estimate to quantify the uncertainty of the gridded et o the errors from each individual gridded input variable were propagated through the fao pm equation using a first order method we then analyzed the resulting grids to assess if it reduces some of the problems detected in standard interpolation methods such as kriging 2 dataset daily meteorological data on maximum t max and minimum temperature t min relative humidity rh wind speed w and sunshine duration sd as the best available surrogate for solar radiation which is poorly measured in spain sanchez lorenzo et al 2013 from 1989 to 2011 was provided by the spanish meteorological agency aemet a quality control process was implemented at daily time scale tomas burguera et al 2016 prior to the aggregation to monthly scales following the recommendation of the world meteorological organization wmo 1989 using only weather stations with more than 12 months of data the length of the available record varied between variables and the number of stations were different for each variable and varied over time a substantial increase in the number of stations recording rh and w is noticeable toward the end of the study period as previously highlighted by vicente serrano et al 2014b and azorin molina et al 2016 respectively table 1 summarizes the number of weather stations available after quality control the highest number of weather stations corresponded to temperature the same number of weather stations was available for t min and t max and the minimum to sd no observed meteorological data was used for portugal the regional climate model rcm that we used in this study was hirham version 5 christensen et al 2006 which dynamically downscales the era interim model dee et al 2011 for the cordex project giorgi et al 2009 from this model we extracted gridded outputs for t max t min rh w and sd which are the same variables in the observational dataset the grids covered the ip at monthly temporal resolution and 0 11 spatial resolution for the period 1989 2011 additionally a digital elevation model obtained from the spanish national geographic institute ign was used to evaluate the mean elevation of each grid cell the study area and the location of the main geographic features referenced in this paper are presented in fig 1 3 methods the meteorological variables described above were used as inputs to the penman monteith equation to obtain et o we used the form of the penman monteith equation recommended by fao allen et al 1998 to construct the et o grid from information obtained at meteorological sites we used the method of oi a data assimilation technique commonly used in the atmospheric and ocean sciences the application of the oi algorithm to generate the et o grid can be done in two different ways 1 calculate the et o using fao pm at each point with available observations and then optimally interpolate the resulting et o values to generate the grid and 2 optimally interpolate the five individual meteorological fields needed to calculate et o generate five interpolated grids one per variable and then calculate et o using the fao pm equation in the complete grids previous work tomas burguera et al 2017 has shown that although more computationally demanding the latter approach is preferable at least in the ip and therefore we chose it in this study since in option 2 et o is not directly optimally interpolated the uncertainty of each individual meteorological field needs to be propagated through the fao pm equation to calculate the final uncertainty of the et o estimates 3 1 et o estimation allen et al 1998 adapted the penman monteith equation to a reference crop of height 0 12 m a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 and an albedo of 0 23 1 et o 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean air temperature at 2 m c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the value 0 408 is used to convert from mj m 2 day 1 units to kg m 2 day 1 alternatively mm day 1 some of the previous variables are not directly measured but according to the procedure defined in allen et al 1998 they could be estimated using the meteorological data at hand specifically t r n g e s e a and δ were estimated using sd t max t min and rh the variable u 2 coincided with w the equation eq 1 is usually known as fao pm and is the equation we used to estimate et o at the monthly time step when necessary we shall distinguish between et o computed using rcm data et o b and from oi data et o a 3 2 optimal interpolation the oi equations can be easily derived as a variational problem with the goal of finding a vector of estimates that minimizes the total error variance of the field being estimated wikle and berliner 2007 the estimator is unbiased and linear between the observations and a first guess a priori estimation of the field the general form of the oi equations takes the form 2 x v a x v b k v y v h v x v b k v p v h v h v p v h v r v 1 p v i k v h v p v where the subscript v refers to each one of the meteorological variables used in the penman monteith equation t max t min rh w sd and that we are interested in optimally interpolating notice that we have an independent oi process for each variable x a is a vector of length m representing the final interpolated variable i e the oi estimator for the variable v x b is a vector of length m representing the background or first guess of the field in our case the rcm y is a vector of length n of observations in our case the instrumental data from the weather stations h n m is a sparse binary matrix to project the background data into the observation space k m n is the kalman gain matrix that provides the optimal linear combination between the background and the observations p m m and r n n are the error covariance matrices for the background and the observations respectively p m m is the error covariance matrix of x a and i m m is the identity matrix finally m is the grid size which is invariant and in our case has 3930 cells and n is the number of grid cells with observations which varies with each variable and time step the results are sensitive to the values prescribed for p and r but these quantities are difficult to estimate because the amount of background process uncertainty associated and the observational errors are typically unknown the parameterization of these quantities is explained later in this section oi assumes that both the background and the observations are unbiased with normally distributed errors 3 x v b x v t g v g v n 0 p v y v y v t e v e v n 0 r v where x t is the unknown true value of the meteorological field y t is the unknown true value at grid cells with observations and g and e are random errors normally distributed with mean 0 and covariance matrices p and r respectively p and r are assumed to be independent from each other a condition that is critical for the correct performance of the oi in this study the background estimates of the meteorological fields x v b and p v were obtained from the rcm we assume that the climatologic variables of each month are random variables with stationary variance and that each month in the record is a sample following this assumption and in the absence of better information the inter annual variance of a meteorological variable is the most natural approximation of the uncertainty about the estimation of such variable in a given specific month and year in other words variables with more variance have higher uncertainty this is further discussed in section 4 5 the matrix p j v for each of the 12 months j in the record of n years can then be calculated as 4 p j v 1 n 1 x j b v 1 x j b v x j b v 1 x j b v for j 1 12 where x j b v is a matrix where each column is a cell in the grid and each row is a simulated month j in the record 1 is a column vector of ones of size n and x j b v is a column vector with the monthly means of each cell obtained by averaging the columns of x j b v for simplicity the use of the subscript v to refer to the different meteorological variables is suppressed from now on when necessary explicit references to the variables will be used 3 2 1 observation uncertainty r unlike rcm outputs which provide meteorological estimates that are representative at the grid cell scale ground observations at a location in a cell can be considered a sample of the probability distribution of the variable within that cell this distribution is determined by the spatial variability of the meteorological variable within the cell which is unknown we calculated the observed estimates at each grid cell where at least one weather observation exists and interpreted r as representing the uncertainty associated with the point to grid conversion representational uncertainty in other words r is the uncertainty that the actual measured location is representative of the average conditions of the entire cell representational errors are assumed to be independent i e r is a diagonal matrix and therefore error covariances between stations are zero note that since r is diagonal the combination of observational information imposed by k on the optimally interpolated grid eq 2 is mostly controlled by the covariances of p i e interpolation relies on the spatial covariance of the climatologic process as described by the physics of the model without a direct way to calculate the representational error we chose r to be inversely proportional to the number of stations in the monitored cell 5 r i β n obs where i is the identify matrix of order n β is a fixed scaling parameter that controls the magnitude of r and that will be used to test the impact of representational errors on the results and n obs is the number of observatories used in the estimation of y the higher the number of stations in a cell the lower the representational uncertainty guided by our experience we initially fixed β at 4 5 for t max and t min 9 for rh and w and 0 9 for sd to investigate the impact of scaling r on the results we performed a sensitivity analysis on the choice of β as described in section 3 4 3 3 uncertainty estimation to estimate the uncertainty of et o a we propagated the uncertainty of each one of the meteorological variables through the fao pm equation using a first order method for this we linearized the fao pm equation to obtain its jacobian matrix j et o and used it to propagate the covariance of the meteorological variables for a specific location grid cell k we have 6 σ et o a k 2 j et o k q k j et o k where q k is the covariance matrix of the variables at location k the jacobian was analytically calculated with the following form j et o et o t max et o t min et o hr et o w et o sd assuming independence of errors between the meteorological variables and using only the diagonal values variances of p i e σ 2 diag p the total error covariance matrix at location k is diagonal q k σ t max 2 k 0 0 0 0 0 σ t min 2 k 0 0 0 0 0 σ hr 2 k 0 0 0 0 0 σ w 2 k 0 0 0 0 0 σ sd 2 k where the subscript k denotes we are using the scalar k element of σ v 2 the assumption of independence and the diagonal nature of q permits to avoid operating with the full matrix q and simplifies the propagation of errors under these assumptions the uncertainty of et o a can be calculated independently at each location k as 7 σ et o a k 2 et o t max k 2 σ t max 2 k et o t min k 2 σ t min 2 k et o hr k 2 σ hr 2 k et o w k 2 σ w 2 k et o sd k 2 σ sd 2 k 3 4 sensitivity analysis to assess the impact that the choice of r has on the results we conducted multiple oi analyses using a range of values of β to vary de magnitude of r for each interpolated meteorological variable we tested four different values of this scaling parameter that evenly partitioned the range of r from an end member that represents high confidence in the observations r p to a value that represents low confidence r p table 2 shows the spatial mean values of p p which were used as a reference to design the values to scale r lowest and higher values of p are selected from the 12 unique p monthly values β values are chosen to cover the range between a value lower than the lowest p value and a value higher than the highest p value 3 5 spatial correlation with portugal the impact of not using weather observations over portugal was evaluated by analyzing the spatial structure of p and specifically how cells with observations in spain covary and inform climatic estimates over portugal since r is diagonal the spatial structure imposed by the optimal interpolation scheme is to a large extent driven by p to facilitate the spatial analysis we first transformed our covariance matrices into correlation matrices then we analyzed the number of grid points in portugal that correlate with observed grid points in spain with a coefficient higher than 0 75 when grid cells in portugal correlate highly with cells containing observations then these observation can inform the corrections in portugal even though they are located in spain during periods where correlations are lower the quality of the estimates over portugal decrease 4 results 4 1 observational dataset the number of instrumental observations used in the gridding process varied with time as individual stations in the network were added or decommissioned fig 2 presents a time series with the number of grid cells in the domain containing one or more observations for each of the meteorological variables used in the calculation of et o temperature t max and t min had the densest spatial coverage the number of grid cells for which temperature data were available increased from about 1200 in the late 1980s to over 1300 in 1995 from the mid 1990s the number of stations declined steadily and the number grid cells with temperature data was 1100 1150 toward the end of the study period stations that registered rh and w where less common at the start of analysis period in the late 1980s only about 100 grid cells contained information on these variables the number of stations measuring rh and w increased steadily until the mid 2000s when the installation of automatic weather stations aws resulted in a sharp increase in the number of grid cells containing information on the other hand the number of stations measuring sd declined over time from about 90 stations in the late 1980s to less than 70 at the end of the study period this decline was partly due to the obsolescence of the heliographs used to perform the measurements which are being replaced by modern radiometers the reason we did not include information from radiometers is that only heliographs provide a homogeneous dataset that covers the entire study period 4 2 optimally interpolated climatic variables and et o estimates the proposed method produces gridded fields of mean x a and variance σ a 2 estimates for each climate variable and for et o et o a and σ et o a 2 to illustrate the outcome of the process and provide a sense of the typical spatial distribution of the estimates and their associated uncertainty results are presented for one sample month july 1994 fig 3 overall the estimates for all meteorological variables and for et o show spatial structure devoid of the interpolation artefacts often produced by other interpolation methods the expected spatial climatologic patterns of the variables over the ip are captured including very localized windward leeward effects produced by the rugged physiography of mountain regions in this sample month the highest temperatures are located in the southern region of the peninsula and in the ebro valley in the northeast high x rh a values are concentrated in regions close to the coast and along corridors that extend the oceanic influence further inland wind speed x w a is highest in the castilla la mancha region eastern spain and in the ebro valley in northeastern spain where high wind speeds are facilitated by the unobstructed high plateau of castilla and by accelerations of northern winds in the ebro valley due to the interaction between the orographic dipole of the pyrenees mountain range with the morphology of the ebro catchment riosalido et al 1986 finally sunny summers and the compact shape of the ip produce similar mean x sd a estimates in july with the exception of the coastal northern region where mean x sd a values are significantly lower due to persistent cloud cover the climatology described by these variables produces et o a estimates that are higher in the southern region and in the ebro valley and lower in the north and northwest region of the peninsula the uncertainty of these estimates represented as the standard deviation σ a are in general low due to the relatively high number of instrumental observations available and the high spatial correlation of the variables this is especially true for σ t max a and σ t min a for which typical values were lower than 0 3 c σ rh a presents higher values in the southwest and northeast this study did not use observations in portugal which is the reason why these variables show higher uncertainty in the west and southwestern regions of the ip relatively high values of σ w a are present only in the regions with highest wind speeds the northwestern and northern coastal regions where cloud cover is most variable result in the highest values for σ sd a because the fao pm equation is non linear and concave upward uncertainties are amplified in regions of high et o where the function tends to have steeper derivatives to illustrate the typical time series generated by our method for each meteorological variable and for et o a fig 4 presents results for one sample location in central spain the most prominent feature of estimates for x t max a x t min a x sd a and et o a is the expected and marked seasonality with summer peaks and winter lows an inverse seasonality affects x rh a with summer lows and winter peaks whereas x w a does not show seasonality the most interesting information in this figure is the standard deviation of the estimates σ a which shows that uncertainty has a clear dependency on time seasonality for all variables in addition σ rh a and to a lesser degree σ w a exhibit a marked decrease in the standard deviation of the estimates toward the last quarter of the study period while σ sd a shows a moderate increase over time these trends are associated with variations in the number of data points used to perform the interpolation as we will discuss later seasonality and trends in the uncertainty of individual climate variables are propagated to σ et o a which in general also shows a clear seasonality and a decline toward the last quarter of the period 4 3 comparison between oi and the rcm the analysis of differences δ x a x b between the oi and the background rcm is of interest for detecting possible biases in the rcm and also to evaluate the adequacy of the observational network fig 5 shows x a the mean of x a over time and x b the same for x b for each climate variable and for et o et o a and et o b as well as their differences δ in general the rcm tended to underestimate t max δ t max 0 and to overestimate t min δ t min 0 indicating that the rcm describes a shallower annual temperature range than the observations we should keep in mind though that the rcm output represents mean cell estimates which are expected to have a lower variability than the very local point information represented by the observations for rh the oi estimates present higher values δ rh 0 in the southern region of the ip and lower values in the northern part δ rh 0 for w the biggest differences appeared in the north east region specially along the ebro valley lower values of sd δ sd 0 appeared in the northern region which could be related to the presence of low level clouds not easily resolved by rcms the effect of these differences is only modestly apparent in the mean et o of the study period the method corrects an et o b overestimation δ et o 0 in the southern region of the ip and in the ebro valley and corrects an underestimation δ et o 0 in the northern region and mountainous areas et o a presents higher values in the northern region and lower values in the southern region in general it appears that the spatial pattern of δ et o is very similar to the pattern of δ rh suggesting that this variable is a major player in determining the spatial patterns of the atmospheric water demand in the region the domain wide seasonal amount of correction is depicted in fig 6 which presents monthly et o a and et o b in general the mean values are similar except during spring and autumn where et o b seems to overestimate regional mean values the figure also presents the spatial interquartile range here also the largest differences between the two datasets occur during spring and autumn during these months the spatial variability of et o a is smaller than that represented by et o b 4 4 impact of the number of available observations as described in section 4 1 the number of stations providing meteorological information varies over time being most prominent the increase in the number of stations measuring rh and w in standard interpolation methods the granularity of the resulting fields is highly dependent on the number and spatial distribution of the observational data used for interpolation this is a problem because it also generates trends in the dispersion statistics variance kurtosis of the spatial fields we evaluate the extent to which oi reduces this problem by analyzing the impact of the number of observations on the amount of correction that our methods apply to the rcm estimates and on the spatial variance of the corrected fields fig 7 shows time series of the spatial mean of the correction applied to the rcm δ et o the differences are grouped by months to remove the seasonal cycle while a strong variability in the mean correction is detected in some months no trends are apparent in the time series not even in the last quarter of the period when a sharp increase in the number of rh and w weather stations took place we also analyzed if the varying number of stations used in the oi process generated temporal trends in the spatial variability of the et o a field fig 8 shows time series of the standard deviation of the field also grouped by months an inspection of the figure shows that only seasonal patterns exist and that no apparent trends can be identified that reveal an increase or decrease in the variability of the field as the number of observations used for interpolation changed over the years while the mean estimates did not seem sensitive to the number of stations used in the oi process the same was not true for their uncertainty fig 9 show time series of the spatial mean of the uncertainty of meteorological variables σ a and of et o σ et o a in the figure we see that σ et o a follows the same seasonality of the mean values showing higher uncertainty during the summer months and lower in winter but the overall uncertainty decreased over the years as the available information used to condition the rcm field increased the man kendall trend test man 1945 kendall 1975 with a significance level α 0 05 determined that the negative trend in the mean spatial uncertainty σ et o a 2 is significant for all the months except for june table 1 anex the decrease in σ et o a seems to be most related to the sharp decrease in σ rh a and σ w a as the number of observations for these two variables increase this occurs despite the fact that the σ t max a σ t min a and σ sd a increase as the number of available observations declined the highest uncertainty in the temperature estimates occurred during the warmest months of the year with a secondary peak in winter for σ t min a on the other hand σ w a and σ sd a showed higher values in winter and lower values in summer σ rh a showed no seasonality having similar values throughout the year 4 5 impact of r figs 10 and 11 present respectively the time series of the spatial mean of estimates for each meteorological variable x a and of the spatial mean of their associated posterior standard deviation σ a for each of the four tested r matrices in general we found that the results estimates remained robust for the range of r matrices tested and only x w a and x sd a showed relevant differences in the case of x w a differences appeared only in the first years of the study when the number of available observations was similar to those of sd as the number of w observations increased the effect of r on x w a faded out and similar results were obtained for the different matrices on the other hand the sensitivity of x sd a on r remained since the number of observations available of this variable continued to decline this suggests the existence of an observation density threshold beyond which the impact of observation uncertainties on the oi estimation process is limited the magnitude of r has a more severe impact on the spatial mean of the estimate uncertainty σ a as expected larger r values resulted in larger uncertainties with a clear dependency on the number of available observations this effect was most clear on σ rh a and σ w a since these two variables experienced the sharpest increase in the number of observations during the study period it is worth noting that the values of σ rh a at the end of the period in the worst case scenario largest r were similar to those at the start of the period in the best case scenario lowest r which suggests the existence of a trade off between the quantity and the quality of the observations 4 6 portugal correlation analysis fig 12 shows the results of the spatial correlation analysis over portugal for all the variables in two contrasting months january and july the color in each cell indicates with how many of the 600 grid cells over portugal the cell has a correlation higher than 0 75 in january winter large areas of spain show high correlation with portugal in all cases and not surprisingly western spain is the most correlated region with portugal t max and t min are the variables exhibiting the most extensive correlation it is interesting that rh and sd during the month of january show a region of extensive correlation with portugal in the southern face of pyrenees range this is mostly explained by the orographic uplift of southern winds in this region which occur simultaneously with cyclonic conditions affecting the western part of ip on the other hand correlated areas tend to decrease in july summer for all variables and the correlations are more spatially restricted to the western area of spain the decrease in the extension of highly correlated areas is specially acute for sd which is explained by the fact that cloudiness during summer months is often related to local or subregional conditions i e mainly convection and sea fog interacting with coastal areas from these results we consider that obtaining good climatological and et o estimates over portugal using observations located in spain is possible but these estimates are expected to be of better quality during winter when synoptic conditions over ip is highly correlated unfortunately et o estimates are most relevant during the summer months when aed is high fig 6 during summer local conditions become more important and correlations between portugal and the rest of the ip become more fragmented 5 discussion 5 1 meteorological estimates the mean climatic fields presented in fig 5 describe the climatology of the ip the northern and northwestern regions are the wettest and coolest with the lowest values of et o sd and t max and t min and higher values of rh the highest t max and t min are mostly concentrated in the southern half with the guadalquivir river valley standing out with the exception of the ebro river valley in the northeast which forms a depression with a characteristic semi arid local climate obtained values of et o are in concordance with previous studies in the iberian peninsula taking into account that other studies were developed using only a subset of weather stations vicente serrano et al 2014c used 46 weather stations in the spanish part of the ip or only analyzed a subregion in the ip such as vanderlinden et al 2008 and espadafor et al 2011 who analyzed only andalusia the same spatial distribution of et o was detected by some of those previous works the higher values appear in the southern region and the lower values in the northern region of the ip the ebro valley a region located in the north is an exception to this latitudinal pattern showing high values of et o the absolute values detected in our study are quite similar to the values of previous studies with maximum values higher than 1400 mm in the guadalquivir valley and values lower than 1000 mm in the northern region our results show somewhat higher values in the southern region up to 1600 mm at some locations in the guadalquivir valley some reasons for these higher estimates are i we used all the weather stations available ii 1961 2011 period show a clear positive trend in et o as detected by espadafor et al 2011 and vicente serrano et al 2014a and our study period 1989 2011 is the last part of that period because of that we possibly detected higher mean values than previous studies in some regions on the other hand minimum values below 700 mm in mountainous regions would be in agreement with the detection of low values in sierra nevada done by vanderlinden et al 2008 the seasonality of et o fig 6 follows the well known seasonal cycles of t max t min and sd with highest et o in the summer and lowest during the winter months espadafor et al 2011 vicente serrano et al 2014c martins et al 2017 the higher spatial variability of summer months was also detected in those previous studies the correction that meteorological observations impose on the background rcm can be analyzed by the differences between the meteorological fields estimated by the oi and those from the rcm these differences often present systematic patterns that can be attributed to biases in the rcm as found by kotlarski et al 2014 but they could also be attributed to the impact of correcting the field with observations that have a footprint smaller than the grid cells the spatial and temporal variability expected from ground observations is larger because their footprint is representative of a region much smaller than that of the grid cell for instance optimally interpolated annual mean values of t max are higher than those of the rcm while mean values of t min are lower indicating that the rcm tends to dampen thermal oscillations in most of the spatial domain this correction is spatially consistent except perhaps in high elevation regions the only variable that shows very contrasting spatial corrections of different sign is rh since oi tend to increase the lower values of rh in the northern half of the ip and decrease the highest values in the south this spatial correction pattern of rh is very similar to the differences in the mean et o field calculated from the oi variables and from the et o calculated from the uncorrected rcm variables which reinforces the conclusions by azorin molina et al 2015 that rh is a key driver of et o in the ip regarding sd annual mean values in the oi field are generally lower than those estimated by the rcm two main factors could help explain differences in sd i the wmo defined sd as the time interval in which the solar radiation exceeds 120 wm 2 wmo 2003 while sd obtained from the rcm considers this the observed sd data is more subjective for the period when the campbell stokes cs recorder was used kerr and tabony 2004 compared the perfomance of cs and automatic sensors obtaining a good agreement but with some differences perhaps because the solar radiation at which the cs starts to record ranges from 106 to 285 w m 2 painter 1981 and ii the general over prediction of solar radiation affecting climate models could also be affecting the rcm used in this study wild et al 2013 in fact our correction of sd values are in concordance with the results obtained for solar radiation by ruiz arias et al 2015 finally while we expected higher spatial variability of w in the observational dataset than in the rcm the annual mean values of the oi fields are lower than those of the rcm wind speed is a complex variable with high local spatial variability that physical models find difficult to capture in fact some authors e g ishak et al 2010 detected that dynamically downscaling a global reanalysis did not improve the quality of the w field with respect to the original reanalysis moreover an experiment using the wrf skamarock and klemp 2008 regional climate model in the north of the ip by jiménez and dudhia 2012 showed that wind speeds calculated at grid points were poor predictors of values observed at the closest ground observatories in the ip martins et al 2017 tested a blended reanalysis developed by sheffield et al 2006 which combined data from distinct sources to obtain a global reanalysis of better quality than any of the individual sources usually the global products have a coarser spatial resolution 0 5 in this case than regional products 0 11 for our product while they used weather observations to validate the results they obtained we preferred not to do that because the value of a weather observation refers to an exact point while the values of oi refer to a grid cell nevertheless as it has been previously explained both the spatial and temporal distribution of our product are coherent with results obtained by previous studies 5 2 uncertainty of estimates our methodology makes a number of assumptions that are worth discussing before interpreting the results we consider that the uncertainty of background rcm estimates p equals to their monthly variance this assumption is based on the idea that monthly estimates of a variable are random variables and that each year in the rcm record is one sample of the variable for each month under this assumption and in the absence of additional information the historical variability the sample variance of the rcm estimates for a given month of the year is the uncertainty around the estimate of this variable note that we are not inferring monthly climatologic means whose uncertainty is represented by the standard error of the mean but values for each particular month in the record so the sample variance the climatological variability and not the standard error is a more appropriate measure of their uncertainty we believe this choice provides a conservative pessimistic estimate of the background uncertainty because it does not leverage information available from previous months an alternative approach to parameterize p would be to use the variance from an ensemble of models e g from the cordex project we argue that this approach would underestimate the actual uncertainty of the estimates because the limited number of models included in the ensemble and because the finite conceptualisations of the reality that they implement sample only a limited range of the actual uncertainty knutti 2010 for this and for its simplicity we preferred to provide the initial estimate of uncertainty from the monthly climatology of the rcm recently the era5 new reanalysis of the ecmwf was made available for the period 2010 2016 and includes a measure of its uncertainty a comparison between both approaches to parameterize p will be possible when the full temporal record in the era5 dataset becomes available hersbach and dee 2016 a second relevant consideration is the prescription of matrix r which represents the error variance of the observations we assumed that observational or instrument errors which are seldom documented are negligible compared to the station representativity error which quantifies the uncertainty associated with the local conditions measured by a given station being representative of the cell where the station is located to approximate this uncertainty we assumed that station errors are independent from each other i e that the matrix r is diagonal and that the uncertainty of each station is inversely proportional to the number of data occurring inside a specific grid cell such that the higher the number of observatories used to estimate the mean value of a grid cell the lower the observational uncertainty for that cell fig 10 shows that variables that are sampled by a large number of stations t min and t max variations in r affect only the uncertainty while the estimates themselves are not affected this is because errors in r are assumed to be unbiased and independent which along with the large number of available stations and the high spatial covariation imposed by p allows for a robust estimation of the spatial field on the other hand variables with a smaller number of observations such as rh w and sd show that variations in r affect both the estimate s uncertainty and the estimates themselves interestingly the case of rh and w both of which experienced a large increase in the number of available observations over time suggests that there is a threshold in the number of observations beyond which the estimates are mostly unaffected by observation uncertainty this is indicative of a trade off between the quantity and the quality of observational information as we will discuss below 5 3 impact of changes in the density of the observational network the generation of meteorological grids using standard interpolation methods such as kriging and other methods based on distance weighting is very sensitive to variations in the number and location of the weather stations used moreover the density and distribution of ground observations necessary to resolve the spatial variability of the climatic field being reconstructed depends on the degree of spatial autocorrelation of the field this is because the covariance of the process determines the size of the region each observation is representative of silverman and maneta 2016 this has non trivial consequences for any climate analysis performed using these grids because the varying number of stations used for interpolation may induce trends in the spatial variability granularity of the meteorological fields that can easily be misinterpreted as being genuinely caused by a climatic process our analysis fig 8 showed that the spatial standard deviation of the fields produced by oi was not as acutely affected by this problem as traditional interpolation methods are as demonstrated in previous studies beguería et al 2016 while the rapid increase in the number of observations affected the estimates of rh w and sd fig 2 the spatial variance of these fields did not show appreciable changes that could be attributed to the densification of the observational network for rh and w which more than doubled the available data in the last 5 years of the study period an increase of the granularity of the field could be expected due to more local effects being detected within the observational network on the other hand sd experienced a steady decrease in the number of grid cells with data with potential impacts on the granularity of the field however we did not find significant temporal trends in the dispersion statistics of the resulting climatic fields a reason for this is that in the oi scheme the information about the spatial variability of the climatic field being reconstructed does not exclusively depend on ground observations as other methods do but also on the rcm variance covariance matrix p which embeds a physically based estimation of the spatial variability of the climatic process over the entire domain including areas sparsely monitored since r is a diagonal matrix the spatial correction performed by oi mostly depends on p i e on the spatial variability of the climate process extracted from the rcm which is available for all grid points and reduces the dependency of the resulting field variance on ground observations on the other hand the uncertainty of the estimates σ a represented on fig 9 was very sensitive to the number of stations used especially for rh and w the sharp increment in the density of the observational network for these variables had a strong impact in reducing σ rh a and σ w a from an algebraic point of view the increase in the number of grid cells containing data affects the calculation of the gain matrix k eq 2 as r decreases p becomes a larger share of the total error variance represented by k informing the updates to increase the amount of correction on the prior estimates i e observations gain influence when the variance update formula is used to calculate the posterior uncertainty of the estimate p k induces a larger reduction in the background uncertainty p similarly a decrease in the number of observations such as in the case of sd results in an increase in σ sd a this also happens albeit to a smaller extent with t max and t min nevertheless the increment in the number of rh and w observations was more important than the decrease in the number of observations in these three variables and the overall uncertainty in the et o estimate σ et o a decreased over the study period 6 conclusions 1 the use of an oi scheme blending background rcm data with observational data from a relatively dense network allowed estimating fields of the variables needed to compute fields of fao pm et o 2 oi also allowed propagating the initial uncertainty of the data to the oi estimated fields which were then propagated through the jacobian of fao pm equation to finally get et o uncertainty fields 3 the granularity of the estimated et o fields as measured through their spatial variance was not affected by changes in the number of stations in the observational network which were noticeable during the study period this can be attributed to the physically coherent information on the spatial structure of the variables provided by the rcm and contrasts with other methods that rely on observational data alone 4 the uncertainty of the meteorological variables and therefore of et o was however sensitive to changes in the number of stations used in this sense we found that in our case study the number and spatial distribution of temperature records was adequate for the spatial resolution of our analysis while a recent increase in the number of air humidity and wind speed stations substantially reduced the uncertainty of computed et o a reduction was found in the number of sunshine duration stations that affected negatively the computation of et o 5 the propagation of uncertainty is a highly relevant issue when constructing meteorological grids but it is often neglected probably due to difficulties in determining the uncertainty of the original data sources in this case a number of assumptions were made to quantify the uncertainties of the rcm and observational data used and their consequences were checked and discussed but other options could be explored acknowledgments this work has been supported by the research project cgl2014 52135 c3 1 r financed by the

7339,thawing permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp has great impacts on the local hydrological process by way of causing ground ice to thaw until now there is little knowledge on ground ice hydrology near permafrost table under a warming climate this study applied stable tracers isotopes and chloride and hydrograph separation model to quantify the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in continuous permafrost regions of the central qtp the results indicated that the ground ice near permafrost table was mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water accounting for 58 9 to 87 0 and 13 0 to 41 1 respectively which implying that the active layer was the dominant source the contribution rates from the active layer to the ground ice in alpine meadow 59 to 69 was less than that in alpine steppe 70 to 87 it showed well developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients presenting depleted isotopes and positive chemical gradients with depth within the soil layer the effects of evaporation and freeze out fractionation on the soil water and ground ice were evident the results provide additional insights into ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in permafrost terrain and would be helpful for improving process based detailed hydrologic models under the occurring global warming keywords hydrogeochemistry ground ice recharge permafrost table qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction most of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is underlain by permafrost which is vulnerable to climate change global warming in recent decades has resulted in permafrost degradation which further has significant impacts on the hydrological and ecological processes qin et al 2016 leading to the variations in hydrological conditions and redistribution of subsurface water throckmorton et al 2016 the knowledge of fundamental hydrologic processes in permafrost regions is limited which influences future predictions of regional hydrologic cycling helbig et al 2013 painter et al 2013 there have been some literatures to analyze recharge and cycling in tundra rivers blaen et al 2014 lakes anderson et al 2013 groundwater carey et al 2013 and active layer water throckmorton et al 2016 but few on ground ice near permafrost table yang et al 2016a ground ice is a distinctive feature of permafrost terrain and could be a potential water source and a proxy index of past climates yoshikawa et al 2013 the large amount of ground ice was discovered in permafrost regions of which the total volume is approximately 9528 km3 liu and chen 2000 zhao et al 2010 the ground ice near the permafrost table is thawing under warming climate which influences water and heat exchange energy budget greenhouse gases release cheng and wu 2007 consequently it is of great significance to understand ground ice recharge and cycling near the permafrost table on the qtp natural tracers such as geochemical constituents and stable isotopes have been widely used to study runoff components and flow paths uhlenbrook et al 2002 gibson et al 2017 the method has been introduced into frozen soil regions to investigate the water sources of ground ice using end member mixing analysis method emma merlivat and jouzel 1979 gilbert et al 2016 lorrain and demeur 1985 stated that ground ice probably formed from the infiltration of glacier meltwater in the arctic permafrost regions in canadian by analyzing the ice isotopic variation characteristics the same conclusion was drawn at the tuktoyaktuk area western arctic coast canada mackay and dallimore 1992 the research in the mackenzie delta and yukon coastal plain regions showed that the 18o value of modern ice wedges can be significantly different from relict ice wedges indicating different paleoclimatic conditions michel 1990 yang et al 2016a revealed that near surface ground ice 0 3 m depth formed mainly from modern precipitation in the kunlun mountain pass on the qtp china meanwhile some progress has been made about the ground ice near permafrost table the water content near permafrost table was increasing based on the analysis of field data zhao et al 2000 hinkel et al 1996 cheng 1983 figured out the mechanism of repeated segregation for the formation of thick layered ground ice near permafrost table however there were still little field based research which explored the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in addition the freeze out fractionation effect for isotope compositions would occur during the unfrozen pore water refreezing into ground ice which would increase the uncertainty of the results for hydrograph separation model harris et al 2007 chloride ion as widely distributed in various water components is the stable structure of chlorine and not sensitive to oxidative reductive conditions and ph huang et al 2017 hence is considered as a suitable natural tracer in alpine regions clark et al 2001 in this study the geochemical conservative tracer chloride ions were used in hydrograph separation to explore the recharge sources and contribution ratios of ground ice near permafrost table in the continuous permafrost regions on the central qtp we attempted to combine stable isotopic and hydrochemical tracers to determine water sources of ground ice near permafrost table the results were expected to fill the fundamental knowledge gap on the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and provide theoretical foundation for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions of the qtp 2 methods 2 1 site description all samples were collected along the qinghai tibet highway qth which winds through the continuous permafrost regions on the hinterland of qtp fig 1 the eight sampling sites include xidatan1 xdtb xidatan2 xdtms kunlunshan kls qingshuihe qsh wudaoliang1 wdlms wudaoliang2 wdlh kekexili kkxl and wenquan wq whose elevations range from 4488 to 4960 m above the sea level 91 900 94 091 e and 33 100 35 720 n with a relatively smooth terrain the slope of each site is less than 5 table 1 the active layer thickness ranges from 1 5 to 3 1 m for the eight sampling sites the mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 3 to 2 2 c and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 212 to 310 mm obtained from national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration and the mean annual evaporation is 1200 1470 mm characterized by a plateau sub frigid semiarid climate li et al 2012 the annual change of precipitation shows a seasonal distribution with about 83 of the total rainfall mainly occurring from may to september zhao et al 2008 the mainly vegetation ecosystems include alpine meadow and alpine steppe and the surface soil types are dominated by sandy loam and loam in these sites the warming climate and associated thawing permafrost are influencing regional hydrological and ecological condition for decades to come yang et al 2016b 2 2 field data during the period from late september to early october of 2015 the water samples were collected from eight sites in permafrost regions along qinghai tibet highway by means of the excavation of soil profile when the thaw depth of active layer approximate to the maximum before the winter freeze up the thawing water samples were collected within the active layer the samples of ground ice near permafrost table were collected at the ice rich layer in the upper part of transient layer and permafrost water samples were taken at 0 5 m depth below the permafrost table table 1 three random replicate water samples were taken at each sampling depth the samples of the ground ice and permafrost water were frozen during sampling the precipitation samples were collected at the study region between september 2015 and june 2016 a total of 131 water samples were collected 23 precipitation samples 60 active layer water samples 24 ground ice samples near permafrost table and 24 permafrost water samples all water samples were immediately sealed in 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination and stored in coolers until back to lab 2 3 laboratory analysis the stable isotope and geochemical measurements were undertaken at the state key laboratory of cryosphere sciences northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences all samples were thawed at room temperature once back to lab filtered through 0 22 µm filters then stored at 4 c to limit evaporation until analysis active layer samples which were used to determine anion concentrations were dried at 105 c for 24 h 50 g of oven dried sample then added double deionized water 50 ml agitated intermittently for 12 h and then the solution was collected with a syringe and filtered through 0 45 µm filters for anion analysis huang et al 2017 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios were measured using laser absorption spectroscopy liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research del 100 the results are reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision for δ18o and δd amounts to 0 2 and 0 5 respectively all water samples were analyzed for major cations and anions by ion chromatography dionex 320 the evaluated ions include fluoride chloride bromide nitrate sulfate sodium ammonium potassium magnesium and calcium the total error in anions and cations is 1 and the analytical detection limit for ions was below 0 1 mg l 2 4 hydrograph separation the hydrograph separation using nature tracers is based on the steady state mass balance equations for water and conservative tracer sklash and farvolden 1979 1 q t q 1 q 2 q n 2 c t t i q t c 1 t i q 1 c 2 t i q 2 c n t i q n where q t is total runoff q 1 q 2 q n are the runoff components and c 1 t i c 2 t i c n t i are the respective runoff component concentrations of the tracer t i in the case of n runoff components need n 1 observed tracers t 1 t 2 t n 1 this technique is based on a number of assumptions 1 the significant differences exist in the tracer concentrations of the different components 2 the tracer concentration of each component is constant throughout the event or variations can be neglected 3 the additional component contributions are negligible 4 the tracers mix conservatively 5 the tracer concentrations of different components are not collinear hoeg et al 2000 the simplest way of using this technique is two component separation model which separates water sources into event water and pre event water and determines their contributions to total runoff the gaussian standard error propagation method as outlined by genereux 1998 was used to estimate the uncertainty in two component hydrograph separation model which could determine the systematic and analytical errors of observed tracer signatures 3 w f p c e c t c e c p 2 w c p 2 c t c p c e c p 2 w c e 2 1 c e c p w c t 2 1 2 where w is uncertainty c is tracer concentration f is the fraction of total

the uncertainty of the tracer concentrations w c p w c e and w c t was estimated using the standard deviations multiplied by t values from student s t distribution 95 confidence for the tracer concentrations genereux 1998 the uncertainty of contribution fraction w f p was determined using eq 3 3 results 3 1 dissolved ions the geochemistry of water samples was measured table 2 and also used to calculate the average normality of each ion for precipitation ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water fig 2 precipitation has a hco3 ca chemistry fig 2 with low salinity the total dissolved solids tds 33 8 mg l the electrical conductivity ec 67 7 us cm and small dissolved ions concentrations cl 0 8 mg l table 2 which is similar to the value in the fenghuoshan during 2008 by ren et al 2010 and the value in the kunlun mountains pass kmp yang et al 2016b indicating the impact of human activities to region meteoric water is negligible the active layer water has relatively high anion concentrations cl ranges from 51 3 to 917 5 mg l and so4 2 ranges from 68 8 to 1641 4 mg l table 2 there are large differences of anion concentrations cl so4 2 and no3 between the active layer water and precipitation table 2 indicating that the active layer water undergoes strong evaporation furthermore the ground ice near permafrost table has a hco3 na chemistry with a na cl molar ratio of 1 82 and high cl cl 127 7 982 9 mg l and salinity tds 0 5 4 3 g l compared with the ground ice the shallow permafrost water has similar geochemistry and slightly lower na cl ratio 1 5 but characterized by higher cl cl 140 9 1281 2 mg l and salinity tds 1 1 3 5 g l fig 2 providing a significant contribution of ions and salinity to the ground ice which is similar to the values for spring water in kekexili region hu 1997 the remarkable differences of cl in each water component provide a tool to determine the relative contributions of various water sources to ground ice near permafrost table 3 2 stable isotopes the isotopic composition of precipitation active layer water and ground ice is summarized in fig 3 and table 3 as shown in fig 3 the source of subsurface water including active layer moisture and ground ice mainly originated from atmospheric precipitation the isotope composition of precipitation ranges from 15 2 to 4 4 for δ18o mean δ18o 10 4 and from 104 9 to 30 0 for δd mean δd 67 7 is similar to the results in kmp by yang et al 2016b which is relatively far from the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 indicating intense evaporation and kinetic fractionation effect for aqueous vapour in qtp since the marine air mass is very difficult to reach the northern part of the qtp directly and much precipitation will re evaporate to atmosphere from the earth surface tian et al 2001 the active layer water data mean δ18o 11 2 mean δd 79 7 is located near the meteoric water line and is similar to the mean isotopic composition of precipitation which shows the active layer water is mainly supplied by local warm season rainfall because of rare snow cover in qtp and may be affected by strong local evaporation prior to recharge yang et al 2016b additionally the δ18o and δd of ground ice near permafrost table from 15 5 to 11 0 and from 104 7 to 73 6 approximating to the values of precipitation are close to the values of underlying permafrost water from 17 2 to 10 1 and from 127 1 to 75 3 and the active layer water it implied that the ground ice is recharged from the three water components directly or indirectly and the unfrozen water in permafrost could migrate upward to permafrost table cheng 1983 the δ18o value for permafrost is different with the δ18o value of precipitation the difference is 3 0 but is close to the δ18o value in guliya ice core drilled through the guliya ice cap in the west kunlun mountains on the central qtp in 1992 in the past 100a δ18o 14 3 the difference is 0 9 tian and yao 2016 which shows that the source of permafrost water at 50 cm depth below permafrost table does not directly originates from summer rainfall of an individual year but from long term modern atmospheric precipitation a diagram of δd vs chloride of ground ice for water samples in qtp illustrates that in general chloride concentrations increase as the δd values become depleted both for ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water fig 4 indicating that ground ice has not undergone strong evaporation harris et al 2007 furthermore as shown in table 3 the isotope values become more depleted successively from precipitation to active layer water ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water on the qtp that means water is isotopically much more depleted but has relatively higher cl concentrations with increasing depth in the soil profile showing that the main factor affecting isotope depletion in unfrozen water is frozen fractionation effect rather than evaporation because the active layer and ground ice are supplied by unfrozen water migration and undergo annual and interannual freeze thaw cycles repeatedly cheng 1983 3 3 hydrograph separation the potential sources of ground ice near permafrost table may include precipitation active layer water and underlying permafrost water therefore both cl and δ18o were used as conservative tracers to confirm if the three mixing end members exist using the measured data of the eight sampling sites the three end members mixing diagram of chloride versus δ18o for precipitation active layer water and permafrost water was plotted fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the sample of ground ice near permafrost table is located without the triangle suggesting that three end members do not exist the precipitation would recharge the ground ice directly or indirectly the directly impact of precipitation to the ground ice is little and can be neglected when separating sources because the active layer thickness in qtp is relatively large ranging from 1 5 m to 3 1 m table 1 but precipitation is only about 400 mm as mentioned the main source of the active layer water is rainfall boike and hubberten 1998 so the indirect effect of precipitation on the ground ice has been reflected in the end member of active layer water therefore in this paper two component separation model eqs 1 and 2 was applied to estimate sources and mixing processes and to quantity the relative contribution proportions of the two end members to ground ice near permafrost table using chloride as conservative tracer of mixing table 4 for the continuous permafrost regions in qtp the active layer water and permafrost water contributed ranging from 58 9 to 87 0 and from 13 0 to 41 1 of the ground ice respectively evidently indicating that the ground ice is mainly originated from the active layer water and that the shallow permafrost water also plays an important role on the hydrological cycle of the ground ice the relative fractions of active layer and permafrost water contributions varied throughout the sampling sites because of the various underlying surface conditions there were two main vegetation ecosystems including alpine meadow and alpine steppe the contribution ratios of active layer water in the alpine steppe were greater 70 87 than that in the alpine meadow 59 69 the standard error associated with the hydrograph separation was calculated using eq 3 table 4 the estimated average percent error for all sites ranges between 0 2 and 8 8 this however is considered an actual underestimate due to the large spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions for the permafrost regions in qtp 4 discussion 4 1 general characteristics of isotope and chemistry for ground ice the main dissolved ion concentrations showed relatively significant differences among sampling sites table 2 the underlying surface characteristics of the sampling sites are diverse covering with various vegetation e g alpine meadow alpine desert and alpine steppe microtopography and increasing elevation from north to south from 4488 to 4960 m however the changes of chloride and tds exhibit large fluctuation but no evident changing trends with distance the origin is golmud city along qth from north to south and the differences of ion concentrations between north sites and south sites are not notable fig 6 this reveals the complex interaction between water sources and flow pathways carey et al 2013 it also indicates that the altitude is not the main controlling factor for hydrochemistry in the permafrost regions of the qtp the isotope and chemistry compositions are characterized by significant change within the different soil depth tables 2 and 3 the isotope compositions of subsurface water apparently decrease as the depth increase compared with the shallow subsurface pore water the soil water and ground ice in deeper layers tended to have more negative values table 3 the more negative values from ground ice were somewhat resulted from unfrozen water which experienced frozen fractionation during freezing processes gonfiantini 1986 suzuoki and kjmura 1973 proposed that the heavy isotope takes priority into ice resulting in more negative of unfrozen water isotope in the process of freezing and that the δd of unfrozen water typically decreased 2 3 a further possible reason for the decreased isotopes might be contributed to the different sources for soil water at different depths the active layer water was mainly recharged by long term modern precipitation and the permafrost water was primarily sourced from old meteoric precipitation while old meteoric precipitation had lower isotopic values than that for modern precipitation tian and yao 2016 however the hydrochemical gradients of soil water and ground ice were positive in the continuous permafrost regions on qtp table 2 the active layer water had greater chloride content than precipitation implying that these waters were locally derived from recent precipitation but strong evaporation occurred table 3 yang et al 2016a revealed a strong evaporation signal about 1469 mm at the kunlun mountain pass on the qtp the great evaporation loss under arid condition on the qtp could be due to the little precipitation about 400 mm strong solar radiation yao et al 2013 and low relative humidity therefore the evaporation process would play an important role in the elevated chloride concentration of active layer water because liquid moisture will rise into atmosphere during evaporation while salinity is stranded in soil and has enrichment effect zhang et al 2003 koch et al 2014 also noted the importance of evaporation to summer active layer water for arctic permafrost regions moreover the repeated replenishment of precipitation to active layer might contribute to the lower ion concentrations in near surface ground due to the low ions and dilution of precipitation huang et al 2017 the chloride content of ground ice near permafrost table tended to significantly greater than that of the active layer pore water while the chloride content of permafrost water was the greatest within these soil layers table 3 the material sources of chloride in subsurface water are mainly from surface water infiltration water exchange with deeper ground water and the dissolution of evaporites he et al 2011 on the qtp the evaporites spreaded extensively due to strong evaporation at the ground surface hu 1997 the salt lake and thermal spring are widely distributed with relatively high salinity and chloride hu 1997 contributing a large amount of salinity to permafrost water through infiltration and water exchange for example in kekexili region on the central qtp hu 1997 found the cl in spring water could approximate to 1 4 g l and na and cl in salt lake were 68 9 g l and 130 7 g l respectively these might imply that the chloride in permafrost water may be primarily sourced from the dissolution of evaporites the infiltration recharge of high salinity lake water and water exchange between permafrost water and deeper groundwater in continuous permafrost regions on the qtp newman et al 2015 also stated that there were strong geochemical depth gradients within active layer in the arctic permafrost region throckmorton et al 2016 demonstrated significant isotope variation with active layer depth at the same site the presence of well developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients within the soil profile indicated that the vertical mixing may be insignificant in permafrost region on the qtp otherwise the depth gradients would be impossibly existed throckmorton et al 2016 furthermore the vertical distribution of soluble ion concentrations within soil profile may be used as an indicator of solute migration and sedimentation conditions lamhonwah et al 2017 and more further studies are required to examine the vertical distributions of hydrochemistry and the interaction with environmental factors by analyzing core samples which are collected within the soil profile with high resolution 5 10 cm interval in the permafrost regions of the qtp 4 2 the sources of ground ice near permafrost table there are three potential water sources to ground ice near permafrost table including precipitation cold season snow and warm season rainfall the active layer water and underlying permafrost water unfrozen water the three end members mixing diagram of chloride versus δ18o for the ground ice fig 5 implies that the importance of precipitation as a source of the ground ice is relatively little snow and snowmelt have significant effect on arctic and other tundra runoff in the winter and spring streletskiy et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015 however the contribution of snow and snowmelt to the active layer is little throckmorton et al 2016 since the infiltration of snowmelt is limited by ice filled pores and rapidly runs into stream woo et al 2008 in the permafrost regions on the qtp the precipitation amount is only about 400 mm while the evaporation could amount to 1469 mm yang et al 2016a leading to relatively dry soil which has large soil water storage capacity gao et al 2014 additionally the active layer thickness on the qtp ranges from 1 5 m to 3 1 m table 1 and the clayey layer approximately 50 80 cm was found above permafrost table within the soil profile in most of the sampling sites which has relatively large water holding capacity and dramatically limits the infiltration of rain into the ground ice zhu 1983 all these factors might result in the weak supply from rain to the ground ice on the qtp therefore the precipitation could be neglected during separating sources in addition as mentioned above the indirect effect of precipitation on the ground ice has been reflected in active layer water because the isotope characteristics show that active layer water is mainly sourced from rainfall boike and hubberten 1998 as shown in table 4 the active layer water accounted for 58 9 87 0 of the source of the ground ice near permafrost table while permafrost water accounted for 13 0 41 1 indicating that the active layer water is the dominant source of the ground ice the chloride values of ground ice are similar to that of active layer water rather than that of permafrost water table 3 the driving force of water migration for the two end members is different zhao et al 2000 the driving forces of soil moisture migration include gravity and temperature gradient and water transports downward to deep layer under gravity while moves from a warmer to a cooler location under temperature gradient zhu 1983 perfect and williams 1980 zhao et al 2000 continuously observed the ground temperature profile in the wudaoliang site on the qtp and found that ground temperature rised as the soil depth increased during the freezing period from late september to mid april while apparently falled down as the soil depth increased during the thawing period from late april to mid september perfect and williams 1980 pointed out that quantity of transferred water is well positively correlated with temperature gradient and temperature during the thawing season the temperature gradient between ground surface and permafrost table is large the maximum temperature difference is about 8 c the unfrozen water content is relatively high xie et al 2012 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities in active layer is also high due to sandy soil sand particle content is more than 71 within 3 m depth soil layer which has high porosity about 52 and low water holding capacity in the permafrost regions on qtp liu et al 2013 gao et al 2014 the active layer pore water transfers downward to supply ground ice near permafrost table by gravity and temperature gradient with a large amount of moisture migration and high transferring rate zhao et al 2000 however cheng 1983 found that there is only upward migration of unfrozen pore water in permafrost to recharge ground ice near permafrost table by a positive ground temperature gradient during the freezing season with a little amount of moisture migration and very low transferring rate due to a relatively small temperature gradient and low unfrozen pore water content zhao et al 2000 xie et al 2012 since the downward transportation of unfrozen water in a frozen active layer is greatly limited by ice filled pores woo et al 2008 in addition we mainly explored the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and determined its dominant contributor using one year sampling data in the present study further research should focus on the ground ice source dynamics through long term continuous investigation on the qtp in the context of climate warming this work only demonstrated the vertical moisture migration while the lateral groundwater flow could also impact water movement within soil profile the lateral groundwater flow significantly impacts water and solute movement in the active layer mainly during the thawing period jessen et al 2014 schuh et al 2017 however the clear interaction between lateral groundwater flow and ground ice near permafrost table in the permafrost affected regions on the qtp still remains largely unknown yang et al 2017 more detailed observations are required to examine the influence of lateral groundwater flow to ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in the context of permafrost degradation permafrost degradation has occurred during the past 50 years due to climate change and human activities cheng and wu 2007 wu et al 2013 wang 1993 jin et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature is noticeably rising with a rate of 0 2 0 4 c 10a during recent decades liu and chen 2000 qin et al 2016 and the mean annual ground surface temperature also shows significantly increase by the rate of 0 6 c 10a from 1980 to 2007 on the central qtp wu et al 2013 the surface thawing index sti has increased at a rate of 125 0 c d decade 1 and the surface freezing index sfi has decreased at a rate of 111 2 c d decade 1 on the central qtp wu et al 2013 in which the sti and sfi reflect the seasonal thaw depth and freeze depth in cold regions respectively wu et al 2011 furthermore cheng and wu 2007 revealed that the active layer thickness has increased by 15 50 cm between 1996 and 2001 xie et al 2012 demonstrated that the liquid water content of active layer migrated downward from the ground surface to the deep soil layer more unfrozen water migration downward because of rising temperature extending thawing period thickening active layer would increase the potential contribution of active layer water to ground ice near permafrost table in the coming years therefore long term and continuous observations are required to investigate the responses of ground ice sources to permafrost degradation and climate change 4 3 influence of alpine ecosystems to ground ice alpine ecosystems in permafrost regions on qtp could be classified into two categories including alpine meadow and alpine steppe table 1 based on the hydrograph separation model the recharge portion of active layer water to the ground ice in the alpine meadow 59 69 was obviously less than that in alpine steppe 70 87 table 4 the influence of different alpine ecosystems to ground ice was different gao et al 2014 the vegetation played a crucial role on the regional water balance and soil moisture redistribution on the frozen ground regions li et al 2013 it is turned out that the ground surface vegetation could affect soil water redistribution pattern and migration processes for various ecosystems under a warming climate table 5 wang et al 2011 zeng et al 2013 luo et al 2014 as shown in table 5 for the top 50 cm soil layer the soil moisture content in the alpine meadow was higher than that in alpine steppe in the sampling sites which was consistent with the results in the wudaoliang region by gao et al 2014 the aboveground and underground biomass and root density for various vegetation showed remarkable difference which resulted from the difference of water holding capacity infiltration hydraulic conductivity porosity and soil texture between the two alpine ecosystems luo et al 2014 gao et al 2014 found that the saturated hydraulic conductivity in alpine steppe was about 5 1 mm min which was 2 times greater than that in alpine meadow about 2 5 mm min but the water holding capacity in alpine steppe porosity 51 was less than that in alpine meadow porosity 57 in the top 40 cm soil in the permafrost regions in addition the shallow soil layer in the permafrost regions of the qtp was mostly dominated by sandy soil sand particle content was more than 92 in the root layer liu et al 2013 which may also increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during the rainy season zhou et al 2000 hence the alpine steppe soil could supplies more liquid water to deep layer to recharge ground ice near permafrost table in the permafrost regions due to sparse vegetation roots large infiltration high hydrologic conductivity low transpiration and coarse particle size of soil however the high initial soil moisture content and dense root system of alpine meadow restricted the infiltration of liquid water resulting in more water preserving in shallow soil layer and lost by evapotranspiration and plants growing during growth season li et al 2008 which would lead to less contribution ratio of active layer water to the ground ice 5 conclusion this work used stable tracer method and hydrograph separation model to infer the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and quantify the contribution ratios in continuous permafrost regions on the qtp according to the above analysis a conceptual diagram of water sources and cycling of ground ice near permafrost table was established in permafrost regions on the qtp fig 7 the results of hydrograph separation model indicate negligible contribution from precipitation suggesting that the ground ice near permafrost table is mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water in the thawing season only active layer pore water transfers downward to supply the ground ice by gravity and temperature gradient the active layer water accounts for 58 9 87 0 of the ground ice as the predominant source the influence of ground surface vegetation on the source of ground ice is evident the recharge portion of active layer water to the ground ice in the alpine meadow 59 69 was obviously less than that in alpine steppe 70 87 implying that vegetation plays animportant role on the regional water balance and soil moisture redistribution on the permafrost regions under a warming climate in the freezing season there was only upward migration of unfrozen water in permafrost to recharge the ground ice by temperature gradient permafrost water accounted for 13 0 41 1 and also was an important source of the ground ice in addition we also investigated the spatial characteristics of hydrogeochemistry for soil water and ground ice the main dissolved ions concentration exhibits a large fluctuation but no significant changing trends with distance along the qth from north to south the isotope and chemistry compositions show notable variations with depth within the soil profile the isotope values depleted as the soil depth increased the more negative values of deep soil water and ground ice are mainly originated from freeze out fractionation during interannual freeze thaw processes however the hydrochemical compositions present apparent positive gradients with depth the chloride content of the active layer water is relatively high due to the influence of strong evaporation on the local scale the higher chloride concentration in permafrost water may be primarily originated from the dissolution of evaporites the infiltration recharge of high salinity in lake water and water exchange between permafrost water and deeper groundwater on the qtp the natural stable tracer was a useful tool to determine sources of ground ice and acted as an indicator of evaporation and frozen fractionation in permafrost regions in particular we noted that both evaporation and frozen fractionation could result in isotopic fractionation but chloride is more conservative and is a suitable natural tracer suited to alpine regions the comparison of hydrograph separation model results between stable isotopes and chloride tracer was necessary to estimate the impact of freeze out fractionation in conclusion the alpine ecosystems are notably affecting ground ice sources near permafrost table in permafrost regions under a warming climate these results provide additional insights into the sources and cycling of the ground ice near permafrost table on the permafrost regions and thus should be useful for addressing fundamental knowledge gap and establishing better regional hydrologic models further studies are required to investigate the response of ground ice dynamics to permafrost degradation and their interaction with environmental factors acknowledgements we thank all staff from the cryosphere research station on the qinghai tibetan plateau for their assistance in

7339,thawing permafrost on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp has great impacts on the local hydrological process by way of causing ground ice to thaw until now there is little knowledge on ground ice hydrology near permafrost table under a warming climate this study applied stable tracers isotopes and chloride and hydrograph separation model to quantify the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in continuous permafrost regions of the central qtp the results indicated that the ground ice near permafrost table was mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water accounting for 58 9 to 87 0 and 13 0 to 41 1 respectively which implying that the active layer was the dominant source the contribution rates from the active layer to the ground ice in alpine meadow 59 to 69 was less than that in alpine steppe 70 to 87 it showed well developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients presenting depleted isotopes and positive chemical gradients with depth within the soil layer the effects of evaporation and freeze out fractionation on the soil water and ground ice were evident the results provide additional insights into ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in permafrost terrain and would be helpful for improving process based detailed hydrologic models under the occurring global warming keywords hydrogeochemistry ground ice recharge permafrost table qinghai tibet plateau 1 introduction most of the qinghai tibet plateau qtp is underlain by permafrost which is vulnerable to climate change global warming in recent decades has resulted in permafrost degradation which further has significant impacts on the hydrological and ecological processes qin et al 2016 leading to the variations in hydrological conditions and redistribution of subsurface water throckmorton et al 2016 the knowledge of fundamental hydrologic processes in permafrost regions is limited which influences future predictions of regional hydrologic cycling helbig et al 2013 painter et al 2013 there have been some literatures to analyze recharge and cycling in tundra rivers blaen et al 2014 lakes anderson et al 2013 groundwater carey et al 2013 and active layer water throckmorton et al 2016 but few on ground ice near permafrost table yang et al 2016a ground ice is a distinctive feature of permafrost terrain and could be a potential water source and a proxy index of past climates yoshikawa et al 2013 the large amount of ground ice was discovered in permafrost regions of which the total volume is approximately 9528 km3 liu and chen 2000 zhao et al 2010 the ground ice near the permafrost table is thawing under warming climate which influences water and heat exchange energy budget greenhouse gases release cheng and wu 2007 consequently it is of great significance to understand ground ice recharge and cycling near the permafrost table on the qtp natural tracers such as geochemical constituents and stable isotopes have been widely used to study runoff components and flow paths uhlenbrook et al 2002 gibson et al 2017 the method has been introduced into frozen soil regions to investigate the water sources of ground ice using end member mixing analysis method emma merlivat and jouzel 1979 gilbert et al 2016 lorrain and demeur 1985 stated that ground ice probably formed from the infiltration of glacier meltwater in the arctic permafrost regions in canadian by analyzing the ice isotopic variation characteristics the same conclusion was drawn at the tuktoyaktuk area western arctic coast canada mackay and dallimore 1992 the research in the mackenzie delta and yukon coastal plain regions showed that the 18o value of modern ice wedges can be significantly different from relict ice wedges indicating different paleoclimatic conditions michel 1990 yang et al 2016a revealed that near surface ground ice 0 3 m depth formed mainly from modern precipitation in the kunlun mountain pass on the qtp china meanwhile some progress has been made about the ground ice near permafrost table the water content near permafrost table was increasing based on the analysis of field data zhao et al 2000 hinkel et al 1996 cheng 1983 figured out the mechanism of repeated segregation for the formation of thick layered ground ice near permafrost table however there were still little field based research which explored the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in addition the freeze out fractionation effect for isotope compositions would occur during the unfrozen pore water refreezing into ground ice which would increase the uncertainty of the results for hydrograph separation model harris et al 2007 chloride ion as widely distributed in various water components is the stable structure of chlorine and not sensitive to oxidative reductive conditions and ph huang et al 2017 hence is considered as a suitable natural tracer in alpine regions clark et al 2001 in this study the geochemical conservative tracer chloride ions were used in hydrograph separation to explore the recharge sources and contribution ratios of ground ice near permafrost table in the continuous permafrost regions on the central qtp we attempted to combine stable isotopic and hydrochemical tracers to determine water sources of ground ice near permafrost table the results were expected to fill the fundamental knowledge gap on the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and provide theoretical foundation for understanding the hydrological processes in permafrost regions of the qtp 2 methods 2 1 site description all samples were collected along the qinghai tibet highway qth which winds through the continuous permafrost regions on the hinterland of qtp fig 1 the eight sampling sites include xidatan1 xdtb xidatan2 xdtms kunlunshan kls qingshuihe qsh wudaoliang1 wdlms wudaoliang2 wdlh kekexili kkxl and wenquan wq whose elevations range from 4488 to 4960 m above the sea level 91 900 94 091 e and 33 100 35 720 n with a relatively smooth terrain the slope of each site is less than 5 table 1 the active layer thickness ranges from 1 5 to 3 1 m for the eight sampling sites the mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 3 to 2 2 c and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 212 to 310 mm obtained from national meteorological information centre china meteorological administration and the mean annual evaporation is 1200 1470 mm characterized by a plateau sub frigid semiarid climate li et al 2012 the annual change of precipitation shows a seasonal distribution with about 83 of the total rainfall mainly occurring from may to september zhao et al 2008 the mainly vegetation ecosystems include alpine meadow and alpine steppe and the surface soil types are dominated by sandy loam and loam in these sites the warming climate and associated thawing permafrost are influencing regional hydrological and ecological condition for decades to come yang et al 2016b 2 2 field data during the period from late september to early october of 2015 the water samples were collected from eight sites in permafrost regions along qinghai tibet highway by means of the excavation of soil profile when the thaw depth of active layer approximate to the maximum before the winter freeze up the thawing water samples were collected within the active layer the samples of ground ice near permafrost table were collected at the ice rich layer in the upper part of transient layer and permafrost water samples were taken at 0 5 m depth below the permafrost table table 1 three random replicate water samples were taken at each sampling depth the samples of the ground ice and permafrost water were frozen during sampling the precipitation samples were collected at the study region between september 2015 and june 2016 a total of 131 water samples were collected 23 precipitation samples 60 active layer water samples 24 ground ice samples near permafrost table and 24 permafrost water samples all water samples were immediately sealed in 250 ml high density polyethylene bottles using disposable pe gloves to prevent contamination and stored in coolers until back to lab 2 3 laboratory analysis the stable isotope and geochemical measurements were undertaken at the state key laboratory of cryosphere sciences northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences all samples were thawed at room temperature once back to lab filtered through 0 22 µm filters then stored at 4 c to limit evaporation until analysis active layer samples which were used to determine anion concentrations were dried at 105 c for 24 h 50 g of oven dried sample then added double deionized water 50 ml agitated intermittently for 12 h and then the solution was collected with a syringe and filtered through 0 45 µm filters for anion analysis huang et al 2017 the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios were measured using laser absorption spectroscopy liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research del 100 the results are reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical precision for δ18o and δd amounts to 0 2 and 0 5 respectively all water samples were analyzed for major cations and anions by ion chromatography dionex 320 the evaluated ions include fluoride chloride bromide nitrate sulfate sodium ammonium potassium magnesium and calcium the total error in anions and cations is 1 and the analytical detection limit for ions was below 0 1 mg l 2 4 hydrograph separation the hydrograph separation using nature tracers is based on the steady state mass balance equations for water and conservative tracer sklash and farvolden 1979 1 q t q 1 q 2 q n 2 c t t i q t c 1 t i q 1 c 2 t i q 2 c n t i q n where q t is total runoff q 1 q 2 q n are the runoff components and c 1 t i c 2 t i c n t i are the respective runoff component concentrations of the tracer t i in the case of n runoff components need n 1 observed tracers t 1 t 2 t n 1 this technique is based on a number of assumptions 1 the significant differences exist in the tracer concentrations of the different components 2 the tracer concentration of each component is constant throughout the event or variations can be neglected 3 the additional component contributions are negligible 4 the tracers mix conservatively 5 the tracer concentrations of different components are not collinear hoeg et al 2000 the simplest way of using this technique is two component separation model which separates water sources into event water and pre event water and determines their contributions to total runoff the gaussian standard error propagation method as outlined by genereux 1998 was used to estimate the uncertainty in two component hydrograph separation model which could determine the systematic and analytical errors of observed tracer signatures 3 w f p c e c t c e c p 2 w c p 2 c t c p c e c p 2 w c e 2 1 c e c p w c t 2 1 2 where w is uncertainty c is tracer concentration f is the fraction of total runoff and the subscripts p e and t are pre event event and total runoff components respectively the tracer concentrations ct cp and ce were the average values for the three random replicate samples the uncertainty of the tracer concentrations w c p w c e and w c t was estimated using the standard deviations multiplied by t values from student s t distribution 95 confidence for the tracer concentrations genereux 1998 the uncertainty of contribution fraction w f p was determined using eq 3 3 results 3 1 dissolved ions the geochemistry of water samples was measured table 2 and also used to calculate the average normality of each ion for precipitation ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water fig 2 precipitation has a hco3 ca chemistry fig 2 with low salinity the total dissolved solids tds 33 8 mg l the electrical conductivity ec 67 7 us cm and small dissolved ions concentrations cl 0 8 mg l table 2 which is similar to the value in the fenghuoshan during 2008 by ren et al 2010 and the value in the kunlun mountains pass kmp yang et al 2016b indicating the impact of human activities to region meteoric water is negligible the active layer water has relatively high anion concentrations cl ranges from 51 3 to 917 5 mg l and so4 2 ranges from 68 8 to 1641 4 mg l table 2 there are large differences of anion concentrations cl so4 2 and no3 between the active layer water and precipitation table 2 indicating that the active layer water undergoes strong evaporation furthermore the ground ice near permafrost table has a hco3 na chemistry with a na cl molar ratio of 1 82 and high cl cl 127 7 982 9 mg l and salinity tds 0 5 4 3 g l compared with the ground ice the shallow permafrost water has similar geochemistry and slightly lower na cl ratio 1 5 but characterized by higher cl cl 140 9 1281 2 mg l and salinity tds 1 1 3 5 g l fig 2 providing a significant contribution of ions and salinity to the ground ice which is similar to the values for spring water in kekexili region hu 1997 the remarkable differences of cl in each water component provide a tool to determine the relative contributions of various water sources to ground ice near permafrost table 3 2 stable isotopes the isotopic composition of precipitation active layer water and ground ice is summarized in fig 3 and table 3 as shown in fig 3 the source of subsurface water including active layer moisture and ground ice mainly originated from atmospheric precipitation the isotope composition of precipitation ranges from 15 2 to 4 4 for δ18o mean δ18o 10 4 and from 104 9 to 30 0 for δd mean δd 67 7 is similar to the results in kmp by yang et al 2016b which is relatively far from the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 indicating intense evaporation and kinetic fractionation effect for aqueous vapour in qtp since the marine air mass is very difficult to reach the northern part of the qtp directly and much precipitation will re evaporate to atmosphere from the earth surface tian et al 2001 the active layer water data mean δ18o 11 2 mean δd 79 7 is located near the meteoric water line and is similar to the mean isotopic composition of precipitation which shows the active layer water is mainly supplied by local warm season rainfall because of rare snow cover in qtp and may be affected by strong local evaporation prior to recharge yang et al 2016b additionally the δ18o and δd of ground ice near permafrost table from 15 5 to 11 0 and from 104 7 to 73 6 approximating to the values of precipitation are close to the values of underlying permafrost water from 17 2 to 10 1 and from 127 1 to 75 3 and the active layer water it implied that the ground ice is recharged from the three water components directly or indirectly and the unfrozen water in permafrost could migrate upward to permafrost table cheng 1983 the δ18o value for permafrost is different with the δ18o value of precipitation the difference is 3 0 but is close to the δ18o value in guliya ice core drilled through the guliya ice cap in the west kunlun mountains on the central qtp in 1992 in the past 100a δ18o 14 3 the difference is 0 9 tian and yao 2016 which shows that the source of permafrost water at 50 cm depth below permafrost table does not directly originates from summer rainfall of an individual year but from long term modern atmospheric precipitation a diagram of δd vs chloride of ground ice for water samples in qtp illustrates that in general chloride concentrations increase as the δd values become depleted both for ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water fig 4 indicating that ground ice has not undergone strong evaporation harris et al 2007 furthermore as shown in table 3 the isotope values become more depleted successively from precipitation to active layer water ground ice near permafrost table and permafrost water on the qtp that means water is isotopically much more depleted but has relatively higher cl concentrations with increasing depth in the soil profile showing that the main factor affecting isotope depletion in unfrozen water is frozen fractionation effect rather than evaporation because the active layer and ground ice are supplied by unfrozen water migration and undergo annual and interannual freeze thaw cycles repeatedly cheng 1983 3 3 hydrograph separation the potential sources of ground ice near permafrost table may include precipitation active layer water and underlying permafrost water therefore both cl and δ18o were used as conservative tracers to confirm if the three mixing end members exist using the measured data of the eight sampling sites the three end members mixing diagram of chloride versus δ18o for precipitation active layer water and permafrost water was plotted fig 5 as shown in fig 5 the sample of ground ice near permafrost table is located without the triangle suggesting that three end members do not exist the precipitation would recharge the ground ice directly or indirectly the directly impact of precipitation to the ground ice is little and can be neglected when separating sources because the active layer thickness in qtp is relatively large ranging from 1 5 m to 3 1 m table 1 but precipitation is only about 400 mm as mentioned the main source of the active layer water is rainfall boike and hubberten 1998 so the indirect effect of precipitation on the ground ice has been reflected in the end member of active layer water therefore in this paper two component separation model eqs 1 and 2 was applied to estimate sources and mixing processes and to quantity the relative contribution proportions of the two end members to ground ice near permafrost table using chloride as conservative tracer of mixing table 4 for the continuous permafrost regions in qtp the active layer water and permafrost water contributed ranging from 58 9 to 87 0 and from 13 0 to 41 1 of the ground ice respectively evidently indicating that the ground ice is mainly originated from the active layer water and that the shallow permafrost water also plays an important role on the hydrological cycle of the ground ice the relative fractions of active layer and permafrost water contributions varied throughout the sampling sites because of the various underlying surface conditions there were two main vegetation ecosystems including alpine meadow and alpine steppe the contribution ratios of active layer water in the alpine steppe were greater 70 87 than that in the alpine meadow 59 69 the standard error associated with the hydrograph separation was calculated using eq 3 table 4 the estimated average percent error for all sites ranges between 0 2 and 8 8 this however is considered an actual underestimate due to the large spatial heterogeneity of underlying surface conditions for the permafrost regions in qtp 4 discussion 4 1 general characteristics of isotope and chemistry for ground ice the main dissolved ion concentrations showed relatively significant differences among sampling sites table 2 the underlying surface characteristics of the sampling sites are diverse covering with various vegetation e g alpine meadow alpine desert and alpine steppe microtopography and increasing elevation from north to south from 4488 to 4960 m however the changes of chloride and tds exhibit large fluctuation but no evident changing trends with distance the origin is golmud city along qth from north to south and the differences of ion concentrations between north sites and south sites are not notable fig 6 this reveals the complex interaction between water sources and flow pathways carey et al 2013 it also indicates that the altitude is not the main controlling factor for hydrochemistry in the permafrost regions of the qtp the isotope and chemistry compositions are characterized by significant change within the different soil depth tables 2 and 3 the isotope compositions of subsurface water apparently decrease as the depth increase compared with the shallow subsurface pore water the soil water and ground ice in deeper layers tended to have more negative values table 3 the more negative values from ground ice were somewhat resulted from unfrozen water which experienced frozen fractionation during freezing processes gonfiantini 1986 suzuoki and kjmura 1973 proposed that the heavy isotope takes priority into ice resulting in more negative of unfrozen water isotope in the process of freezing and that the δd of unfrozen water typically decreased 2 3 a further possible reason for the decreased isotopes might be contributed to the different sources for soil water at different depths the active layer water was mainly recharged by long term modern precipitation and the permafrost water was primarily sourced from old meteoric precipitation while old meteoric precipitation had lower isotopic values than that for modern precipitation tian and yao 2016 however the hydrochemical gradients of soil water and ground ice were positive in the continuous permafrost regions on qtp table 2 the active layer water had greater chloride content than precipitation implying that these waters were locally derived from recent precipitation but strong evaporation occurred table 3 yang et al 2016a revealed a strong evaporation signal about 1469 mm at the kunlun mountain pass on the qtp the great evaporation loss under arid condition on the qtp could be due to the little precipitation about 400 mm strong solar radiation yao et al 2013 and low relative humidity therefore the evaporation process would play an important role in the elevated chloride concentration of active layer water because liquid moisture will rise into atmosphere during evaporation while salinity is stranded in soil and has enrichment effect zhang et al 2003 koch et al 2014 also noted the importance of evaporation to summer active layer water for arctic permafrost regions moreover the repeated replenishment of precipitation to active layer might contribute to the lower ion concentrations in near surface ground due to the low ions and dilution of precipitation huang et al 2017 the chloride content of ground ice near permafrost table tended to significantly greater than that of the active layer pore water while the chloride content of permafrost water was the greatest within these soil layers table 3 the material sources of chloride in subsurface water are mainly from surface water infiltration water exchange with deeper ground water and the dissolution of evaporites he et al 2011 on the qtp the evaporites spreaded extensively due to strong evaporation at the ground surface hu 1997 the salt lake and thermal spring are widely distributed with relatively high salinity and chloride hu 1997 contributing a large amount of salinity to permafrost water through infiltration and water exchange for example in kekexili region on the central qtp hu 1997 found the cl in spring water could approximate to 1 4 g l and na and cl in salt lake were 68 9 g l and 130 7 g l respectively these might imply that the chloride in permafrost water may be primarily sourced from the dissolution of evaporites the infiltration recharge of high salinity lake water and water exchange between permafrost water and deeper groundwater in continuous permafrost regions on the qtp newman et al 2015 also stated that there were strong geochemical depth gradients within active layer in the arctic permafrost region throckmorton et al 2016 demonstrated significant isotope variation with active layer depth at the same site the presence of well developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients within the soil profile indicated that the vertical mixing may be insignificant in permafrost region on the qtp otherwise the depth gradients would be impossibly existed throckmorton et al 2016 furthermore the vertical distribution of soluble ion concentrations within soil profile may be used as an indicator of solute migration and sedimentation conditions lamhonwah et al 2017 and more further studies are required to examine the vertical distributions of hydrochemistry and the interaction with environmental factors by analyzing core samples which are collected within the soil profile with high resolution 5 10 cm interval in the permafrost regions of the qtp 4 2 the sources of ground ice near permafrost table there are three potential water sources to ground ice near permafrost table including precipitation cold season snow and warm season rainfall the active layer water and underlying permafrost water unfrozen water the three end members mixing diagram of chloride versus δ18o for the ground ice fig 5 implies that the importance of precipitation as a source of the ground ice is relatively little snow and snowmelt have significant effect on arctic and other tundra runoff in the winter and spring streletskiy et al 2015 tetzlaff et al 2015 however the contribution of snow and snowmelt to the active layer is little throckmorton et al 2016 since the infiltration of snowmelt is limited by ice filled pores and rapidly runs into stream woo et al 2008 in the permafrost regions on the qtp the precipitation amount is only about 400 mm while the evaporation could amount to 1469 mm yang et al 2016a leading to relatively dry soil which has large soil water storage capacity gao et al 2014 additionally the active layer thickness on the qtp ranges from 1 5 m to 3 1 m table 1 and the clayey layer approximately 50 80 cm was found above permafrost table within the soil profile in most of the sampling sites which has relatively large water holding capacity and dramatically limits the infiltration of rain into the ground ice zhu 1983 all these factors might result in the weak supply from rain to the ground ice on the qtp therefore the precipitation could be neglected during separating sources in addition as mentioned above the indirect effect of precipitation on the ground ice has been reflected in active layer water because the isotope characteristics show that active layer water is mainly sourced from rainfall boike and hubberten 1998 as shown in table 4 the active layer water accounted for 58 9 87 0 of the source of the ground ice near permafrost table while permafrost water accounted for 13 0 41 1 indicating that the active layer water is the dominant source of the ground ice the chloride values of ground ice are similar to that of active layer water rather than that of permafrost water table 3 the driving force of water migration for the two end members is different zhao et al 2000 the driving forces of soil moisture migration include gravity and temperature gradient and water transports downward to deep layer under gravity while moves from a warmer to a cooler location under temperature gradient zhu 1983 perfect and williams 1980 zhao et al 2000 continuously observed the ground temperature profile in the wudaoliang site on the qtp and found that ground temperature rised as the soil depth increased during the freezing period from late september to mid april while apparently falled down as the soil depth increased during the thawing period from late april to mid september perfect and williams 1980 pointed out that quantity of transferred water is well positively correlated with temperature gradient and temperature during the thawing season the temperature gradient between ground surface and permafrost table is large the maximum temperature difference is about 8 c the unfrozen water content is relatively high xie et al 2012 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivities in active layer is also high due to sandy soil sand particle content is more than 71 within 3 m depth soil layer which has high porosity about 52 and low water holding capacity in the permafrost regions on qtp liu et al 2013 gao et al 2014 the active layer pore water transfers downward to supply ground ice near permafrost table by gravity and temperature gradient with a large amount of moisture migration and high transferring rate zhao et al 2000 however cheng 1983 found that there is only upward migration of unfrozen pore water in permafrost to recharge ground ice near permafrost table by a positive ground temperature gradient during the freezing season with a little amount of moisture migration and very low transferring rate due to a relatively small temperature gradient and low unfrozen pore water content zhao et al 2000 xie et al 2012 since the downward transportation of unfrozen water in a frozen active layer is greatly limited by ice filled pores woo et al 2008 in addition we mainly explored the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and determined its dominant contributor using one year sampling data in the present study further research should focus on the ground ice source dynamics through long term continuous investigation on the qtp in the context of climate warming this work only demonstrated the vertical moisture migration while the lateral groundwater flow could also impact water movement within soil profile the lateral groundwater flow significantly impacts water and solute movement in the active layer mainly during the thawing period jessen et al 2014 schuh et al 2017 however the clear interaction between lateral groundwater flow and ground ice near permafrost table in the permafrost affected regions on the qtp still remains largely unknown yang et al 2017 more detailed observations are required to examine the influence of lateral groundwater flow to ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in the context of permafrost degradation permafrost degradation has occurred during the past 50 years due to climate change and human activities cheng and wu 2007 wu et al 2013 wang 1993 jin et al 2006 the mean annual air temperature is noticeably rising with a rate of 0 2 0 4 c 10a during recent decades liu and chen 2000 qin et al 2016 and the mean annual ground surface temperature also shows significantly increase by the rate of 0 6 c 10a from 1980 to 2007 on the central qtp wu et al 2013 the surface thawing index sti has increased at a rate of 125 0 c d decade 1 and the surface freezing index sfi has decreased at a rate of 111 2 c d decade 1 on the central qtp wu et al 2013 in which the sti and sfi reflect the seasonal thaw depth and freeze depth in cold regions respectively wu et al 2011 furthermore cheng and wu 2007 revealed that the active layer thickness has increased by 15 50 cm between 1996 and 2001 xie et al 2012 demonstrated that the liquid water content of active layer migrated downward from the ground surface to the deep soil layer more unfrozen water migration downward because of rising temperature extending thawing period thickening active layer would increase the potential contribution of active layer water to ground ice near permafrost table in the coming years therefore long term and continuous observations are required to investigate the responses of ground ice sources to permafrost degradation and climate change 4 3 influence of alpine ecosystems to ground ice alpine ecosystems in permafrost regions on qtp could be classified into two categories including alpine meadow and alpine steppe table 1 based on the hydrograph separation model the recharge portion of active layer water to the ground ice in the alpine meadow 59 69 was obviously less than that in alpine steppe 70 87 table 4 the influence of different alpine ecosystems to ground ice was different gao et al 2014 the vegetation played a crucial role on the regional water balance and soil moisture redistribution on the frozen ground regions li et al 2013 it is turned out that the ground surface vegetation could affect soil water redistribution pattern and migration processes for various ecosystems under a warming climate table 5 wang et al 2011 zeng et al 2013 luo et al 2014 as shown in table 5 for the top 50 cm soil layer the soil moisture content in the alpine meadow was higher than that in alpine steppe in the sampling sites which was consistent with the results in the wudaoliang region by gao et al 2014 the aboveground and underground biomass and root density for various vegetation showed remarkable difference which resulted from the difference of water holding capacity infiltration hydraulic conductivity porosity and soil texture between the two alpine ecosystems luo et al 2014 gao et al 2014 found that the saturated hydraulic conductivity in alpine steppe was about 5 1 mm min which was 2 times greater than that in alpine meadow about 2 5 mm min but the water holding capacity in alpine steppe porosity 51 was less than that in alpine meadow porosity 57 in the top 40 cm soil in the permafrost regions in addition the shallow soil layer in the permafrost regions of the qtp was mostly dominated by sandy soil sand particle content was more than 92 in the root layer liu et al 2013 which may also increase infiltration and reduce surface runoff during the rainy season zhou et al 2000 hence the alpine steppe soil could supplies more liquid water to deep layer to recharge ground ice near permafrost table in the permafrost regions due to sparse vegetation roots large infiltration high hydrologic conductivity low transpiration and coarse particle size of soil however the high initial soil moisture content and dense root system of alpine meadow restricted the infiltration of liquid water resulting in more water preserving in shallow soil layer and lost by evapotranspiration and plants growing during growth season li et al 2008 which would lead to less contribution ratio of active layer water to the ground ice 5 conclusion this work used stable tracer method and hydrograph separation model to infer the sources of ground ice near permafrost table and quantify the contribution ratios in continuous permafrost regions on the qtp according to the above analysis a conceptual diagram of water sources and cycling of ground ice near permafrost table was established in permafrost regions on the qtp fig 7 the results of hydrograph separation model indicate negligible contribution from precipitation suggesting that the ground ice near permafrost table is mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water in the thawing season only active layer pore water transfers downward to supply the ground ice by gravity and temperature gradient the active layer water accounts for 58 9 87 0 of the ground ice as the predominant source the influence of ground surface vegetation on the source of ground ice is evident the recharge portion of active layer water to the ground ice in the alpine meadow 59 69 was obviously less than that in alpine steppe 70 87 implying that vegetation plays animportant role on the regional water balance and soil moisture redistribution on the permafrost regions under a warming climate in the freezing season there was only upward migration of unfrozen water in permafrost to recharge the ground ice by temperature gradient permafrost water accounted for 13 0 41 1 and also was an important source of the ground ice in addition we also investigated the spatial characteristics of hydrogeochemistry for soil water and ground ice the main dissolved ions concentration exhibits a large fluctuation but no significant changing trends with distance along the qth from north to south the isotope and chemistry compositions show notable variations with depth within the soil profile the isotope values depleted as the soil depth increased the more negative values of deep soil water and ground ice are mainly originated from freeze out fractionation during interannual freeze thaw processes however the hydrochemical compositions present apparent positive gradients with depth the chloride content of the active layer water is relatively high due to the influence of strong evaporation on the local scale the higher chloride concentration in permafrost water may be primarily originated from the dissolution of evaporites the infiltration recharge of high salinity in lake water and water exchange between permafrost water and deeper groundwater on the qtp the natural stable tracer was a useful tool to determine sources of ground ice and acted as an indicator of evaporation and frozen fractionation in permafrost regions in particular we noted that both evaporation and frozen fractionation could result in isotopic fractionation but chloride is more conservative and is a suitable natural tracer suited to alpine regions the comparison of hydrograph separation model results between stable isotopes and chloride tracer was necessary to estimate the impact of freeze out fractionation in conclusion the alpine ecosystems are notably affecting ground ice sources near permafrost table in permafrost regions under a warming climate these results provide additional insights into the sources and cycling of the ground ice near permafrost table on the permafrost regions and thus should be useful for addressing fundamental knowledge gap and establishing better regional hydrologic models further studies are required to investigate the response of ground ice dynamics to permafrost degradation and their interaction with environmental factors acknowledgements we thank all staff from the cryosphere research station on the qinghai tibetan plateau for their assistance in
