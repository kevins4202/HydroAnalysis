23945,interaction processes of attenuating surface waves and underlying currents are explicitly simulated with a nonhydrostatic free surface numerical model the model designed with special attention to the numerical conservation properties of energy and momentum is capable of accurately capturing the effect of the virtual wave stress a viscous momentum transfer from waves to current simple experiments with the present model show that the langmuir circulations in the wave resolving simulations tend to be stronger than the ones in the craik leibovich equation with corresponding stokes drift profiles the underestimation in the craik leibovich equation can be corrected by addressing momentum transfer from attenuating waves to currents as the virtual wave stress at the surface keywords nonhydrostatic free surface model surface waves langmuir circulations virtual wave stress 1 introduction wind waves and swells play crucial roles in the upper ocean dynamics and the air sea interaction by moderating momentum heat and material exchanges between air and water even without breaking waves interact with upper ocean current to produce langmuir circulations lcs which are considered to dominate the surface mixing in regions with high waves such as the southern ocean belcher et al 2012 the central dynamics of lcs is considered to be described by the craik leibovich cl equation craik and leibovich 1976 leibovich 1980 holm 1996 which is a prognostic equation of the wave averaged non oscillatory current in the cl equation the residual effect of wave motion is parameterized using external forces called the vortex force and the bernoulli head gradient the former represents the advection and tilting of vorticity by the stokes drift velocity when the directions of the stokes drift and the wind driven sheared current are aligned lcs induce vertical vorticity by tilting up the wind driven crosswind vorticity which is then tilted downwind by the vertically sheared stokes drift this process forms a positive feedback and lcs develop efficiently this instability is called the cl2 mechanism and is considered to be a major driving mechanism of the lcs craik 1977 leibovich 1977 1983 in order to obtain a quantitative picture of wave driven turbulence many numerical studies have been conducted using the cl equation e g skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 li et al 2005 these simulations are called the wave averaged simulations or was the cl equation is an approximate form of the navier stokes equation under various asymptotic assumptions whereby neglecting several processes such as unsteadiness of wave amplitude etc therefore it is important to verify the performance of the was by comparing the result with field observations laboratory experiments or explicit numerical simulations of wave motions called wave resolving simulations or wrs wrs and was can be directly compared and are thus suitable for the verification of the wave averaged formulations among the recent wrs studies tsai et al 2017 and wang and özgökmen 2018 suggest the importance of the so called eulerian mean drift which was first addressed by longuet higgins 1953 this drift occurs because the momentum carried by the waves proportional to the amplitude squared and directed to the propagation direction is transferred to the underlying current when they attenuate due to viscosity phillips 1966 this momentum transfer occurs in the thin viscous boundary layer near the surface and the wave averaged current feels the momentum input as if there is additional tangential stress at the surface called the virtual wave stress vws in the limit of small amplitude and weak viscosity the vws is to leading order τ vws ρ ν z u st surface where ρ ν and u st z are the water density the kinematic viscosity and the stokes drift profile longuet higgins 1953 xu and bowen 1994 aiki and greatbatch 2012 weber 2018 in the cl framework the vws will intensify the lcs by producing stronger crosswind vorticity near the surface and enhancing the cl2 mechanism based on linear stability analysis tsai et al 2017 suggested that the coherent vortices observed in laboratory experiments and wrs without imposed surface stress can be interpreted as lcs arising from the interaction of the eulerian mean drift and the wave motion wang and özgökmen 2018 compared the lcs simulated in wrs and was based on the cl equation and showed that the wrs obtains stronger lc than the was they attributed the difference to the eulerian mean drift but they did not quantify its effect on the difference while these results suggest that the viscous wave attenuation leads to stronger lcs in wrs detailed quantitative support has not yet been provided in order to properly interpret the simulation results the impact of the viscous wave attenuation on the lcs must be clarified as far as we are aware no free surface model is carefully examined for its accuracy in simulating the viscous momentum transfer from waves to currents in this study we investigate the effect of the viscous wave attenuation on the lcs our particular interest is if and if so how the effect can be reproduced in the wave averaged framework for this purpose we first develop a nonhydrostatic free surface numerical model that can be reliably used in wrs studies of wave current interaction the model uses the surface following coordinate system so that it can simulate large amplitude surface waves and the underlying current at the same time as long as there is no overturning of the surface wave breaking in order to avoid numerical sources of momentum that could cause a fake wave current interaction we spatially discretize the momentum equation in a full flux form as in xuan and shen 2019 who independently developed a free surface numerical model with a similar discretization scheme we also paid special attention to reduce the numerical energy growth and decay to a negligible level even with a relatively long integration time step detailed tests are carried out to examine the energy conservation properties using the newly developed model low reynolds number direct numerical simulations dns of lcs with a simple configuration are conducted the result shows that the effect of the viscous wave attenuation is crucially important to determine the intensity of lcs the was reproduces the lcs of wrs in a quantitatively consistent manner only when the vws is added to the top tangential stress the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 the formulation of the newly developed model is described the model s performance in inviscid and viscid surface wave simulations is examined in section 3 then the impact of wave attenuation on wrs and was of lcs is examined in section 4 implications for wrs and was studies of lcs are discussed in section 5 2 model description the numerical formulation presented here is similar to the sigma coordinate free surface models of tsai and hung 2007 yang and shen 2011 and xuan and shen 2019 to highlight the improvements from these models we keep our model description to necessary formulations only since the three dimensional non hydrostatic simulations in a curvilinear coordinate system are computationally costly it is preferable if a numerical error in momentum and energy can be reduced to a negligible level even with relatively low spatial temporal resolutions to achieve this we spatially discretize the momentum equation in full flux form whereby momentum is well conserved similar discretization with full flux form was independently adopted by xuan and shen 2019 in order to improve the energy conservation property we propose a new temporal integration procedure of the pressure gradient terms using the 4th order adams bashforth scheme which has not been used in the previous numerical ocean models in this manuscript we shall consider a horizontally rectangular domain with a flat bottom and horizontally equally spaced grid points for simplicity however these techniques can also be applied in free surface models with more complex geometries to improve their numerical conservation properties 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions here x y and z denote the cartesian coordinates and z is taken vertically upward variables u v and w are the x y and z components of velocity respectively consider a horizontally rectangular domain bounded by a rigid bottom at z h h is constant and a free surface at z η x y t which is assumed to be a single valued function no overturn horizontal boundaries are doubly periodic let us consider the incompressible navier stokes equation with a uniform density ρ the horizontal and vertical momentum equations and the continuity equation are as follows 1a u t u u x v u y w u z x g η p s p t x x x t y x y t z x z 1b v t u v x v v y w v z y g η p s p t x y x t y y y t z y z 1c w t u w x v w y w w z p z t x z x t y z y t z z z 2 u x v y w z 0 here g is the gravitational acceleration for convenience we have decomposed the raw pressure ϕ into three parts as follows 3 ϕ ρ p s ρ g η z ρ p the three rhs terms represent the surface pressure sum of the atmospheric pressure and surface tension effect the hydrostatic pressure due to surface displacement and the nonhydrostatic pressure as introduced later p s x y t is the value of ϕ ρ at the water surface and is provided as a dynamical boundary condition t is viscous stress tensor whose components are defined as 4 t i j ν u j x i u i x j where i and j represent x y and z u x u y u z u v w and x x x y x z x y z the kinematic viscosity ν is assumed isotropic the kinematic boundary conditions at the top and bottom are w η t u η x v η y at z η w 0 at z h these two conditions are combined with the continuity equation 2 to provide the total volume conservation equation 5 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z in addition to the kinematic boundary conditions dynamic boundary conditions must be given at the bottom surface two components of the tangential stress τ b x t x z and τ b y t y z are specified the dynamical boundary condition at the free surface should be given so that the three components of the surface stress s n can be determined here s ϕ ρ i t i is the unit tensor is the total stress tensor and n is the unit vector outward normal to the free surface we choose τ s x τ s y and p s in the following equations are to be specified at the surface 6a τ s x η x t x x η y t y x t z x 6b τ s y η x t x y η y t y y t z y 6c p s n s n ϕ ρ τ 1 η x 2 η y 2 here η x and η y represent η x and η y respectively quantities τ s x and τ s y denote the surface flux of horizontal momentum via viscous stress per unit horizontal area eq 6c specifies the normal component of the surface stress which is received via the pressure ϕ and the normal viscous stress τ t z z 2 η x t x z 2 η y t y z η x 2 t x x 2 η x η y t x y η y 2 t y y to simplify the treatment of pressure we approximate eq 6c with p s ϕ ρ from which the surface boundary condition p 0 can be derived this approximation does not affect the velocity field because the total normal force imposed onto the fluid is unchanged the pressure field is altered by the approximation but we can estimate that its relative error from the actual pressure is smaller than 10 3 for waves with wavelengths longer than 0 1 m 2 2 coordinate transformation the following vertical coordinate transform maps the deformable physical domain h z η x y t onto a fixed computational domain h z 0 7 x x y y z z x y z t z 1 z h η t t this is essentially equivalent to the so called sigma coordinate tsai and hung 2007 yang and shen 2011 xuan and shen 2019 we introduce the layer thickness h and the z velocity ω as follows h z z 1 η h ω h 1 w z t z x u z y v where subscripts with the independent variables x y z t represent partial derivatives for convenience we introduce the thickness weighted variables u h u v h v w h w p h p and ω h ω one can transform the volume conservation equation 5 as 8 η t x h 0 u d z y h 0 v d z this equation is used to diagnose z t 1 z h η t in the definition of ω using the chain rules the continuity equation 2 can be rewritten in the following diagnostic and prognostic forms 9 u x v y z w h z x h u z y h v 0 10 h t u x v y ω z 0 using eq 10 the momentum equations 1 are transformed to the following thickness weighted form 11a u t x u u h 1 2 g h h 2 p h t x x y v u h h t y x z ω u h z x h p z x t x x z y t y x t x z 0 11b v t x u v h h t x y y v v h 1 2 g h h 2 p h t y y z ω v h z y h p z x t x y z y t y y t y z 0 11c w t x u w h h t x z y v w h h t y z z ω w h p h z x t x z z y t y z t z z 0 the thickness weighted equations have the advantage that the nonlinear and stress terms including pressure gradient terms can be written in flux form mellor 2003 aiki and greatbatch 2012 xuan and shen 2019 the full flux forms of the momentum equations 11a 11c are essentially equivalent to the ones in xuan and shen 2019 2 3 spatial discretization next we shall spatially discretize the model equations in the horizontal direction the pseudo spectral method based on the fourier series is used all variables are thus uniformly distributed and collocated in horizontal hereafter horizontal derivatives denote evaluation using fft tests revealed that zero filling the spectral coefficients above two thirds of the nyquist wavenumber prevents nonlinear instability in most cases in the vertical direction the second order finite difference method based on the staggered grid is used let k be the vertical index increasing upwards we denote the cell centers with indices 1 2 k and the cell interfaces with indices 1 2 3 2 k 1 2 the bottom and the top locations are represented with z 1 2 and z k 1 2 the location of variables is listed in table 1 let us denote the vertical cell thicknesses measured in z system with δ z 1 δ z k since the variables are horizontally collocated we omit the horizontal indices of the discretized variables when variables need to be evaluated at vertical levels where they are originally not defined they are interpolated to the evaluation points the velocity components u and v at the water surface k 1 2 must be given in the continuity equation 9 from which the pressure poisson equation is constructed we set u v k 1 2 u v k instead of extrapolating or using the stress boundary conditions according to various tests this treatment simplifies the formulation without significantly affecting the results appendix c the tangential stress boundary condition is imposed through the viscous stress term the stress tensor components t x z and t y z at the water surface are specified with eq 6 a b for convenience the vertical finite difference operator δ is introduced as follows δ φ k 1 2 1 δ z k 1 2 φ k 1 φ k δ φ k 1 δ z k φ k 1 2 φ k 1 2 where φ represents any variable the vertical derivatives of variables multiplied by coordinate slope often appear in the equations they can be transformed as follows z z x φ k h 1 η x δ h z φ k z z x φ k 1 2 h 1 η x δ h z φ k 1 2 and likewise for y instead of x also for convenience let us introduce the operator δ ˆ as δ ˆ φ k δ h z φ k using these notations the discretized version of eqs 8 9 and 11 are 12a u k t g x k p k x η x h h δ ˆ p k 12b v k t g y k p k y η y h h δ ˆ p k 12c w k 1 2 t g z k 1 2 1 h δ p k 1 2 13 η t k 1 k u k x v k y δ z k 14 u k x v k y 1 h δ w k η x h h δ ˆ u k η y h h δ ˆ v k 0 where g x g y and g z represent the sum of the terms other than the nonhydrostatic pressure term on the rhs of eqs 11a 11b and 11c respectively these terms can be explicitly evaluated from an instantaneous flow field thanks to the flux form discretization of eqs 12 and 13 the momentum and total mass are well conserved as will be shown later 2 4 time integration and pressure solving scheme let us denote the variable φ at timestep n as φ n and the vector u v w as u and the variables u n v n w n η n are known the pressure p needs to be determined from incompressibility conventionally the incompressibility is achieved by using the so called projection method e g chorin 1968 durran 2010 where pressure is determined so that the resulting velocity field would become divergence free however in general this pressure is neither p n nor p n 1 2 2 in the surface following curvilinear coordinate the spatial derivative operator for convenience contains time dependent coefficients the instantaneous pressure p n is determined so that n p n g n will become nondivergent where g g x g y g z the scalar field obtained from the projection method as the pressure φ is determined so that δ t n 1 φ u n t n t n 1 g d t will become nondivergent because the evaluation time is different φ differs from p n by o δ t in the present system pressure serves not only to retain incompressibility but also to drive potential motion related to waves in order to achieve time integration with high conservation property and reasonable computational costs we adopt the 4th order adams bashforth ab4 scheme to integrate eqs 12 and 13 see appendix a for the comparison of several different integration schemes ab4 scheme approximates the time integral of the pressure gradient term using a linear combination of p n p n 1 p n 2 and p n 3 since the pressure derived from the projection method does not belong to any particular moment it is not suitable for the ab4 integration we take the following strategy requiring the nondivergence of velocity tendency u t n the instantaneous pressure p n is calculated and the momentum equation is integrated using ab4 scheme the incompressibility of u n 1 is guaranteed by adding the gradient of correction pressure p to the velocity field after ab4 integration where p is obtained from the incompressibility condition of u n 1 the standard projection method in order to derive the pressure poisson equation for p n take t derivative of eq 14 to yield an equation for nondivergence of velocity tendency 15 u t k x v t k y 1 h δ w t k μ x δ ˆ u t k μ y δ ˆ v t k μ t h δ w k μ t x δ ˆ u k μ t y δ ˆ v k 0 where we have introduced μ log η h for convenience note that μ t x y η t x y h h substituting eq 12 into 15 we obtain the poisson equation for instantaneous pressure 16 2 p k x 2 2 p k y 2 δ δ p k g x k x g y

ˆ u δ ˆ p p k where all the variables are evaluated at timestep n the notation δ ˆ u φ means δ ˆ φ terms that originate from δ ˆ u or δ ˆ v and the variables upper boundary condition follow φ k 1 2 φ k similarly the δ ˆ p φ terms originate from δ ˆ p so φ k 1 2 0 therefore δ ˆ u φ k 1 δ z k h φ k h z k 1 2 φ k 1 2 and δ ˆ p φ k 1 δ z k h z k 1 2 φ k 1 2 the pressure poisson equation 16 can be solved using the fixed point iteration scheme as in tsai and hung 2007 and yang and shen 2011 let us write the lhs terms as l p the rhs terms independent of p as q and the rhs terms dependent on p as ϵ p denoting the index of iteration with superscript m we iteratively solve 17 l p m q ϵ p m 1 using horizontal fourier transform until max p m p m 1 rms p m becomes sufficiently small when p m converges it satisfies eq 16 when surface steepness is smaller than 0 3 it typically takes less than 10 iterations to reach convergence we also tried to utilize the modified newton method as in tsai and hung 2007 and yang and shen 2011 but it did not improve performance in our formulation for example in the inviscid stokes wave test described in section 3 with a k 0 1 and δ t 2 π 100 the average number of iteration for solving eq 16 was increased from 6 to 20 by introducing mixed scheme of fixed point iteration and modified newton methods once p n is obtained the rhs terms of eqs 12 and 13 can all be evaluated at timestep n also for n 1 etc so they can be integrated using the ab4 to obtain η n 1 and the intermediate velocity u η n 1 η n 1 24 δ t 55 η t n 59 η t n 1 37 η t n 2 9 η t n 3 u u n 1 24 δ t 55 u t n 59 u t n 1 37 u t n 2 9 u t n 3 next the standard projection procedure is taken to achieve incompressibility i e the gradient of correction pressure p is added to u 18a u k n 1 u k δ t p k x μ x δ ˆ p k 18b v k n 1 v k δ t p k y μ y δ ˆ p k 18c w k 1 2 n 1 w k 1 2 δ t δ p k 1 2 top boundary condition is given by the dirichlet condition p k 1 2 0 and the bottom condition is to satisfy w 1 2 n 1 0 the pressure poisson equation for p can be obtained by substituting eq 18 into eq 14 19 2 p k x 2 2 p k y 2 δ δ p k 1 δ t u k x v k y 1 h δ w k μ x δ ˆ u u k μ y δ ˆ u v k 1 1 h

residual error is evaluated as max p m p m 1 rms p n since the velocity tendency is already nondivergent only small corrections are needed in the projection method and it requires less iterations than solving eq 16 to reach convergence 3 performance tests in this section inviscid and viscid surface waves are simulated to show the model performance first we nondimensionalize the governing equations 1 2 and 4 dimensional variables are temporally denoted with subscript d let us take a linear deep water wave of wavenumber k d and angular frequency σ d g d k d 1 2 for reference and consider cases with constant viscosity we nondimensionalize the variables as x y z k d x d y d z d t σ d t d u v w σ d k d 1 u d v d w d η h k d η d h d and p σ d k d 2 p d the resulting nondimensional equations have the same form as eqs 1 2 and 4 with ρ 1 g 1 and ν ν d σ d k d 2 re 1 here re σ d k d 2 ν d is reynolds number based on wave phase speed and wavenumber 3 3 as noted by phillips 1961 re does not have a clear dynamical interpretation and does not serve as an index of dynamic instability in this section we consider x z two dimensional problems whose equations are obtained by setting v 0 and y 0 let us take a domain bounded by periodic boundaries at x 0 2 π the free surface at z η η 0 at rest and a flat bottom at z h at the free surface zero surface pressure p s 0 is assumed in viscous problems zero viscous stresses are assumed at the top and bottom boundaries τ s x τ s y 0 τ b x τ b y 0 3 1 dispersion relation and energy conservation of inviscid waves in this subsection the inviscid cases ν 0 are considered to study the model performance in conservative processes first the depth dependence of dispersion relation of linear surface waves is examined the numbers of grid points are 64 in the horizontal and vertical and the vertical cell thicknesses in terms of z are uniformly distributed as an initial condition we give the orbital motion of surface waves with wavenumber k 1 as follows 20a η x 0 a cos x 20b u x z 0 a σ lin cosh z h cosh h cos x 20c w x z 0 a σ lin sinh z h cosh h sin x here σ lin tanh h 1 2 is the angular frequency of linear surface waves the experiments were conducted with depth h varying from 0 0156 π to 4 π for longer than 200 π σ lin the amplitude a is taken as min 0 001 0 001 h to avoid nonlinear effects typically time step δ t of 0 02 π σ lin is used while smaller δ t is required in cases with small h for stable computation the computations are conducted for more than 100 wave periods the zero up cross method is applied to the time series of η at x 0 to obtain a series of individual wave periods t 1 t 2 then the individual periods of the first 100 waves are averaged to obtain the wave period t in fig 1 the diagnosed angular frequency σ 2 π t is plotted against the nondimensional depth k h equal to h all of the individual wave periods fell within the range 1 0 001 t for all the cases the result shows that the model can accurately simulate the linear dispersion relation from shallow to deep water regimes next we take the wave amplitude as the control parameter and examine the model s capability to simulate wave nonlinearity we shall consider a deep water case h 4 π let us denote the numbers of grid points in x z directions as n x 2 n z i e one wavelength is resolved with n x and n z points in horizontal and vertical respectively experiments are conducted with various combinations of n x n z vertical cell thicknesses are uniform in terms of z the fifth order stokes wave solution fenton 1985 is used to provide the initial condition the wave slope a k is varied from 0 01 to 0 35 and the simulations are run for longer than 100 periods with δ t 2 π 100 and 2 π 200 the simulated wave period t is obtained by using the zero up cross analysis and by averaging the first 100 individual wave periods in fig 1 the diagnosed angular frequency σ 2 π t is plotted against wave steepness a k equal to a when a k 0 2 computations with δ t 2 π 100 became unstable stable with δ t 2 π 200 the simulation results with n x n z 64 64 closely follow the nonlinear dispersion relation σ 1 a k 2 2 o a k 3 stokes 1847 however reducing the vertical resolution to n z 16 resulted in a phase deceleration error of 0 1 regardless of wave steepness this suggests that adequate vertical resolution is required to accurately simulate phenomena in which the accurate dispersion relation plays a central role on the other hand the results were less sensitive to horizontal resolution thanks to the pseudo spectral discretization in horizontal to examine the model s energy conservation property the temporal evolution of the total energy e 1 2 u 2 w 2 d z d x 1 2 η 2 d x which is ideally conserved is examined the energy growth rate β is evaluated by fitting e t e 0 e β t to the time series of total energy over the simulation period the growth rate is plotted in fig 2 for cases with a k 0 01 and 0 1 with various combinations of n x n z the growth rate of 1 0 6 indicates that the energy decays by 0 06 over 200 π 100 linear periods which is negligible in most practical cases from fig 2 we can find that the energy conservation property of this model is mainly dominated by temporal and vertical discretization errors the former causes slight energy decay see also appendix a while the latter causes energy growth the energy growth due to vertical discretization is magnified when the wave slope is large and this magnification is observed with a k at least up to 0 3 not shown for a k 0 1 and δ t 2 π 100 the growth effect dominates over the decaying effect when n z 32 on the other hand the horizontal resolution as low as n x 8 causes undetectable difference from the cases with n x 64 thanks to the full flux formulation of momentum and mass conservation equations the errors in the volume integral of these quantities are practically negligible for the case with lowest resolution n x n z 8 δ t 2 π 100 with a k 0 1 the relative error in the total horizontal momentum was smaller than 2 1 0 8 during the simulation period for a standard resolution of n x n z 64 δ t 2 π 100 the error was reduced to 3 1 0 14 in both cases the error in total mass was smaller than 10 15 to demonstrate the model s energy conservation property in viscous cases compared to the preceding numerical models we conduct the nondimensionalized version of the performance test designed by tsai and hung 2007 their figure 3 consider a two dimensional domain with h 1 6 π we use the nondimensionalized equation introduced above and take a finite reynolds number re 6286 the flow is initialized with the fifth order stokes wave fenton 1985 with wavenumber k 1 and slope a k 0 3 and the integration time step is δ t t 2000 where t is one wave period of the stokes wave the domain is discretized with three combinations of grid points 24 48 32 64 and 128 128 where the horizontal a and vertical b grid points are denoted with a b the grid spacings are changed in vertical and cell interfaces are specified with z n 1 2 h tanh 1 8417 n k tanh 1 8417 1 n 0 k fig 3 shows the time series of normalized energy error in each

smaller than ones shown in figure 3 of tsai and hung 2007 which are of o 1 0 4 1 0 3 3 2 eulerian mean drift next deep water waves with small viscosity are simulated to examine the model s capability to correctly simulate the eulerian mean drift the nondimensional equations are simulated with finite re the depth h 4 π is used and 64 and 128 grid points are taken in horizontal and vertical respectively the grid spacings are changed in vertical so that more grid points are clustered near the upper boundary for details of the grid point distribution see appendix b the top grid thickness δ

eulerian current is consistent with the perturbation theory of longuet higgins 1953 sensitivity test with different δ z top showed that the top layer as thick as 2 δ could properly represent the vws effect see appendix b 4 effects of viscous wave attenuation on langmuir circulations in order to investigate the effect of viscous wave attenuation the wrs and was of langmuir circulations are compared in a simple configuration in the wrs the nondimensional equations are solved in a three dimensional domain 0 x 2 π 0 y 2 π 2 π z η discretized with 64 64 128 grid points in each direction

retain incompressibility because an addition of any gradient term under the rigid lid approximation does not alter the result the bernoulli head term is not explicitly specified the initial condition is the jet like flow as in the wrs 24 u x y z 0 u 2 1 cos y v x y z 0 w x y z 0 0 in order to highlight the role of viscous wave attenuation three was experiments named cl dvws cl d and cl c are designed and their settings are listed in table 2 in the cl dvws and cl d cases where d means decaying the stokes drift u st is prescribed using the deep water wave solution where the wave s amplitude is assumed to decay following the linear theory a t a e 2 t re in the cl c case where c means constant the stokes drift is kept constant the comparison between the cl d and cl c cases highlights the effect of the wave attenuation through the vortex force to investigate the effect through the momentum transfer an additional vws is imposed at the upper boundary condition of the cl dvws case from the cl2 instability theory it is expected that this imposed vws will lead to stronger lcs compared to cl d case in all the cases τ s y and τ b x y are set to zero we first consider a situation with surface stress τ 0 1 1 0 6 this setting is similar to the one considered by wang and özgökmen 2018 although they considered the stress field that varies in the y direction the wrs result can be compared with the cl result after phase averaging and here eulerian average in the x direction is used and denoted with overbar fig 5 shows the y z cross section of the streamwise velocity u and the stream function ψ v ψ z w ψ y in an initial growth phase at t 600 π wrs result shows clear features of langmuir cells and they are closely reproduced in cl dvws case cells also appear in cl d case but they are weaker and shallower than wrs and cl dvws cases to examine the dynamics of the simulated circulations we study the turbulent kinetic energy tke production terms let us define the tke as 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 where denotes eulerian average in y direction and prime denotes deviation from it according to the cl theory the tke develops as 25 t tke p st p f z ϵ e g mcwilliams et al 1997 where the stokes production term p st u w u st z and the shear production term p u w u z represent the conversion of energy from waves and horizontal mean current respectively to horizontally nonuniform motion f is vertical tke transport due to turbulence and pressure and ϵ is energy dissipation in wrs case p st is estimated using the prescribed u st profile of cl dvws and cl d cases fig 6 shows the vertical profiles of u u st p and p st at t 600 π from the vertical profiles of the production terms we find that the stokes production term energizes the deep circulation cells while the shear production term serves to intensify the circulations near the surface cl d and cl c cases underestimate both terms but the difference is more apparent in the shear production term which directly reflects the difference in the surface stress fig 7 a b shows the temporal evolution of maximum upwelling downwelling velocity w and maximum ψ cl dvws case closely captures the development and viscous decay of the langmuir cells in wrs this result shows that the viscous attenuation of waves intensifies the lcs and that its effect can be incorporated into was by applying additional tangential stress vws at the upper surface cl d case underestimates the initial growth of the lcs because the vertically sheared current produced by the boundary condition is weaker compared to cl dvws case and the cl2 mechanism would work less effectively the difference between cl d and cl dvws becomes smaller as the simulation proceeds fig 7 b this is because the vws becomes much smaller compared to τ 0 at the later stage of the simulation and the forcing of cl dvws case becomes similar to cl d case cl c case also underestimates the initial growth but the underestimation turns to the overestimation at around t 1000 π the tke production profile at t 1000 π not shown shows that the stokes production of cl c case retains its magnitude while in other cases it becomes small as the stokes drift reduces with time for reference the e folding time scale of the stokes drift in wrs cl dvws and cl d cases is about 1600 π the wave attenuation increases the momentum input into currents which effectively increases the friction velocity the circulation intensity normalized with the effective friction velocity u eff ρ 1 τ 0 τ vws 1 2 is weakened when the vws effect is included fig 7 c d this is consistent with the classical argument of lcs intensity based on the turbulent langmuir number la t u u st 1 2 belcher et al 2012 since la t represents the relative magnitude of the shear production to the stokes production larger la t would be associated with weaker lcs compared to the stress driven current which is characterized with u to explore the situation considered in tsai et al 2017 let us next investigate the cases with τ 0 0 wrs cl dvws cl d and cl c cases are conducted with τ 0 0 condition in figs 8 10 the results are shown fig 8 shows that the wrs result clearly shows the circulation pattern like langmuir cells and again cl dvws case closely reproduces the features cl d and cl c cases significantly underestimate the cell intensity although there are still very weak cells the vertical profiles of tke production terms fig 9 show that the cells of wrs and cl dvws cases are produced through both shear and stokes production terms just like in the experiments with τ 0 1 1 0 6 this suggests that the cells are driven in a similar mechanism even in the absence of the surface stress τ 0 on the other hand in cl d and cl c cases only weak stokes production effect can be observed and the shear production is nearly zero the fact that the momentum supply from the surface is essential for the cell growth supports the idea that the cells observed in wrs and cl dvws cases are driven by the cl2 mechanism it is noteworthy that the lcs in cl c case remain underestimated throughout the simulation period fig 10 in contrast to the experiments with τ 0 1 1 0 6 since the momentum supply by the surface stress τ 0 is absent the cl2 mechanism does not function even though the stokes drift shear persists to examine the amplitude dependence of the above result we have conducted the same simulations with a k 0 2 and τ 0 0 to avoid numerical instability we used δ t 2 π 300 and took 64 128 256 grid points in x y z directions respectively the temporal evolution of vertical velocity and stream function is shown in fig 11 cl dvws case roughly captures the circulation intensity of wrs case although they do not strictly agree because of a somewhat chaotic behavior of the currents we also conducted simulations with a k 0 3 and then the lcs became completely turbulent and non uniform in x then x averaged w and ψ are no longer good indices of the circulation intensity to stick to simple analyses we will not further examine turbulent cases and these cases will be discussed elsewhere 5 discussion and conclusion in this paper we described the formulation of a curvilinear coordinate free surface numerical fluid model special attention was paid to the momentum and energy conservation properties so that the quantitatively reliable results can be obtained even with low spatial and temporal resolutions thanks to this feature the model can be reliably used to simulate the momentum energy transfer between waves and currents which appears as a residual over one wave period of a much stronger oscillatory motion also the reduction of the required temporal resolution to retain accuracy saves the computation cost which can be used to increase the domain size spatial resolution or the number of experiment parameters applications of this feature may include the simulations of the langmuir circulations under a random sea or the wave wave interaction under an influence of underlying current for instance presently the model is only thread parallelized and only allows simulations with o 20 0 3 grid points and we plan to process parallelize the code to enable simulations of a wider range of phenomena in section 4 the impacts of viscous wave attenuation on the lcs are investigated by comparing wrs and was with several different representations of the wave attenuation effects it was shown that the viscous wave effect can be incorporated into the was by addressing the weakening of the stokes drift used in the vortex force and by applying the vws ρ ν z u st surface as additional tangential stress at the surface zhou 2000 showed that the vws needs to be imposed in was to reproduce the result of dns under a wavy rigid lid configuration and our result extends the conclusion to a dns with freely propagating waves that can decay in time since the sheared current produced by the wave attenuation is favorable for the cl2 instability driving streamwise vortices leibovich 1983 such vortices are produced even in the absence of wind stress at the upper surface see figs 8 and 10 the fact that the vortex growth was well reproduced with the cl equation and the vws at the surface provides strong support for the analysis of tsai et al 2017 the coherent vortices observed in wrs without wind stress can be interpreted as lcs driven by cl2 mechanism arising from the vws induced shear the viscous attenuation effect might appear unimportant for the development of lcs because the decay of significant waves due to molecular viscosity is very weak in the typical oceanic conditions however we consider that the wave attenuation effect deserves attention in the context of lcs for the following two reasons first the ocean waves are often broad banded and the short waves e g gravity capillary waves attenuate more quickly than the significant waves resulting in an efficient transfer of momentum to the current longuet higgins 1969 estimated that this momentum transfer accounts for 15 of the total wind stress when u 3 m s 1 where u is wind speed at 4 cm above the water surface second and probably more importantly the computational power of today only allows the wave resolving dns of o 1 m scales with realistic parameters in simulations of larger spatial scales we must rely on dns with a higher viscosity than realistic water or the eddy viscosity parameterizations i e the large eddy simulations in such simulations waves will induce much stronger vws than reality and the intensity of lcs will be strongly influenced in order to properly interpret the wrs results we must be aware of the qualitative and quantitative impact of the wave attenuation in the simulation results at hand credit authorship

the energy conservation properties of six explicit time integration schemes namely adams bashforth 2nd 3rd and 4th order schemes ab2 ab3 ab4 runge kutta midpoint 2nd order scheme rk2 the low storage runge kutta 3rd order scheme lsrk3 williamson 1980 and runge kutta 4th order rk4 scheme the linear ode d x t d t i x t is used as a model equation where x t is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit its analytical solution is x t x 0 exp i t and the energy e x t 2 is conserved the integration time step δ t of t 50 and t 100 are used in the ab schemes where t 2 π is the oscillation period to compare performances with the same computational cost δ t t 25 t 50 for rk2 δ t t 17 t 33 for lsrk3 and δ t t 12 t 25 for rk4 table a 3 shows the numerical energy growth rate β defined in section 3 1 and phase error of each scheme out of the six schemes ab4 shows the smallest error in both energy and phase appendix b grid generation and dependence of the simulated vws on top grid thickness in the viscous wave simulations in sections 3 2 and 4 the vertically stretched grid thickness δ z k was constructed in the following form b 1 δ z k a 1 b tanh k k 2 0 15 k k 1 k where a and b are constants that are determined from desired δ z top and the constraint δ z k h the vertical profiles of δ z are shown in fig b 12 for δ z top 0 2 δ and 2 δ with re 1 0 4 where δ 2 re 1 2 to study the sensitivity of the simulated vws on top grid thickness δ z top simulations of free propagating viscous wave as in section 3 2 are conducted with δ z top 0 2 δ and 2 δ with re 1 0 4 the vertical profiles of u at t 800 π are shown in fig b 13 for each δ z even with the top grid as thick as 2 δ the drift current due to the vws agrees well with the result obtained with high vertical resolution therefore the fluctuating viscous boundary layer at the free surface does not need to be resolved as far as we are only concerned with its residual effect we conducted the same test with re 1 0 5 and the same conclusion was obtained appendix c treatment of upper boundary here we examine the error introduced by the approximation c 1 u v k 1 2 u v k used in solving the poisson equations 16 and 19 for comparison the following condition is used c 2 u v k 1 2 u v k δ z k 2 u z v z k 1 2 even though the tangential stress is not explicitly used here u v k 1 2 would reflect the stress via the internal velocity gradient u z v z k 1 2 we shall call the conditions eqs c 1 and c 2 top cell and extrapolation conditions respectively using top cell and extrapolation conditions we conducted the inviscid and viscid test cases introduced in section 3 in the inviscid simulation we used the same setting as the one used to produce fig 2 n x n z 64 δ t 2 π 200 except that a k 0 3 in the viscid simulation the performance test of tsai and hung 2007 is conducted with horizontal and vertical grid points of 32 and 64 respectively we have examined the results with lower vertical resolutions but the conclusion did not change fig c 14 shows the surface elevation after 6 linear wave periods in the inviscid cases the fifth order solution of fenton 1985 is also shown for reference the difference between the top cell case and the fifth order solution shows that the top cell case shows some delay in phase this is consistent with the phase delay error due to vertical discretization fig 1 b it can be found that the phase delay is somewhat reduced by using the extrapolation condition but its effect is limited table c 4 shows the energy error from each case here e defined with eq 21 is used to calculate the energy growth rate β to incorporate the viscosity effect and separate the numerical error the use of top cell approximation does not change the order of magnitude of the energy error note that the magnitude of the energy error is reduced by using the top cell approximation in the viscid case since the energy dissipation due to viscosity is much larger than this the energy error of this magnitude is practically negligible it was also found that the use of different conditions did not affect the number of iterations for solving the poisson equations and the computational stability overall we conclude that the use of the top cell condition does not significantly affect the performance of the model 
23945,interaction processes of attenuating surface waves and underlying currents are explicitly simulated with a nonhydrostatic free surface numerical model the model designed with special attention to the numerical conservation properties of energy and momentum is capable of accurately capturing the effect of the virtual wave stress a viscous momentum transfer from waves to current simple experiments with the present model show that the langmuir circulations in the wave resolving simulations tend to be stronger than the ones in the craik leibovich equation with corresponding stokes drift profiles the underestimation in the craik leibovich equation can be corrected by addressing momentum transfer from attenuating waves to currents as the virtual wave stress at the surface keywords nonhydrostatic free surface model surface waves langmuir circulations virtual wave stress 1 introduction wind waves and swells play crucial roles in the upper ocean dynamics and the air sea interaction by moderating momentum heat and material exchanges between air and water even without breaking waves interact with upper ocean current to produce langmuir circulations lcs which are considered to dominate the surface mixing in regions with high waves such as the southern ocean belcher et al 2012 the central dynamics of lcs is considered to be described by the craik leibovich cl equation craik and leibovich 1976 leibovich 1980 holm 1996 which is a prognostic equation of the wave averaged non oscillatory current in the cl equation the residual effect of wave motion is parameterized using external forces called the vortex force and the bernoulli head gradient the former represents the advection and tilting of vorticity by the stokes drift velocity when the directions of the stokes drift and the wind driven sheared current are aligned lcs induce vertical vorticity by tilting up the wind driven crosswind vorticity which is then tilted downwind by the vertically sheared stokes drift this process forms a positive feedback and lcs develop efficiently this instability is called the cl2 mechanism and is considered to be a major driving mechanism of the lcs craik 1977 leibovich 1977 1983 in order to obtain a quantitative picture of wave driven turbulence many numerical studies have been conducted using the cl equation e g skyllingstad and denbo 1995 mcwilliams et al 1997 li et al 2005 these simulations are called the wave averaged simulations or was the cl equation is an approximate form of the navier stokes equation under various asymptotic assumptions whereby neglecting several processes such as unsteadiness of wave amplitude etc therefore it is important to verify the performance of the was by comparing the result with field observations laboratory experiments or explicit numerical simulations of wave motions called wave resolving simulations or wrs wrs and was can be directly compared and are thus suitable for the verification of the wave averaged formulations among the recent wrs studies tsai et al 2017 and wang and özgökmen 2018 suggest the importance of the so called eulerian mean drift which was first addressed by longuet higgins 1953 this drift occurs because the momentum carried by the waves proportional to the amplitude squared and directed to the propagation direction is transferred to the underlying current when they attenuate due to viscosity phillips 1966 this momentum transfer occurs in the thin viscous boundary layer near the surface and the wave averaged current feels the momentum input as if there is additional tangential stress at the surface called the virtual wave stress vws in the limit of small amplitude and weak viscosity the vws is to leading order τ vws ρ ν z u st surface where ρ ν and u st z are the water density the kinematic viscosity and the stokes drift profile longuet higgins 1953 xu and bowen 1994 aiki and greatbatch 2012 weber 2018 in the cl framework the vws will intensify the lcs by producing stronger crosswind vorticity near the surface and enhancing the cl2 mechanism based on linear stability analysis tsai et al 2017 suggested that the coherent vortices observed in laboratory experiments and wrs without imposed surface stress can be interpreted as lcs arising from the interaction of the eulerian mean drift and the wave motion wang and özgökmen 2018 compared the lcs simulated in wrs and was based on the cl equation and showed that the wrs obtains stronger lc than the was they attributed the difference to the eulerian mean drift but they did not quantify its effect on the difference while these results suggest that the viscous wave attenuation leads to stronger lcs in wrs detailed quantitative support has not yet been provided in order to properly interpret the simulation results the impact of the viscous wave attenuation on the lcs must be clarified as far as we are aware no free surface model is carefully examined for its accuracy in simulating the viscous momentum transfer from waves to currents in this study we investigate the effect of the viscous wave attenuation on the lcs our particular interest is if and if so how the effect can be reproduced in the wave averaged framework for this purpose we first develop a nonhydrostatic free surface numerical model that can be reliably used in wrs studies of wave current interaction the model uses the surface following coordinate system so that it can simulate large amplitude surface waves and the underlying current at the same time as long as there is no overturning of the surface wave breaking in order to avoid numerical sources of momentum that could cause a fake wave current interaction we spatially discretize the momentum equation in a full flux form as in xuan and shen 2019 who independently developed a free surface numerical model with a similar discretization scheme we also paid special attention to reduce the numerical energy growth and decay to a negligible level even with a relatively long integration time step detailed tests are carried out to examine the energy conservation properties using the newly developed model low reynolds number direct numerical simulations dns of lcs with a simple configuration are conducted the result shows that the effect of the viscous wave attenuation is crucially important to determine the intensity of lcs the was reproduces the lcs of wrs in a quantitatively consistent manner only when the vws is added to the top tangential stress the structure of the paper is as follows in section 2 the formulation of the newly developed model is described the model s performance in inviscid and viscid surface wave simulations is examined in section 3 then the impact of wave attenuation on wrs and was of lcs is examined in section 4 implications for wrs and was studies of lcs are discussed in section 5 2 model description the numerical formulation presented here is similar to the sigma coordinate free surface models of tsai and hung 2007 yang and shen 2011 and xuan and shen 2019 to highlight the improvements from these models we keep our model description to necessary formulations only since the three dimensional non hydrostatic simulations in a curvilinear coordinate system are computationally costly it is preferable if a numerical error in momentum and energy can be reduced to a negligible level even with relatively low spatial temporal resolutions to achieve this we spatially discretize the momentum equation in full flux form whereby momentum is well conserved similar discretization with full flux form was independently adopted by xuan and shen 2019 in order to improve the energy conservation property we propose a new temporal integration procedure of the pressure gradient terms using the 4th order adams bashforth scheme which has not been used in the previous numerical ocean models in this manuscript we shall consider a horizontally rectangular domain with a flat bottom and horizontally equally spaced grid points for simplicity however these techniques can also be applied in free surface models with more complex geometries to improve their numerical conservation properties 2 1 governing equations and boundary conditions here x y and z denote the cartesian coordinates and z is taken vertically upward variables u v and w are the x y and z components of velocity respectively consider a horizontally rectangular domain bounded by a rigid bottom at z h h is constant and a free surface at z η x y t which is assumed to be a single valued function no overturn horizontal boundaries are doubly periodic let us consider the incompressible navier stokes equation with a uniform density ρ the horizontal and vertical momentum equations and the continuity equation are as follows 1a u t u u x v u y w u z x g η p s p t x x x t y x y t z x z 1b v t u v x v v y w v z y g η p s p t x y x t y y y t z y z 1c w t u w x v w y w w z p z t x z x t y z y t z z z 2 u x v y w z 0 here g is the gravitational acceleration for convenience we have decomposed the raw pressure ϕ into three parts as follows 3 ϕ ρ p s ρ g η z ρ p the three rhs terms represent the surface pressure sum of the atmospheric pressure and surface tension effect the hydrostatic pressure due to surface displacement and the nonhydrostatic pressure as introduced later p s x y t is the value of ϕ ρ at the water surface and is provided as a dynamical boundary condition t is viscous stress tensor whose components are defined as 4 t i j ν u j x i u i x j where i and j represent x y and z u x u y u z u v w and x x x y x z x y z the kinematic viscosity ν is assumed isotropic the kinematic boundary conditions at the top and bottom are w η t u η x v η y at z η w 0 at z h these two conditions are combined with the continuity equation 2 to provide the total volume conservation equation 5 η t x h η u d z y h η v d z in addition to the kinematic boundary conditions dynamic boundary conditions must be given at the bottom surface two components of the tangential stress τ b x t x z and τ b y t y z are specified the dynamical boundary condition at the free surface should be given so that the three components of the surface stress s n can be determined here s ϕ ρ i t i is the unit tensor is the total stress tensor and n is the unit vector outward normal to the free surface we choose τ s x τ s y and p s in the following equations are to be specified at the surface 6a τ s x η x t x x η y t y x t z x 6b τ s y η x t x y η y t y y t z y 6c p s n s n ϕ ρ τ 1 η x 2 η y 2 here η x and η y represent η x and η y respectively quantities τ s x and τ s y denote the surface flux of horizontal momentum via viscous stress per unit horizontal area eq 6c specifies the normal component of the surface stress which is received via the pressure ϕ and the normal viscous stress τ t z z 2 η x t x z 2 η y t y z η x 2 t x x 2 η x η y t x y η y 2 t y y to simplify the treatment of pressure we approximate eq 6c with p s ϕ ρ from which the surface boundary condition p 0 can be derived this approximation does not affect the velocity field because the total normal force imposed onto the fluid is unchanged the pressure field is altered by the approximation but we can estimate that its relative error from the actual pressure is smaller than 10 3 for waves with wavelengths longer than 0 1 m 2 2 coordinate transformation the following vertical coordinate transform maps the deformable physical domain h z η x y t onto a fixed computational domain h z 0 7 x x y y z z x y z t z 1 z h η t t this is essentially equivalent to the so called sigma coordinate tsai and hung 2007 yang and shen 2011 xuan and shen 2019 we introduce the layer thickness h and the z velocity ω as follows h z z 1 η h ω h 1 w z t z x u z y v where subscripts with the independent variables x y z t represent partial derivatives for convenience we introduce the thickness weighted variables u h u v h v w h w p h p and ω h ω one can transform the volume conservation equation 5 as 8 η t x h 0 u d z y h 0 v d z this equation is used to diagnose z t 1 z h η t in the definition of ω using the chain rules the continuity equation 2 can be rewritten in the following diagnostic and prognostic forms 9 u x v y z w h z x h u z y h v 0 10 h t u x v y ω z 0 using eq 10 the momentum equations 1 are transformed to the following thickness weighted form 11a u t x u u h 1 2 g h h 2 p h t x x y v u h h t y x z ω u h z x h p z x t x x z y t y x t x z 0 11b v t x u v h h t x y y v v h 1 2 g h h 2 p h t y y z ω v h z y h

including pressure gradient terms can be written in flux form mellor 2003 aiki and greatbatch 2012 xuan and shen 2019 the full flux forms of the momentum equations 11a 11c are essentially equivalent to the ones in xuan and shen 2019 2 3 spatial discretization next we shall spatially discretize the model equations in the horizontal direction the pseudo spectral method based on the fourier series is used all variables are thus uniformly distributed and collocated in horizontal hereafter horizontal derivatives denote evaluation using fft tests revealed that zero filling the spectral coefficients above two thirds of the nyquist wavenumber prevents nonlinear instability in most cases in the vertical direction the second order finite difference method based on the staggered grid is used let k be the vertical index increasing upwards we denote the cell centers with indices 1 2 k and the cell interfaces with indices 1 2 3 2 k 1 2 the bottom and the top locations are represented with z 1 2 and z k 1 2 the location of variables is listed in table 1 let us denote the vertical cell thicknesses measured in z system with δ z 1 δ z k since the variables are horizontally collocated we omit the horizontal indices of the discretized variables when variables need to be evaluated at vertical levels where they are originally not defined they are interpolated to the evaluation points the velocity components u and v at the water surface k 1 2 must be given in the continuity equation 9 from which the pressure poisson equation is constructed we set u v k 1 2 u v k instead of extrapolating or using the stress boundary conditions according to various tests this treatment simplifies the formulation without significantly affecting the results appendix c the tangential stress boundary condition is imposed through the viscous stress term the stress tensor components t x z and t y z at the water surface are specified with eq 6 a b for convenience the vertical finite difference operator δ is introduced as follows δ φ k 1 2 1 δ z k 1 2 φ k 1 φ k δ φ k 1 δ z k φ k 1 2 φ k 1 2 where φ represents any variable the vertical derivatives of variables multiplied by coordinate slope often appear in the equations they can be transformed as follows z z x φ k h 1 η x δ h z φ k z z x φ k 1 2 h 1 η x δ h z φ k 1 2 and likewise for y instead of x also for convenience let us introduce the operator δ ˆ as δ ˆ φ k δ h z φ k using these notations the discretized version of eqs 8 9 and 11 are 12a u k t g x k p k x η x h h δ ˆ p k 12b v k t g y k p k y η y h h δ ˆ p k

nonhydrostatic pressure term on the rhs of eqs 11a 11b and 11c respectively these terms can be explicitly evaluated from an instantaneous flow field thanks to the flux form discretization of eqs 12 and 13 the momentum and total mass are well conserved as will be shown later 2 4 time integration and pressure solving scheme let us denote the variable φ at timestep n as φ n and the vector u v w as u and the variables u n v n w n η n are known the pressure p needs to be determined from incompressibility conventionally the incompressibility is achieved by using the so called projection method e g chorin 1968 durran 2010 where pressure is determined so that the resulting velocity field would become divergence free however in general this pressure is neither p n nor p n 1 2 2 in the surface following curvilinear coordinate the spatial derivative operator for convenience contains time dependent coefficients the instantaneous pressure p n is determined so that n p n g n will become nondivergent where g g x g y g z the scalar field obtained from the projection method as the pressure φ is determined so that δ t n 1 φ u n t n t n 1 g d t will become nondivergent because the evaluation time is different φ differs from p n by o δ t in the present system pressure serves not only to retain incompressibility but also to drive potential motion related to waves in order to achieve time integration with high conservation property and reasonable computational costs we adopt the 4th order adams bashforth ab4 scheme to integrate eqs 12 and 13 see appendix a for the comparison of several different integration schemes ab4 scheme approximates the time integral of the pressure gradient term using a linear combination of p n p n 1 p n 2 and p n 3 since the pressure derived from the projection method does not belong to any particular moment it is not suitable for the ab4 integration we take the following strategy requiring the nondivergence of velocity tendency u t n the instantaneous pressure p n is calculated and the momentum equation is integrated using ab4 scheme the incompressibility of u n 1 is guaranteed by adding the gradient of correction pressure p to the velocity field after ab4 integration where p is obtained from the incompressibility condition of u n 1 the standard projection method in order to derive the pressure poisson equation for p n

solved using the fixed point iteration scheme as in tsai and hung 2007 and yang and shen 2011 let us write the lhs terms as l p the rhs terms independent of p as q and the rhs terms dependent on p as

converges it satisfies eq 16 when surface steepness is smaller than 0 3 it typically takes less than 10 iterations to reach convergence we also tried to utilize the modified newton method as in tsai and hung 2007 and yang and shen 2011 but it did not improve performance in our formulation for example in the inviscid stokes wave test described in section 3 with a k 0 1 and δ t 2 π 100 the average number of iteration for solving eq 16 was increased from 6 to 20 by introducing mixed scheme of fixed point iteration and modified newton methods once p n is obtained the rhs terms of eqs 12 and 13

solving eq 16 to reach convergence 3 performance tests in this section inviscid and viscid surface waves are simulated to show the model performance first we nondimensionalize the governing equations 1 2 and 4 dimensional variables are temporally denoted with subscript d let us take a linear deep water wave of wavenumber k d and angular frequency σ d g d k d 1 2 for reference and consider cases with constant viscosity we nondimensionalize the variables as x y z k d x d y d z d t σ d t d u v w σ d k d 1 u d v d w d η h k d η d h d and p σ d k d 2 p d the resulting nondimensional equations have the same form as eqs 1 2 and 4 with ρ 1 g 1 and ν ν d σ d k d 2 re 1 here re σ d k d 2 ν d is reynolds number based on wave phase speed and wavenumber 3 3 as noted by phillips 1961 re does not have a clear dynamical interpretation and does not serve as an index of dynamic instability in this section we consider x z two dimensional problems whose equations are obtained by setting v 0 and y 0 let us take a domain bounded by periodic boundaries at x 0 2 π the free surface at z η η 0 at rest and a flat bottom at z h at the free surface zero surface pressure p s 0 is assumed in viscous problems zero viscous stresses are assumed at the top and bottom boundaries τ s x τ s y 0 τ b x τ b y 0 3 1 dispersion relation and energy conservation of inviscid waves in this subsection the inviscid cases ν 0 are considered to study the model performance in conservative processes first the depth dependence of dispersion relation of linear surface waves is examined the numbers of grid points are 64 in the horizontal and vertical and the vertical cell thicknesses in terms of z are uniformly distributed as an initial condition we give the orbital motion of surface waves with wavenumber k 1 as follows 20a η x 0 a cos x 20b u x z 0 a σ lin cosh z h cosh h cos x 20c w x z 0 a σ lin sinh z h cosh h sin x here σ lin tanh h 1 2 is the angular frequency of linear surface waves the experiments were conducted with depth h varying from 0 0156 π to 4 π for longer than 200 π σ lin the amplitude a is taken as min 0 001 0 001 h to avoid nonlinear effects typically time step δ t of 0 02 π σ lin is used while smaller δ t is required in cases with small h for stable computation the computations are conducted for more than 100 wave periods the zero up cross method is applied to the time series of η at x 0 to obtain a series of individual wave periods t 1 t 2 then the individual periods of the first 100 waves are averaged to obtain the wave period t in fig 1 the diagnosed angular frequency σ 2 π t is plotted against the nondimensional depth k h equal to h all of the individual wave periods fell within the range 1 0 001 t for all the cases the result shows that the model can accurately simulate the linear dispersion relation from shallow to deep water regimes next we take the wave amplitude as the control parameter and examine the model s capability to simulate wave nonlinearity we shall consider a deep water case h 4 π let us denote the numbers of grid points in x z directions as n x 2 n z i e one wavelength is resolved with n x and n z points in horizontal and vertical respectively experiments are conducted with various combinations of n x n z vertical cell thicknesses are uniform in terms of z the fifth order stokes wave solution fenton 1985 is used to provide the initial condition the wave slope a k is varied from 0 01 to 0 35 and the simulations are run for longer than 100 periods with δ t 2 π 100 and 2 π 200 the simulated wave period t is obtained by using the zero up cross analysis and by averaging the first 100 individual wave periods in fig 1 the diagnosed angular frequency σ 2 π t is plotted against wave steepness a k equal to a when a k 0 2 computations with δ t 2 π 100 became unstable stable with δ t 2 π 200 the simulation results with n x n z 64 64 closely follow the nonlinear dispersion relation σ 1 a k 2 2 o a k 3 stokes 1847 however reducing the vertical resolution to n z 16 resulted in a phase deceleration error of 0 1 regardless of wave steepness this suggests that adequate vertical resolution is required to accurately simulate phenomena in which the accurate dispersion relation plays a central role on the other hand the results were less sensitive to horizontal resolution thanks to the pseudo spectral discretization in horizontal to examine the model s energy conservation property the temporal evolution of the total energy e 1 2 u 2 w 2 d z d x 1 2 η 2 d x which is ideally conserved is examined the energy growth rate β is evaluated by fitting e t e 0 e β t to the time series of total energy over the simulation period the growth rate is plotted in fig 2 for cases with a k 0 01 and 0 1 with various combinations of n x n z the growth rate of 1 0 6 indicates that the energy decays by 0 06 over 200 π 100 linear periods which is negligible in most practical cases from fig 2 we can find that the energy conservation property of this model is mainly dominated by temporal and vertical discretization errors the former causes slight energy decay see also appendix a while the latter causes energy growth the energy growth due to vertical discretization is magnified when the wave slope is large and this magnification is observed with a k at least up to 0 3 not shown for a k 0 1 and δ t 2 π 100 the growth effect dominates over the decaying effect when n z 32 on the other hand the horizontal resolution as low as n x 8 causes undetectable difference from the cases with n x 64 thanks to the full flux formulation of momentum and mass conservation equations the errors in the volume integral of these quantities are practically negligible for the case with lowest resolution n x n z 8 δ t 2 π 100 with a k 0 1 the relative error in the total horizontal momentum was smaller than 2 1 0 8 during the simulation period for a standard resolution of n x n z 64 δ t 2 π 100 the error was reduced to 3 1 0 14 in both cases the error in total mass was smaller than 10 15 to demonstrate the model s energy conservation property in viscous cases compared to the preceding numerical models we conduct the nondimensionalized version of the performance test designed by tsai and hung 2007 their figure 3 consider a two dimensional domain with h 1 6 π we use the nondimensionalized equation introduced above and take a finite reynolds number re 6286 the flow is initialized with the fifth order stokes wave fenton 1985 with wavenumber k 1 and slope a k 0 3 and the integration time step is δ t t 2000 where t is one wave period of the stokes wave the domain is discretized with three combinations of grid points 24 48 32 64 and 128 128 where the horizontal a and vertical b grid points are denoted with a b the grid spacings are changed in vertical and cell interfaces are specified with z n 1 2 h tanh 1 8417 n k tanh 1 8417 1 n 0 k fig 3 shows the time series of normalized energy error in each

in the x z component momentum equation after 6 wave periods the cases with 24 48 32 64 and 128 128 grid points show errors of 6 8 1 0 6 9 1 1 0 6 and 1 3 1 0 6 respectively these errors are fairly smaller than ones shown in figure 3 of tsai and hung 2007 which are of o 1 0 4 1 0 3 3 2 eulerian mean drift next deep water waves with small viscosity are simulated to examine the model s capability to correctly simulate the eulerian mean drift the nondimensional equations are simulated with finite re the depth h 4 π is used and 64 and 128 grid points are taken in horizontal and vertical respectively the grid spacings are changed in vertical so that more grid points are clustered near the upper boundary for details of the grid point distribution see appendix b the top grid thickness δ z top is set to 0 2 δ where δ 2 re 1 2 is the thickness of viscous boundary layer the tests are conducted with two reynolds numbers re 1 0 4 and 1 0 5 the flow is initialized with the fifth order stokes wave fenton 1985 with a k 0 1 and is freely propagated for more than 2000 π with δ t 2 π 300 it is confirmed that the amplitude decays in good accordance with linear theory a t a e 2 t re phillips 1966 to compare the result with the analytical expression of vws the one dimensional diffusion equation u t re 1 2 u z 2 is solved the upper boundary condition is set to the vws considering

depths and then averaging horizontally the average is not defined above trough for both re 1 0 4 and 1 0 5 two profiles agree well showing that the simulated momentum transfer from waves to the eulerian current is consistent with the perturbation theory of longuet higgins 1953 sensitivity test with different δ z top showed that the top layer as thick as 2 δ could properly represent the vws effect see appendix b 4 effects of viscous wave attenuation on langmuir circulations in order to investigate the effect of viscous wave attenuation the wrs and was of langmuir circulations are compared in a simple configuration in the wrs the nondimensional equations are solved in a three dimensional domain 0 x 2 π 0 y 2 π 2 π z η discretized with 64 64 128 grid points in each direction since it is shown that the top layer can be as thick as 2 δ to properly represent the vws effect δ z is set to δ at the top increasing with depth where δ 2 re 1 2 and re 2 1 0 4 initial conditions are the superposition of the fifth order stokes wave with a 0 1 and streamwise jet like perturbation to seed lcs 22a η x y 0 η w5 x 22b u x y z 0 u w5 x z u 2 1 cos y 22c v x y z 0 0 22d w x y z 0 w w5 x

y 0 at the upper surface and τ b x τ b y 0 at the bottom here τ 0 is the imposed tangential stress at the upper boundary and is specified later the simulation is run for more than 4000 π with δ t 2 π 100 the result showed that the wave amplitude decays in good accordance with the linear theory a t a e 2 t re to compare the result of wrs corresponding was is conducted using the cl equation 23a u t

retain incompressibility because an addition of any gradient term under the rigid lid approximation does not alter the result the bernoulli head term is not explicitly specified the initial condition is the jet like flow as in the wrs 24 u x y z 0 u 2 1 cos y v x y z 0 w x y z 0 0 in order to highlight the role of viscous wave attenuation three was experiments named cl dvws cl d and cl c are designed and their settings are listed in table 2 in the cl dvws and cl d cases where d means decaying the stokes drift u st is prescribed using the deep water wave solution where the wave s amplitude is assumed to decay following the linear theory a t a e 2 t re in the cl c case where c means constant the stokes drift is kept constant the comparison between the cl d and cl c cases highlights the effect of the wave attenuation through the vortex force to investigate the effect through the momentum transfer an additional vws is imposed at the upper boundary condition of the cl dvws case from the cl2 instability theory it is expected that this imposed vws will lead to stronger lcs compared to cl d case in all the cases τ s y and τ b x y are set to zero we first consider a situation with surface stress τ 0 1 1 0 6 this setting is similar to the one considered by wang and özgökmen 2018 although they considered the stress field that varies in the y direction the wrs result can be compared with the cl result after phase averaging and here eulerian average in the x direction is used and denoted with overbar fig 5 shows the y z cross section of the streamwise velocity u and the stream function ψ v ψ z w ψ y in an initial growth phase at t 600 π wrs result shows clear features of langmuir cells and they are closely reproduced in cl dvws case cells also appear in cl d case but they are weaker and shallower than wrs and cl dvws cases to examine the dynamics of the simulated circulations we study the turbulent kinetic energy tke production terms let us define the tke as 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 where denotes eulerian average in y direction and prime denotes deviation from it according to the cl theory the tke develops as 25 t tke p st p f z ϵ e g mcwilliams et al 1997 where the stokes production term p st u w u st z and the shear production term p u w u z represent the conversion of energy from waves and horizontal mean current respectively to horizontally nonuniform motion f is vertical tke transport due to turbulence and pressure and ϵ is energy dissipation in wrs case p st is estimated using the prescribed u st profile of cl dvws and cl d cases fig 6 shows the vertical profiles of u u st p and p st at t 600 π from the vertical profiles of the production terms we find that the stokes production term energizes the deep circulation cells while the shear production term serves to intensify the circulations near the surface cl d and cl c cases underestimate both terms but the difference is more apparent in the shear production term which directly reflects the difference in the surface stress fig 7 a b shows the temporal evolution of maximum upwelling downwelling velocity w and maximum ψ cl dvws case closely captures the development and viscous decay of the langmuir cells in wrs this result shows that the viscous attenuation of waves intensifies the lcs and that its effect can be incorporated into was by applying additional tangential stress vws at the upper surface cl d case underestimates the initial growth of the lcs because the vertically sheared current produced by the boundary condition is weaker compared to cl dvws case and the cl2 mechanism would work less effectively the difference between cl d and cl dvws becomes smaller as the simulation proceeds fig 7 b this is because the vws becomes much smaller compared to τ 0 at the later stage of the simulation and the forcing of cl dvws case becomes similar to cl d case cl c case also underestimates the initial growth but the underestimation turns to the overestimation at around t 1000 π the tke production profile at t 1000 π not shown shows that the stokes production of cl c case retains its magnitude while in other cases it becomes small as the stokes drift reduces with time for reference the e folding time scale of the stokes drift in wrs cl dvws and cl d cases is about 1600 π the wave attenuation increases the momentum input into currents which effectively increases the friction velocity the circulation intensity normalized with the effective friction velocity u eff ρ 1 τ 0 τ vws 1 2 is weakened when the vws effect is included fig 7 c d this is consistent with the classical argument of lcs intensity based on the turbulent langmuir number la t u u st 1 2 belcher et al 2012 since la t represents the relative magnitude of the shear production to the stokes production larger la t would be associated with weaker lcs compared to the stress driven current which is characterized with u to explore the situation considered in tsai et al 2017 let us next investigate the cases with τ 0 0 wrs cl dvws cl d and cl c cases are conducted with τ 0 0 condition in figs 8 10 the results are shown fig 8 shows that the wrs result clearly shows the circulation pattern like langmuir cells and again cl dvws case closely reproduces the features cl d and cl c cases significantly underestimate the cell intensity although there are still very weak cells the vertical profiles of tke production terms fig 9 show that the cells of wrs and cl dvws cases are produced through both shear and stokes production terms just like in the experiments with τ 0 1 1 0 6 this suggests that the cells are driven in a similar mechanism even in the absence of the surface stress τ 0 on the other hand in cl d and cl c cases only weak stokes production effect can be observed and the shear production is nearly zero the fact that the momentum supply from the surface is essential for the cell growth supports the idea that the cells observed in wrs and cl dvws cases are driven by the cl2 mechanism it is noteworthy that the lcs in cl c case remain underestimated throughout the simulation period fig 10 in contrast to the experiments with τ 0 1 1 0 6 since the momentum supply by the surface stress τ 0 is absent the cl2 mechanism does not function even though the stokes drift shear persists to examine the amplitude dependence of the above result we have conducted the same simulations with a k 0 2 and τ 0 0 to avoid numerical instability we used δ t 2 π 300 and took 64 128 256 grid points in x y z directions respectively the temporal evolution of vertical velocity and stream function is shown in fig 11 cl dvws case roughly captures the circulation intensity of wrs case although they do not strictly agree because of a somewhat chaotic behavior of the currents we also conducted simulations with a k 0 3 and then the lcs became completely turbulent and non uniform in x then x averaged w and ψ are no longer good indices of the circulation intensity to stick to simple analyses we will not further examine turbulent cases and these cases will be discussed elsewhere 5 discussion and conclusion in this paper we described the formulation of a curvilinear coordinate free surface numerical fluid model special attention was paid to the momentum and energy conservation properties so that the quantitatively reliable results can be obtained even with low spatial and temporal resolutions thanks to this feature the model can be reliably used to simulate the momentum energy transfer between waves and currents which appears as a residual over one wave period of a much stronger oscillatory motion also the reduction of the required temporal resolution to retain accuracy saves the computation cost which can be used to increase the domain size spatial resolution or the number of experiment parameters applications of this feature may include the simulations of the langmuir circulations under a random sea or the wave wave interaction under an influence of underlying current for instance presently the model is only thread parallelized and only allows simulations with o 20 0 3 grid points and we plan to process parallelize the code to enable simulations of a wider range of phenomena in section 4 the impacts of viscous wave attenuation on the lcs are investigated by comparing wrs and was with several different representations of the wave attenuation effects it was shown that the viscous wave effect can be incorporated into the was by addressing the weakening of the stokes drift used in the vortex force and by applying the vws ρ ν z u st surface as additional tangential stress at the surface zhou 2000 showed that the vws needs to be imposed in was to reproduce the result of dns under a wavy rigid lid configuration and our result extends the conclusion to a dns with freely propagating waves that can decay in time since the sheared current produced by the wave attenuation is favorable for the cl2 instability driving streamwise vortices leibovich 1983 such vortices are produced even in the absence of wind stress at the upper surface see figs 8 and 10 the fact that the vortex growth was well reproduced with the cl equation and the vws at the surface provides strong support for the analysis of tsai et al 2017 the coherent vortices observed in wrs without wind stress can be interpreted as lcs driven by cl2 mechanism arising from the vws induced shear the viscous attenuation effect might appear unimportant for the development of lcs because the decay of significant waves due to molecular viscosity is very weak in the typical oceanic conditions however we consider that the wave attenuation effect deserves attention in the context of lcs for the following two reasons first the ocean waves are often broad banded and the short waves e g gravity capillary waves attenuate more quickly than the significant waves resulting in an efficient transfer of momentum to the current longuet higgins 1969 estimated that this momentum transfer accounts for 15 of the total wind stress when u 3 m s 1 where u is wind speed at 4 cm above the water surface second and probably more importantly the computational power of today only allows the wave resolving dns of o 1 m scales with realistic parameters in simulations of larger spatial scales we must rely on dns with a higher viscosity than realistic water or the eddy viscosity parameterizations i e the large eddy simulations in such simulations waves will induce much stronger vws than reality and the intensity of lcs will be strongly influenced in order to properly interpret the wrs results we must be aware of the qualitative and quantitative impact of the wave attenuation in the simulation results at hand credit authorship

the energy conservation properties of six explicit time integration schemes namely adams bashforth 2nd 3rd and 4th order schemes ab2 ab3 ab4 runge kutta midpoint 2nd order scheme rk2 the low storage runge kutta 3rd order scheme lsrk3 williamson 1980 and runge kutta 4th order rk4 scheme the linear ode d x t d t i x t is used as a model equation where x t is a complex number and i is the imaginary unit its analytical solution is x t x 0 exp i t and the energy e x t 2 is conserved the integration time step δ t of t 50 and t 100 are used in the ab schemes where t 2 π is the oscillation period to compare performances with the same computational cost δ t t 25 t 50 for rk2 δ t t 17 t 33 for lsrk3 and δ t t 12 t 25 for rk4 table a 3 shows the numerical energy growth rate β defined in section 3 1 and phase error of each scheme out of the six schemes ab4 shows the smallest error in both energy and phase appendix b grid generation and dependence of the simulated vws on top grid thickness in the viscous wave simulations in sections 3 2 and 4 the vertically stretched grid thickness δ z k was constructed in the following form b 1 δ z k a 1 b tanh k k 2 0 15 k k 1 k where a and b are constants that are determined from desired δ z top and the constraint δ z k h the vertical profiles of δ z are shown in fig b 12 for δ z top 0 2 δ and 2 δ with re 1 0 4 where δ 2 re 1 2 to study the sensitivity of the simulated vws on top grid thickness δ z top simulations of free propagating viscous wave as in section 3 2 are conducted with δ z top 0 2 δ and 2 δ with re 1 0 4 the vertical profiles of u at t 800 π are shown in fig b 13 for each δ z even with the top grid as thick as 2 δ the drift current due to the vws agrees well with the result obtained with high vertical resolution therefore the fluctuating viscous boundary layer at the free surface does not need to be resolved as far as we are only concerned with its residual effect we conducted the same test with re 1 0 5 and the same conclusion was obtained appendix c treatment of upper boundary here we examine the error introduced by the approximation c 1 u v k 1 2 u v k used in solving the poisson equations 16 and 19 for comparison the following condition is used c 2 u v k 1 2 u v k δ z k 2 u z v z k 1 2 even though the tangential stress is not explicitly used here u v k 1 2 would reflect the stress via the internal velocity gradient u z v z k 1 2 we shall call the conditions eqs c 1 and c 2 top cell and extrapolation conditions respectively using top cell and extrapolation conditions we conducted the inviscid and viscid test cases introduced in section 3 in the inviscid simulation we used the same setting as the one used to produce fig 2 n x n z 64 δ t 2 π 200 except that a k 0 3 in the viscid simulation the performance test of tsai and hung 2007 is conducted with horizontal and vertical grid points of 32 and 64 respectively we have examined the results with lower vertical resolutions but the conclusion did not change fig c 14 shows the surface elevation after 6 linear wave periods in the inviscid cases the fifth order solution of fenton 1985 is also shown for reference the difference between the top cell case and the fifth order solution shows that the top cell case shows some delay in phase this is consistent with the phase delay error due to vertical discretization fig 1 b it can be found that the phase delay is somewhat reduced by using the extrapolation condition but its effect is limited table c 4 shows the energy error from each case here e defined with eq 21 is used to calculate the energy growth rate β to incorporate the viscosity effect and separate the numerical error the use of top cell approximation does not change the order of magnitude of the energy error note that the magnitude of the energy error is reduced by using the top cell approximation in the viscid case since the energy dissipation due to viscosity is much larger than this the energy error of this magnitude is practically negligible it was also found that the use of different conditions did not affect the number of iterations for solving the poisson equations and the computational stability overall we conclude that the use of the top cell condition does not significantly affect the performance of the model 
23946,we use an observing system simulation experiment osse to quantify improvements in ocean state estimation due to the assimilation of simulated surface water ocean topography swot observations using a multi scale 3dvar approach the sequential multi scale assimilation first generates a large scale analysis and then updates that analysis with smaller scale corrections since we use temperature and salinity depth profiles as proxies for sea surface height ssh observations the results are idealized skill metrics consistently show that the multi scale analysis is superior to the single scale analysis specifically because it improves small scale skill without sacrificing skill at larger scales the analysis skill over a range of spatial scales is determined using wavenumber spectral analysis of 100 m temperature ssh and mixed layer depth mld for mld the multi scale assimilation of swot data reduces the minimum constrained wavelength from 158 km to 122 km a 36 km reduction compared to a single scale assimilation of the same data for ssh the multi scale approach only reduces constrained scales from 73 km to 72 km a 1 km reduction this small increase in skill is caused by the steep wavenumber spectral slope associated with ssh which suggests that ssh variability is concentrated at long wavelengths ultimately the small scale update in the multi scale assimilation has less to correct for ssh in contrast mld has a relatively flat spectral slope the multi scale solution can make a more substantial update to the mld field because it has more small scale variability thus our results suggest that the magnitude of the skill improvement provided by the multi scale solution is negatively correlated with the spectral slope of the ocean variable keywords data

ubelmann 2014 ballarotta et al 2019 in 2021 the surface water ocean topography swot satellite mission fu and ubelmann 2014 will provide global surface elevation over a high density 120 km wide swath this new data source should produce much greater coverage of the mesoscale field as well as submesoscales on a regional basis wang et al 2019 recent studies have quantified the potential impact that swot data will have on ocean state estimation and prediction skill carrier et al 2016 bonaduce et al 2018 d addezio et al 2019 using observing system simulation experiment osse methodologies these studies found significant improvements in skill when assimilating simulated swot data but also found that each forecast analysis system could not constrain wavelengths below 100 km despite the fact that swot observations resolve these scales gaultier et al 2016 wang et al 2019 experimenting with the analysis decorrelation length scale d addezio et al 2019 concluded that multi scale data assimilation was required to fully utilize the swot observations here we verify that hypothesis by testing a multi scale 3dvar system in a high resolution 1 km simulation of the western pacific ocean fig 1 we find that the sequential multi scale analysis consistently outperforms the single scale analysis more precisely when compared with the single scale assimilation the multi scale assimilation reduces the constrained scales by 21 km and 36 km for 100 m temperature and mixed layer depth mld respectively multi scale assimilation methodologies have recently emerged to deal with observing networks that provide information on a wide range of scales muscarella et al 2014 li et al 2015a b miyazawa et al 2017 li et al 2019 for example glider data can observe the subsurface at very high spatial and temporal resolutions if the assimilation system is tuned to primarily correct large scale features e g mesoscale eddies those high resolution observations may be underutilized at smaller scales the relative sparsity of ocean observations creates a desire to maximize the utility of all available observations a glider specific case has been addressed by performing a multi step 4dvar analysis whereby large scale corrections were made to a background state in the first assimilation step followed by an update to that analysis field using small scale innovation background minus observations residuals carrier et al 2019 this is similar to how multi scale 3dvar has been previously implemented li et al 2015a b 2019 here we follow that tradition by implementing a two step 3dvar analysis in which the first step makes a large scale correction to the model background and the second step makes a small scale correction to the first step the multi scale assimilation is tested using an osse methodology whereby simulated observations are sampled from a free running model simulation the nature run a second model assimilates the simulated observations and we compare the second model to the nature run to evaluate errors e g halliwell et al 2014 section 2 details the configuration of our multi scale assimilation system the primary multi scale 3dvar parameter is the decorrelation length scale of the background error covariance but we also explore a temporal component the length of the small scale assimilation window the assimilation window is the length of time that observations are allowed into the data assimilation analysis the large scale analysis uses a 5 day assimilation window to correct the slowly evolving mesoscale field we show that because the smaller scale phenomena are transient the small scale update to the model background requires a shorter assimilation window section 3 documents errors generated by each of our osse experiments we focus our error analysis on variables that feature variability over a wide range of scales 100 m temperature ssh and mld we provide errors in time with depth and in the wavenumber spectral domain the focus of the study is to test the analysis skill improvement when using simulated swot observations in a multi scale assimilation system as opposed to a single scale system another important goal is to test the optimal set of observations used in the second analysis step nadir altimeter observations are coarse in the across track direction however our results suggest that it is still appropriate to include these data in the small scale correction 2 methods in this section we detail the construction of an osse framework to test how well a multi scale analysis system can improve the assimilation of simulated swot observations several components are necessary a numerical model simulated observations and an assimilation system this section describes each component and how it was used in conjunction with one another to produce the results presented in section 3 2 1 numerical model the navy coastal ocean model ncom barron et al 2006 produced our simulated three dimensional ocean fields ncom integrates the primitive equations forward in time using a leapfrog approach the dynamics utilize hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the vertical coordinate is a hybrid σ z grid the experimentation presented here used 50 vertical levels at rest the surface sigma layer is approximately 1 m thick and layer thicknesses steadily increase to a maximum depth of 4000 m in the horizontal the grid spacing was set to 1 km this resolution being an important threshold for simulating the full mesoscale field as well as submesoscale eddies with length scales o 10 km capet et al 2008 a double nesting procedure provided lateral boundary conditions to the final 1 km grid firstly the global 1 12 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom metzger et al 2017 provided boundary conditions to a 3 km ncom simulation with boundaries at least 3 away from the final 1 km ncom grid on all sides the 3 km ncom simulation then provided boundary conditions to the final 1 km ncom simulation surface forcing was provided by the navy global environment model navgem hogan et al 2014 and included surface wind stress latent heat flux sensible heat flux solar radiation and precipitation the navgem data have 3 hourly output and approximately 37 km grid spacing a monthly climatology river database barron and smedstad 2002 provided fresh water flows to the ocean boundaries finally tidal forcing from the global oregon tidal inverse solution otis egbert and erofeeva 2002 was included along the open boundaries for just the 1 km nested simulation using these model parameters we simulated the western pacific ocean 116 e 133 e 18 n 34 n fig 1 a region of substantial mesoscale submesoscale and internal wave variability this is due in part to the strong kuroshio boundary current that runs through the region additionally the domain features strong barotropic tides that interact with the shelf break to produce strong internal tides that propagate into the open ocean and interact with variable vertical stratification set primarily by the mesoscale field these interacting dynamics make ocean state estimation and prediction challenging and therefore represents an interesting region to study the utility of the multi scale assimilation system the 1 km ncom simulation without data assimilation generated the nature run the 3 km ncom simulation on december 1 2015 interpolated spatially provided the initial condition for the nature run we then integrated the nature run forward to december 31 2016 the 3 km initial condition lacked many of the smaller scale dynamics we are targeting in our multi scale assimilation so the one month spin up in december 2015 was conducted to allow for these small scale features to properly develop this was confirmed visually by comparing the surface eddy kinetic energy eke of the 3 km initial condition to the eke field generated by the end of the spin up on december 31 2015 it was also confirmed quantitatively by a clear linear trend in increasing eke of 0 0014 m 2 s 2 per day over the month of december 2015 with the eke plateauing near the very beginning of january results are not shown here a more detailed validation of the nature run can be found in d addezio et al 2019 not accounting for the spin up month the final time window for the nature run was january 1 2016 december 31 2016 fig 1 shows a diverse interaction of large and small scales making the nature run simulation useful for the multi scale state estimation problem we are trying to solve each osse was perturbed by using a different initial condition from the nature run more specifically the december 1 2016 nature run state was used as the initial condition for each of the osse experiments on december 1 2015 the boundary conditions surface forcing and model parameters used for the nature run were also those used for the osse experiments each osse simulation was integrated forward without data assimilation for the month of december 2015 this extra one month spin up allowed each experiment to develop significant differences from the nature run trajectory such that simulated observations correct the respective osse state towards the truth starting january 1 2016 each osse was integrated forward in time after assimilation by either the single or multi scale analysis using simulated observations sampled from the nature run an analysis field single scale or multi scale was generated every 24 h at 00z throughout the experiments the way in which those simulated observations were generated and assimilated is documented in the remainder of section 2 2 2 simulated observations sampling of the nature run over january 1 2016 december 31 2016 provided simulated observations of sea surface temperature sst in situ depth profiles nadir altimeters and swot real world observation times and locations provided realistic sampling of the nature run for sst in situ profile and nadir altimeter observations the nadir altimeters included jason 2 altika and cryosat 2 to generate simulated swot data we used version 2 0 0 of the jet propulsion laboratory s jpl swot simulator gaultier et al 2016 to provide times and locations at which we sampled the nature run the swot simulator sampled instantaneous not time averaged 3 hourly output of the nature run the swot simulator along and across track resolutions were 2 km the default for the simulator the operational navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system uses improved synthetic ocean profile isop to convert ssh observations into climatology based subsurface temperature and salinity helber et al 2013 the conversion uses historical profile observations to build the covariances between ssh anomalies and subsurface temperature and salinity naturally errors are induced in the process of constructing the synthetic profiles an example of isop temperature and salinity error distributions for the region and time frame used in this paper are demonstrated in d addezio et al 2019 see their figure 10 our interest is in the spatial resolution effects and not necessarily the effects of the synthetic profile errors therefore we extracted temperature and salinity profiles from the nature run at the nadir altimeter and swot geographic locations and times by sampling the nature run subsurface temperature and salinity at the nadir altimeter and swot locations and times we mimic how ssh observations are assimilated operationally using isop and bypass errors associated with the synthetic generation process tidal harmonics were not filtered from the sampled temperature and salinity observations the presence of tides in these data will primarily manifest in the form of baroclinic tides produced when barotropic tides interact with bathymetry in the presence of vertical stratification eddies and waves can become superimposed phenomena at smaller scales chavanne et al 2010 therefore this will be an additional source of error in our osse configuration as the assimilation system used here single scale or multi scale targets eddy features primarily in geostrophic balance and not internal waves this replacement of ssh anomalies with temperature and salinity profiles does limit the osse realism allowing us to only determine the impact of the data density and not the overall effects of all error sources in the full prediction process therefore our results are idealized and the specific skill we demonstrate may not be representative of real world applications our focus is on comparing and contrasting skill when using different assimilation systems single scale vs multi scale and different observations types nadir altimeters vs swot therefore the exclusion of simulated error does not preclude this analysis 2 3 data assimilation 2 3 1 single scale data assimilation the single scale data assimilation system used in this study is the 3dvar built into ncoda cummings 2005 ncoda 3dvar minimizes the following incremental cost function 1 j δ x 1 2 δ x t b 1 δ x 1 2 h δ x d t r 1 h δ x d in the cost function eq 1 δ x is the incremental state variable hereafter referred to as the increment defined as δ x x x b where x is the state vector and x b is the background state vector which in this case is a prior forecast from the numerical model described in section 2 1 b is the matrix of error covariance associated with the background state vector d is the innovation defined as d y o h x b where y o is the observation vector h is the observation operator that maps the model state vector to the observation and r is the observation error covariance ncoda 3dvar carries the minimization out in the observation space also known as dual space by solving the following linear system 2 δ x a b h t hb h t r 1 d ncoda 3dvar also separates the background error covariance for each model variable into the background error variance and the background error correlation as 3 b σ c σ t where σ 2 is the variance and c is the correlation matrix c is further decomposed into vertical horizontal and flow dependent components 4 c x y z x y z c h x y x y c v z z c f x y x y where x y z and x y z are the locations of the two points between which the correlation is required c h is the horizontal correlation c v is the vertical correlation and c f is the flow dependent correlation we focus on c h as it is the key to the definition of the correlation for different horizontal scales we refer the reader to cummings 2005 for more details on the other terms of the correlation as well as the cross correlation in ncoda 3dvar ncoda 3dvar models c h as a second order auto regressive soar function 5 c h x y x y 1 s l c e s l c where s x x y y is the distance between the points x y and x y and l c is the prescribed decorrelation length scale ncoda 3dvar defines the decorrelation length scale as the first local baroclinic rossby radius of deformation scaled by a proportionality constant for the single scale assimilation experiments in this paper that proportionality constant was set to 1 2 specifically because this default value is known to produce good results in ncoda 3dvar ncoda 3dvar computes the background error variance from a time history of analyzed model increments with a relaxation to the climatology defined variance cummings 2005 jacobs et al 2014a with the horizontal decorrelation length scale set close to the rossby radius of deformation the data assimilation process corrects for features of the order of the mesoscale this is consistent with the effective resolution of nadir altimetry in the across track direction and in situ profile data currently available ballarotta et al 2019 see their figure 8 future observations such as those from the swot mission will allow for corrections to the background state at higher resolution than mesoscale with the assumption of uncorrelated observation errors and in the presence of high density of observations the quality of analysis may decrease as shown by liu and rabier 2002 for that reason it is often necessary to reduce the density of observations to assimilate the size of the system to solve is a function of the number of observations to assimilate and the computational cost is a function of the size of the system also redundant in the sense of the decorrelation length scale observations affect the conditioning of the system and adds to the computational cost resulting in slow convergence in the presence of round off error in ncoda the reduction of the number of observations to assimilate commonly known as observation thinning uses the local decorrelation length scale to control the density of the observations to assimilate the larger the decorrelation length scale the smaller the spatial density of kept observations going into the minimization likewise the smaller the decorrelation length scale the larger the spatial density of kept observations going into the minimization consequently the proportionality constant used in conjunction with the rossby radius of deformation to define the decorrelation length scale indirectly defines the density of observations to assimilate thus it was used in the multi scale experiments presented in this paper to define the density of observations going into the analysis for each scale ncoda uses two thinning methods super obing and selection thinning by super obing combines many observations in a given area by weighted averaging or other methods to make one single observation called the super observation in this experiment the super obing technique is applied to sst observations whereby all sst observations over a decorrelation length scale are averaged into a single value thinning by selection selects one observation among other observations in a given area in this experiment thinning by selection within a decorrelation length scale was used for profile observations because we have substituted nadir altimeter and swot ssh observations for temperature and salinity profiles see section 2 2 thinning by selection also applied to these data types thinning as described in this paragraph is the approach used by ncoda some state of the art thinning methods can be found in gratton et al 2015 liu and rabier 2002 li et al 2010 and ochotta et al 2005 we define the assimilation window as the past looking period over which we collected observations to be assimilated the ncoda default assimilation windows are 120 h 5 days for ssh 288 h 12 days for profiles and 24 h 1 day for sst these values were derived empirically through rigorous testing e g jacobs et al 2014a b as described in section 2 2 we used profiles as proxies for ssh observations and the assimilation window for this group of profiles was set to the 5 days like observations from present nadir altimeter satellites the innovation for sst used the first guess at appropriate time fgat meaning that the background is valid at the observation time fgat is useful for fitting phenomena with an essential time component such as diurnal warming fgat was not applied to any other observations types 2 3 2 multi scale data assimilation for the multi scale assimilation we follow the methodology of li et al 2015a and decompose the increment into 6 δ x δ x l δ x s where δ x l and δ x s denote the uncorrelated large and small scale components of δ x respectively with the mitigation of scale aliasing as suggested by li et al 2015a we compute the multi scale increments as 7 δ x l a b l h t h b l h t r l 1 d l 8 δ x s a b s h t h b s h t r s 1 d s the subscript l stands for large scale and the subscript s stands for small scale in the decomposition of δ x into large and small scale we assume there exist two linear operators p l and p s that can decompose the state vector into distinct uncorrelated spatial scales spatial filters and orthogonal decompositions are examples of such decomposition functions with the operators p l and p s the background x b and observation vector y o are also decomposed into their respective large and small scale components and are used to compute the large and small scale innovations d l y l o x l b and d s y s o x s b the choice of the decomposition operators p l and p s remains a challenge the best choice will certainly be application dependent for the purposes of this paper we leverage the filtering properties of the analysis equation eq 2 that has been used in operational data assimilation for decades a large decorrelation scale in the background error covariance imposes strong filtering on small scales in the analysis and therefore acts as a low pass filter daley 1991 li et al 2015a thus eq 2 using a large decorrelation scale results in a large scale increment the large scale filter p l is implicitly built into the analysis equation for the large scale therefore we do not know how to apply that operator to the background fields however we can estimate the small scale innovation given the large scale increment as follows 9 d s y o h x b δ x l a in fact by replacing the full observation vector and the full background by their decomposition into large and small scales the right hand side of eq 9 becomes y l o h x l b δ x l a y s o h x s b the term y l o h x l b δ x l a is negligible thanks to the correction from the large scale analysis as a result y o h x b δ x l a is an appropriate approximation of the small scale innovation with this observation vector we carry out two analyses in two sequential steps as follows 10 δ x l a b l h t h b l h t r l 1 d 11 δ x s a b s h t h b s h t r s 1 d s notice that the first step large scale analysis uses the full innovation we rely on the filtering properties of the analysis equation to produce the large scale increment the second step small scale analysis uses the small scale innovation from eq 9 this approach where the small scale innovation is computed from the background updated with the large scale increment is similar to the one used by carrier et al 2019 with 4dvar data assimilation for the large scale analysis we computed the background error variance from a time history of analyzed model increments with a relaxation to the climatology defined variance because of the lack of climatology at small scales this process is not possible for the small scale analysis instead from one step to the next we updated the background error variance to account for the correction from the previous step given the equation of the analysis error covariance 12 p a b b h t hb h t r 1 hb where p a is the analysis error covariance ncoda 3dvar provides an estimate of the diagonal variance in the form of a reduction of the forecast error cummings and smedstad 2013 the reduced background error from the first step becomes the background error variance for the second step the decorrelation scale in each step is proportional to the rossby deformation radius for the large and small scale corrections the proportionality constants were set to 1 2 and 0 5 respectively for the soar function used here these values translate to length scales of 23 km and 10 km jacobs et al 2020 see their table 1 for the small scale update the 10 km soar length scale corresponds with a gaussian length scale of approximately 30 km jacobs et al 2020 see their figure 3 this length scale being near the lowest wavelength effectively resolved by swot wang et al 2019 for the representativeness error in the observation we used the formulation embedded in ncoda 3dvar for both scales i e the same representation error is used in both large and small scale analysis steps it combines the climatology and the vertical gradient in the observed profiles cummings 2005 the second assimilation step targets small scale features and because of the transient nature of small scale features a relatively long assimilation window such as that used for the first step mesoscale correction is not appropriate through experimentation over a 31 day period we find that a 24 h assimilation window in the second small scale analysis step the same for all variables produces the best skill fig 2 these experiments all used the standard assimilation windows for the first analysis step see section 2 3 1 and only varied the length of the assimilation window of all variables in the second analysis step fig 2a compares the evolution of the region averaged ssh errors for the month of january 2016 it clearly shows that results degrade as the assimilation window increases in the second step fig 2b d show 500 m temperature increments for an assimilation window of 24 72 and 120 h respectively as the assimilation window increases more observations come into the system which results in a larger region with suboptimal increments this is an important result because prior multi scale formations have focused heavily on the spatial decomposition of scales the results shown in fig 2 suggest that there is also an essential temporal component to the multi scale assimilation problem we add the first step increment δ x l a in eq 10 to the background to compute innovations in the second step d s in eq 11 this ensures the second step begins with the large scale features corrected with the large scale features corrected in the first step the innovation in the second step will be more representative of smaller scales to account for fgat in the processing of sst observations we added the same increment to the 3 hourly forecast over the past 24 h this process assumes constant correction over the 24 h period which is consistent with the fgat process used to compute the innovation and is reasonable due to the slowly varying nature of the mesoscale features corrected by the first step a foundation sst was not used though this might be useful to apply in future work in order to better neglect the diurnal cycle present in the large scale update fig 3 shows the increments from a large scale analysis fig 3a and a small scale analysis fig 3b as well as the full multi scale increment fig 3c which is the sum of the two fig 3a and b suggest that the first analysis step corrects for the relatively large scale features while the second analysis step corrects for the relatively small features the summation of the two ensures that the final multi scale increment includes both large and small scale corrections which should therefore limit the scale aliasing of errors observed in prior work d addezio et al 2019 wavenumber spectral analysis of the resulting multi scale increments of 100 m temperature quantify the result fig 4 compared to the single scale increments the multi scale increments are adding information across the entire observed spectrum fig 4a the peak difference between the two updates occurs at 71 km fig 4b however even at 30 km scales the multi scale increments have approximately twice as much energy as the single scale increments therefore the multi scale assimilation is targeting features below approximately 100 km with significant energy extending into the small mesoscale and submesoscale regimes additionally we examined the realism of these increments by comparing their spectra to the spectrum of the true background errors nature run 24 h forecast minus osse 24 h forecast below 100 km the single scale increment was found to have power spectral density psd several orders of magnitude smaller than the psd of the true background errors results are not shown here this is the desired outcome the single scale increments are not introducing significant energy at scales primarily targeted by the second small scale update the full multi scale increment large scale increment small scale increment psd compared more closely with the psd of the true background errors at smaller scales 100 km but is also several orders of magnitude less than the psd at scales not targeted 20 km results are not shown here in order to generate the multi scale analysis field the full multi scale increment was added to the background over a 6 h hindcast period a 24 h forecast was then generated based on the 00z initial condition reached at the end of the hindcast a multi scale analysis was performed every 24 hours the results presented in the following section document the utility of this formulation of the multi scale assimilation 3 results after a one month spin up of each osse experiment during december 2015 assimilation of simulated observations from the nature run began on january 1 2016 an analysis field was generated every 24 h until june 30 2016 we compare analysis errors produced by single and multi scale experiments additionally we compare analysis errors generated by experiments that use the same assimilation configuration but assimilate different sets of data we begin our examination of the osse analysis errors with time series of 100 m temperature ssh and mld errors with respect to the nature run from january to june fig 5 each data point in the time series is the region averaged mean absolute error mae for grid points with at least 1000 m water depth the types of data assimilated in each osse are listed in table 1 the abbreviations ss and ms stand for single scale and multi scale respectively experiment names ending in reg mean only regular observations from the current observing network were assimilated nadir altimeters in situ profiles and sst experiment names ending all assimilated all of the observation types used in this paper nadir altimeters in situ profiles and sst and swot with respect to 100 m temperature and ssh the free run performs the poorest proving that the assimilation is adding skill for mld the assimilative experiments outperform the free run for a majority of the time series though improvement in skill is not universal the strong decline in error magnitudes starting in april are due to enhanced stratification and thus mixed layer shoaling during the summer months mld is a complicated variable with variability caused by relatively small scale surface forcing fronts and eddies jacobs et al 2014b this variable serves as the highest benchmark for osse performance the time series also show that the ss reg experiment has the second highest errors behind the free run this is followed by ms reg suggesting that even without the high resolution swot data a multi scale assimilation technique can extract useful additional information from the observations available in the regular observing network at the time of this writing all of the osses that utilize swot data even the single scale experiment ss all produce less error over the time series when compared to the previously described experiments this is encouraging as it suggests that the swot data are adding significant skill and is consistent with recent work bonaduce et al 2018 d addezio et al 2019 however it becomes difficult to distinguish between error magnitudes generated by each of the subsequent multi scale experiments clearly more sensitive metrics are required to evaluate potential performance increases brought about by the multi scale assimilation fig 6 shows time space averaged temperature errors with depth between january and june the averaging in space and time only includes grid points with at least 1000 m water depth as in the time series described above the temperature error depth profiles show that the free run ss reg and ms reg experiments have the highest errors in that order fig 6a the percent change in error with respect to the ss reg experiment fig 6b accentuates differences in error magnitudes firstly we observe that the ms reg experiment shows additional skill closer to the surface and then converges with the ss reg errors at depth this further suggests that the multi scale assimilation is useful even when utilizing only the current observing network the relatively large performance increase near the surface suggests that the high resolution sst is having the greatest impact in the second small scale update the next best experiment is ss all a single scale assimilation that utilizes the swot data compared to ms reg this experiment has slightly higher errors near the surface but has greater skill at depth thus even when using only a single scale analysis method the swot data are adding significant skill up to 10 compared to ss reg at some depths a more nuanced comparison of the multi scale experiments is now possible as well ms sst shows that assimilating only sst in the second analysis step adds additional skill over the top 100 m and errors converge to the ss all errors at greater depths this further suggests that the high resolution sst data available today have sufficient small scale information to enhance analysis skill over the top 100 m of the water column assimilating only swot data in the second analysis step ms swot shows improvement over the entire water column when compared with the ss all experiment however the ms sst experiment outperforms ms swot over the top 50 m of the water column using both the sst and swot data in the second analysis step ms sst swot shows improvement over the top 100 m of the water column and then converges with the ms swot experiment at greater depths finally the ms all experiment which assimilates all available data in the second analysis step outperforms all of the other osses this demonstrates that although the nadir altimeter data are coarse particularly in the across track direction there is sufficient small scale information within those observations to make an accurate small scale correction to the background state overall the mean error profiles are a clear demonstration that the multi scale analysis technique used here extracts useful small scale information from all of the data types tested another way to more finely differentiate the errors produced by each osse is to use wavenumber spectral analysis this method evaluates the wavelengths constrained by each experiment with respect to the nature run we follow d addezio et al 2019 by evaluating the osse error spectrum of each experiment in relation to the mean of the nature run and the respective osse spectra 13 ε o s s e γ n a t u r e γ o s s e where ε o s s e is the psd of the osse error nature minus osse γ n a t u r e is the psd of the nature run γ o s s e is the psd of the osse and the brackets denote the mean of the two spectra two dimensional psd was calculated over the square subregion shown in fig 1 at each analysis time between january and june the ensemble of psd was averaged in time finally the time averaged psd in k x k y space was averaged azimuthally along concentric circles of constant wavenumber k to generate a one dimensional spectrum richman et al 2012 eq 13 produces a normalized error spectrum with values ranging from 0 to 2 fig 7 a zero value means there is no error in the osse at a particular wavelength a value of 2 means that the osse has no skill in a particular wavelength in this case the osse and nature run spectra have zero correlation and the variance of the error is the summation of the variance in the osse and the nature run a value of 1 equates to a correlation of 0 5 between the osse and nature run fields and is used here as the threshold for whether or not the osse has skill in the time series fig 5 it is difficult to identify large differences between each of the experiments particularly with respect to mld using the normalized error spectra differences are more immediately apparent fig 7 in all three variables the free run and ss reg experiments reach the 1 threshold at much larger wavelengths unlike in the time series the effect is amplified for mld for 100 m temperature and mld the cascade of experiments reaching the 1 threshold correlates with the skill we observed in fig 6 free run ss reg ms reg ss all ms sst ms swot ms sst swot ms all the differentiation is less clear for ssh therefore it is helpful to document the exact wavelength each experiment crosses the 1 threshold this term being defined as the minimum constrained wavelength fig 8 for 100 m temperature fig 8a a clear progression of skill between the free run ss reg and ss all is apparent adding swot data within the single scale analysis reduces constrained scales from 124 km ss reg to 101 km ss all a reduction of 13 km moving into the multi scale experiments ms reg outperforms ss reg but underperforms ss all this again highlights both 1 the utility of the multi scale assimilation even when only using the current observing network and 2 the great benefit swot data will provide even in just a single scale assimilation the ms sst experiment produces a result comparable to the ss all this is expected when considering the results shown in fig 6 in the mean temperature errors over depth the sst data only affect assimilation skill down to approximately 100 m where the skill then converges with the ss all results adding the swot data to the second analysis step reduces constrained scales from 101 km ss all to 86 km ms swot a reduction of 15 km again adding sst data to the second analysis step ms sst swot does little to improve the skill for 100 m temperature as was shown in the mean depth temperature errors fig 6 finally using all available data in the multi scale assimilation reduces constrained scales from 101 km ss all to 80 km ms all a reduction of 21 km this is a clear demonstration of the utility of the multi scale assimilation technique it allows the extraction of additional information from the dense swot observations discarded by the single scale analysis for ssh the multi scale results are less dramatic fig 8b all of the assimilative experiments significantly outperform the free run the single scale analysis utilizing the swot data reduces constrained scales from 80 km ss reg to 73 km ss all a reduction of 7 km however the multi scale experiments do not provide substantial increases in ssh skill the ssh spectrum for this region is steep k 4 fig 9 suggesting that a strong majority of ssh variance is concentrated at long wavelengths thus the small scale corrections provided by the second analysis step have less impact on the ssh field precisely because there is less variability at smaller scales this phenomenon is explored more fully in section 4 finally for mld reductions in the minimum constrained wavelengths are more comparable to those observed for 100 m temperature fig 8c for the free run mld is the least constrained variable of the three under consideration again mld is a difficult parameter to constrain assimilating simulated nadir altimeter data reduces constrained scales from 537 km free run to 207 km ss reg a reduction of 330 km adding swot observations in the single scale analysis reduces constrained scales from 207 km ss reg to 158 km ss all a reduction of 49 km moving onto the multi scale experiments performing a multi scale analysis using only the regular observations reduces constrained scales from 207 ss reg to 194 km ms reg a reduction of 13 km the ms sst osse surprisingly performs slightly worse than the ss all experiment the mld is 100 m in this region so the small scale sst information should be having an impact on mld analysis accuracy an additional metric is required to fully quantify this phenomenon calculating the ratios of the integrated spectra in eq 13 shows assimilation skill over all of the observed wavelengths 14 k m i n k n y q u i s t ε o s s e d k k m i n k n y q u i s t γ n a t u r e γ o s s e d k where k denotes wavenumbers k min is the minimum resolvedwavenumber 1 640 km 1 and k nyquist is the nyquist wavenumber 1 2 km 1 the ratios for each experiment and each variable are shown in table 2 as with eq 13 the possible values extend from 0 perfect skill to 2 no skill this metric shows that over all observed wavelengths the ms sst experiment slightly outperforms the ss all experiment with respect to mld this is because while the ms sst experiment crosses the 1 threshold at a longer wavelength than the ss all experiment the ms sst experiment has greater skill at smaller wavelengths 110 km 40 km fig 7 although above the skill threshold we have established for the minimum constrained wavelength table 2 confirms that including sst in the second analysis step does in fact provide some additional mld skill at smaller wavelengths adding only swot to the second analysis step continues the improvement by reducing constrained scales from 158 km ss all to 142 km ms swot a reduction of 16 km the ms sst swot experiment is slightly worse compared to the ms swot experiment with respect to the minimum constrained wavelength fig 8c but slightly better when integrated across the entire spectrum table 2 finally assimilating all data using the multi scale approach reduces constrained scales from 158 km ss all to 122 km ms all a reduction of 36 km overall the wavenumber spectral results show a clear improvement in analysis skill when adding more observations and by transitioning to a multi scale assimilation system 4 discussion and conclusions we have shown that the two step multi scale assimilation produces a better analysis than a single scale assimilation this result is consistent across all of the experiments each of which assimilated different sets of data in the second analysis step we summarize the findings by focusing on the three most pertinent experiments ss reg ss all and ms all the first is a representation of single scale analysis skill available today using a constellation of nadir altimeters ss all suggests how a single scale analysis will perform when swot data become available finally ms all is an estimate of multi scale skill when swot data are available for assimilation time series of mld errors for these three experiments are shown in fig 10a these data suggest a clear progression of skill adding swot observations to a single scale analysis outperforms the nadir altimeter only single scale analysis and the multi scale analysis adds additional skill by utilizing smaller scale information in the dense swot data recall that mld is the least accurately constrained variable of those tested here figs 7 and 8 making the consistent 2 m skill improvement provided by the multi scale analysis substantial with depth the same progression of skill is noted fig 10b further highlighting the utility of the multi scale analysis we are exploiting the minimum constrained wavelength for each of the tested variables 100 m temperature ssh and mld is lower moving from ss reg to ss all to ms all fig 11 however the rate of decline in the minimum constrained wavelength is different for each of the three variables for ssh the multi scale assimilation of all data reduces constrained scales from 80 km ss reg to 72 km ms all a relatively small reduction of 8 km in contrast the decline for mld is steep the multi scale assimilation of all data reduces constrained scales from 207 km ss reg to 122 km ms all a relatively large reduction of 85 km the results for 100 m temperature sit between the two other variables this phenomenon is caused by the scale dependent variability each variable has fig 9 ssh has a very steep spectral slope of 4 4 suggesting that a strong majority of ssh variability is concentrated at long wavelengths mld however has a relatively flat spectral slope of 2 6 suggesting that mld has relatively high concentrations of variability at smaller wavelengths 100 m temperature has an intermediate slope of 3 9 thus the multi scale analysis preferentially adds skill for variables that have relatively large variance at smaller wavelengths e g mld the multi scale analysis is less beneficial for a variable like ssh because the first large scale update to the background has already corrected a strong majority of the signal this is an important consideration for users as data become denser and state estimation targets smaller scale phenomena tuning around parameters such as ssh will become less useful a well tuned single scale analysis will fare well for these larger scale parameters evaluation of multi scale skill should focus on variables with sufficient small scale variability such as mld and gradient fields e g divergence using an osse framework we estimated the utility of a multi scale assimilation system specifically our aim was to test how dense swot observations can be further utilized in the assimilation process d addezio et al 2019 showed that a single scale assimilation of the high resolution swot observations biases errors into either large or small scales depending on the length scale of the background error covariance i e ncoda scaling factors of 1 2 vs 0 5 the multi scale system tested here is capable of making an accurate small scale update without sacrificing skill at larger scales we also showed that data from the historical observing network in situ profiles sst and nadir altimeter contain sufficient small scale information to reduce errors in a multi scale analysis ms reg when compared to a single scale analysis ss reg therefore our results suggest that the adoption of multi scale assimilation methodologies need not wait for swot data to arrive in 2021 the results presented here are idealized our osses used the same dynamical model surface forcing tidal forcing and boundary conditions used by the nature run a simplification that does not allow one to quantify how model parameters affect prediction skill when utilizing the new swot observations and the multi scale assimilation atlas 1997 subsurface temperature and salinity were assimilated at the geographic locations and times ssh observations were taken this mimics the operational approach used by ncoda smith et al 2015 for projecting surface information through synthetics isop helber et al 2013 as routinely used in systems such as the us navy operational global ocean prediction system metzger et al 2014 however the perfect subsurface temperature and salinity data that were assimilated have led to overly optimistic values of analysis skill therefore here we have simply compared the accuracy of the single scale and multi scale analyses using the same data small ssh psd at small wavelengths fig 9 causes an additional isop issue difficult to quantify using our methodology in a more realistic application an ssh innovation background minus observation is passed to isop when moving to the second small scale analysis that innovation is a residual from the large scale analysis made in the first step eq 9 the strong decline in ssh psd at small wavelengths suggests that this innovation will have low magnitude causing isop to make a relatively small correction to the temperature and salinity depth profile in reality parts of the water column may still have significant errors e g very near surface with a variable mixed layer the totality of these simplifications ensures that real world error levels will be higher than those demonstrated in this paper the results suggest some potential avenues for future research firstly the ocean cannot be simply decomposed into two uncorrelated spatial scales as is assumed by our theoretical foundation li et al 2015a ocean spectra are continuous across all scales fig 9 ideally all scales resolved by the observations and model should be corrected our approach generates small scale innovations based on the prior large scale analysis theoretically one could correct downscale more finely until the innovations approach zero i e all scales have been corrected one might even add additional large scale steps above the 1 2 scaling factor we have used here for our first analysis step however there are potential hazards to adding more analysis steps that are more correlated across scale if one does not know an approximate lower limit to the horizontal scales resolved by the observations one could find innovations at very small scales that are essentially manufactured representation errors i e the observations not resolving modeled features this effect was demonstrated in li et al 2015a this formulation also likely requires more representative background and observation error covariances as only rudimentary assumptions about both were made here additionally one might derive an accurate innovation but the resulting increment might be spread over scales uncorrelated with the small scale background errors one is targeting in our case the second order auto regressive soar function is very broad in spectral space jacobs et al 2020 see their figure 3 this would lead to inappropriate corrections at larger scales when moving the assimilation downscale the multi scale process might also be further segmented in time some small scale phenomena have significant variability on temporal scales below the 24 h we have used here for our small scale assimilation window one might make a series of small scale corrections over smaller subsets of time e g 6 h to account for this effect because of this temporal effect a multi scale 4dvar could be an even more effective approach carrier et al 2019 finally the proper representation of physics in the multi scale update should be addressed current variational schemes typically rely on assumed dynamical balances e g geostrophy in the assimilation process even 4dvar which uses linearized model physics to extend the static background error covariance often includes a balance operator in order to generate a smooth analysis field the assumptions used in these balance operators are typically mesoscale oriented in addition the vertical relations amongst variables is assumed to be similar within the two steps of the multi scale analysis and is probably a shortcoming that inhibits greater skill moving forward these assumptions will require modification small mesoscales submesoscales and internal waves do not follow dynamics appropriate for the large scale slowly evolving mesoscale field d addezio et al 2020 as models and observations continue to resolve finer scales this representation issue will become increasingly important a more sophisticated multi scale assimilation should take into account not only characteristic length scales but also the dynamics appropriate for those respective scales the emerging multi physics problem is therefore an important frontier in ocean state

23946,we use an observing system simulation experiment osse to quantify improvements in ocean state estimation due to the assimilation of simulated surface water ocean topography swot observations using a multi scale 3dvar approach the sequential multi scale assimilation first generates a large scale analysis and then updates that analysis with smaller scale corrections since we use temperature and salinity depth profiles as proxies for sea surface height ssh observations the results are idealized skill metrics consistently show that the multi scale analysis is superior to the single scale analysis specifically because it improves small scale skill without sacrificing skill at larger scales the analysis skill over a range of spatial scales is determined using wavenumber spectral analysis of 100 m temperature ssh and mixed layer depth mld for mld the multi scale assimilation of swot data reduces the minimum constrained wavelength from 158 km to 122 km a 36 km reduction compared to a single scale assimilation of the same data for ssh the multi scale approach only reduces constrained scales from 73 km to 72 km a 1 km reduction this small increase in skill is caused by the steep wavenumber spectral slope associated with ssh which suggests that ssh variability is concentrated at long wavelengths ultimately the small scale update in the multi scale assimilation has less to correct for ssh in contrast mld has a relatively flat spectral slope the multi scale solution can make a more substantial update to the mld field because it has more small scale variability thus our results suggest that the magnitude of the skill improvement provided by the multi scale solution is negatively correlated with the spectral slope of the ocean variable keywords data assimilation modeling multi scale swot 3dvar 1 introduction for decades the scientific and operational oceanographic communities have relied heavily upon nadir altimeters to provide mesoscale surface elevation observations mesoscale being defined as large scale eddies with length scales greater than the local rossby radius of deformation ranging from 10 km to 100 km depending on latitude chelton et al 1998 the height observations are then used to generate surface maps resolving sea surface height ssh to global average wavelengths of approximately 150 km and greater ducet et al 2000 fu and ubelmann 2014 ballarotta et al 2019 in 2021 the surface water ocean topography swot satellite mission fu and ubelmann 2014 will provide global surface elevation over a high density 120 km wide swath this new data source should produce much greater coverage of the mesoscale field as well as submesoscales on a regional basis wang et al 2019 recent studies have quantified the potential impact that swot data will have on ocean state estimation and prediction skill carrier et al 2016 bonaduce et al 2018 d addezio et al 2019 using observing system simulation experiment osse methodologies these studies found significant improvements in skill when assimilating simulated swot data but also found that each forecast analysis system could not constrain wavelengths below 100 km despite the fact that swot observations resolve these scales gaultier et al 2016 wang et al 2019 experimenting with the analysis decorrelation length scale d addezio et al 2019 concluded that multi scale data assimilation was required to fully utilize the swot observations here we verify that hypothesis by testing a multi scale 3dvar system in a high resolution 1 km simulation of the western pacific ocean fig 1 we find that the sequential multi scale analysis consistently outperforms the single scale analysis more precisely when compared with the single scale assimilation the multi scale assimilation reduces the constrained scales by 21 km and 36 km for 100 m temperature and mixed layer depth mld respectively multi scale assimilation methodologies have recently emerged to deal with observing networks that provide information on a wide range of scales muscarella et al 2014 li et al 2015a b miyazawa et al 2017 li et al 2019 for example glider data can observe the subsurface at very high spatial and temporal resolutions if the assimilation system is tuned to primarily correct large scale features e g mesoscale eddies those high resolution observations may be underutilized at smaller scales the relative sparsity of ocean observations creates a desire to maximize the utility of all available observations a glider specific case has been addressed by performing a multi step 4dvar analysis whereby large scale corrections were made to a background state in the first assimilation step followed by an update to that analysis field using small scale innovation background minus observations residuals carrier et al 2019 this is similar to how multi scale 3dvar has been previously implemented li et al 2015a b 2019 here we follow that tradition by implementing a two step 3dvar analysis in which the first step makes a large scale correction to the model background and the second step makes a small scale correction to the first step the multi scale assimilation is tested using an osse methodology whereby simulated observations are sampled from a free running model simulation the nature run a second model assimilates the simulated observations and we compare the second model to the nature run to evaluate errors e g halliwell et al 2014 section 2 details the configuration of our multi scale assimilation system the primary multi scale 3dvar parameter is the decorrelation length scale of the background error covariance but we also explore a temporal component the length of the small scale assimilation window the assimilation window is the length of time that observations are allowed into the data assimilation analysis the large scale analysis uses a 5 day assimilation window to correct the slowly evolving mesoscale field we show that because the smaller scale phenomena are transient the small scale update to the model background requires a shorter assimilation window section 3 documents errors generated by each of our osse experiments we focus our error analysis on variables that feature variability over a wide range of scales 100 m temperature ssh and mld we provide errors in time with depth and in the wavenumber spectral domain the focus of the study is to test the analysis skill improvement when using simulated swot observations in a multi scale assimilation system as opposed to a single scale system another important goal is to test the optimal set of observations used in the second analysis step nadir altimeter observations are coarse in the across track direction however our results suggest that it is still appropriate to include these data in the small scale correction 2 methods in this section we detail the construction of an osse framework to test how well a multi scale analysis system can improve the assimilation of simulated swot observations several components are necessary a numerical model simulated observations and an assimilation system this section describes each component and how it was used in conjunction with one another to produce the results presented in section 3 2 1 numerical model the navy coastal ocean model ncom barron et al 2006 produced our simulated three dimensional ocean fields ncom integrates the primitive equations forward in time using a leapfrog approach the dynamics utilize hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations the vertical coordinate is a hybrid σ z grid the experimentation presented here used 50 vertical levels at rest the surface sigma layer is approximately 1 m thick and layer thicknesses steadily increase to a maximum depth of 4000 m in the horizontal the grid spacing was set to 1 km this resolution being an important threshold for simulating the full mesoscale field as well as submesoscale eddies with length scales o 10 km capet et al 2008 a double nesting procedure provided lateral boundary conditions to the final 1 km grid firstly the global 1 12 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom metzger et al 2017 provided boundary conditions to a 3 km ncom simulation with boundaries at least 3 away from the final 1 km ncom grid on all sides the 3 km ncom simulation then provided boundary conditions to the final 1 km ncom simulation surface forcing was provided by the navy global environment model navgem hogan et al 2014 and included surface wind stress latent heat flux sensible heat flux solar radiation and precipitation the navgem data have 3 hourly output and approximately 37 km grid spacing a monthly climatology river database barron and smedstad 2002 provided fresh water flows to the ocean boundaries finally tidal forcing from the global oregon tidal inverse solution otis egbert and erofeeva 2002 was included along the open boundaries for just the 1 km nested simulation using these model parameters we simulated the western pacific ocean 116 e 133 e 18 n 34 n fig 1 a region of substantial mesoscale submesoscale and internal wave variability this is due in part to the strong kuroshio boundary current that runs through the region additionally the domain features strong barotropic tides that interact with the shelf break to produce strong internal tides that propagate into the open ocean and interact with variable vertical stratification set primarily by the mesoscale field these interacting dynamics make ocean state estimation and prediction challenging and therefore represents an interesting region to study the utility of the multi scale assimilation system the 1 km ncom simulation without data assimilation generated the nature run the 3 km ncom simulation on december 1 2015 interpolated spatially provided the initial condition for the nature run we then integrated the nature run forward to december 31 2016 the 3 km initial condition lacked many of the smaller scale dynamics we are targeting in our multi scale assimilation so the one month spin up in december 2015 was conducted to allow for these small scale features to properly develop this was confirmed visually by comparing the surface eddy kinetic energy eke of the 3 km initial condition to the eke field generated by the end of the spin up on december 31 2015 it was also confirmed quantitatively by a clear linear trend in increasing eke of 0 0014 m 2 s 2 per day over the month of december 2015 with the eke plateauing near the very beginning of january results are not shown here a more detailed validation of the nature run can be found in d addezio et al 2019 not accounting for the spin up month the final time window for the nature run was january 1 2016 december 31 2016 fig 1 shows a diverse interaction of large and small scales making the nature run simulation useful for the multi scale state estimation problem we are trying to solve each osse was perturbed by using a different initial condition from the nature run more specifically the december 1 2016 nature run state was used as the initial condition for each of the osse experiments on december 1 2015 the boundary conditions surface forcing and model parameters used for the nature run were also those used for the osse experiments each osse simulation was integrated forward without data assimilation for the month of december 2015 this extra one month spin up allowed each experiment to develop significant differences from the nature run trajectory such that simulated observations correct the respective osse state towards the truth starting january 1 2016 each osse was integrated forward in time after assimilation by either the single or multi scale analysis using simulated observations sampled from the nature run an analysis field single scale or multi scale was generated every 24 h at 00z throughout the experiments the way in which those simulated observations were generated and assimilated is documented in the remainder of section 2 2 2 simulated observations sampling of the nature run over january 1 2016 december 31 2016 provided simulated observations of sea surface temperature sst in situ depth profiles nadir altimeters and swot real world observation times and locations provided realistic sampling of the nature run for sst in situ profile and nadir altimeter observations the nadir altimeters included jason 2 altika and cryosat 2 to generate simulated swot data we used version 2 0 0 of the jet propulsion laboratory s jpl swot simulator gaultier et al 2016 to provide times and locations at which we sampled the nature run the swot simulator sampled instantaneous not time averaged 3 hourly output of the nature run the swot simulator along and across track resolutions were 2 km the default for the simulator the operational navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda system uses improved synthetic ocean profile isop to convert ssh observations into climatology based subsurface temperature and salinity helber et al 2013 the conversion uses historical profile observations to build the covariances between ssh anomalies and subsurface temperature and salinity naturally errors are induced in the process of constructing the synthetic profiles an example of isop temperature and salinity error distributions for the region and time frame used in this paper are demonstrated in d addezio et al 2019 see their figure 10 our interest is in the spatial resolution effects and not necessarily the effects of the synthetic profile errors therefore we extracted temperature and salinity profiles from the nature run at the nadir altimeter and swot geographic locations and times by sampling the nature run subsurface temperature and salinity at the nadir altimeter and swot locations and times we mimic how ssh observations are assimilated operationally using isop and bypass errors associated with the synthetic generation process tidal harmonics were not filtered from the sampled temperature and salinity observations the presence of tides in these data will primarily manifest in the form of baroclinic tides produced when barotropic tides interact with bathymetry in the presence of vertical stratification eddies and waves can become superimposed phenomena at smaller scales chavanne et al 2010 therefore this will be an additional source of error in our osse configuration as the assimilation system used here single scale or multi scale targets eddy features primarily in geostrophic balance and not internal waves this replacement of ssh anomalies with temperature and salinity profiles does limit the osse realism allowing us to only determine the impact of the data density and not the overall effects of all error sources in the full prediction process therefore our results are idealized and the specific skill we demonstrate may not be representative of real world applications our focus is on comparing and contrasting skill when using different assimilation systems single scale vs multi scale and different observations types nadir altimeters vs swot therefore the exclusion of simulated error does not preclude this analysis 2 3 data assimilation 2 3 1 single scale data assimilation the single scale data assimilation system used in this study is the 3dvar built into ncoda cummings 2005 ncoda 3dvar minimizes the following incremental cost function 1 j δ x 1 2 δ x t b 1 δ x 1 2 h δ x d t r 1 h δ x d in the cost function eq 1 δ x is the incremental state variable hereafter referred to as the increment defined as δ x x x b where x is the state vector and x b is the background state vector which in this case is a prior forecast from the numerical model described in section 2 1 b is the matrix of error covariance associated with the background state vector d is the innovation defined as d y o h x b where y o is the observation vector h is the observation operator that maps the model state vector to the observation and r is the observation error covariance ncoda 3dvar carries the minimization out in the observation space also known as dual space by solving the following linear system 2 δ x a b h t hb h t r 1 d ncoda 3dvar also separates the background error covariance for each model variable into the background error variance and the background error correlation as 3 b σ c σ t where σ 2 is the variance and c is the correlation matrix c is further decomposed into vertical horizontal and flow dependent components 4 c x y z x y z c h x y x y c v z z c f x y x y where x y z and x y z are the locations of the two points between which the correlation is required c h is the horizontal correlation c v is the vertical correlation and c f is the flow dependent correlation we focus on c h as it is the key to the definition of the correlation for different horizontal scales we refer the reader to cummings 2005 for more details on the other terms of the correlation as well as the cross correlation in ncoda 3dvar ncoda 3dvar models c h as a second order auto regressive soar function 5 c h x y x y 1 s l c e s l c where s x x y y is the distance between the points x y and x y and l c is the prescribed decorrelation length scale ncoda 3dvar defines the decorrelation length scale as the first local baroclinic rossby radius of deformation scaled by a proportionality constant for the single scale assimilation experiments in this paper that proportionality constant was set to 1 2 specifically because this default value is known to produce good results in ncoda 3dvar ncoda 3dvar computes the background error variance from a time history of analyzed model increments with a relaxation to the climatology defined variance cummings 2005 jacobs et al 2014a with the horizontal decorrelation length scale set close to the rossby radius of deformation the data assimilation process corrects for features of the order of the mesoscale this is consistent with the effective resolution of nadir altimetry in the across track direction and in situ profile data currently available ballarotta et al 2019 see their figure 8 future observations such as those from the swot mission will allow for corrections to the background state at higher resolution than mesoscale with the assumption of uncorrelated observation errors and in the presence of high density of observations the quality of analysis may decrease as shown by liu and rabier 2002 for that reason it is often necessary to reduce the density of observations to assimilate the size of the system to solve is a function of the number of observations to assimilate and the computational cost is a function of the size of the system also redundant in the sense of the decorrelation length scale observations affect the conditioning of the system and adds to the computational cost resulting in slow convergence in the presence of round off error in ncoda the reduction of the number of observations to assimilate commonly known as observation thinning uses the local decorrelation length scale to control the density of the observations to assimilate the larger the decorrelation length scale the smaller the spatial density of kept observations going into the minimization likewise the smaller the decorrelation length scale the larger the spatial density of kept observations going into the minimization consequently the proportionality constant used in conjunction with the rossby radius of deformation to define the decorrelation length scale indirectly defines the density of observations to assimilate thus it was used in the multi scale experiments presented in this paper to define the density of observations going into the analysis for each scale ncoda uses two thinning methods super obing and selection thinning by super obing combines many observations in a given area by weighted averaging or other methods to make one single observation called the super observation in this experiment the super obing technique is applied to sst observations whereby all sst observations over a decorrelation length scale are averaged into a single value thinning by selection selects one observation among other observations in a given area in this experiment thinning by selection within a decorrelation length scale was used for profile observations because we have substituted nadir altimeter and swot ssh observations for temperature and salinity profiles see section 2 2 thinning by selection also applied to these data types thinning as described in this paragraph is the approach used by ncoda some state of the art thinning methods can be found in gratton et al 2015 liu and rabier 2002 li et al 2010 and ochotta et al 2005 we define the assimilation window as the past looking period over which we collected observations to be assimilated the ncoda default assimilation windows are 120 h 5 days for ssh 288 h 12 days for profiles and 24 h 1 day for sst these values were derived empirically through rigorous testing e g jacobs et al 2014a b as described in section 2 2 we used profiles as proxies for ssh observations and the assimilation window for this group of profiles was set to the 5 days like observations from present nadir altimeter satellites the innovation for sst used the first guess at appropriate time fgat meaning that the background is valid at the observation time fgat is useful for fitting phenomena with an essential time component such as diurnal warming fgat was not applied to any other observations types 2 3 2 multi scale data assimilation for the multi scale assimilation we follow the methodology of li et al 2015a and decompose the increment into 6 δ x δ x l δ x s where δ x l and δ x s denote the uncorrelated large and small scale components of δ x respectively with the mitigation of scale aliasing as suggested by li et al 2015a we compute the multi scale increments as 7 δ x l a b l h t h b l h t r l 1 d l 8 δ x s a b s h t h b s h t r s 1 d s the subscript l stands for large scale and the subscript s stands for small scale in the decomposition of δ x into large and small scale we assume there exist two linear operators p l and p s that can decompose the state vector into distinct uncorrelated spatial scales spatial filters and orthogonal decompositions are examples of such decomposition functions with the operators p l and p s the background x b and observation vector y o are also decomposed into their respective large and small scale components and are used to compute the large and small scale innovations d l y l o x l b and d s y s o x s b the choice of the decomposition operators p l and p s remains a challenge the best choice will certainly be application dependent for the purposes of this paper we leverage the filtering properties of the analysis equation eq 2 that has been used in operational data assimilation for decades a large decorrelation scale in the background error covariance imposes strong filtering on small scales in the analysis and therefore acts as a low pass filter daley 1991 li et al 2015a thus eq 2 using a large decorrelation scale results in a large scale increment the large scale filter p l is implicitly built into the analysis equation for the large scale therefore we do not know how to apply that operator to the background fields however we can estimate the small scale innovation given the large scale increment as follows 9 d s y o h x b δ x l a in fact by replacing the full observation vector and the full background by their decomposition into large and small scales the right hand side of eq 9 becomes y l o h x l b δ x l a y s o h x s b the term y l o h x l b δ x l a is negligible thanks to the correction from the large scale analysis as a result y o h x b δ x l a is an appropriate approximation of the small scale innovation with this observation vector we carry out two analyses in two sequential steps as follows 10 δ x l a b l h t h b l h t r l 1 d 11 δ x s a b s h t h b s h t r s 1 d s notice that the first step large scale analysis uses the full innovation we rely on the filtering properties of the analysis equation to produce the large scale increment the second step small scale analysis uses the small scale innovation from eq 9 this approach where the small scale innovation is computed from the background updated with the large scale increment is similar to the one used by carrier et al 2019 with 4dvar data assimilation for the large scale analysis we computed the background error variance from a time history of analyzed model increments with a relaxation to the climatology defined variance because of the lack of climatology at small scales this process is not possible for the small scale analysis instead from one step to the next we updated the background error variance to account for the correction from the previous step given the equation of the analysis error covariance 12 p a b b h t hb h t r 1 hb where p a is the analysis error covariance ncoda 3dvar provides an estimate of the diagonal variance in the form of a reduction of the forecast error cummings and smedstad 2013 the reduced background error from the first step becomes the background error variance for the second step the decorrelation scale in each step is proportional to the rossby deformation radius for the large and small scale corrections the proportionality constants were set to 1 2 and 0 5 respectively for the soar function used here these values translate to length scales of 23 km and 10 km jacobs et al 2020 see their table 1 for the small scale update the 10 km soar length scale corresponds with a gaussian length scale of approximately 30 km jacobs et al 2020 see their figure 3 this length scale being near the lowest wavelength effectively resolved by swot wang et al 2019 for the representativeness error in the observation we used the formulation embedded in ncoda 3dvar for both scales i e the same representation error is used in both large and small scale analysis steps it combines the climatology and the vertical gradient in the observed profiles cummings 2005 the second assimilation step targets small scale features and because of the transient nature of small scale features a relatively long assimilation window such as that used for the first step mesoscale correction is not appropriate through experimentation over a 31 day period we find that a 24 h assimilation window in the second small scale analysis step the same for all variables produces the best skill fig 2 these experiments all used the standard assimilation windows for the first analysis step see section 2 3 1 and only varied the length of the assimilation window of all variables in the second analysis step fig 2a compares the evolution of the region averaged ssh errors for the month of january 2016 it clearly shows that results degrade as the assimilation window increases in the second step fig 2b d show 500 m temperature increments for an assimilation window of 24 72 and 120 h respectively as the assimilation window increases more observations come into the system which results in a larger region with suboptimal increments this is an important result because prior multi scale formations have focused heavily on the spatial decomposition of scales the results shown in fig 2 suggest that there is also an essential temporal component to the multi scale assimilation problem we add the first step increment δ x l a in eq 10 to the background to compute innovations in the second step d s in eq 11 this ensures the second step begins with the large scale features corrected with the large scale features corrected in the first step the innovation in the second step will be more representative of smaller scales to account for fgat in the processing of sst observations we added the same increment to the 3 hourly forecast over the past 24 h this process assumes constant correction over the 24 h period which is consistent with the fgat process used to compute the innovation and is reasonable due to the slowly varying nature of the mesoscale features corrected by the first step a foundation sst was not used though this might be useful to apply in future work in order to better neglect the diurnal cycle present in the large scale update fig 3 shows the increments from a large scale analysis fig 3a and a small scale analysis fig 3b as well as the full multi scale increment fig 3c which is the sum of the two fig 3a and b suggest that the first analysis step corrects for the relatively large scale features while the second analysis step corrects for the relatively small features the summation of the two ensures that the final multi scale increment includes both large and small scale corrections which should therefore limit the scale aliasing of errors observed in prior work d addezio et al 2019 wavenumber spectral analysis of the resulting multi scale increments of 100 m temperature quantify the result fig 4 compared to the single scale increments the multi scale increments are adding information across the entire observed spectrum fig 4a the peak difference between the two updates occurs at 71 km fig 4b however even at 30 km scales the multi scale increments have approximately twice as much energy as the single scale increments therefore the multi scale assimilation is targeting features below approximately 100 km with significant energy extending into the small mesoscale and submesoscale regimes additionally we examined the realism of these increments by comparing their spectra to the spectrum of the true background errors nature run 24 h forecast minus osse 24 h forecast below 100 km the single scale increment was found to have power spectral density psd several orders of magnitude smaller than the psd of the true background errors results are not shown here this is the desired outcome the single scale increments are not introducing significant energy at scales primarily targeted by the second small scale update the full multi scale increment large scale increment small scale increment psd compared more closely with the psd of the true background errors at smaller scales 100 km but is also several orders of magnitude less than the psd at scales not targeted 20 km results are not shown here in order to generate the multi scale analysis field the full multi scale increment was added to the background over a 6 h hindcast period a 24 h forecast was then generated based on the 00z initial condition reached at the end of the hindcast a multi scale analysis was performed every 24 hours the results presented in the following section document the utility of this formulation of the multi scale assimilation 3 results after a one month spin up of each osse experiment during december 2015 assimilation of simulated observations from the nature run began on january 1 2016 an analysis field was generated every 24 h until june 30 2016 we compare analysis errors produced by single and multi scale experiments additionally we compare analysis errors generated by experiments that use the same assimilation configuration but assimilate different sets of data we begin our examination of the osse analysis errors with time series of 100 m temperature ssh and mld errors with respect to the nature run from january to june fig 5 each data point in the time series is the region averaged mean absolute error mae for grid points with at least 1000 m water depth the types of data assimilated in each osse are listed in table 1 the abbreviations ss and ms stand for single scale and multi scale respectively experiment names ending in reg mean only regular observations from the current observing network were assimilated nadir altimeters in situ profiles and sst experiment names ending all assimilated all of the observation types used in this paper nadir altimeters in situ profiles and sst and swot with respect to 100 m temperature and ssh the free run performs the poorest proving that the assimilation is adding skill for mld the assimilative experiments outperform the free run for a majority of the time series though improvement in skill is not universal the strong decline in error magnitudes starting in april are due to enhanced stratification and thus mixed layer shoaling during the summer months mld is a complicated variable with variability caused by relatively small scale surface forcing fronts and eddies jacobs et al 2014b this variable serves as the highest benchmark for osse performance the time series also show that the ss reg experiment has the second highest errors behind the free run this is followed by ms reg suggesting that even without the high resolution swot data a multi scale assimilation technique can extract useful additional information from the observations available in the regular observing network at the time of this writing all of the osses that utilize swot data even the single scale experiment ss all produce less error over the time series when compared to the previously described experiments this is encouraging as it suggests that the swot data are adding significant skill and is consistent with recent work bonaduce et al 2018 d addezio et al 2019 however it becomes difficult to distinguish between error magnitudes generated by each of the subsequent multi scale experiments clearly more sensitive metrics are required to evaluate potential performance increases brought about by the multi scale assimilation fig 6 shows time space averaged temperature errors with depth between january and june the averaging in space and time only includes grid points with at least 1000 m water depth as in the time series described above the temperature error depth profiles show that the free run ss reg and ms reg experiments have the highest errors in that order fig 6a the percent change in error with respect to the ss reg experiment fig 6b accentuates differences in error magnitudes firstly we observe that the ms reg experiment shows additional skill closer to the surface and then converges with the ss reg errors at depth this further suggests that the multi scale assimilation is useful even when utilizing only the current observing network the relatively large performance increase near the surface suggests that the high resolution sst is having the greatest impact in the second small scale update the next best experiment is ss all a single scale assimilation that utilizes the swot data compared to ms reg this experiment has slightly higher errors near the surface but has greater skill at depth thus even when using only a single scale analysis method the swot data are adding significant skill up to 10 compared to ss reg at some depths a more nuanced comparison of the multi scale experiments is now possible as well ms sst shows that assimilating only sst in the second analysis step adds additional skill over the top 100 m and errors converge to the ss all errors at greater depths this further suggests that the high resolution sst data available today have sufficient small scale information to enhance analysis skill over the top 100 m of the water column assimilating only swot data in the second analysis step ms swot shows improvement over the entire water column when compared with the ss all experiment however the ms sst experiment outperforms ms swot over the top 50 m of the water column using both the sst and swot data in the second analysis step ms sst swot shows improvement over the top 100 m of the water column and then converges with the ms swot experiment at greater depths finally the ms all experiment which assimilates all available data in the second analysis step outperforms all of the other osses this demonstrates that although the nadir altimeter data are coarse particularly in the across track direction there is sufficient small scale information within those observations to make an accurate small scale correction to the background state overall the mean error profiles are a clear demonstration that the multi scale analysis technique used here extracts useful small scale information from all of the data types tested another way to more finely differentiate the errors produced by each osse is to use wavenumber spectral analysis this method evaluates the wavelengths constrained by each experiment with respect to the nature run we follow d addezio et al 2019 by evaluating the osse error spectrum of each experiment in relation to the mean of the nature run and the respective osse spectra 13 ε o s s e γ n a t u r e γ o s s e where ε o s s e is the psd of the osse error nature minus osse γ n a t u r e is the psd of the nature run γ o s s e is the psd of the osse and the brackets denote the mean of the two spectra two dimensional psd was calculated over the square subregion shown in fig 1 at each analysis time between january and june the ensemble of psd was averaged in time finally the time averaged psd in k x k y space was averaged azimuthally along concentric circles of constant wavenumber k to generate a one dimensional spectrum richman et al 2012 eq 13 produces a normalized error spectrum with values ranging from 0 to 2 fig 7 a zero value means there is no error in the osse at a particular wavelength a value of 2 means that the osse has no skill in a particular wavelength in this case the osse and nature run spectra have zero correlation and the variance of the error is the summation of the variance in the osse and the nature run a value of 1 equates to a correlation of 0 5 between the osse and nature run fields and is used here as the threshold for whether or not the osse has skill in the time series fig 5 it is difficult to identify large differences between each of the experiments particularly with respect to mld using the normalized error spectra differences are more immediately apparent fig 7 in all three variables the free run and ss reg experiments reach the 1 threshold at much larger wavelengths unlike in the time series the effect is amplified for mld for 100 m temperature and mld the cascade of experiments reaching the 1 threshold correlates with the skill we observed in fig 6 free run ss reg ms reg ss all ms sst ms swot ms sst swot ms all the differentiation is less clear for ssh therefore it is helpful to document the exact wavelength each experiment crosses the 1 threshold this term being defined as the minimum constrained wavelength fig 8 for 100 m temperature fig 8a a clear progression of skill between the free run ss reg and ss all is apparent adding swot data within the single scale analysis reduces constrained scales from 124 km ss reg to 101 km ss all a reduction of 13 km moving into the multi scale experiments ms reg outperforms ss reg but underperforms ss all this again highlights both 1 the utility of the multi scale assimilation even when only using the current observing network and 2 the great benefit swot data will provide even in just a single scale assimilation the ms sst experiment produces a result comparable to the ss all this is expected when considering the results shown in fig 6 in the mean temperature errors over depth the sst data only affect assimilation skill down to approximately 100 m where the skill then converges with the ss all results adding the swot data to the second analysis step reduces constrained scales from 101 km ss all to 86 km ms swot a reduction of 15 km again adding sst data to the second analysis step ms sst swot does little to improve the skill for 100 m temperature as was shown in the mean depth temperature errors fig 6 finally using all available data in the multi scale assimilation reduces constrained scales from 101 km ss all to 80 km ms all a reduction of 21 km this is a clear demonstration of the utility of the multi scale assimilation technique it allows the extraction of additional information from the dense swot observations discarded by the single scale analysis for ssh the multi scale results are less dramatic fig 8b all of the assimilative experiments significantly outperform the free run the single scale analysis utilizing the swot data reduces constrained scales from 80 km ss reg to 73 km ss all a reduction of 7 km however the multi scale experiments do not provide substantial increases in ssh skill the ssh spectrum for this region is steep k 4 fig 9 suggesting that a strong majority of ssh variance is concentrated at long wavelengths thus the small scale corrections provided by the second analysis step have less impact on the ssh field precisely because there is less variability at smaller scales this phenomenon is explored more fully in section 4 finally for mld reductions in the minimum constrained wavelengths are more comparable to those observed for 100 m temperature fig 8c for the free run mld is the least constrained variable of the three under consideration again mld is a difficult parameter to constrain assimilating simulated nadir altimeter data reduces constrained scales from 537 km free run to 207 km ss reg a reduction of 330 km adding swot observations in the single scale analysis reduces constrained scales from 207 km ss reg to 158 km ss all a reduction of 49 km moving onto the multi scale experiments performing a multi scale analysis using only the regular observations reduces constrained scales from 207 ss reg to 194 km ms reg a reduction of 13 km the ms sst osse surprisingly performs slightly worse than the ss all experiment the mld is 100 m in this region so the small scale sst information should be having an impact on mld analysis accuracy an additional metric is required to fully quantify this phenomenon calculating the ratios of the integrated spectra in eq 13 shows assimilation skill over all of the observed wavelengths 14 k m i n k n y q u i s t ε o s s e d k k m i n k n y q u i s t γ n a t u r e γ o s s e d k where k denotes wavenumbers k min is the minimum resolvedwavenumber 1 640 km 1 and k nyquist is the nyquist wavenumber 1 2 km 1 the ratios for each experiment and each variable are shown in table 2 as with eq 13 the possible values extend from 0 perfect skill to 2 no skill this metric shows that over all observed wavelengths the ms sst experiment slightly outperforms the ss all experiment with respect to mld this is because while the ms sst experiment crosses the 1 threshold at a longer wavelength than the ss all experiment the ms sst experiment has greater skill at smaller wavelengths 110 km 40 km fig 7 although above the skill threshold we have established for the minimum constrained wavelength table 2 confirms that including sst in the second analysis step does in fact provide some additional mld skill at smaller wavelengths adding only swot to the second analysis step continues the improvement by reducing constrained scales from 158 km ss all to 142 km ms swot a reduction of 16 km the ms sst swot experiment is slightly worse compared to the ms swot experiment with respect to the minimum constrained wavelength fig 8c but slightly better when integrated across the entire spectrum table 2 finally assimilating all data using the multi scale approach reduces constrained scales from 158 km ss all to 122 km ms all a reduction of 36 km overall the wavenumber spectral results show a clear improvement in analysis skill when adding more observations and by transitioning to a multi scale assimilation system 4 discussion and conclusions we have shown that the two step multi scale assimilation produces a better analysis than a single scale assimilation this result is consistent across all of the experiments each of which assimilated different sets of data in the second analysis step we summarize the findings by focusing on the three most pertinent experiments ss reg ss all and ms all the first is a representation of single scale analysis skill available today using a constellation of nadir altimeters ss all suggests how a single scale analysis will perform when swot data become available finally ms all is an estimate of multi scale skill when swot data are available for assimilation time series of mld errors for these three experiments are shown in fig 10a these data suggest a clear progression of skill adding swot observations to a single scale analysis outperforms the nadir altimeter only single scale analysis and the multi scale analysis adds additional skill by utilizing smaller scale information in the dense swot data recall that mld is the least accurately constrained variable of those tested here figs 7 and 8 making the consistent 2 m skill improvement provided by the multi scale analysis substantial with depth the same progression of skill is noted fig 10b further highlighting the utility of the multi scale analysis we are exploiting the minimum constrained wavelength for each of the tested variables 100 m temperature ssh and mld is lower moving from ss reg to ss all to ms all fig 11 however the rate of decline in the minimum constrained wavelength is different for each of the three variables for ssh the multi scale assimilation of all data reduces constrained scales from 80 km ss reg to 72 km ms all a relatively small reduction of 8 km in contrast the decline for mld is steep the multi scale assimilation of all data reduces constrained scales from 207 km ss reg to 122 km ms all a relatively large reduction of 85 km the results for 100 m temperature sit between the two other variables this phenomenon is caused by the scale dependent variability each variable has fig 9 ssh has a very steep spectral slope of 4 4 suggesting that a strong majority of ssh variability is concentrated at long wavelengths mld however has a relatively flat spectral slope of 2 6 suggesting that mld has relatively high concentrations of variability at smaller wavelengths 100 m temperature has an intermediate slope of 3 9 thus the multi scale analysis preferentially adds skill for variables that have relatively large variance at smaller wavelengths e g mld the multi scale analysis is less beneficial for a variable like ssh because the first large scale update to the background has already corrected a strong majority of the signal this is an important consideration for users as data become denser and state estimation targets smaller scale phenomena tuning around parameters such as ssh will become less useful a well tuned single scale analysis will fare well for these larger scale parameters evaluation of multi scale skill should focus on variables with sufficient small scale variability such as mld and gradient fields e g divergence using an osse framework we estimated the utility of a multi scale assimilation system specifically our aim was to test how dense swot observations can be further utilized in the assimilation process d addezio et al 2019 showed that a single scale assimilation of the high resolution swot observations biases errors into either large or small scales depending on the length scale of the background error covariance i e ncoda scaling factors of 1 2 vs 0 5 the multi scale system tested here is capable of making an accurate small scale update without sacrificing skill at larger scales we also showed that data from the historical observing network in situ profiles sst and nadir altimeter contain sufficient small scale information to reduce errors in a multi scale analysis ms reg when compared to a single scale analysis ss reg therefore our results suggest that the adoption of multi scale assimilation methodologies need not wait for swot data to arrive in 2021 the results presented here are idealized our osses used the same dynamical model surface forcing tidal forcing and boundary conditions used by the nature run a simplification that does not allow one to quantify how model parameters affect prediction skill when utilizing the new swot observations and the multi scale assimilation atlas 1997 subsurface temperature and salinity were assimilated at the geographic locations and times ssh observations were taken this mimics the operational approach used by ncoda smith et al 2015 for projecting surface information through synthetics isop helber et al 2013 as routinely used in systems such as the us navy operational global ocean prediction system metzger et al 2014 however the perfect subsurface temperature and salinity data that were assimilated have led to overly optimistic values of analysis skill therefore here we have simply compared the accuracy of the single scale and multi scale analyses using the same data small ssh psd at small wavelengths fig 9 causes an additional isop issue difficult to quantify using our methodology in a more realistic application an ssh innovation background minus observation is passed to isop when moving to the second small scale analysis that innovation is a residual from the large scale analysis made in the first step eq 9 the strong decline in ssh psd at small wavelengths suggests that this innovation will have low magnitude causing isop to make a relatively small correction to the temperature and salinity depth profile in reality parts of the water column may still have significant errors e g very near surface with a variable mixed layer the totality of these simplifications ensures that real world error levels will be higher than those demonstrated in this paper the results suggest some potential avenues for future research firstly the ocean cannot be simply decomposed into two uncorrelated spatial scales as is assumed by our theoretical foundation li et al 2015a ocean spectra are continuous across all scales fig 9 ideally all scales resolved by the observations and model should be corrected our approach generates small scale innovations based on the prior large scale analysis theoretically one could correct downscale more finely until the innovations approach zero i e all scales have been corrected one might even add additional large scale steps above the 1 2 scaling factor we have used here for our first analysis step however there are potential hazards to adding more analysis steps that are more correlated across scale if one does not know an approximate lower limit to the horizontal scales resolved by the observations one could find innovations at very small scales that are essentially manufactured representation errors i e the observations not resolving modeled features this effect was demonstrated in li et al 2015a this formulation also likely requires more representative background and observation error covariances as only rudimentary assumptions about both were made here additionally one might derive an accurate innovation but the resulting increment might be spread over scales uncorrelated with the small scale background errors one is targeting in our case the second order auto regressive soar function is very broad in spectral space jacobs et al 2020 see their figure 3 this would lead to inappropriate corrections at larger scales when moving the assimilation downscale the multi scale process might also be further segmented in time some small scale phenomena have significant variability on temporal scales below the 24 h we have used here for our small scale assimilation window one might make a series of small scale corrections over smaller subsets of time e g 6 h to account for this effect because of this temporal effect a multi scale 4dvar could be an even more effective approach carrier et al 2019 finally the proper representation of physics in the multi scale update should be addressed current variational schemes typically rely on assumed dynamical balances e g geostrophy in the assimilation process even 4dvar which uses linearized model physics to extend the static background error covariance often includes a balance operator in order to generate a smooth analysis field the assumptions used in these balance operators are typically mesoscale oriented in addition the vertical relations amongst variables is assumed to be similar within the two steps of the multi scale analysis and is probably a shortcoming that inhibits greater skill moving forward these assumptions will require modification small mesoscales submesoscales and internal waves do not follow dynamics appropriate for the large scale slowly evolving mesoscale field d addezio et al 2020 as models and observations continue to resolve finer scales this representation issue will become increasingly important a more sophisticated multi scale assimilation should take into account not only characteristic length scales but also the dynamics appropriate for those respective scales the emerging multi physics problem is therefore an important frontier in ocean state

petersburg russia corresponding author whitehead s tank model whitehead 2000 describes a localized deep convective site exchanging water with a two layer neighbouring ocean basin at three vertical levels we generalize the original model for the case of arbitrary temperatures and salinities of water layers under an assumption of a constant surface heat flux to the atmosphere in the convective area the generalized model has unique stable steady state for any value of the heat flux we then explore analytically the regimes with multiple steady states for a temperature dependent heat flux to the atmosphere in this latter case the multiple steady states are possible and the condition for their existence is derived analytically depending on the values of the non dimensional model parameters the solution allows for a different number of steady states from zero to three the lyapunov stability analysis showed that in the case of three steady states only two of them are stable the model results are tested against the observations in the greenland sea the results show that the model in spite of its simplicity adequately describes many basic features of water exchange between the region of a frequent development of deep convection in the greenland sea and the surrounding ocean the model predicts a negligibly small probability for existence of multiple steady states which might result from a feedback between the horizontal advection and the deep convection in the greenland sea msc 76e06 34d20 keywords deep convection surface heat flux multiple steady states lyapunov stability 1 introduction open ocean deep convection is a strongly nonlinear dynamic phenomenon observed in a few regions of the world ocean being a localized or even mesoscale phenomenon moore et al 2015 nagurnyi et al 1985 johannessen et al 1991 2013 it is an inherent part of the global ocean conveyor affecting the global climate state over a wide range of temporal scales marshall and schott 1999 alekseev et al 2001a visbeck 2007 lumpkin and speer 2007 buckley and marshall 2016 chafik and rossby 2019 deep convection is modelled within a broad spectrum of approaches of different complexity from simple conceptual models to the state of the art nonhydrostatic simulations killworth 1979 androsov et al 2005 mikolajewicz et al 2005 kovalevsky et al 2020 in a conceptually simple side of the modelling spectrum such approaches as box models stommel 1961 stommel and young 1993 cessi 1994 scott et al 1999 zickfeld et al 2004 and one dimensional 1d mixed layer models garwood 1991 provide interesting insights in the link between the processes of water mixing during deep convective events and upper ocean inflow in the convective regions and the deep water outflow from the regions in particular box models are able to provide multiple steady states that are hypothesized to correspond to plausible states of ocean circulation under past or projected future climates opposed to spurious multiple steady states caused by flux corrections in certain coupled primitive equation ocean atmosphere models see neelin and dijkstra 1995 for a discussion whitehead s tank model presented in whitehead 2000 referred below as w2000 was developed to suggest further laboratory experiments modelling a link between a deep convection intensity and an inter basin exchange the laboratory experiments and their link to the mathematical model are reported in whitehead et al 2005 whitehead and bradley 2006 and whitehead 2009 the tank model can be considered a hybrid of a box and a 1d mixed layer model despite its conceptual simplicity the model demonstrates a rich variety of possible in outflow regimes and allows multiple steady states in the original paper w2000 only the basic properties of the model were derived from analytical considerations while a number of results were obtained from numerical simulations in bashmachnikov and kovalevsky 2019 referred below as bk2019 the full analytical solution for this tank model was obtained for the case of a constant sea surface heat release to the atmosphere at a deep convective site however the analyses by w2000 and by bk2019 were limited to the case of the vertically uniform temperature and the fresh upper mixed layer around a deep convective site this analysis was subsequently extended by kovalevsky and bashmachnikov 2020 referred below as kb2020 to a more general case of the saline upper layer of the ambient ocean with a focus on deriving exact analytical solutions for the nonlinear transitional model dynamics besides the case of the constant surface heat flux w2000 considered numerically the case of a temperature dependent heat flux i e proportional to the temperature difference between the upper ocean and the atmosphere the dependence accounts for a decrease of the ocean heat release with a decreasing temperature difference between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere extensive numerical simulations led whitehead to particularly interesting results on the multiple steady states if for a constant heat flux the stable steady state of the dynamic system under study is always unique for the temperature dependent heat release to the atmosphere multiple stable steady states can coexist for some range of the parameters in the temperature dependent heat flux equation in the present paper we extend our previous analytical results on whitehead s tank model presented in bk2019 to a general case of an arbitrary temperature and salinity of the layers for both constant and temperature dependent heat fluxes to the atmosphere in particular we analytically derive a condition of existence of multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux and explore their stability the theoretical results are further tested against the observations in the greenland sea the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the generalized whitehead s tank model in section 3 we discuss model equations for case of arbitrary temperature and salinity of the upper and the lower layers around the deep convective site section 4 provides a summary of analytical results for the generalized model for a constant heat flux this analysis is further used for development of the theory for the case of the temperature dependent heat flux in section 5 we derive parametric conditions for existence of multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat exchange with the atmosphere and analyse their stability in section 6 we test the theoretical results against observations in the greenland sea conclusions are provided in section 7 derivations of the analytical results for the cases of the constant and the temperature dependent heat fluxes are presented in appendices a and c respectively appendix b presents solutions for the constant heat flux in the dimensional form 2 generalized whitehead s tank model following w2000 we consider a mathematical tank model the tank is composed by two interconnected basins a small basin representing a localized deep convection site and a big basin representing a larger neighbouring ocean region fig 1 the water column in the big basin is split in two layers the lower thick layer has temperature t 0 and salinity s 0 and the upper thin layer of thickness d has temperature t 1 and salinity s 1 our model setup with different temperature and salinity of the layers in the big basin is a generalization of the original model of w2000 where t 1 t 0 and s 1 0 1 1 the case of arbitrary salinity s 1 of the upper layer was considered in kb2020 however it was still assumed that t 0 t 1 temperature salinity and thickness of the layers in the big basin are assumed to be constant depending on the values of the model parameters the model dynamics can be characterized by different flow regimes section 4 these regimes are distinguished through the character of the water exchange between the big and the small basin at three equidistant vertical levels the upper level i 1 at zero depth the mid depth level i 2 at depth d 2 and the bottom level i 3 at depth d the boundary between the layers in the big basin is always shallower than the mid depth level i 2 i e 1 0 d d 2 we will assume the flow to be positive q i 0 when it is directed from the big basin to the small one in the model q 1 is always positive the sign of q 2 depends on the regime and can be negative zero or positive q 3 can be either negative or zero table 1 sea surface cooling in the small basin we assume that the sea surface heat flux from the ocean is always h 0 leads to the development of the convective layer of depth δ the temperature t 0 t of the convective layer in the small basin where t is the temperature anomaly is also affected by water exchange with the big basin dependent on the flow regime the convective layer will either have salinity equal to that of the upper layer in the big basin s 1 or in between s 0 and s 1 its depth varies from the mid depth level to the bottom of the small basin as is shown in fig 1 3 model equations 3 1 hydrostatic considerations and hydraulic analogies to keep the model analytically tractable the linear equation of state of the seawater is used 2 ρ t s ρ 0 1 β s α t where ρ 0 is the reference density at temperature t 0 the temperature anomaly t 0 and zero salinity α is the constant coefficient of thermal expansion and β is the constant coefficient of haline contraction the condition of hydrostatic stability in the big basin implies that the density of the lower layer 3 ρ l ρ 0 s 0 ρ 0 1 β s 0 should be higher or equal to the density of the upper layer 4 ρ u ρ t 1 t 0 s 1 ρ 0 1 α t 1 t 0 β s 1 or equivalently 5 δ ρ lu ρ l ρ u 0 this leads to the following hydrostatic stability constraint on the model parameters 6 α t 1 t 0 β s 1 s 0 the dynamics of water exchange between the basins are also described within a simple approximation inspired by hydraulic models specifically the transport q i is assumed to be proportional to the pressure difference between the big and the small basins at the depth level i 7 q i c i p 0 i p i i 1 2 3 where p 0 i p i is the pressure in the big small basin at level i and c i is a constant analogous to the inverse hydraulic resistance for the ocean the pressure gradient needs to be taken along the section in between the two basins the latter can be expressed in the same form as in eq 7 to limit the number of model parameters c 2 and c 3 are assumed to be equal while c 1 is taken smaller than either of them 8 c 1 γ c c 2 c 3 c where γ is the scaling factor varying within the limits 9 0 γ 1 pressures in eq 7 are computed using the hydrostatic approximation appendix a 1 for the real ocean one can use the same form of equation for q i but instead of the pressure difference at two sides of the connecting tube use the pressure difference along the section separating the basins in this case characteristics of the big basin project along one of the boundaries into the small basin and the convective site shifts towards the centre of the small basin 3 2 non dimensional model equations and parameters it is convenient to perform further analysis in the non dimensional form to normalize the model variables we define the characteristic temperature t s 10 t s t 1 t 0 β α s 1 s 0 because of the hydrostatic stability constraint 6 t s is always positive 2 2 in w2000 the characteristic temperature scale is defined as t s β s 0 α in kb2020 we used a different temperature scale β s 0 s 1 α these two definitions as well as a new definition 10 can be easily unified if we define the characteristic temperature scale as δ ρ lu α ρ 0 where δ ρ lu is the density difference between the lower and the upper layers the flow scaling parameter q s is 11 q s γ γ 2 c ρ 0 g α t s d the scales of the heat flux from one basin to another w s of the sea surface heat flux to the atmosphere h s and the timescale t s are the following 12 w s ρ 0 c p t s q s h s w s a 0 t s a 0 δ w s where g is the gravity acceleration c p is the specific heat capacity of water a 0 is the area of the small basin the system is described by two state variables the non dimensional temperature anomaly t and the scaled salinity anomaly s defined as 13 t t t s s s s 1 s 0 s 1 where t and s are the temperature and the salinity of the convective layer below the tilded state variables t and s will be referred to just as temperature and salinity while when occasionally discussing the non tilded state variables we will stress where necessary the words dimensional temperature and unscaled salinity note that the temperature of the convective layer is always smaller than the highest of the temperatures in the big basin 14 t 0 t max t 0 t 1 or in tilded variables 15 t max 0 θ where a scaled temperature difference between the upper and the lower layers 16 θ t 1 t 0 t s represents a new non dimensional parameter of the generalized model we notice that θ 0 when t 0 t 1 while θ 1 when s 0 s 1 see eq 10 in general θ can take any value θ however if t 1 t 0 or alternatively s 1 s 0 is fixed the hydrostatic stability condition 6 imposes a constraint on the possible values of θ in general the salinity of the upper layer s 1 can be higher equal to or lower than the salinity of the lower layer s 0 provided of course that the hydrostatic stability constraint 6 is fulfilled the salinity of the convective layer s will be in between s 0 and s 1 or eq 13 17 0 s 1 the geometry of the system will be fully specified by the non dimensional depth d of the upper layer in the big basin 18 d d d in view of eq 1 19 0 d 1 2 the non dimensional inter basin transports q i and the non dimensional sea surface heat flux h are

flow regimes for a constant sea surface heat flux in this section we generalize some results from w2000 and bk2019 to the case where temperature and salinity of the upper layer of the big basin are different from those of the lower layer in this section the case of a constant sea surface heat flux h is considered we will refer to this analysis in section 5 when exploring the case of the temperature dependent heat flux for computing figures below in the range of the presented non dimensional model parameters we use the values characteristic for the case study area in the greenland sea analysed in section 6 γ 0 25 d 0 1 θ 0 6 see section 6 for derivation of the parameters 4 1 threshold temperatures and heat fluxes three different regimes of water flows which are possible when h const will be referred as regime a b and c the transitions between the regimes take place at three threshold temperatures t nil t c and t cc defined as 25 t nil 1 θ 2 d 26 t c 1 θ 2 γ 1 2 γ d 27 t cc 1 θ 2 γ 1 γ d the dependence of these three temperature thresholds on γ is visualized in fig 2 the derivations of t nil t c and t cc are provided in appendices a 6 a 2 and a 3 respectively we also define two threshold heat fluxes h ab and h bc 28 h ab γ 2 2 γ 1 d 1 2 γ 1 2 γ d 29 h bc γ 2 1 γ d 1 2 γ 1 γ d note that both threshold fluxes are positive i e from the ocean regimes a b and c are summarized in table 1 a detailed analysis is provided in the following sections 4 2 regime a a weak sea surface heat flux regime a is observed for a weak heat flux to the atmosphere 0 h h ab for this regime the inflow into the small basin at the upper level is balanced by the outflow at the mid depth level while there is no flow at the bottom level q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 the equilibrium salinity of regime a is equal to zero s a 0 according to eq 13 the corresponding unscaled salinity of the mixed layer in the small basin s a is equal to that of the upper layer in the big basin s a s 1 the equilibrium temperature of regime a can be found by solving an appropriate quadratic equation from its two roots the smaller one should be chosen while the larger one should be ignored as the lyapunov stability analysis reveals that only the former one corresponds to the stable equilibrium of the dynamic system 22 23 appendix a 5 explicitly the unique stable equilibrium of regime a is reached at 30 t eq a h θ 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h 31 s eq a h 0 when h increases from zero to its first threshold level h ab the equilibrium temperature t eq a decreases monotonically from t nil to t c the mid depth transport q 2 a is 32 q 2 a h γ 2 4 γ 1 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h 1 2 d while q 1 a q 2 a and q 3 a 0 see appendix a 2 4 3 regime b a sea surface heat flux of medium intensity regime b is observed for a medium heat flux from the ocean h ab h h bc unlike regime a now the water exchange takes place at all three levels the inflow to the small basin at the upper level is balanced by the sum of outflows at the mid depth and the bottom levels q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 the steady state is again reached at s b 0 or s b s 1 for unscaled salinity similar to regime a the equilibrium temperature can be found from a quadratic equation where only the smaller root corresponds to the stable equilibrium while the larger one should be ignored appendix a 7 explicitly the stable equilibrium of regime b is reached at 33 t eq b h θ 1 3 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h 34 s eq b h 0 similar to regime a the equilibrium temperature of regime b monotonically decreases with h as h increases from h ab to h bc the temperature decreases from t c to t cc the mid depth flow q 2 b is 35 q 2 b h γ 1 6 γ 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h d the expressions for the flows at the upper and the lower levels are presented in appendix a 6 4 4 regime c a strong sea surface heat flux regime c the third possible flow regime requires a strong heat flux from the ocean h h bc similar to regime b there is a water exchange at all three levels however the direction of the flow at the mid depth level is now reverse and is directed from the big basin to the small one q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 given the depth of the convective layer δ below the mid depth level d 2 in fact it is even below d the deep mixed layer of the small basin is now fed by two inflows with different salinity s 1 at the upper level and s 0 at the mid depth level thus the unscaled equilibrium salinity s lies between s 0 and s 1 for the scaled variable 0 s 1 similar to the previous cases two equilibria are found for regime c appendix a 8 but the lyapunov stability analysis now shows that both of them are stable appendix a 9 however to obey a sign constraint q 2 0 distinguishing regime c only one of these two stable equilibria will realize appendix a 10 the equilibrium state variables are 36 t eq c h γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d h 6 h 3 2 d b θ h b θ 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 37 s eq c h 1 2 γ 1 1 γ 4 γ 2 d 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 3 2 d in eqs 36 37 38 b γ 2 2 γ 1 d it can be easily seen from eq 37 that water salinity s eq c of regime c is an increasing positive concave function of h that is zero up to the threshold flux value h h bc and then grows converging to the asymptotic value 39 s 1 γ 2 γ 1 as h the temperature t eq c is always a decreasing function of h when h is large enough however its behaviour at smaller h depends on an interplay between the parameters γ d and θ it can be shown that t eq c h is a nonmonotonic function of h if and only if 40 1 θ 2 γ γ 2 1 γ 2 d then t eq c h initially increases with h when h slightly departs from h bc eventually reaches its maximum t max c t cc and then starts decreasing table 1 for further analysis section 5 it is important that where t eq c h is increasing it is for sure a concave function if the condition 40 is not fulfilled t eq c h monotonically decreases throughout the whole range of h of regime c appendix a 11 the mid depth flow q 2 c is 41 q 2 c h 1 γ 4 2 γ 1 3 2 d 2 8 γ 2 γ 1 h γ 2 d 3 1 2 1 γ 1 γ d the two other flows are presented in appendix a 6 4 5 overview of regimes a c in the present section we discuss the graphical representations of the solutions for regimes a c for a constant heat release to the atmosphere and make further comments on general properties of these solutions fig 3 presents t eq h for several values of θ and fixed γ while the upper panel of fig 4 shows t eq h for several values of γ at fixed θ these two graphs are computed with eqs 30 33 and 36 for regimes a b and c respectively the lower panel of fig 4 shows s eq h for several values of γ based on eqs 31 34 and 37 while fig 5 presents q 2 h computed with eqs 32 35 and 41 for the same values of γ neither s eq h nor q 2 h depend on θ appendix a 12 consider first a family of the curves t eq h for different values of θ shown in fig 3 all five curves are computed for d 0 1 and γ 0 25 characteristic for the greenland sea the value θ 0 0 corresponds to the case of the equal temperatures of the upper and the lower layers in the big basin t 1 t 0 θ 1 0 corresponds to the equal salinities s 1 s 0 section 3 2 the curve labelled θ 0 6 is close to the characteristic value for the greenland sea the vertical lines mark h 0 h ab and h bc i e the starting points of regimes a b and c respectively from eqs 28 and 29 neither h ab nor h bc depend on θ so the starting points for all three regimes lie on the vertical lines fig 3 for regimes a and b t eq h monotonically decreases with h for all θ for regime c whether t eq h is monotonous or not depends on the fulfilment of the constraint 40 obviously this constraint cannot be satisfied for any θ 1 so without estimating the r h s of eq 40 we find that the two upper curves in fig 3 must monotonically decrease for the three lower curves the constraint 40 is fulfilled and they are non monotonous it can be easily seen from eqs 10 and 16 that the above mentioned necessary condition of the non monotonic behaviour of t eq h θ 1 is equivalent to a simple constraint s 0 s 1 the family of curves of t eq h for different values of γ is shown in the upper panel of fig 4 here again d 0 1 and θ 0 6 as h ab and h bc do depend on γ the starting points b i and c i for regimes b and c are now curve specific the constraint 40 is fulfilled for the three upper curves while it is not fulfilled for the lower one therefore the three upper curves have an intermediate maximum while the lower curve is monotonically decreasing the properties of the equilibrium salinity curves the lower panel of fig 4 have been already discussed in section 4 4 the lower the value of γ the higher is the asymptotic salinity s eq 39 to which s eq h converges at large h however this asymptotic value is constrained within the limits 0 s 1 in unscaled variables the smaller the γ the closer is s to s 0 a family of curves q 2 h is shown in fig 5 the transport q 2 h is negative for regimes a and b while it is positive for regime c q 2 h decreases with h for regime a while it increases with h for regimes b and c it is interesting to notice that all curves of the family intersect at the same point n with coordinates h 2 d q 2 d therefore at h 2 d the flow q 2 depends neither on θ nor on γ the latter statement also applies to q 1 and q 3 see appendix a 12 all curves t eq h s eq h q i h i 1 2 3 are continuous functions of h note the curves labelled γ 0 25 in figs 4 and 5 these are computed for the same set of parameter values as the curve labelled with θ 0 6 in fig 3 and imitate situation for the greenland sea discussed below in appendix b we also provide the formulas for the dimensional temperature t h and the unscaled salinity s h for all three regimes 5 multiple steady states for a temperature dependent heat flux 5 1 preliminary remarks developing further the numerical results by w2000 in this section we derive analytical solutions for the tank model with temperature dependent relaxation sea surface heat flux 42 h k t sea t air k const the physical meaning of the parameter k c p ρ a w follows from the expression for the sensible heat flux h c p ρ a w t sea t air where c p 1 7 j kg 1 c 1 is the product of the specific heat of the air on the bulk heat transfer coefficient and ρ a 1 3 kg m 3 is the air density and w is the wind speed being proportional to the wind speed k can vary in a rather wide range of values following the notations of section 2 the temperature of the convective layer of the small basin is equal to t sea t 0 t where t is the sea surface temperature anomaly we introduce an analogous notation t air t 0 t where t is the near surface air temperature anomaly and rewrite eq 42 as 43 h k t t or in non dimensional terms 44 h k t t where 45 k k t s h s we assume that the air above the small basin should be cooler than the upper water layer in the big basin t 1 46 t 0 t t 1 or in non dimensional terms 47 t θ 0 5 2 graphical analysis of the possible equilibria the theory for the temperature dependent heat flux can be built on the theory for the constant heat flux described in section 4 in particular the equilibrium temperature for regimes a b and c will be determined by the same quadratic equations as before where the constant heat flux h should now be replaced with eq 44 it can be shown that quadratic equations for the equilibrium temperatures in regimes a and b remain quadratic after this substitution and a straightforward generalization of the previous analysis reveals that conclusions about stability of the related steady states remain unchanged explicitly in case of the relaxation heat flux 48 t eq a θ 1 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 49 t eq b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d k 3 2 2 d k 2 6 k t θ for regimes a and b respectively see appendices c 1 c 2 for detail the situation is not as simple for regime c it can be shown that after substituting the parametrization 44 the equilibrium temperature should be derived from a cubic equation a straightforward application of the theory of cubic equations would lead to cumbersome calculations therefore we will adopt a different strategy inspired by the numerical analysis by w2000 we first perform a graphical analysis and then support it with analytical results in h t space for constant k and t eq 44 is a straight line we will call it the flux line the latter equation can be also rewritten as 50 t h k t graphically we can overlay flux lines 50 on an equilibrium temperature curve t eq h for instance on one of the temperature curves in figs 3 or 4 the intersections of a flux line with the equilibrium temperature curve will mark the equilibria for the case of the temperature dependent heat flux dependent on the slope and the intercept of a flux line different cases are possible fig 6 five different flux lines shown in the figure correspond to different pairs of parameters k t as it is evident from the figure depending on the values of k t there can be either no equilibrium line j one equilibrium line k with the equilibrium point k1 two equilibria line l with the equilibria l1 l2 or three equilibria lines m and n with the equilibria m1 m2 m3 and n1 n2 n3 respectively it also follows from the discussion in section 4 4 that multiple equilibria are possible only if the curve t eq h is non monotonous i e if the constraint 40 is fulfilled as it is mentioned in section 4 5 the necessary condition is s 0 s 1 otherwise when the equilibrium temperature curve decreases monotonically for all h as the curve for γ 0 50 in the upper panel of fig 4 the flux line with a positive slope can intersect the temperature curve no more than once however the constraint 40 is a necessary but insufficient condition of multiple equilibria and further analysis is needed 5 3 a condition for existence of multiple steady states based on the graphical analysis above we will now derive an analytic constraint on k for existence of the multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux for multiple equilibria to be possible a flux line should cross the curve t eq h twice within regime c as mentioned above this may only happen if the curve t eq h is non monotonous then the intersection at a smaller h takes place at the ascending part of the curve where as mentioned in section 4 4 the curve is concave see e g the intersection points l1 m2 n2 in fig 6 therefore around this first equilibrium point within regime c the curve t c h should become steeper than the flux line in other words for existence of the equilibrium point at a smaller h should hold 51 d t c d h eq 1 k as for h varying from h bc to the abovementioned equilibrium point the derivative d t c d h is decreasing the constraint 51 holds if and only if 52 d t c d h h h bc 1 k to summarize we get the following condition of the multiple equilibria if and only if the constraint 52 is fulfilled for a certain value of k then it is possible to choose t in eq 44 such that the flux line crosses the curve t h within regime c that is at h h bc twice thus yielding two possible equilibria there in this latter case there also might exist the third steady state in regimes a or b lines m and n in fig 6 have three equilibria however this possibility holds not for all flux lines of this family see line l in fig 6 with only two equilibria explicitly the condition 52 takes the form 53 1 θ 2 γ γ 2 1 γ 2 d 1 3 2 1 2 1 γ 1 γ d 1 k in the limit of k eq 53 transforms into the already obtained condition 40 of the non monotonicity of the equilibrium temperature curve 3 3 a derivation of eq 53 is similar to that of eq 40 and is based on the analysis outlined in appendix a 11 as an example the boundaries of the multiple equilibria domain in the phase plane γ d given by eq 53 are shown in fig 7 for three values of parameter k 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 and for the particular case of θ 0 6 note that the middle curve labelled k 0 1 in fig 7 is close to what can be expected in the greenland sea discussed in section 6 the domain of the multiple equilibria for a particular value of k is below the corresponding curve note the similarity of fig 7 with fig 5 from w2000 derived from numerical experiments 5 4 stability analysis in the previous section we derived a criterion of the multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux if this criterion is fulfilled for a given set of the model parameters and the multiple equilibria do exist the question arises are these equilibria stable the equilibria for regimes a or b are stable as it has been derived above for the constant heat flux this has already been discussed in section 5 2 below we briefly summarize the lyapunov stability analysis of the steady states for regime c derived in appendix c 3 1 an equilibrium at the descending part of the curve t eq c h if it exists is always stable 2 an equilibrium at the ascending part of the curve t eq c h if it exists is stable only if 54 d t c d h eq 1 k but in the latter case the condition 54 would contradict the condition 51 of existence of multiple equilibria if this is the equilibrium with a smaller h and a smaller t among the two therefore the equilibria l1 m2 and n2 in fig 6 are necessarily unstable for the other equilibrium with a larger h and a larger t even if it lies on the ascending part of the curve t eq c h the stability condition 54 is fulfilled see for example the point m3 in fig 6 therefore there might be from zero to three equilibria under the temperature dependent heat flux however in the case when two equilibria arise within regime c the first one with a smaller h and a smaller t is always unstable while the second one with a larger h and a larger t is always stable in other words when considering all three regimes in the case of three equilibria two of them are stable while the third middle one is unstable in fig 6 the points l1 m2 and n2 indicate unstable equilibria while all others k1 l2 m1 m3 n1 n3 are stable equilibria 6 deep convection in the greenland basin and water exchange with the neighbouring areas in this section we test the theoretical model against observations in the greenland sea fig 8a the greenland basin is the region of the most frequent deep convection in the greenland sea killworth 1983 marshall and schott 1999 fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 brakstad et al 2019 gradual deepening of the upper mixed layer begins in november while deep convection is observed from january to april marshall and schott 1999 alekseev et al 2001b fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 in the mid 1990s the deep convection in the greenland sea was of medium intensity the maximum mixing depth was of order of 1000 m then it intensified and stayed intensive from 2008 to at least 2016 the maximum mixing depth exceeded 1500 m ronski and budéus 2005 bashmachnikov et al 2019 the variations in the convection intensity in the greenland sea are often linked to variations of the ocean heat release to the atmosphere marshall and schott 1999 moore et al 2015 variations in the atlantic water inflow mostly entering the basin from the north influence temperature and salinity of the upper part of the water column in the convective site and presumably also affect the convection intensity alekseev et al 2001a glessmer et al 2014 lauvset et al 2018 both mechanisms form part of the theoretical model described in the previous sections which gives ground for validation of the model results against observations in the region the oceanographic data are obtained from armor3d dataset http marine copernicus eu the dataset contains gridded monthly global 3d fields of temperature salinity and geostrophic currents at the standard depth levels with the 0 2 5 0 2 5 spatial resolution verbrugge et al 2017 temperature salinity fields combine in situ temperature and salinity profiles with satellite observations guinehut et al 2004 2012 geostrophic currents are estimated by extrapolating the sea surface altimetry currents down using the thermal wind equations mulet et al 2012 atmospheric parameters are obtained from era interim reanalysis data dee 2016 on the 0 7 5 0 7 5 grid https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily the ocean atmosphere heat fluxes are computed using the coare 3 5 algorithm fairall et al 2003 the area of the most frequent deep convection fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 in the greenland sea fig 8a b is bounded from the north by section n with the mean latitude of around 77 n and from the south by section s with the mean latitude of 71 5 n along the sill of the jan mayen fracture zone this area forms the small basin of the theoretical model the sections are oriented perpendicular to the east greenland current egc and are limited from the west by the shelf break of greenland as the shelf branch of the egc has a very limited exchange with the deep part of the greenland basin rudels et al 2002 dukhovskoy et al 2019 and it is not included in the analysis the point where the direction of the time mean meridional velocity changes from the southward to the northward is taken as the eastern limit of section n section s is limited from the east by jan mayen island water column of the central greenland sea can be roughly split into three layers each dominated by a certain water mass the upper layer 200 500 m thick is dominated by the recirculating atlantic water raw which is a mixture of the atlantic water of the west spitsbergen current and the arctic upper polar water rudels et al 2002 jeansson et al 2008 2017 the water mass has temperature of 0 to 3 c and salinity of 34 4 to 34 9 its lower limit is within the potential density range of σ θ 28 00 28 02 kg m 3 rudels et al 2002 from 500 to 1000 m the greenland sea intermediate water gsiw is observed with the characteristic temperature of 0 8 to 0 4 c and salinity around 34 90 below 1000 m the greenland sea deep water gsdw is detected with the characteristic temperature 1 2 to 0 8 c and salinity of around 34 91 the two latter water masses are formed as the mixture between the intermediate and deep arctic and atlantic water masses modified during winter deep convection events rudels et al 2002 jeansson et al 2008 langehaug and falck 2012 the boundary between the water mass lies in the potential density range of σ θ 28 05 28 07 kg m 3 rudels et al 2002 based on this information we took isopycnal σ θ 1 28 00 kg m 3 as the base of the upper layer in the big basin figs 1 and 8a as the isopycnal roughly marks the base of the raw fig 8c d isopycnal σ θ 2 28 06 kg m 3 separating the gsiw from gsdw is taken as the boundary between layers 2 and 3 fig 8c d to compare the natural system with the theoretical tank model we make the following assumptions water in the upper layer enters the convection area in the greenland basin through section n depth d is taken as the mean depth of isopycnal σ θ 1 at section n fig 8c while t 1 and s 1 are the mean temperature and salinity respectively of the upper layer at section n as the water reaches section s some water changes its density via heat release to the atmosphere with a relatively weak convection some fraction of the water lowers to the second layer gsiw and leaves the basin as q 2 with a strong convection some fraction of the water enters the deeper layer 3 gsdw and also leaves the basin as q 3 the maximum depth of the sill at section s is taken as the level d 1700 m fig 8d consequently in the simplified approach of the tank model the mid level flow q 2 leaves the basin at 850 m within the gsiw depth range the mean temperature and salinity of layers 2 and 3 are taken as t 0 and s 0 variations of these characteristics between the two layers and over the study region are relatively small and can be neglected a significant fraction of the water which enters the basin through section n streams through the basin as the topographically trapped egc not entering the central areas where deep convection occurs therefore to approach the design of the tank model fig 1 the transports q 1 q 2 and q 3 are computed as the differences between the transport entering the greenland basin through section n and that leaving the basin through section s however the fluxes though section s have to be taken with a certain time lag as it takes a certain time for water to pass 720 km from section n to section s with the mean velocity of the egc of 5 10 cm s 1 this distance is covered in 3 5 months therefore the fluxes in out of the small basin are computed as the difference between august to november transport through section n and the following january to april transport through section s the four month means additionally reduce the intra annual variations of the transport intensity the mean parameters of the greenland basin used for comparison with the theoretical model are listed in table 2 we also use the following physical parameters the coefficient of thermal expansion α 0 9 1 0 4 c 1 the coefficient of haline contraction β 7 6 1 0 4 the mean water density ρ 0 1028 kg m 3 the specific seawater heat capacity c p 4000 j c 1 kg 1 and the area of the small basin a 0 8 1 0 10 m 2 of the deep convection region fig 8a making use of the values of dimensional parameters provided in table 2 we obtain the characteristic values of the non dimensional parameters used in figs 2 5 and 7 γ 0 25 d 0 1 θ 0 6 in the greenland sea in table 2 the transports in out of the basin are not fully balanced whereas the theoretical model logically assumes the mass balance in the small basin eq a 11 the misbalance is 0 35 sv this may be due to unaccounted fluxes some water leaves the greenland basin to the lofoten basin northeast of jan mayen an integral transport by eddies is another unknown these relatively small fluxes are difficult to estimate however whatever is the re distribution of the mass misbalance between the layers q 1 always or predominantly remains positive q 3 always or predominantly remains negative and q 2 may take any sign given a very high dispersion of the estimate these results are consistent with the tank model design mean winter january to april heat flux

basin and the transports at different water layers predicted by the theory section 4 appendix b depends in a nonlinear way on a number of input parameters that can be derived from observations with a limited accuracy see table 2 column 2 to account for these uncertainties we estimate t eq s eq and transports q 1 q 2 q 3 from the equations provided in section 4 and in appendix b using series of monte carlo mc experiments specifically for each of the mc experiments the values of the input parameters s 0 s 1 h d γ c are obtained from independent normal distributions with the means and standard deviations from the second column of table 2 the interannual variations of the parameters t 0 and t 1 are strongly correlated with s 0 0 9 and s 1 0 8 respectively t 0 and t 1 are therefore computed as dependent variables using the following regression equations 55 t 0 560 67 16 05 s 0 r 2 0 84 56 t 1 152 92 4 46 s 1 r 2 0 67 here r 2 is the coefficient of determination the results of the mc experiments corresponding to the constant sea surface heat release to the atmosphere section 4 are summarized in the third column of table 2 the mean modelled temperature in the convective region t eq is slightly above the freezing point the mean salinity s eq in the small basin is practically the same as the mean input salinity of the upper layer in the big basin s 1 this is because regimes a and b are clearly dominating over regime c table 3 the observations show a higher t eq and a lower s eq this is because the theoretical model does not take into account the effect of the vertical mixing with the more saline and warm lower layer during the deepening of the convective layer in regimes a and b only regime c allows for variations of salinity of the convective layer due to mixing with the water from layer 2 of the big basin in the model the lower salinity of the upper layer in the small basin is compensated by the lower temperature of the convective layer all fluxes in the greenland sea derived from the theoretical results have values of the same order as the observed ones q 1 is always positive q 3 is predominantly negative only the mean values of q 2 show different signs in the model and in observations however in observations as well as in the model results the sign of q 2 is the most uncertain as the standard deviations far exceed the mean values the results suggest a principal possibility of all three regimes a b c for different configurations of the input parameters with the abovementioned input parameters table 2 the probabilities of the system to stay in regimes a b and c are roughly 1 4 1 2 and 1 4 respectively table 3 the dominance of regime b corresponds to the signs of the mean values of q i derived from the observations table 2 when analysing the results of tables 2 and 3 one has to keep in mind that the mean transports at different levels as well as the probability of emergence of the regimes in a non linear way depend on a number of model parameters these can be obtained from the real ocean only after a number of assumptions on the regional dynamics making the parameter values uncertain and potentially leading to variations in the probabilities of emergence of the different flow regimes for example our additional experiments show that with the growth of the parameter c the probability of regime a grows in expense of regime c as mentioned the monte carlo experiments are based on the theory of the constant sea surface heat release however in the last row of table 3 we also assess the probability of falling into the regime with multiple steady states under assumption that all input parameters have the same statistics as before but the constant heat flux is replaced with the temperature dependent heat flux 42 from era interim reanalysis the winter mean air temperature over the convection region in the greenland sea is t air 6 0 1 5 c taking the typical heat flux see above we can estimate the parameter k h t sea t air 20 3 w m 2 c 1 note that for monthly means this parameter varies in a much wider range of values from 10 to 30 w m 2 c 1 for winter months the related characteristic value of a non dimensional parameter k 0 1 see fig 7 the derived value of k suggests the mean winter wind speed over the convective region w 5 m s 1 as can be derived from observations the probability of observing multiple steady states with the derived mean value of k 20 w m 2 c 1 is very low about 5 table 3 if making the estimates for an arbitrary k the possibility of the multiple equilibria becomes non negligible only if the values of k are taken substantially larger than those observed in the greenland sea these results suggest that in the greenland sea we do not expect the multiple equilibria to arise from a possible feedback between the horizontal advection and the deep convection 7 conclusions while demonstrating a versatile dynamic behaviour with qualitatively different flow regimes already for a relatively simple case of a constant time independent oceanic heat release to the atmosphere the whitehead s tank model experiments whitehead 2000 show even more interesting behaviour for a more complex case of a temperature dependent sea surface heat flux it is well known that many seemingly simple low dimensional dynamic systems can be studied only numerically quite surprisingly this is not the case with the dynamic system of whitehead s tank model in the present paper we generalized the original whitehead s model to the case of an arbitrary temperature and salinity of the layers further on departing from our previous analytical considerations for the constant ocean heat release to the atmosphere we have built an analytical theory for a more complex and a more realistic case of a temperature dependent heat release in particular we have derived a condition of existence of multiple equilibria in the form of an analytical constraint on non dimensional model parameters the constraint eq 53 suggests that multiple equilibria are possible only for a certain range of parameters γ d θ and k in particular if s 0 s 1 and therefore θ 1 no multiple equilibria are possible if γ eq 8 d eq 18 θ eq 16 are fixed the parameter k eq 45 should be large enough for multiple equilibria to exist additionally we have performed lyapunov stability analysis for co existing steady states and derived a simple stability criterion that also has a direct visual interpretation if the parameter range allows the multiple steady states in particular if k is large enough the stable steady states can be observed during a transition from to small heat fluxes h regimes a or b to from large heat flux h regime c this means that with a decrease increase of h the bistable system first shows a relatively weak evolution but at a certain critical value starts quickly drifting to another regime application of the model to the greenland sea suggests a high variability of the direction of q 2 from one winter to another which is the sign of transitions between the regimes derived in the theoretical model in particular the monte carlo experiment within the observed range of the model parameters confirms that different configuration of the parameters allows all three transport regimes a b and c among which regime b is clearly dominating however for the estimated values of k the emergence of the multiple steady states has a very low probability this means that the intensity of water exchange and the thermohaline parameters in the greenland sea should gradually change without jumps with variation of h consistent with the results by bashmachnikov et al 2019 we also note that the theoretical model does not account for the change of the thermohaline properties of the upper convective layer due to mixing with the lower layer during the convective events this leads to a certain deviation of the equilibrium temperature and salinity of the convective layer from the observations in particular having lower salinity the model predicts a lower mixed layer equilibrium temperature than observed this has implication on the critical heat fluxes marking the transitions between the regimes which should be lower than the model predicts overall in spite of the mentioned drawbacks and some difficulties in comparison of the highly simplified model with the observations we believe that whitehead s model which turned out to be analytically tractable is able to get an additional insight into the dynamics of the phenomenon of deep convection and its effect on the large scale ocean circulation the results might also serve a useful starting point for building more detailed and realistic models of deep convection with multiple steady states credit authorship contribution statement dmitry v

4 some of these derivations generalize the results reported by w2000 and bk2019 to the case of arbitrary temperature and salinity of water layers in the big basin while other ones are completely new a 1 pressure and transport estimates to compute transport q i at three levels i 1 2 3 we need to estimate the hydrostatic pressure at these levels in the big and the small basins when the temperature anomaly and salinity in the mixed layer of the small basin is defined as t s the density of the mixed layer in the small basin is eq 2 a 1 ρ sb ρ t s ρ 0 1 α t β s then the density difference between the lower layer of the big basin and the mixed layer of the small basin can be defined as a 2 δ ρ ρ l ρ sb ρ 0 α t β s 0 s we also denote the sea surface elevation in the small basin relative to that in the big basin as η note that η η where η is shown in fig 1 the hydrostatic pressure in the big basin at the level i 1 is a 3 p 01 0 and at the levels i 2 3 the hydrostatic pressure is a 4 p 0 i g ρ u d ρ l i 1 2 d d or equivalently a 5 p 0 i g δ ρ l u d ρ l i 1 2 d the hydrostatic pressure in the mixed layer of the small basin is a 6 p i g ρ 0 η ρ sb i 1 2 d the latter formula is valid at the levels i 1 2 for all flow regimes and at the level i 3 for regimes b and c only see the classification of flow regimes in section 4 1 then the pressure difference between the big and the small basins at the level i 1 is a 7 p 01 p 1 g ρ 0 η while at the levels i 2 3 it is a 8 p 0 i p i g δ ρ lu d ρ 0 η δ ρ i 1 2 d then in accordance with eqs 7 8 the flow at the level i 1 is a 9 q 1 γ c ρ 0 g η while at the levels i 2 3 it is a 10 q i c g δ ρ lu d ρ 0 η δ ρ i 1 2 d note that for i 3 eqs a 8 and a 10 are again valid for regimes b and c only a 2 regime a sea surface elevation transports t nil the transports are balanced for all the flow regimes a 11 q 1 q 2 q 3 0 in regime a when q 3 0 the balance takes the form a 12 q 1 q 2 0 equations as a 11 a 12 are applicable for the scaled transports q i eq 20 as well for regime a the salinity of the small basin is s 1 so in eq a 10 δ ρ δ ρ where a 13 δ ρ ρ 0 α t β s 0 s 1 using eqs a 9 a 10 a 12 a 13 we get a 14 η 1 1 γ δ ρ d 2 δ ρ lu d ρ 0 for the flow q 1 to be positive i e to be directed from the big basin to the small one we should require η 0 it can be shown that the latter constraint is equivalent to a 15 t t nil here the first threshold temperature t nil is defined as a 16 t nil 2 α d β s 0 s 1 α t 0 t 1 d β s 0 s 1 d 2 for scaled variables see section 3 2 eqs a 15 a 16 take the form t t nil where t nil is provided by eq 25 from eqs a 9 a 10 a 14 the scaled flows of regime a are a 17 q 1 q 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 t θ 1 2 d or equivalently a 18 q 1 q 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 t t nil a 3 the convection depth and t c in this section we derive the mixed layer depth δ in the small basin for regime a δ d the hydrostatic pressure in both basins at depth δ should be the same then the pressure at the level i 3 in both basins is also the same and there is no flow at the level i 3 q 3 0 so we must require a 19 p 0 δ p δ analogously to eq a 8 a 20 p 0 δ p δ g δ ρ lu d ρ 0 η δ ρ δ where the notation a 13 is used then from eq a 19 a 21 δ ρ 0 η δ ρ lu d δ ρ by substituting η from eq a 14 we get after some rearrangements a 22 δ 1 1 γ d 2 γ d δ ρ lu δ ρ then the transition from regime a to b at δ d is equivalent to a 23 δ ρ 2 γ 2 γ 1 d d δ ρ lu or in non dimensional variables regime a is observed when t t c here the second threshold temperature t c is defined by eq 26 the transition from regime a to b occurs at t t c a 4 dynamic equations for temperature and salinity as the small basin is exposed to the sea surface cooling the dimensional dynamic equation for temperature can be written as a 24 ρ 0 c p v t t ρ 0 c p q 1 1 q 1 t 1 1 q 1 t 0 t q 2 1 q 2 t 0 1 q 2 t 0 t q 3 1 q 3 t 0 1 q 3 t 0 t a 0 h where a 0 is the area of the small basin and a 25 v a 0 δ is the volume of the mixed layer in the small basin h is the sea surface heat flux in the small basin h 0 if the heat flux is directed from the ocean to the atmosphere and the unit step function 1 x is defined by eq 24 given that a 26 q i 1 q i 1 q i q i and making use of the flow balance a 11 eq a 24 can be re written as a 27 v t t q 1 1 q 1 t 1 t 0 q 1 1 q 1 q 2 1 q 2 q 3 1 q 3 t a 0 ρ 0 c p h in scaled variables defined in section 3 2 including the scaled time the non dimensional form of eq a 27 is eq 22 given that a 28 q 1 0 q 3 0 is always true eq 22 is reduced to a 29 t t q 1 θ q 2 1 q 2 q 3 t h similar to eq a 24 the unscaled salinity varies as a 30 v s t q 1 1 q 1 s 1 1 q 1 s q 2 1 q 2 s 0 1 q 2 s q 3 1 q 3 s 0 1 q 3 s using again eqs a 11 and a 26 we rewrite eq a 30 as a 31 v s t q 1 1 q 1 s 1 s q 2 1 q 2 q 3 1 q 3 s 0 s finally the scaled salinity equation takes the form of eq 23 making use of eq a 28 the equation is reduced to a 32 s t q 1 s q 2 1 q 2 1 s a 5 regime a the steady states and their stability analysis for regime a in view of q 2 q 1 the dynamic system a 29 a 32 is a 33 t t q 1 t θ h a 34 s t q 1 s from eq a 34 the equilibrium salinity anomaly for regime a is s a 0 the equilibrium temperature t eq a can be derived from eq a 33 in the stationary case the equation takes the form a 35 q 1 t θ h 0 substituting eq a 17 into eq a 35 we get a 36 t θ 1 2 d t θ 2 γ 1 γ 2 h 0 the roots of this quadratic equation are a 37 t a θ 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h we now perform the lyapunov stability analysis for two equilibrium temperatures of eq a 37 to do this we explore the linearized dynamic system a 33 a 34 in the vicinity of the equilibria a 38 δ t t δ s t m ˆ a δ t δ s where δ t and δ s are temperature and salinity perturbations respectively and the matrix m ˆ a is a 39 m ˆ a q 1 t t θ q 1 q 1 s t θ 0 q 1 the matrix m ˆ a is a diagonal matrix and therefore its eigenvalues are simply equal to its diagonal elements a 40 λ 1 a q 1 t t θ q 1 λ 2 a q 1 as q 1 0 the second eigenvalue λ 2 a is always negative it can be shown that the first eigenvalue a 41 λ 1 a γ 2 2 γ 1 2 t eq a θ 1 2 d will be negative for the equilibrium t a and positive for the equilibrium t a this means that the stable equilibrium corresponds to t a while the other equilibrium t a is unstable and should be ignored therefore for regime a we obtain the unique stable steady state 30 31 a 6 transport for regimes b and c and the threshold temperature t cc below we derive expressions for q i for regimes b and c as in regime c the scaled salinity s is no longer zero the general case of the density difference δ ρ eq a 2 should be used in calculations this differs from calculations for regime a appendix a 2 where the specific case of δ ρ eq a 13 was explored from eqs a 9 a 10 a 11 the surface elevation now becomes a 42 η 1 2 γ δ ρ 3 d 2 δ ρ lu 2 d

non dimensional transports q i become a 48 q 1 3 2 t 1 θ 1 s 2 d a 49 q 2 1 γ 1 2 t 1 θ 1 s d a 50 q 3 2 γ 1 2 t 1 θ 1 s d transition from regime b to c occurs when q 2 0 here still s 0 from eq a 49 it is easy to see that this transition takes place at the third threshold temperature t cc given by eq 27 a 7 regime b the steady states and their stability analysis for regime b eqs a 33 a 34 a 35 a 39 are still valid but q 1 is now given by a different expression derived from eq a 48 when s 0 a 51 q 1 3 2 t θ 3 2 2 d similar to regime a s eq b 0 substituting eq a 51 into eq a 35 we find two equilibrium temperatures which are the roots of the related quadratic equation a 52 t b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h the stability analysis for regime b is fully analogous to regime a above the first eigenvalue is a 53 λ 1 b 3 t eq b θ 3 2 2 d while the second eigenvalue still obeys an equation λ 2 b q 1 and is therefore negative λ 1 b is negative for the equilibrium temperature t b and positive for t b therefore the stable equilibrium corresponds to t b while the equilibrium t b is unstable and should be ignored therefore regime b is also characterized by the unique stable steady state 33 34 a 8 regime c the steady states for regime c the dynamic system a 29 a 32 takes the form a 54 t t q 1 θ q 3 t h a 55 s t q 1 s q 2 1 s making use of eq a 11 we can rewrite this system as a 56 t t q 2 θ q 3 t θ h a 57 s t q 2 q 3 s the system for the corresponding steady states becomes a 58 q 2 θ q 3 t θ h 0 a 59 q 2 q 3 s 0 we now multiply eq a 59 by θ and add the resultant equation to eq a 58 to get a 60 q 3 t θ 1 s h from eqs a 49 a 50 it is easy to derive a general relation between transports q 2 and q 3 valid for both regimes b and c a 61 q 2 a q 3 b where a 62 a 1 γ 2 γ 1 b γ 2 2 γ 1 d substituting eq a 61 in eq a 59 we rewrite the latter equation as a 63 q 3 s a b or equivalently a 64 q 3 b s a substituting eq a 64 in eq a 60 we get a 65 t θ 1 s h s a b at the same time it follows from eqs a 50 and a 64 that a 66 t 1 θ 1 s 2 γ 2 γ 1 d b s a finally subtracting eq a 65 from eq a 66 we obtain an equation for a single unknown the equilibrium salinity s a 67 1 s 2 γ 2 γ 1 d b s a h s a b in further analysis we introduce a notation a 68 ψ a s b where the reversal of the latter expression is a 69 s a b ψ then eq a 67 can be rewritten as a quadratic equation for the variable ψ a 70 h b ψ 2 2 γ 2 γ 1 d 1 a ψ 2 γ 2 γ 1 0 its roots are a 71 ψ γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b from eq a 65 a 72 t 1 a θ h b θ ψ and we get two potential temperature equilibria for regime c a 73 t c γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d h 6 h 3 2 d b θ h b θ 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b an analysis in appendix a 10 shows that in eqs a 71 and a 73 the root with the sign should be chosen thus a 74 ψ 4 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 3 2 d making use of eq a 69 for the equilibrium salinity of regime c we come to the solution 37 notice that s eq c does not depend on θ a 9 regime c stability analysis similar to regimes a and b the lyapunov stability analysis for regime c is performed for a linearized dynamic system derived from eqs a 56 a 57 the matrix of the linearized system takes the form a 75 m ˆ c q 2 t θ q 3 t t θ q 3 q 2 s θ q 3 s t θ q 2 t q 3 t s q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 after somewhat lengthy algebra we find compact equations for trace and determinant of the matrix a 75 a 76 tr m ˆ c 3 q 3 3 2 d det m ˆ c q 3 2 q 3 3 2 d for eigenvalues λ 1 c λ 2 c of the two dimensional matrix m ˆ c the following equations hold a 77 λ 1 c λ 2 c tr m ˆ c λ 1 c λ 2 c det m ˆ c then using eqs a 76 we immediately find both eigenvalues a 78 λ 1 c q 3 λ 2 c 2 q 3 3 2 d as q 3 0 both eigenvalues are negative and therefore both potential equilibria derived for regime c appendix a 8 are stable we see that unlike regimes a and b here the stability analysis in itself does not help excluding the wrong equilibrium therefore selection of the equilibrium for regime c requires additional analysis given in appendix a 10 it is interesting to note that despite the temperature parameter θ of the generalized theory enters eq a 75 and is used for the intermediate calculations for the eigenvalues not shown it does not explicitly enter the final results a 78 the expressions for the eigenvalues take the same form as in bk2019 where they were derived for a particular case t 1 t 0 s 1 0 implicitly the flux q 3 does of course depend on θ eq a 50 a 10 regime c selection of permissible steady state as derived in appendix a 9 the stability analysis itself does not answer the question which of two equilibria or none of them or both should be retained as the steady state solution for regime c the graphical analysis of this section should reveal whether the obtained equilibria are compatible with the constraints of the theory eq a 66 can be written as a 79 t f s where a 80 f s 1 θ s 1 2 γ 2 γ 1 d 2 γ 2 γ 1 b s a at the same time the constraint q 2 0 that indicates regime c in view of eq a 50 has the following form a 81 t f q s where a 82 f q s 1 θ s 1 2 γ 1 γ d finally the linear relation a 65 of t and s can be rewritten as a 83 t f h s where a 84 f h s ξ θ s 1 3 γ 2 γ 1 ξ and the positive parameter ξ is defined as a 85 ξ h b in summary the following constraints should be fulfilled a 86 f s f q s f h s f q s f s f h s assigning the new functions a 87 g s f s f q s g h s f h s f q s constraints of eq a 86 become a 88 g s 0 g h s 0 g s g h s explicitly a 89 g s 2 γ 2 γ 1 b s a γ 2 1 γ d a 90 g h s ξ 1 s 1 3 γ 2 γ 1 ξ 2 γ 1 γ d the hyperbola g s eq a 89 is shown in fig a 9 the scaled salinity anomaly s varies within the limits 0 s 1 the singularity of the hyperbola at s a lies within these limits note that g 0 0 and the function g s monotonically decreases from 0 to with s increasing from 0 to a in view of eq a 88 the equilibrium of regime c can occur only on this negative segment of the hyperbola g s 0 s a the positive branch a s 1 is excluded from further analysis as 1 ξ the straight line g h s has a positive or in a limiting case a zero slope it will intersect the permissible negative segment of the hyperbola g s if and only if g h 0 0 that means the point m on the vertical axis in fig a 9 is at or below the zero point the line g h s will intersect the negative segment of the hyperbola only once yielding an equilibrium at some point a the second intersection of g h s with the positive branch of the hyperbola point b should be excluded to summarize for regime c if g h 0 0 there is only one permissible steady state if g h 0 0 there are no permissible steady states an explicit calculation shows that the constraint g h 0 0 is equivalent to the constraint a 91 ξ 2 γ 1 1 γ 1 2 γ 1 γ d the latter in turn is simply equivalent to the constraint h h bc which defines regime c eq 29 this means that for regime c the permissible equilibrium exists and is unique we can now answer the question which sign to choose in eqs a 71 and a 73 from the analysis above fig a 9 it follows that among the two possible equilibria points a and b the one corresponding to smaller s is to be chosen imagine now the straight line t f h s eq a 84 the sign of its slope ξ θ is equal to the sign of h b θ if the slope is positive we should choose the equilibrium with a smaller t among the two but in such a case h b θ 0 and one has to choose in eq a 73 if the slope is negative we should choose the equilibrium with a larger t among the two but in such a case h b θ 0 and one has again to choose in eq a 73 therefore one always has to choose in eq a 73 and the permissible equilibrium for regime c is given by eqs 36 37 a 11 properties of t eq c h for regime c in the present section we explore properties of the equilibrium temperature t eq c h for regime c using eq 36 first we define some auxiliary parameters a 92 m 3 2 d p 8 2 γ 1 γ l b 1 θ and auxiliary functions a 93 z h h b r z m 2 p z note that the parameters m and p of eq a 92 are always positive while the parameter l can have any sign also in eq a 93 r z m for regime c then a 94 t z 3 γ 2 γ 1 θ 4 f z where the new function f z is defined as a 95 f z z l r z m differentiating f z with respect to z we get after some rearrangements a 96 f z r z m 2 p l 2 r z r z m 2 it follows from eq a 96 that f z is for sure positive for large r or equivalently for large z i e large h and that f z has either no or only one zero in regime c the condition of having one zero can be derived from eq a 96 and takes the explicit form of eq 40 note that this is possible only if θ 1 note also that when f z 0 the absolute value of f z is decreasing with r and hence with z coming back to eq a 94 we see that for regime c t eq c h either monotonically decreases or when the constraint 40 is fulfilled initially increases passes through the maximum and then starts decreasing when t h 0 the absolute value of t h decreases with h so that the equilibrium temperature is a concave function of h a 12 further properties of solutions with a constant heat flux independence of s eq h from θ follows from explicit expressions for s eq h for regimes a c eqs 31 34 and 37 and from the fact that the threshold fluxes of the regimes h ab and h bc do not depend on θ similar arguments apply to q 2 h as all three transports are connected by simple linear relations appendices a 2 a 6 this is also true for q 1 h q 3 h the point h 2 d is within regime b at this point t eq b θ 1 eq 33 s eq b 0 so in expressions a 48 a 50 for all q i the term t 1 θ 1 s 0 and at h 2 d q i depend neither on θ nor on γ explicitly q 1 2 d 2 d q 2 2 d q 3 2 d d appendix b

dependent heat release by the ocean c 1 regime a the steady states and their stability analysis the analysis of regime a in case of a temperature dependent heat flux is similar to the case of a constant heat flux considered in appendix a 5 it is convenient to re write the temperature dependent heat flux 44 as c 1 h k t θ t θ substituting the latter equation in eq a 36 we get c 2 t θ 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 2 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 0 the two roots of this quadratic equation are c 3 t a θ 1 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ in order to make a decision on which sign in eq c 3 to choose we do the stability analysis of the dynamic system a 33 a 34 with h replaced with its temperature dependent form 44 eq a 39 now becomes c 4 m ˆ a q 1 t t θ q 1 k q 1 s t θ 0 q 1 as in appendix a 5 this is a diagonal matrix and its eigenvalues are equal to its diagonal elements c 5 λ 1 a q 1 t t θ q 1 k λ 2 a q 1 here λ 2 a is always negative to determine the sign of λ 1 a we notice that eq a 41 now becomes c 6 λ 1 a γ 2 2 γ 1 2 t eq a θ 1 2 d k it can be seen that λ 1 a 0 when there is sign in eq c 3 while λ 1 a 0 when the sign is the stable solution requires sign and we come to eq 48 c 2 regime b the steady states and their stability analysis in the case of a temperature dependent heat flux the quadratic equation for equilibrium temperature for regime b derived from eq a 35 becomes c 7 3 2 t θ 2 3 2 2 d k t θ k t θ 0 its roots are c 8 t b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d k 3 2 2 d k 2 6 k t θ similar to the expression a 53 the first eigenvalue of the matrix of linearized dynamic system now is c 9 λ 1 b 3 t eq b θ 3 2 2 d k it can be seen that λ 1 b 0 when in eq c 8 the sign is while λ 1 b 0 when the sign is the second eigenvalue λ 2 b is always negative therefore the stable solution corresponds to sign in eq c 8 and we come to eq 49 c 3 regime c stability analysis in this section we perform the stability analysis for regime c for the temperature dependent heat flux to the atmosphere the matrix of the linearized system analogous to eq a 75 becomes c 10 m ˆ c q 2 t θ q 3 t t θ q 3 k q 2 s θ q 3 s t θ q 2 t q 3 t s q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 both eigenvalues of a two dimensional matrix m ˆ c have negative real parts if and only if c 11 tr m ˆ c 0 det m ˆ c 0 after a lengthy algebra we get c 12 tr m ˆ c 3 q 3 3 2 d k det m ˆ c q 3 2 q 3 3 2 d k m 22 c where m 22 c is the bottom right element of the matrix c 10 c 13 m 22 c q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 from eq c 12 we immediately see that the first constraint of eq c 11 is automatically fulfilled while the second one requires further analysis using notations from appendix a 11 we find c 14 q 3 2 q 3 3 2 d r r m 8 c 15 m 22 c 1 4 r m r m 2 8 γ 2 γ d 1 θ at the same time it can be shown that c 16 d t d h 2 r r m 2 r m 2 8 γ 2 γ d 1 θ comparing eqs c 15 and c 16 we find that c 17 m 22 c r r m 8 d t d h and finally c 18 det m ˆ c r r m 8 1 k d t d h from eq c 18 it follows that det m ˆ c is positive if d t d h 0 while at d t d h 0 one must additionally impose the constraint 54 overall the stability analysis justifies the corollaries of section 5 4

petersburg russia corresponding author whitehead s tank model whitehead 2000 describes a localized deep convective site exchanging water with a two layer neighbouring ocean basin at three vertical levels we generalize the original model for the case of arbitrary temperatures and salinities of water layers under an assumption of a constant surface heat flux to the atmosphere in the convective area the generalized model has unique stable steady state for any value of the heat flux we then explore analytically the regimes with multiple steady states for a temperature dependent heat flux to the atmosphere in this latter case the multiple steady states are possible and the condition for their existence is derived analytically depending on the values of the non dimensional model parameters the solution allows for a different number of steady states from zero to three the lyapunov stability analysis showed that in the case of three steady states only two of them are stable the model results are tested against the observations in the greenland sea the results show that the model in spite of its simplicity adequately describes many basic features of water exchange between the region of a frequent development of deep convection in the greenland sea and the surrounding ocean the model predicts a negligibly small probability for existence of multiple steady states which might result from a feedback between the horizontal advection and the deep convection in the greenland sea msc 76e06 34d20 keywords deep convection surface heat flux multiple steady states lyapunov stability 1 introduction open ocean deep convection is a strongly nonlinear dynamic phenomenon observed in a few regions of the world ocean being a localized or even mesoscale phenomenon moore et al 2015 nagurnyi et al 1985 johannessen et al 1991 2013 it is an inherent part of the global ocean conveyor affecting the global climate state over a wide range of temporal scales marshall and schott 1999 alekseev et al 2001a visbeck 2007 lumpkin and speer 2007 buckley and marshall 2016 chafik and rossby 2019 deep convection is modelled within a broad spectrum of approaches of different complexity from simple conceptual models to the state of the art nonhydrostatic simulations killworth 1979 androsov et al 2005 mikolajewicz et al 2005 kovalevsky et al 2020 in a conceptually simple side of the modelling spectrum such approaches as box models stommel 1961 stommel and young 1993 cessi 1994 scott et al 1999 zickfeld et al 2004 and one dimensional 1d mixed layer models garwood 1991 provide interesting insights in the link between the processes of water mixing during deep convective events and upper ocean inflow in the convective regions and the deep water outflow from the regions in particular box models are able to provide multiple steady states that are hypothesized to correspond to plausible states of ocean circulation under past or projected future climates opposed to spurious multiple steady states caused by flux corrections in certain coupled primitive equation ocean atmosphere models see neelin and dijkstra 1995 for a discussion whitehead s tank model presented in whitehead 2000 referred below as w2000 was developed to suggest further laboratory experiments modelling a link between a deep convection intensity and an inter basin exchange the laboratory experiments and their link to the mathematical model are reported in whitehead et al 2005 whitehead and bradley 2006 and whitehead 2009 the tank model can be considered a hybrid of a box and a 1d mixed layer model despite its conceptual simplicity the model demonstrates a rich variety of possible in outflow regimes and allows multiple steady states in the original paper w2000 only the basic properties of the model were derived from analytical considerations while a number of results were obtained from numerical simulations in bashmachnikov and kovalevsky 2019 referred below as bk2019 the full analytical solution for this tank model was obtained for the case of a constant sea surface heat release to the atmosphere at a deep convective site however the analyses by w2000 and by bk2019 were limited to the case of the vertically uniform temperature and the fresh upper mixed layer around a deep convective site this analysis was subsequently extended by kovalevsky and bashmachnikov 2020 referred below as kb2020 to a more general case of the saline upper layer of the ambient ocean with a focus on deriving exact analytical solutions for the nonlinear transitional model dynamics besides the case of the constant surface heat flux w2000 considered numerically the case of a temperature dependent heat flux i e proportional to the temperature difference between the upper ocean and the atmosphere the dependence accounts for a decrease of the ocean heat release with a decreasing temperature difference between the upper ocean and the lower atmosphere extensive numerical simulations led whitehead to particularly interesting results on the multiple steady states if for a constant heat flux the stable steady state of the dynamic system under study is always unique for the temperature dependent heat release to the atmosphere multiple stable steady states can coexist for some range of the parameters in the temperature dependent heat flux equation in the present paper we extend our previous analytical results on whitehead s tank model presented in bk2019 to a general case of an arbitrary temperature and salinity of the layers for both constant and temperature dependent heat fluxes to the atmosphere in particular we analytically derive a condition of existence of multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux and explore their stability the theoretical results are further tested against the observations in the greenland sea the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we present the generalized whitehead s tank model in section 3 we discuss model equations for case of arbitrary temperature and salinity of the upper and the lower layers around the deep convective site section 4 provides a summary of analytical results for the generalized model for a constant heat flux this analysis is further used for development of the theory for the case of the temperature dependent heat flux in section 5 we derive parametric conditions for existence of multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat exchange with the atmosphere and analyse their stability in section 6 we test the theoretical results against observations in the greenland sea conclusions are provided in section 7 derivations of the analytical results for the cases of the constant and the temperature dependent heat fluxes are presented in appendices a and c respectively appendix b presents solutions for the constant heat flux in the dimensional form 2 generalized whitehead s tank model following w2000 we consider a mathematical tank model the tank is composed by two interconnected basins a small basin representing a localized deep convection site and a big basin representing a larger neighbouring ocean region fig 1 the water column in the big basin is split in two layers the lower thick layer has temperature t 0 and salinity s 0 and the upper thin layer of thickness d has temperature t 1 and salinity s 1 our model setup with different temperature and salinity of the layers in the big basin is a generalization of the original model of w2000 where t 1 t 0 and s 1 0 1 1 the case of arbitrary salinity s 1 of the upper layer was considered in kb2020 however it was still assumed that t 0 t 1 temperature salinity and thickness of the layers in the big basin are assumed to be constant depending on the values of the model parameters the model dynamics can be characterized by different flow regimes section 4 these regimes are distinguished through the character of the water exchange between the big and the small basin at three equidistant vertical levels the upper level i 1 at zero depth the mid depth level i 2 at depth d 2 and the bottom level i 3 at depth d the boundary between the layers in the big basin is always shallower than the mid depth level i 2 i e 1 0 d d 2 we will assume the flow to be positive q i 0 when it is directed from the big basin to the small one in the model q 1 is always positive the sign of q 2 depends on the regime and can be negative zero or positive q 3 can be either negative or zero table 1 sea surface cooling in the small basin we assume that the sea surface heat flux from the ocean is always h 0 leads to the development of the convective layer of depth δ the temperature t 0 t of the convective layer in the small basin where t is the temperature anomaly is also affected by water exchange with the big basin dependent on the flow regime the convective layer will either have salinity equal to that of the upper layer in the big basin s 1 or in between s 0 and s 1 its depth varies from the mid depth level to the bottom of the small basin as is shown in fig 1 3 model equations 3 1 hydrostatic considerations and hydraulic analogies to keep the model analytically tractable the linear equation of state of the seawater is used 2 ρ t s ρ 0 1 β s α t where ρ 0 is the reference density at temperature t 0 the temperature anomaly t 0 and zero salinity α is the constant coefficient of thermal expansion and β is the constant coefficient of haline contraction the condition of hydrostatic stability in the big basin implies that the density of the lower layer 3 ρ l ρ 0 s 0 ρ 0 1 β s 0 should be higher or equal to the density of the upper layer 4 ρ u ρ t 1 t 0 s 1 ρ 0 1 α t 1 t 0 β s 1 or equivalently 5 δ ρ lu ρ l ρ u 0 this leads to the following hydrostatic stability constraint on the model parameters 6 α t 1 t 0 β s 1 s 0 the dynamics of water exchange between the basins are also described within a simple approximation inspired by hydraulic models specifically the transport q i is assumed to be proportional to the pressure difference between the big and the small basins at the depth level i 7 q i c i p 0 i p i i 1 2 3 where p 0 i p i is the pressure in the big small basin at level i and c i is a constant analogous to the inverse hydraulic resistance for the ocean the pressure gradient needs to be taken along the section in between the two basins the latter can be expressed in the same form as in eq 7 to limit the number of model parameters c 2 and c 3 are assumed to be equal while c 1 is taken smaller than either of them 8 c 1 γ c c 2 c 3 c where γ is the scaling factor varying within the limits 9 0 γ 1 pressures in eq 7 are computed using the hydrostatic approximation appendix a 1 for the real ocean one can use the same form of equation for q i but instead of the pressure difference at two sides of the connecting tube use the pressure difference along the section separating the basins in this case characteristics of the big basin project along one of the boundaries into the small basin and the convective site shifts towards the centre of the small basin 3 2 non dimensional model equations and parameters it is convenient to perform further analysis in the non dimensional form to normalize the model variables we define the characteristic temperature t s 10 t s t 1 t 0 β α s 1 s 0 because of the hydrostatic stability constraint 6 t s is always positive 2 2 in w2000 the characteristic temperature scale is defined as t s β s 0 α in kb2020 we used a different temperature scale β s 0 s 1 α these two definitions as well as a new definition 10 can be easily unified if we define the characteristic temperature scale as δ ρ lu α ρ 0 where δ ρ lu is the density difference between the lower and the upper layers the flow scaling parameter q s is 11 q s γ γ 2 c ρ 0 g α t s d the scales of the heat flux from one basin to another w s of the sea surface heat flux to the atmosphere h s and the timescale t s are the following 12 w s ρ 0 c p t s q s h s w s a 0 t s a 0 δ w s where g is the gravity acceleration c p is the specific heat capacity of water a 0 is the area of the small basin the system is described by two state variables the non dimensional temperature anomaly t and the scaled salinity anomaly s defined as 13 t t t s s s s 1 s 0 s 1 where t and s are the temperature and the salinity of the convective layer below the tilded state variables t and s will be referred to just as temperature and salinity while when occasionally discussing the non tilded state variables we will stress where necessary the words dimensional temperature and unscaled salinity note that the temperature of the convective layer is always smaller than the highest of the temperatures in the big basin 14 t 0 t max t 0 t 1 or in tilded variables 15 t max 0 θ where a scaled temperature difference between the upper and the lower layers 16 θ t 1 t 0 t s represents a new non dimensional parameter of the generalized model we notice that θ 0 when t 0 t 1 while θ 1 when s 0 s 1 see eq 10 in general θ can take any value θ however if t 1 t 0 or alternatively s 1 s 0 is fixed the hydrostatic stability condition 6 imposes a constraint on the possible values of θ in general the salinity of the upper layer s 1 can be higher equal to or lower than the salinity of the lower layer s 0 provided of course that the hydrostatic stability constraint 6 is fulfilled the salinity of the convective layer s will be in between s 0 and s 1 or eq 13 17 0 s 1 the geometry of the system will be fully specified by the non dimensional depth d of the upper layer in the big basin 18 d d d in view of eq 1 19 0 d 1 2 the non dimensional inter basin transports q i and the non dimensional sea surface heat flux h are

flow regimes for a constant sea surface heat flux in this section we generalize some results from w2000 and bk2019 to the case where temperature and salinity of the upper layer of the big basin are different from those of the lower layer in this section the case of a constant sea surface heat flux h is considered we will refer to this analysis in section 5 when exploring the case of the temperature dependent heat flux for computing figures below in the range of the presented non dimensional model parameters we use the values characteristic for the case study area in the greenland sea analysed in section 6 γ 0 25 d 0 1 θ 0 6 see section 6 for derivation of the parameters 4 1 threshold temperatures and heat fluxes three different regimes of water flows which are possible when h const will be referred as regime a b and c the transitions between the regimes take place at three threshold temperatures t nil t c and t cc defined as 25 t nil 1 θ 2 d 26 t c 1 θ 2 γ 1 2 γ d 27 t cc 1 θ 2 γ 1 γ d the dependence of these three temperature thresholds on γ is visualized in fig 2 the derivations of t nil t c and t cc are provided in appendices a 6 a 2 and a 3 respectively we also define two threshold heat fluxes h ab and h bc 28 h ab γ 2 2 γ 1 d 1 2 γ 1 2 γ d 29 h bc γ 2 1 γ d 1 2 γ 1 γ d note that both threshold fluxes are positive i e from the ocean regimes a b and c are summarized in table 1 a detailed analysis is provided in the following sections 4 2 regime a a weak sea surface heat flux regime a is observed for a weak heat flux to the atmosphere 0 h h ab for this regime the inflow into the small basin at the upper level is balanced by the outflow at the mid depth level while there is no flow at the bottom level q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 the equilibrium salinity of regime a is equal to zero s a 0 according to eq 13 the corresponding unscaled salinity of the mixed layer in the small basin s a is equal to that of the upper layer in the big basin s a s 1 the equilibrium temperature of regime a can be found by solving an appropriate quadratic equation from its two roots the smaller one should be chosen while the larger one should be ignored as the lyapunov stability analysis reveals that only the former one corresponds to the stable equilibrium of the dynamic system 22 23 appendix a 5 explicitly the unique stable equilibrium of regime a is reached at 30 t eq a h θ 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h 31 s eq a h 0 when h increases from zero to its first threshold level h ab the equilibrium temperature t eq a decreases monotonically from t nil to t c the mid depth transport q 2 a is 32 q 2 a h γ 2 4 γ 1 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h 1 2 d while q 1 a q 2 a and q 3 a 0 see appendix a 2 4 3 regime b a sea surface heat flux of medium intensity regime b is observed for a medium heat flux from the ocean h ab h h bc unlike regime a now the water exchange takes place at all three levels the inflow to the small basin at the upper level is balanced by the sum of outflows at the mid depth and the bottom levels q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 the steady state is again reached at s b 0 or s b s 1 for unscaled salinity similar to regime a the equilibrium temperature can be found from a quadratic equation where only the smaller root corresponds to the stable equilibrium while the larger one should be ignored appendix a 7 explicitly the stable equilibrium of regime b is reached at 33 t eq b h θ 1 3 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h 34 s eq b h 0 similar to regime a the equilibrium temperature of regime b monotonically decreases with h as h increases from h ab to h bc the temperature decreases from t c to t cc the mid depth flow q 2 b is 35 q 2 b h γ 1 6 γ 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h d the expressions for the flows at the upper and the lower levels are presented in appendix a 6 4 4 regime c a strong sea surface heat flux regime c the third possible flow regime requires a strong heat flux from the ocean h h bc similar to regime b there is a water exchange at all three levels however the direction of the flow at the mid depth level is now reverse and is directed from the big basin to the small one q 1 0 q 2 0 q 3 0 given the depth of the convective layer δ below the mid depth level d 2 in fact it is even below d the deep mixed layer of the small basin is now fed by two inflows with different salinity s 1 at the upper level and s 0 at the mid depth level thus the unscaled equilibrium salinity s lies between s 0 and s 1 for the scaled variable 0 s 1 similar to the previous cases two equilibria are found for regime c appendix a 8 but the lyapunov stability analysis now shows that both of them are stable appendix a 9 however to obey a sign constraint q 2 0 distinguishing regime c only one of these two stable equilibria will realize appendix a 10 the equilibrium state variables are 36 t eq c h γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d h 6 h 3 2 d b θ h b θ 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 37 s eq c h 1 2 γ 1 1 γ 4 γ 2 d 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 3 2 d in eqs 36 37 38 b γ 2 2 γ 1 d it can be easily seen from eq 37 that water salinity s eq c of regime c is an increasing positive concave function of h that is zero up to the threshold flux value h h bc and then grows converging to the asymptotic value 39 s 1 γ 2 γ 1 as h the temperature t eq c is always a decreasing function of h when h is large enough however its behaviour at smaller h depends on an interplay between the parameters γ d and θ it can be shown that t eq c h is a nonmonotonic function of h if and only if 40 1 θ 2 γ γ 2 1 γ 2 d then t eq c h initially increases with h when h slightly departs from h bc eventually reaches its maximum t max c t cc and then starts decreasing table 1 for further analysis section 5 it is important that where t eq c h is increasing it is for sure a concave function if the condition 40 is not fulfilled t eq c h monotonically decreases throughout the whole range of h of regime c appendix a 11 the mid depth flow q 2 c is 41 q 2 c h 1 γ 4 2 γ 1 3 2 d 2 8 γ 2 γ 1 h γ 2 d 3 1 2 1 γ 1 γ d the two other flows are presented in appendix a 6 4 5 overview of regimes a c in the present section we discuss the graphical representations of the solutions for regimes a c for a constant heat release to the atmosphere and make further comments on general properties of these solutions fig 3 presents t eq h for several values of θ and fixed γ while the upper panel of fig 4 shows t eq h for several values of γ at fixed θ these two graphs are computed with eqs 30 33 and 36 for regimes a b and c respectively the lower panel of fig 4 shows s eq h for several values of γ based on eqs 31 34 and 37 while fig 5 presents q 2 h computed with eqs 32 35 and 41 for the same values of γ neither s eq h nor q 2 h depend on θ appendix a 12 consider first a family of the curves t eq h for different values of θ shown in fig 3 all five curves are computed for d 0 1 and γ 0 25 characteristic for the greenland sea the value θ 0 0 corresponds to the case of the equal temperatures of the upper and the lower layers in the big basin t 1 t 0 θ 1 0 corresponds to the equal salinities s 1 s 0 section 3 2 the curve labelled θ 0 6 is close to the characteristic value for the greenland sea the vertical lines mark h 0 h ab and h bc i e the starting points of regimes a b and c respectively from eqs 28 and 29 neither h ab nor h bc depend on θ so the starting points for all three regimes lie on the vertical lines fig 3 for regimes a and b t eq h monotonically decreases with h for all θ for regime c whether t eq h is monotonous or not depends on the fulfilment of the constraint 40 obviously this constraint cannot be satisfied for any θ 1 so without estimating the r h s of eq 40 we find that the two upper curves in fig 3 must monotonically decrease for the three lower curves the constraint 40 is fulfilled and they are non monotonous it can be easily seen from eqs 10 and 16 that the above mentioned necessary condition of the non monotonic behaviour of t eq h θ 1 is equivalent to a simple constraint s 0 s 1 the family of curves of t eq h for different values of γ is shown in the upper panel of fig 4 here again d 0 1 and θ 0 6 as h ab and h bc do depend on γ the starting points b i and c i for regimes b and c are now curve specific the constraint 40 is fulfilled for the three upper curves while it is not fulfilled for the lower one therefore the three upper curves have an intermediate maximum while the lower curve is monotonically decreasing the properties of the equilibrium salinity curves the lower panel of fig 4 have been already discussed in section 4 4 the lower the value of γ the higher is the asymptotic salinity s eq 39 to which s eq h converges at large h however this asymptotic value is constrained within the limits 0 s 1 in unscaled variables the smaller the γ the closer is s to s 0 a family of curves q 2 h is shown in fig 5 the transport q 2 h is negative for regimes a and b while it is positive for regime c q 2 h decreases with h for regime a while it increases with h for regimes b and c it is interesting to notice that all curves of the family intersect at the same point n with coordinates h 2 d q 2 d therefore at h 2 d the flow q 2 depends neither on θ nor on γ the latter statement also applies to q 1 and q 3 see appendix a 12 all curves t eq h s eq h q i h i 1 2 3 are continuous functions of h note the curves labelled γ 0 25 in figs 4 and 5 these are computed for the same set of parameter values as the curve labelled with θ 0 6 in fig 3 and imitate situation for the greenland sea discussed below in appendix b we also provide the formulas for the dimensional temperature t h and the unscaled salinity s h for all three regimes 5 multiple steady states for a temperature dependent heat flux 5 1 preliminary remarks developing further the numerical results by w2000 in this section we derive analytical solutions for the tank model with temperature dependent relaxation sea surface heat flux 42 h k t sea t air k const the physical meaning of the parameter k c p ρ a w follows from the expression for the sensible heat flux h c p ρ a w t sea t air where c p 1 7 j kg 1 c 1 is the product of the specific heat of the air on the bulk heat transfer coefficient and ρ a 1 3 kg m 3 is the air density and w is the wind speed being proportional to the wind speed k can vary in a rather wide range of values following the notations of section 2 the temperature of the convective layer of the small basin is equal to t sea t 0 t where t is the sea surface temperature anomaly we introduce an analogous notation t air t 0 t where t is the near surface air temperature anomaly and rewrite eq 42 as 43 h k t t or in non dimensional terms 44 h k t t where 45 k k t s h s we assume that the air above the small basin should be cooler than the upper water layer in the big basin t 1 46 t 0 t t 1 or in non dimensional terms 47 t θ 0 5 2 graphical analysis of the possible equilibria the theory for the temperature dependent heat flux can be built on the theory for the constant heat flux described in section 4 in particular the equilibrium temperature for regimes a b and c will be determined by the same quadratic equations as before where the constant heat flux h should now be replaced with eq 44 it can be shown that quadratic equations for the equilibrium temperatures in regimes a and b remain quadratic after this substitution and a straightforward generalization of the previous analysis reveals that conclusions about stability of the related steady states remain unchanged explicitly in case of the relaxation heat flux 48 t eq a θ 1 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 49 t eq b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d k 3 2 2 d k 2 6 k t θ for regimes a and b respectively see appendices c 1 c 2 for detail the situation is not as simple for regime c it can be shown that after substituting the parametrization 44 the equilibrium temperature should be derived from a cubic equation a straightforward application of the theory of cubic equations would lead to cumbersome calculations therefore we will adopt a different strategy inspired by the numerical analysis by w2000 we first perform a graphical analysis and then support it with analytical results in h t space for constant k and t eq 44 is a straight line we will call it the flux line the latter equation can be also rewritten as 50 t h k t graphically we can overlay flux lines 50 on an equilibrium temperature curve t eq h for instance on one of the temperature curves in figs 3 or 4 the intersections of a flux line with the equilibrium temperature curve will mark the equilibria for the case of the temperature dependent heat flux dependent on the slope and the intercept of a flux line different cases are possible fig 6 five different flux lines shown in the figure correspond to different pairs of parameters k t as it is evident from the figure depending on the values of k t there can be either no equilibrium line j one equilibrium line k with the equilibrium point k1 two equilibria line l with the equilibria l1 l2 or three equilibria lines m and n with the equilibria m1 m2 m3 and n1 n2 n3 respectively it also follows from the discussion in section 4 4 that multiple equilibria are possible only if the curve t eq h is non monotonous i e if the constraint 40 is fulfilled as it is mentioned in section 4 5 the necessary condition is s 0 s 1 otherwise when the equilibrium temperature curve decreases monotonically for all h as the curve for γ 0 50 in the upper panel of fig 4 the flux line with a positive slope can intersect the temperature curve no more than once however the constraint 40 is a necessary but insufficient condition of multiple equilibria and further analysis is needed 5 3 a condition for existence of multiple steady states based on the graphical analysis above we will now derive an analytic constraint on k for existence of the multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux for multiple equilibria to be possible a flux line should cross the curve t eq h twice within regime c as mentioned above this may only happen if the curve t eq h is non monotonous then the intersection at a smaller h takes place at the ascending part of the curve where as mentioned in section 4 4 the curve is concave see e g the intersection points l1 m2 n2 in fig 6 therefore around this first equilibrium point within regime c the curve t c h should become steeper than the flux line in other words for existence of the equilibrium point at a smaller h should hold 51 d t c d h eq 1 k as for h varying from h bc to the abovementioned equilibrium point the derivative d t c d h is decreasing the constraint 51 holds if and only if 52 d t c d h h h bc 1 k to summarize we get the following condition of the multiple equilibria if and only if the constraint 52 is fulfilled for a certain value of k then it is possible to choose t in eq 44 such that the flux line crosses the curve t h within regime c that is at h h bc twice thus yielding two possible equilibria there in this latter case there also might exist the third steady state in regimes a or b lines m and n in fig 6 have three equilibria however this possibility holds not for all flux lines of this family see line l in fig 6 with only two equilibria explicitly the condition 52 takes the form 53 1 θ 2 γ γ 2 1 γ 2 d 1 3 2 1 2 1 γ 1 γ d 1 k in the limit of k eq 53 transforms into the already obtained condition 40 of the non monotonicity of the equilibrium temperature curve 3 3 a derivation of eq 53 is similar to that of eq 40 and is based on the analysis outlined in appendix a 11 as an example the boundaries of the multiple equilibria domain in the phase plane γ d given by eq 53 are shown in fig 7 for three values of parameter k 0 01 0 1 and 1 0 and for the particular case of θ 0 6 note that the middle curve labelled k 0 1 in fig 7 is close to what can be expected in the greenland sea discussed in section 6 the domain of the multiple equilibria for a particular value of k is below the corresponding curve note the similarity of fig 7 with fig 5 from w2000 derived from numerical experiments 5 4 stability analysis in the previous section we derived a criterion of the multiple steady states for the temperature dependent heat flux if this criterion is fulfilled for a given set of the model parameters and the multiple equilibria do exist the question arises are these equilibria stable the equilibria for regimes a or b are stable as it has been derived above for the constant heat flux this has already been discussed in section 5 2 below we briefly summarize the lyapunov stability analysis of the steady states for regime c derived in appendix c 3 1 an equilibrium at the descending part of the curve t eq c h if it exists is always stable 2 an equilibrium at the ascending part of the curve t eq c h if it exists is stable only if 54 d t c d h eq 1 k but in the latter case the condition 54 would contradict the condition 51 of existence of multiple equilibria if this is the equilibrium with a smaller h and a smaller t among the two therefore the equilibria l1 m2 and n2 in fig 6 are necessarily unstable for the other equilibrium with a larger h and a larger t even if it lies on the ascending part of the curve t eq c h the stability condition 54 is fulfilled see for example the point m3 in fig 6 therefore there might be from zero to three equilibria under the temperature dependent heat flux however in the case when two equilibria arise within regime c the first one with a smaller h and a smaller t is always unstable while the second one with a larger h and a larger t is always stable in other words when considering all three regimes in the case of three equilibria two of them are stable while the third middle one is unstable in fig 6 the points l1 m2 and n2 indicate unstable equilibria while all others k1 l2 m1 m3 n1 n3 are stable equilibria 6 deep convection in the greenland basin and water exchange with the neighbouring areas in this section we test the theoretical model against observations in the greenland sea fig 8a the greenland basin is the region of the most frequent deep convection in the greenland sea killworth 1983 marshall and schott 1999 fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 brakstad et al 2019 gradual deepening of the upper mixed layer begins in november while deep convection is observed from january to april marshall and schott 1999 alekseev et al 2001b fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 in the mid 1990s the deep convection in the greenland sea was of medium intensity the maximum mixing depth was of order of 1000 m then it intensified and stayed intensive from 2008 to at least 2016 the maximum mixing depth exceeded 1500 m ronski and budéus 2005 bashmachnikov et al 2019 the variations in the convection intensity in the greenland sea are often linked to variations of the ocean heat release to the atmosphere marshall and schott 1999 moore et al 2015 variations in the atlantic water inflow mostly entering the basin from the north influence temperature and salinity of the upper part of the water column in the convective site and presumably also affect the convection intensity alekseev et al 2001a glessmer et al 2014 lauvset et al 2018 both mechanisms form part of the theoretical model described in the previous sections which gives ground for validation of the model results against observations in the region the oceanographic data are obtained from armor3d dataset http marine copernicus eu the dataset contains gridded monthly global 3d fields of temperature salinity and geostrophic currents at the standard depth levels with the 0 2 5 0 2 5 spatial resolution verbrugge et al 2017 temperature salinity fields combine in situ temperature and salinity profiles with satellite observations guinehut et al 2004 2012 geostrophic currents are estimated by extrapolating the sea surface altimetry currents down using the thermal wind equations mulet et al 2012 atmospheric parameters are obtained from era interim reanalysis data dee 2016 on the 0 7 5 0 7 5 grid https apps ecmwf int datasets data interim full daily the ocean atmosphere heat fluxes are computed using the coare 3 5 algorithm fairall et al 2003 the area of the most frequent deep convection fedorov et al 2018 bashmachnikov et al 2018 in the greenland sea fig 8a b is bounded from the north by section n with the mean latitude of around 77 n and from the south by section s with the mean latitude of 71 5 n along the sill of the jan mayen fracture zone this area forms the small basin of the theoretical model the sections are oriented perpendicular to the east greenland current egc and are limited from the west by the shelf break of greenland as the shelf branch of the egc has a very limited exchange with the deep part of the greenland basin rudels et al 2002 dukhovskoy et al 2019 and it is not included in the analysis the point where the direction of the time mean meridional velocity changes from the southward to the northward is taken as the eastern limit of section n section s is limited from the east by jan mayen island water column of the central greenland sea can be roughly split into three layers each dominated by a certain water mass the upper layer 200 500 m thick is dominated by the recirculating atlantic water raw which is a mixture of the atlantic water of the west spitsbergen current and the arctic upper polar water rudels et al 2002 jeansson et al 2008 2017 the water mass has temperature of 0 to 3 c and salinity of 34 4 to 34 9 its lower limit is within the potential density range of σ θ 28 00 28 02 kg m 3 rudels et al 2002 from 500 to 1000 m the greenland sea intermediate water gsiw is observed with the characteristic temperature of 0 8 to 0 4 c and salinity around 34 90 below 1000 m the greenland sea deep water gsdw is detected with the characteristic temperature 1 2 to 0 8 c and salinity of around 34 91 the two latter water masses are formed as the mixture between the intermediate and deep arctic and atlantic water masses modified during winter deep convection events rudels et al 2002 jeansson et al 2008 langehaug and falck 2012 the boundary between the water mass lies in the potential density range of σ θ 28 05 28 07 kg m 3 rudels et al 2002 based on this information we took isopycnal σ θ 1 28 00 kg m 3 as the base of the upper layer in the big basin figs 1 and 8a as the isopycnal roughly marks the base of the raw fig 8c d isopycnal σ θ 2 28 06 kg m 3 separating the gsiw from gsdw is taken as the boundary between layers 2 and 3 fig 8c d to compare the natural system with the theoretical tank model we make the following assumptions water in the upper layer enters the convection area in the greenland basin through section n depth d is taken as the mean depth of isopycnal σ θ 1 at section n fig 8c while t 1 and s 1 are the mean temperature and salinity respectively of the upper layer at section n as the water reaches section s some water changes its density via heat release to the atmosphere with a relatively weak convection some fraction of the water lowers to the second layer gsiw and leaves the basin as q 2 with a strong convection some fraction of the water enters the deeper layer 3 gsdw and also leaves the basin as q 3 the maximum depth of the sill at section s is taken as the level d 1700 m fig 8d consequently in the simplified approach of the tank model the mid level flow q 2 leaves the basin at 850 m within the gsiw depth range the mean temperature and salinity of layers 2 and 3 are taken as t 0 and s 0 variations of these characteristics between the two layers and over the study region are relatively small and can be neglected a significant fraction of the water which enters the basin through section n streams through the basin as the topographically trapped egc not entering the central areas where deep convection occurs therefore to approach the design of the tank model fig 1 the transports q 1 q 2 and q 3 are computed as the differences between the transport entering the greenland basin through section n and that leaving the basin through section s however the fluxes though section s have to be taken with a certain time lag as it takes a certain time for water to pass 720 km from section n to section s with the mean velocity of the egc of 5 10 cm s 1 this distance is covered in 3 5 months therefore the fluxes in out of the small basin are computed as the difference between august to november transport through section n and the following january to april transport through section s the four month means additionally reduce the intra annual variations of the transport intensity the mean parameters of the greenland basin used for comparison with the theoretical model are listed in table 2 we also use the following physical parameters the coefficient of thermal expansion α 0 9 1 0 4 c 1 the coefficient of haline contraction β 7 6 1 0 4 the mean water density ρ 0 1028 kg m 3 the specific seawater heat capacity c p 4000 j c 1 kg 1 and the area of the small basin a 0 8 1 0 10 m 2 of the deep convection region fig 8a making use of the values of dimensional parameters provided in table 2 we obtain the characteristic values of the non dimensional parameters used in figs 2 5 and 7 γ 0 25 d 0 1 θ 0 6 in the greenland sea in table 2 the transports in out of the basin are not fully balanced whereas the theoretical model logically assumes the mass balance in the small basin eq a 11 the misbalance is 0 35 sv this may be due to unaccounted fluxes some water leaves the greenland basin to the lofoten basin northeast of jan mayen an integral transport by eddies is another unknown these relatively small fluxes are difficult to estimate however whatever is the re distribution of the mass misbalance between the layers q 1 always or predominantly remains positive q 3 always or predominantly remains negative and q 2 may take any sign given a very high dispersion of the estimate these results are consistent with the tank model design mean winter january to april heat flux from the ocean to atmosphere estimated within the area of the frequent development of deep convection fig 8a is h 110 30 w m 2 derived from era interim reanalysis h includes the sum of winter sensible and latent heat fluxes the merger is possible due to high correlation of the interannual variations of the two fluxes 0 96 while the total winter heat release to the atmosphere is well approximated by the doubled sensible heat flux the correlation coefficient is 0 99 then estimated heat flux h 2 c p ρ a w t sea t air and k 2 c p ρ a w see eq 42 the equilibrium temperature and salinity in the small basin and the transports at different water layers predicted by the theory section 4 appendix b depends in a nonlinear way on a number of input parameters that can be derived from observations with a limited accuracy see table 2 column 2 to account for these uncertainties we estimate t eq s eq and transports q 1 q 2 q 3 from the equations provided in section 4 and in appendix b using series of monte carlo mc experiments specifically for each of the mc experiments the values of the input parameters s 0 s 1 h d γ c are obtained from independent normal distributions with the means and standard deviations from the second column of table 2 the interannual variations of the parameters t 0 and t 1 are strongly correlated with s 0 0 9 and s 1 0 8 respectively t 0 and t 1 are therefore computed as dependent variables using the following regression equations 55 t 0 560 67 16 05 s 0 r 2 0 84 56 t 1 152 92 4 46 s 1 r 2 0 67 here r 2 is the coefficient of determination the results of the mc experiments corresponding to the constant sea surface heat release to the atmosphere section 4 are summarized in the third column of table 2 the mean modelled temperature in the convective region t eq is slightly above the freezing point the mean salinity s eq in the small basin is practically the same as the mean input salinity of the upper layer in the big basin s 1 this is because regimes a and b are clearly dominating over regime c table 3 the observations show a higher t eq and a lower s eq this is because the theoretical model does not take into account the effect of the vertical mixing with the more saline and warm lower layer during the deepening of the convective layer in regimes a and b only regime c allows for variations of salinity of the convective layer due to mixing with the water from layer 2 of the big basin in the model the lower salinity of the upper layer in the small basin is compensated by the lower temperature of the convective layer all fluxes in the greenland sea derived from the theoretical results have values of the same order as the observed ones q 1 is always positive q 3 is predominantly negative only the mean values of q 2 show different signs in the model and in observations however in observations as well as in the model results the sign of q 2 is the most uncertain as the standard deviations far exceed the mean values the results suggest a principal possibility of all three regimes a b c for different configurations of the input parameters with the abovementioned input parameters table 2 the probabilities of the system to stay in regimes a b and c are roughly 1 4 1 2 and 1 4 respectively table 3 the dominance of regime b corresponds to the signs of the mean values of q i derived from the observations table 2 when analysing the results of tables 2 and 3 one has to keep in mind that the mean transports at different levels as well as the probability of emergence of the regimes in a non linear way depend on a number of model parameters these can be obtained from the real ocean only after a number of assumptions on the regional dynamics making the parameter values uncertain and potentially leading to variations in the probabilities of emergence of the different flow regimes for example our additional experiments show that with the growth of the parameter c the probability of regime a grows in expense of regime c as mentioned the monte carlo experiments are based on the theory of the constant sea surface heat release however in the last row of table 3 we also assess the probability of falling into the regime with multiple steady states under assumption that all input parameters have the same statistics as before but the constant heat flux is replaced with the temperature dependent heat flux 42 from era interim reanalysis the winter mean air temperature over the convection region in the greenland sea is t air 6 0 1 5 c taking the typical heat flux see above we can estimate the parameter k h t sea t air 20 3 w m 2 c 1 note that for monthly means this parameter varies in a much wider range of values from 10 to 30 w m 2 c 1 for winter months the related characteristic value of a non dimensional parameter k 0 1 see fig 7 the derived value of k suggests the mean winter wind speed over the convective region w 5 m s 1 as can be derived from observations the probability of observing multiple steady states with the derived mean value of k 20 w m 2 c 1 is very low about 5 table 3 if making the estimates for an arbitrary k the possibility of the multiple equilibria becomes non negligible only if the values of k are taken substantially larger than those observed in the greenland sea these results suggest that in the greenland sea we do not expect the multiple equilibria to arise from a possible feedback between the horizontal advection and the deep convection 7 conclusions while demonstrating a versatile dynamic behaviour with qualitatively different flow regimes already for a relatively simple case of a constant time independent oceanic heat release to the atmosphere the whitehead s tank model experiments whitehead 2000 show even more interesting behaviour for a more complex case of a temperature dependent sea surface heat flux it is well known that many seemingly simple low dimensional dynamic systems can be studied only numerically quite surprisingly this is not the case with the dynamic system of whitehead s tank model in the present paper we generalized the original whitehead s model to the case of an arbitrary temperature and salinity of the layers further on departing from our previous analytical considerations for the constant ocean heat release to the atmosphere we have built an analytical theory for a more complex and a more realistic case of a temperature dependent heat release in particular we have derived a condition of existence of multiple equilibria in the form of an analytical constraint on non dimensional model parameters the constraint eq 53 suggests that multiple equilibria are possible only for a certain range of parameters γ d θ and k in particular if s 0 s 1 and therefore θ 1 no multiple equilibria are possible if γ eq 8 d eq 18 θ eq 16 are fixed the parameter k eq 45 should be large enough for multiple equilibria to exist additionally we have performed lyapunov stability analysis for co existing steady states and derived a simple stability criterion that also has a direct visual interpretation if the parameter range allows the multiple steady states in particular if k is large enough the stable steady states can be observed during a transition from to small heat fluxes h regimes a or b to from large heat flux h regime c this means that with a decrease increase of h the bistable system first shows a relatively weak evolution but at a certain critical value starts quickly drifting to another regime application of the model to the greenland sea suggests a high variability of the direction of q 2 from one winter to another which is the sign of transitions between the regimes derived in the theoretical model in particular the monte carlo experiment within the observed range of the model parameters confirms that different configuration of the parameters allows all three transport regimes a b and c among which regime b is clearly dominating however for the estimated values of k the emergence of the multiple steady states has a very low probability this means that the intensity of water exchange and the thermohaline parameters in the greenland sea should gradually change without jumps with variation of h consistent with the results by bashmachnikov et al 2019 we also note that the theoretical model does not account for the change of the thermohaline properties of the upper convective layer due to mixing with the lower layer during the convective events this leads to a certain deviation of the equilibrium temperature and salinity of the convective layer from the observations in particular having lower salinity the model predicts a lower mixed layer equilibrium temperature than observed this has implication on the critical heat fluxes marking the transitions between the regimes which should be lower than the model predicts overall in spite of the mentioned drawbacks and some difficulties in comparison of the highly simplified model with the observations we believe that whitehead s model which turned out to be analytically tractable is able to get an additional insight into the dynamics of the phenomenon of deep convection and its effect on the large scale ocean circulation the results might also serve a useful starting point for building more detailed and realistic models of deep convection with multiple steady states credit authorship contribution statement dmitry v

4 some of these derivations generalize the results reported by w2000 and bk2019 to the case of arbitrary temperature and salinity of water layers in the big basin while other ones are completely new a 1 pressure and transport estimates to compute transport q i at three levels i 1 2 3 we need to estimate the hydrostatic pressure at these levels in the big and the small basins when the temperature anomaly and salinity in the mixed layer of the small basin is defined as t s the density of the mixed layer in the small basin is eq 2 a 1 ρ sb ρ t s ρ 0 1 α t β s then the density difference between the lower layer of the big basin and the mixed layer of the small basin can be defined as a 2 δ ρ ρ l ρ sb ρ 0 α t β s 0 s we also denote the sea surface elevation in the small basin relative to that in the big basin as η note that η η where η is shown in fig 1 the hydrostatic pressure in the big basin at the level i 1 is a 3 p 01 0 and at the levels i 2 3 the hydrostatic pressure is a 4 p 0 i g ρ u d ρ l i 1 2 d d or equivalently a 5 p 0 i g δ ρ l u d ρ l i 1 2 d the hydrostatic pressure in the mixed layer of the small basin is a 6 p i g ρ 0 η ρ sb i 1 2 d the latter formula is valid at the levels i 1 2 for all flow regimes and at the level i 3 for regimes b and c only see the classification of flow regimes in section 4 1 then the pressure difference between the big and the small basins at the level i 1 is a 7 p 01 p 1 g ρ 0 η while at the levels i 2 3 it is a 8 p 0 i p i g δ ρ lu d ρ 0 η δ ρ i 1 2 d then in accordance with eqs 7 8 the flow at the level i 1 is a 9 q 1 γ c ρ 0 g η

the transports are balanced for all the flow regimes a 11 q 1 q 2 q 3 0 in regime a when q 3 0 the balance takes the form a 12 q 1 q 2 0 equations as a 11 a 12 are applicable for the scaled transports q i eq 20 as well for regime a the salinity of the small basin is s 1 so in eq a 10 δ ρ δ ρ where a 13 δ ρ ρ 0 α t β s 0 s 1 using eqs a 9 a 10 a 12 a 13 we get a 14 η 1 1 γ δ ρ d 2 δ ρ lu d ρ 0 for the flow q 1 to be positive i e to be directed from the big basin to the small one we should require η 0 it can be shown that the latter constraint is equivalent to a 15 t t nil here the first threshold temperature t nil is defined as a 16 t nil 2 α d β s 0 s 1 α t 0 t 1 d β s 0 s 1 d 2 for scaled variables see section 3 2 eqs a 15 a 16 take the form t t nil where t nil is provided by eq 25 from eqs a 9 a 10 a 14 the scaled flows of regime a are a 17 q 1 q 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 t θ 1 2 d or equivalently a 18 q 1 q 2 γ 2 2 γ 1 t t nil a 3 the convection depth and t c in this section we derive the mixed layer depth δ in the small basin for regime a δ d the hydrostatic pressure in both basins at depth δ should be the same then the pressure at the level i 3 in both basins is also the same and there is no flow at the level i 3 q 3 0 so we must require a 19 p 0 δ p δ analogously to eq a 8 a 20 p 0 δ p δ g δ ρ lu d ρ 0 η δ ρ δ where the notation a 13 is used then from eq a 19 a 21 δ ρ 0 η δ ρ lu d δ ρ by substituting η from eq a 14 we get after some rearrangements a 22 δ 1 1 γ d 2 γ d δ ρ lu δ ρ then the transition from regime a to b at δ d is equivalent to a 23 δ ρ 2 γ 2 γ 1 d d δ ρ lu or in non dimensional variables regime a is observed when t t c here the second threshold temperature t c is defined by eq 26 the transition from regime a to b occurs at t t c a 4 dynamic equations for temperature and salinity as the small basin is exposed to the sea surface cooling the dimensional dynamic equation for temperature can be written as a 24 ρ 0 c p v t t ρ 0 c p q 1 1 q 1 t 1 1 q 1 t 0 t q 2 1 q 2 t 0 1 q 2 t 0 t q 3 1 q 3 t 0 1 q 3 t 0 t a 0 h where a 0 is the area of the small basin and a 25 v a 0 δ is the volume of the mixed layer in the small basin h is the sea surface heat flux in the small basin h 0 if the heat flux is directed from the ocean to the atmosphere and the unit step function 1 x is defined by eq 24 given that a 26 q i 1 q i 1 q i q i and making use of the flow

dimensional form of eq a 27 is eq 22 given that a 28 q 1 0 q 3 0 is always true eq 22 is reduced to a 29 t t q 1 θ q 2 1 q 2 q 3 t h similar to eq a 24 the unscaled salinity varies as a 30 v s t q 1 1 q 1 s 1 1 q 1 s q 2 1 q 2 s 0 1 q 2 s q 3 1 q 3 s 0 1 q 3 s using again eqs a 11 and a 26 we rewrite eq a 30 as a 31 v s t q 1 1 q 1 s 1 s q 2 1 q 2 q 3 1 q 3 s 0 s finally the scaled salinity equation takes the form of eq 23 making use of eq a 28 the equation is reduced to a 32 s t q 1 s q 2 1 q 2 1 s a 5 regime a the steady states and their stability analysis for regime a in view of q 2 q

in the stationary case the equation takes the form a 35 q 1 t θ h 0 substituting eq a 17 into eq a 35 we get a 36 t θ 1 2 d t θ 2 γ 1 γ 2 h 0 the roots of this quadratic equation are a 37 t a θ 1 2 1 2 d 1 2 d 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 h we now perform the lyapunov stability analysis for two equilibrium temperatures of eq a 37 to do this we explore the linearized dynamic system a 33 a 34 in the vicinity of the equilibria a 38 δ t t δ s t m ˆ a δ t δ s where δ t and δ s are temperature and salinity perturbations respectively and the matrix m ˆ a is a 39 m ˆ a q 1 t t θ q 1 q 1 s t θ 0 q 1 the matrix m ˆ a is a diagonal matrix and therefore its eigenvalues are simply equal to its diagonal elements a 40 λ 1 a q 1 t t θ q 1 λ 2 a q 1 as q 1 0 the second eigenvalue λ 2 a is always negative it can be shown that the first eigenvalue a 41 λ 1 a γ 2 2 γ 1 2 t eq a θ 1 2 d will be negative for the equilibrium t a and positive for the equilibrium t a this means that the stable equilibrium corresponds to t a while the other equilibrium t a is unstable and should be ignored therefore for regime a we obtain the unique stable steady state 30 31 a 6 transport for regimes b and c and the threshold temperature t cc below we derive expressions for q i for regimes b and c as in regime c the scaled salinity s is no longer zero the general case of the density difference δ ρ eq a 2 should be used in calculations this differs from calculations for regime a appendix a 2 where the specific case of δ ρ eq a 13 was explored from eqs a 9 a 10 a 11 the surface elevation now becomes a 42 η 1 2 γ δ ρ 3 d 2 δ ρ lu 2 d

non dimensional transports q i become a 48 q 1 3 2 t 1 θ 1 s 2 d a 49 q 2 1 γ 1 2 t 1 θ 1 s d a 50 q 3 2 γ 1 2 t 1 θ 1 s d transition from regime b to c occurs when q 2 0 here still s 0 from eq a 49 it is easy to see that this transition takes place at the third threshold temperature t cc given by eq 27 a 7 regime b the steady states and their stability analysis for regime b eqs a 33 a 34 a 35 a 39 are still valid but q 1 is now given by a different expression derived from eq a 48 when s 0 a 51 q 1 3 2 t θ 3 2 2 d similar to regime a s eq b 0 substituting eq a 51 into eq a 35 we find two equilibrium temperatures which are the roots of the related quadratic equation a 52 t b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d 3 2 2 d 2 6 h the stability analysis for regime b is fully analogous to regime a above the first eigenvalue is a 53 λ 1 b 3 t eq b θ 3 2 2 d while the second eigenvalue still obeys an equation λ 2 b q 1 and is therefore negative λ 1 b is negative for the equilibrium temperature t b and positive for t b therefore the stable equilibrium corresponds to t b while the equilibrium t b is unstable and should be ignored therefore regime b is also characterized by the unique stable steady state 33 34 a 8 regime c the steady states for regime c the dynamic system a 29 a 32 takes the form a 54 t t q 1 θ q 3 t h a 55 s t q 1 s q 2 1 s making use of eq a 11 we can rewrite this system as a 56 t t q 2 θ q 3 t θ h a 57 s t q 2 q 3 s the system for the corresponding steady states becomes a 58 q 2 θ q 3 t θ h 0 a 59 q 2 q 3 s 0 we now multiply eq a 59 by θ and add the resultant equation to eq a 58 to get a 60 q 3 t θ 1 s h from eqs a 49 a 50 it is easy to derive a general relation between transports q 2 and q 3 valid for both regimes b and c a 61 q 2 a q 3 b where a 62 a 1 γ 2 γ 1 b γ 2 2 γ 1 d substituting eq a 61 in eq a 59 we rewrite the latter equation as a 63 q 3 s a b or equivalently a 64 q 3 b s a substituting eq a 64 in eq a 60 we get a 65 t θ 1 s h s a b at the same time it follows from eqs a 50 and a 64 that a 66 t 1 θ 1 s 2 γ 2 γ 1 d b s a finally subtracting eq a 65 from eq a 66 we obtain an equation for a single unknown the equilibrium salinity s a 67 1 s 2 γ 2 γ 1 d b s a h s a b in further analysis we introduce a notation a 68 ψ a s b where the reversal of the latter expression is a 69 s a b ψ then eq a 67 can be rewritten as a quadratic equation for the variable ψ a 70 h b ψ 2 2 γ 2 γ 1 d 1 a ψ 2 γ 2 γ 1 0 its roots are a 71 ψ γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b from eq a 65 a 72 t 1 a θ h b θ ψ and we get two potential temperature equilibria for regime c a 73 t c γ 2 2 γ 1 1 h b 3 2 d h 6 h 3 2 d b θ h b θ 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b an analysis in appendix a 10 shows that in eqs a 71 and a 73 the root with the sign should be chosen thus a 74 ψ 4 3 2 d 2 8 2 γ 1 γ h b 3 2 d making use of eq a 69 for the equilibrium salinity of regime c we come to the solution 37 notice that s eq c does not depend on θ a 9 regime c stability analysis similar to regimes a and b the lyapunov stability analysis for regime c is performed for a linearized dynamic system derived from eqs a 56 a 57 the matrix of the linearized system takes the form a 75 m ˆ c q 2 t θ q 3 t t θ q 3 q 2 s θ q 3 s t θ q 2 t q 3 t s q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 after somewhat lengthy algebra we find compact equations for trace and determinant of the matrix a 75 a 76 tr m ˆ c 3 q 3 3 2 d det m ˆ c q 3 2 q 3 3 2 d for eigenvalues λ 1 c λ 2 c of the two dimensional matrix m ˆ c the following equations hold a 77 λ 1 c λ 2 c tr m ˆ c λ 1 c λ 2 c det m ˆ c then using eqs a 76 we immediately find both eigenvalues a 78 λ 1 c q 3 λ 2 c 2 q 3 3 2 d as q 3 0 both eigenvalues are negative and therefore both potential equilibria derived for regime c appendix a 8 are stable we see that unlike regimes a and b here the stability analysis in itself does not help excluding the wrong equilibrium therefore selection of the equilibrium for regime c requires additional analysis given in appendix a 10 it is interesting to note that despite the temperature parameter θ of the generalized theory enters eq a 75 and is used for the intermediate calculations for the eigenvalues not shown it does not explicitly enter the final results a 78 the expressions for the eigenvalues take the same form as in bk2019 where they were derived for a particular case t 1 t 0 s 1 0 implicitly the flux q 3 does of course depend on θ eq a 50 a 10 regime c selection of permissible steady state as derived in appendix a 9 the stability analysis itself does not answer the question which of two equilibria or none of them or both should be retained as the steady state solution for regime c the graphical analysis of this section should reveal whether the obtained equilibria are compatible with the constraints of the theory eq a 66 can be written as a 79 t f s where a 80 f s 1 θ s 1 2 γ 2 γ 1 d 2 γ 2 γ 1 b s a at the same time the constraint q 2 0 that indicates regime c in view of eq a 50 has the following form a 81 t f q s where a 82 f q s 1 θ s 1 2 γ 1 γ d finally the linear relation a 65 of t and s can be rewritten as a 83 t f h s where a 84 f h s ξ θ s 1 3 γ 2 γ 1 ξ and the positive parameter ξ is defined as a 85 ξ h b in summary the following constraints should be fulfilled a 86 f s f q s f h s f q s f s f h s assigning the new functions a 87 g s f s f q s g h s f h s f q s constraints of eq a 86 become a 88 g s 0 g h s 0 g s g h s explicitly a 89 g s 2 γ 2 γ 1 b s a γ 2 1 γ d a 90 g h s ξ 1 s 1 3 γ 2 γ 1 ξ 2 γ 1 γ d the hyperbola g s eq a 89 is shown in fig a 9 the scaled salinity anomaly s varies within the limits 0 s 1 the singularity of the hyperbola at s a lies within these limits note that g 0 0 and the function g s monotonically decreases from 0 to with s increasing from 0 to a in view of eq a 88 the equilibrium of regime c can occur only on this negative segment of the hyperbola g s 0 s a the positive branch a s 1 is excluded from further analysis as 1 ξ the straight line g h s has a positive or in a limiting case a zero slope it will intersect the permissible negative segment of the hyperbola g s if and only if g h 0 0 that means the point m on the vertical axis in fig a 9 is at or below the zero point the line g h s will intersect the negative segment of the hyperbola only once yielding an equilibrium at some point a the second intersection of g h s with the positive branch of the hyperbola point b should be excluded to summarize for regime c if g h 0 0 there is only one permissible steady state if g h 0 0 there are no permissible steady states an explicit calculation shows that the constraint g h 0 0 is equivalent to the constraint a 91 ξ 2 γ 1 1 γ 1 2 γ 1 γ d the latter in turn is simply equivalent to the constraint h h bc which defines regime c eq 29 this means that for regime c the permissible equilibrium exists and is unique we can now answer the question which sign to choose in eqs a 71 and a 73 from the analysis above fig a 9 it follows that among the two possible equilibria points a and b the one corresponding to smaller s is to be chosen imagine now the straight line t f h s eq a 84 the sign of its slope ξ θ is equal to the sign of h b θ if the slope is positive we should choose the equilibrium with a smaller t among the two but in such a case h b θ 0 and one has to choose in eq a 73 if the slope is negative we should choose the equilibrium with a larger t among the two but in such a case h b θ 0 and one has again to choose in eq a 73 therefore one always has to choose in eq a 73 and the permissible equilibrium for regime c is given by eqs 36 37 a 11 properties of t eq c h for regime c in the present section we explore properties of the equilibrium temperature t eq c h for regime c using eq 36 first we define some auxiliary parameters a 92 m 3 2 d p 8 2 γ 1 γ l b 1 θ and auxiliary functions a 93 z h h b r z m 2 p z note that the parameters m and p of eq a 92 are always positive while the parameter l can have any sign also in eq a 93 r z m for regime c then a 94 t z 3 γ 2 γ 1 θ 4 f z where the new function f z is defined as a 95 f z z l r z m differentiating f z with respect to z we get after some rearrangements a 96 f z r z m 2 p l 2 r z r z m 2 it follows from eq a 96 that f z is for sure positive for large r or equivalently for large z i e large h and that f z has either no or only one zero in regime c the condition of having one zero can be derived from eq a 96 and takes the explicit form of eq 40 note that this is possible only if θ 1 note also that when f z 0 the absolute value of f z is decreasing with r and hence with z coming back to eq a 94 we see that for regime c t eq c h either monotonically decreases or when the constraint 40 is fulfilled initially increases passes through the maximum and then starts decreasing when t h 0 the absolute value of t h decreases with h so that the equilibrium temperature is a concave function of h a 12 further properties of solutions with a constant heat flux independence of s eq h from θ follows from explicit expressions for s eq h for regimes a c eqs 31 34 and 37 and from the fact that the threshold fluxes of the regimes h ab and h bc do not depend on θ similar arguments apply to q 2 h as all three transports are connected by simple linear relations appendices a 2 a 6 this is also true for q 1 h q 3 h the point h 2 d is within regime b at this point t eq b θ 1 eq 33 s eq b 0 so in expressions a 48 a 50 for all q i the term t 1 θ 1 s 0 and at h 2 d q i depend neither on θ nor on γ explicitly q 1 2 d 2 d q 2 2 d q 3 2 d d appendix b

analytical results the temperature dependent heat flux from the ocean surface in this appendix we provide derivations of analytical results presented in section 5 for the case of the temperature dependent heat release by the ocean c 1 regime a the steady states and their stability analysis the analysis of regime a in case of a temperature dependent heat flux is similar to the case of a constant heat flux considered in appendix a 5 it is convenient to re write the temperature dependent heat flux 44 as c 1 h k t θ t θ substituting the latter equation in eq a 36 we get c 2 t θ 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 2 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ 0 the two roots of this quadratic equation are c 3 t a θ 1 2 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 1 2 d γ 1 γ 2 k 2 8 γ 1 γ 2 k t θ in order to make a decision on which sign in eq c 3 to choose we do the stability analysis of the dynamic system a 33 a 34 with h replaced with its temperature dependent form 44 eq a 39 now becomes c 4 m ˆ a q 1 t t θ q 1 k q 1 s t θ 0 q 1 as in appendix a 5 this is a diagonal matrix and its eigenvalues are equal to its diagonal elements c 5 λ 1 a q 1 t t θ q 1 k λ 2 a q 1 here λ 2 a is always negative to determine the sign of λ 1 a we notice that eq a 41 now becomes c 6 λ 1 a γ 2 2 γ 1 2 t eq a θ 1 2 d k it can be seen that λ 1 a 0 when there is sign in eq c 3 while λ 1 a 0 when the sign is the stable solution requires sign and we come to eq 48 c 2 regime b the steady states and their stability analysis in the case of a temperature dependent heat flux the quadratic equation for equilibrium temperature for regime b derived from eq a 35 becomes c 7 3 2 t θ 2 3 2 2 d k t θ k t θ 0 its roots are c 8 t b θ 1 3 3 2 2 d k 3 2 2 d k 2 6 k t θ similar to the expression a 53 the first eigenvalue of the matrix of linearized dynamic system now is c 9 λ 1 b 3 t eq b θ 3 2 2 d k it can be seen that λ 1 b 0 when in eq c 8 the sign is while λ 1 b 0 when the sign is the second eigenvalue λ 2 b is always negative therefore the stable solution corresponds to sign in eq c 8 and we come to eq 49 c 3 regime c stability analysis in this section we perform the stability analysis for regime c for the temperature dependent heat flux to the atmosphere the matrix of the linearized system analogous to eq a 75 becomes c 10 m ˆ c q 2 t θ q 3 t t θ q 3 k q 2 s θ q 3 s t θ q 2 t q 3 t s q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 both eigenvalues of a two dimensional

bottom right element of the matrix c 10 c 13 m 22 c q 2 s q 3 s s q 3 from eq c 12 we immediately see that the first constraint of eq c 11 is automatically fulfilled while the second one requires further analysis using notations from appendix a 11 we find c 14 q 3 2 q 3 3 2 d r r m 8 c 15 m 22 c 1 4 r m r m 2 8 γ 2 γ d 1 θ at the same time it can be shown that c 16 d t d h 2 r r m 2 r m 2 8 γ

t d h 0 one must additionally impose the constraint 54 overall the stability analysis justifies the corollaries of section 5 4 
23948,the ensemble four dimensional variational en4dvar data assimilation da system introduced in part i pasmans and kurapov 2019 is tested in the coastal waters offshore oregon and washington u s west coast during the spring and summer of 2011 the background error covariance b is derived from the forecast ensemble satellite sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh and daily averaged radial surface currents from high frequency radars hfrs are assimilated the performance of the en4dvar system is compared with a traditional 4dvar system using a static b it is found that the presence of the columbia river plume has a profound impact on the ensemble b near the plume front the sst sss covariance can be up to a factor 20 larger in magnitude than in the static b this introduces large spatial and temporal variability in the ensemble b the en4dvar system is more successful than the 4dvar with the static b preserving the temperature salinity properties when compared to glider data the en4dvar system also produces more accurate forecasts and analyses for temperature in the subsurface below 30 m at a buoy location on the continental shelf in comparisons with other surface and subsurface observations en4dvar shows consistent albeit not significant improvement over traditional 4dvar large surface temperature salinity covariances in combination with the episodic occurrence of large scale errors in the sst observations lead to erroneous freshening in the centre of the model domain adding constraints on the surface salinity corrections based on the prior model reduces this effect keywords 4dvar data assimilation coastal oceanography ensemble background error covariance river plume usa oregon 1 introduction for the benefit of the local fishing communities government agencies and other users the oregon state university osu coastal ocean forecast system has provided forecasts of temperature salinity currents and other oceanic fields of interest in the oregon washington or wa coastal area http nvs nanoos org explorer while the system does produce useful forecasts we continue exploring ways to improve its performance in this system initial conditions for the forecasts are corrected by assimilating surface observations using the 4dvar data assimilation da algorithm in a series of 3 day windows this requires specification of the forecast or background error covariance b the b currently implemented in the or wa system is static i e it does not change from one assimilation window to the next in this covariance the balance operator and its adjoint counterpart kurapov et al 2011 weaver et al 2005 are used to correlate errors in different components of the ocean state vector including ssh and three dimensional fields of the horizontal velocity temperature and salinity the balance operator uses diagnostic relations such as geostrophy thermal wind balance the linearised equation of state and a simplified linear temperature salinity relation based on multiyear glider observations details on the balance operator used can be found in appendix a coastal waters in the or wa area are very dynamic with wind driven currents in excess of 0 5 ms 1 strong temperature fronts geostrophic and ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and jets separating from the shelf towards the ocean interior koch et al 2010 the freshwater outflow from the columbia river creates a shallow plume hereafter referred to as the plume that spreads over a large area berdeal et al 2002 hickey et al 2005 huyer et al 2005 liu et al 2009 the location of the columbia river plume changes on seasonal and shorter time scales in response to the winds in summer due to the predominantly southward winds the columbia river plume is transported to the south of the river mouth and offshore with the coastal upwelling during periods of wind relaxation the plume is advected towards the coast freshening the coastal waters off oregon in such a dynamic area the utility of a static b can be limited one way to capture the time varying dynamics in b is to estimate it from an ensemble of perturbed model runs this approach has been tested in meteorology with varying results kuhl et al 2013 found that replacing the static b with one coming partially from an ensemble 3dvar system in the naval research laboratory atmospheric variational data assimilation system accelerated representer navdas ar system reduced background errors in contrast running an ensemble kalman filter to produce b the met office found that a system using a pure ensemble b resulted in an overall degradation of performance and produced forecasts with larger root mean square errors rmse compared to a system using a static climatological background covariance lorenc and jardak 2018 in this study we aim to compare 4dvar with static b and ensemble b both applied to a realistic ocean model in part i pasmans and kurapov 2019 the en4dvar method generating the ensemble b was described the or wa coastal ocean forecast system was used to illustrate the computational efficiency of the cluster search minimisation algorithm and to introduce essential statistical tests of the dynamical ensemble and the resulting time variable b however we did not demonstrate if in any regard the use of the more computationally demanding en4dvar yields an improvement in the forecast accuracy compared to a traditional 4dvar system with the static balance operator b this void is filled here in the process of this study we recognise one of the general potential dangers using en4dvar for poorly observed fields by design an ensemble yields large variances and hence covariances in frontal areas at the same time if observations are affected by large scale errors or biases in these areas unobserved fields can receive a large and erroneous correction in our case satellite sst observations are occasionally found to contain large scale spatial biases combined with the large and negative temperature salinity covariance in the columbia river plume and along the oregon coastal upwelling front assimilation of the biased sst results in unrealistically large corrections to the surface salinity this issue motivated us to test methodology to constrain the near surface salinity based on the forecast solution the so called salinity constraint sc procedure this paper is organised as follows section 2 provides a summary of the ocean model en4dvar da and the 4dvar da system in this section we also introduce the sc procedure developed to deal with the erroneous corrections to the salinity discovered during this study horizontal and vertical spatial patterns of the static and the ensemble b are compared in section 3 the problems with the salinity field are illustrated in section 4 analyses and forecasts from the en4dvar system are compared to the model without assimilation and with the standard 4dvar in section 5 in section 6 our findings are summarised and some other approaches not considered here e g hybrid covariances are briefly discussed 2 model experiments in the or wa system nonlinear forecasts are obtained using the regional ocean modeling system roms www myroms org with

the salinity in this paper is reported according to the pss 78 standard and following iapso 1985 oceanographic standard is reported as dimensionless quantity the 4dvar da utilises the avrora tangent

control run cases bal ens and ens sc and each ensemble member ens ens sc are updated at the beginning of each window by the assimilation of the goes satellite sea surface temperature sst daily averaged radial current observations from high frequency radars hfr and along track satellite sea surface height ssh altimetry see pasmans and kurapov 2019 for the details on the data sets used prior to assimilation the resolution of the sst and hfr observations is reduced to the resolution of the tangent linear and adjoint models by averaging the sst observations over 4 4 km horizontal cells and radial hfr data over 5 5 km cells the 24 h average of the tides based on the harmonical analysis of the no da model is added to the detided absolute dynamic topography ssh observations in the da system this is matched against the 24 h average of the model ssh with the model and observed means removed along each satellite track no in situ observations are assimilated because of inherent problems assimilating very sparse hydrographic profiles pasmans et al 2019 in every assimilation forecast cycle the nonlinear roms is run for 6 days starting from the corrected initial conditions the model output over the first three days is referred to as the analysis and the next three days as the forecast corrections x m to the ocean state at the beginning of each da window for both the control run and each of the ensemble members m are calculated by maximising the conditional probability 1 p x m d m p d m x m p x m with respect to x m here indicates that the two sides are equal apart from a proportionality constant the equality in 1 follows from bayes theorem d m is the vector with innovations i e the differences between observations and the nonlinear forecast predictions for the observations p x m d m the probability that the background error is x m given the innovations d m p d m x m the probability that the innovations are d m given that the background error is x m and p x

m the tangent linear model i e the roms model linearised around the forecast the observation error covariance r is assumed to be diagonal in this case the maximisation of p x m d m in 1 is equivalent to the minimisation of the cost function courtier et al 1994 egbert et al 1994 2 j x m j o b s x m j b x m in experiments ens and ens sc an ensemble of 40 forecasts is carried throughout the study period the control run is computed using the wind forcing without perturbations the other 39 runs are carried using perturbed winds and perturbed observations see pasmans and kurapov 2019 sec 4 the model fields for ssh salinity temperature and velocity are averaged over a period beginning 12 h prior to the da window start time and ending 12 h after the start time the time averaged fields of the 39 runs are then utilised to compute b based on the findings in pasmans and kurapov 2017 localisation is applied in the horizontal such that zero correlations are imposed on points spaced further than 100 km apart the wind perturbations are linear combinations of the empirical orthogonal functions eofs derived from the nam wind fields with their coefficients drawn from normal distributions daubechies wavelets are added to these wind perturbations to represent the small scale errors in the wind field distributions of the eof coefficients are determined by comparison of the model wind field with ascat scatterometer data using a bayesian hierarchical model pasmans and kurapov 2019 all ensemble members start off from the same initial state that is taken from experiment no da on 10 march 2011 and are run till 19 april with perturbed winds but without da as the ensemble perturbations to the ocean state are generated from the perturbations in the wind forcing using the physics that is contained in the model it is assumed that the ensemble perturbations are consistent with the ocean dynamics therefore it is expected that the da corrections are in leading order in geostrophic balance and that the amplitude of the transient solutions that emanate from the da corrections are sufficiently small that no model blow ups occur indeed in the control run of experiments ens and ens sc no blow ups are encountered sporadically a blow up is encountered in one of the ensemble members these blow ups however are not due to the da corrections as rerunning the ensemble member with different wind forcing perturbations resolves the problem the solution x m that minimises the cost function j in 2 for each ensemble is approximated using a numerical iterative solver in case of the popular reduced b conjugate gradient rbcg method gürol et al 2014 the approximation to x m would be sought in a subspace that is expanded by 1 dimension in each inner loop iteration for en4dvar this method was deemed too time and resource consuming instead the newly developed cluster search method is used to approximate x m in the cluster search method the search subspace is expanded by n s 1 dimensions per inner loop iteration if n s 1 the cluster search method is identical to the rbcg method for n s 1 the cluster search still searches for the same solution as ordinary 4dvar i e x m that minimises equation 2 or 3 but it converges faster than rbcg full details on the cluster search method can be found in pasmans and kurapov 2019 sec 3 for practical reasons we use the cluster search method with n s 4 and 12 inner loop iterations in this study in experiment bal no ensemble is available in order to use cluster search and thus accelerate convergence of the traditional 4dvar a low rank surrogate ensemble is generated as explained in appendix b it is found in case ens that unphysical da corrections to the sea surface salinity sss can occur to reduce this effect salinity constraints sc are added to the 4dvar cost function 2 these constrains nudge the da correction towards the prior model salinity we do not want to nudge sss to the prior model point by point since this would suppress changes to the location of the river plume front constraining simply the area averaged sss does not effectively mitigate the adverse effect of the biased sst since the domain averaged sss can be preserved when salinity is wildly redistributed instead we cover the surface area in the model interior with a hierarchy of boxes or rectangles fig 1 the largest box spans the entire domain area inside the blue edges in fig 1 excluding the domain edges and also excluding puget sound in the northeast corner of our domain the next level of boxes areas inside the green edges is obtained by dividing the largest box blue edges into 4 level 3 boxes areas bounded by the red edges are obtained by dividing level 2 boxes areas bounded by the green edges by 4 and so on in order not to impede corrections on the scale of the background error covariance r 25 km only five levels of boxes are used the areas bounded by the blue green red cyan edges respectively plus a level not shown in fig 1 in this way the smallest boxes have dimensions of 30 65 km the prior forecast sss from a earlier window can then be averaged in each of these boxes at the beginning of the current assimilation window by a sampling operator h s these averaged salinity values are treated as additional observations the computational cost of implementing this scheme in the 4dvar is negligible using the incremental 4dvar formulation 2 the innovation vector d m corresponding to these synthetic data is zero and an additional term is added to cost function 2 this term provides a penalty on the deviations of the box averaged sss from the prior 3 j s c i δ s i 2 σ s i 2 here δ s i is the da change in the box averaged salinity of box i and σ s i some specified variability we have opted to base these values for σ s i on the natural variance in experiment no da for two reasons first 4dvar corrections are applied to all ensemble members and consequently the large salinity corrections can exaggerate the ensemble spread resulting in unrealistically large estimates of σ s i 2 from the ensemble second the additional penalty terms serve solely to limit sss corrections to climatologically realistic values contrary to the no da solution the 4dvar ensemble is not available prior to da and therefore cannot be used to estimate climatological values specifically the value for σ s i 2 has been determined by first calculating the box sss in no da at the beginning of each window then taking differences in the box sss between consecutive windows and after this defining σ s i 2 as 5 of the variance in these sss differences for box i this yields average values of the standard deviation σ s i of 0 058 0 12 0 17 0 21 and 0 23 for the boxes at levels 1 through 5 respectively as the period covered in the case no da is limited to one upwelling season it is possible that in reality the plume front moved beyond the maximal extent of the plume in experiment no da in that case the values for σ s i obtained using the aforementioned procedure would underestimate the background error in the sss the application of salinity constraints under these conditions would lead to unnecessary local suppression of da corrections to the sss even though in practice the salinity constraints are implemented as additional observations they are no actual observations and j s c depends solely on the background errors in the model sss therefore in the interpretation of da based on bayes theorem the addition of j s c to the cost function is equivalent with replacing the a priori background error probability distribution p x m in 1 with p x m exp j b x m exp 1 2 x m t h s t σ 2 h s x m where σ is a diagonal matrix with the values σ i on its diagonal i e da corrections that change surface salinity on scales equal or larger than the scale of the smallest boxes become less probable than they would be without the addition of j s c in this way sss corrections on scales smaller than 20 km are not impacted by the additional penalty while large scale corrections will result in changes of box averaged salinity in multiple boxes at multiple levels thus rapidly increasing j s c the da case in which 3 is added to cost function 2 is referred to as ens sc experiment bal uses the standard 4dvar with the static balance operator b as described in kurapov et al 2011 and appendix a experiment bal also uses the sc to enable a fair comparison with ens sc the en4dvar experiment with physically acceptable salinity fields 3 covariances in this section spatial structures in the static balance operator based and ensemble b are compared first comparisons will be made for the offshore part of the ocean where dynamics are governed at the lowest order by geostrophy and where the balance operator covariance is expected to be an accurate approximation of the background error covariance then a similar analysis will be obtained for a location near the plume edge the focus will be on the correlations and covariances with sst as this is the field for which most observations are available surface maps of the background error correlation between t at a point far offshore r 0 127 57 w 47 00 n and fields of t s and surface currents are shown in fig 2 in the balanced b fig 2a b the sst velocity correlation plotted as a vector field exhibits an anticyclonic eddy consistent with lowering of the isopycnal surfaces in the core of such an eddy contrary to other implementations of the balance operator in oceanography balmaseda et al 2008 2013 weaver et al 2005 our implementation of the balance operator does not have an unbalanced component i e it is assumed that all background errors can be derived from the background error in the ocean temperature as a consequence the static balanced t s cross correlation fig 2b is apart from a sign change equal to the static balanced t t correlation fig 2a in particular the t s correlation at r 0 is 1 the correlation between t r 0 and the surface velocity in the vicinity of this location peaks at 0 41 we hypothesise that far offshore away from strong coastal fronts and jets the ensemble b computed using daily averaged member fields yields correlation structures that are overall close to the static balanced b to test this ensemble perturbations from the window ensemble mean are collected from all ensemble members and all windows in experiment ens these n n t perturbations with n t the number of da windows and n 39 the number of ensemble members forms a set to which we will refer as the super ensemble the correlation structures obtained from this super ensemble fig 2c d are qualitatively similar to the static balanced b fig 2a b a more quantitative assessment reveals that the t r 0 s r 0 correlation is only 0 58 compared to the value of 1 in the balanced b this is partly due to the fact that mean vertical profiles of t and s are different from window to window affected by the wind driven mixing and other conditions the cross correlation of t r 0 with the surface velocity field is also weaker with peak magnitudes reaching 0 15 0 21 correlation maps for locations near the upwelling front reveal more complicated horizontal structures particularly if computed for a single assimilation window fig 3 shows the surface ensemble error correlation for a point chosen at the inshore edge of the river plume s 31 5 on 9 july 2011 the fresher warmer plume water is found to the west and saltier and colder upwelled water to the east of this location the error in the surface t r 0 is strongly correlated with the error in the cross front surface current correlation magnitudes up to 0 79 reflecting the dominance of the advection mechanism displacing the front the point where the temperature velocity correlation is the largest is marked by a green dot the largest t s correlation in this surface map is also large in magnitude 0 86 to analyse the impact of the river plume on the t t and t s ensemble error correlations fifty 200 km meridional sections are selected randomly in each assimilation window along each section the ensemble averaged sss is determined using the same ensemble of 24 h averaged ocean states that is also used in the calculation of the ensemble based background covariance if the minimum ensemble averaged salinity along the section is larger than 31 5 the section is classified as outside the plume if the maximum ensemble averaged salinity along the section is lower than 31 5 the section is classified as inside the plume only sections fully inside or outside the plume are retained for analysis here the ensemble correlation between the sst at the middle point of each section and sst and sss along the length of each section have been calculated using all 39 ensemble members excluding the control forecast run the localised ensemble correlations found in this way along the different sections are shown in fig 4 grey lines the average ensemble correlations dashed lines are obtained by first removing the ensemble mean from each section and combining the ensemble perturbations from all different sections spanning all windows into one super ensemble the correlation is then calculated from this super ensemble the t s cross correlations in individual sections and windows grey lines vary widely e g taking either sign outside the plume fig 4c consequently the averaged cross correlation at the central point 0 25 is only a fraction of the 1 0 cross correlation used in the balance operator within the plume fig 4d the averaged t s ensemble correlation is closer to the balance operator correlation being mostly negative and yielding the averaged value of 0 73 at the section centre qualitative analysis of the satellite sst imagery and surface model fields suggests that the columbia river plume water is relatively warmer than the ambient ocean partly since the river source is warmer and possibly also since strong stratification inhibits downward vertical turbulent heat flux at the base of the river plume the higher temperature of the plume compared to the surrounding ocean explains the more definitive negative t s error correlation within the plume compared to areas outside in the balanced b the t t and t s horizontal correlations have a gaussian shape the correlation is thus 60 and 14 of its peak value at distances r 25 km and 2 r 50 km respectively where r is the horizontal correlation length scales assumed in the balance operator covariance for the averaged ensemble correlations in fig 4 we determine the distances from the centre r at which the average correlations have dropped to 60 and 14 of their value at r 0 for the correlation without localisation these distances are found to lie between 14 20 and 40 54 km while the latter is comparable to the 50 km value in the balance operator the former is smaller than its balance operator equivalent so although both correlations decrease to 14 of their maximum values in about the same distance the ensemble correlations decrease faster than the gaussian this is also directly visible in fig 4a b as expected the localisation scheme creates an additional reduction in scale for the localised correlations the above referenced correlation benchmarks lie between 12 16 and 34 40 km not only are the background error correlations produced by the ensemble different from those produced by the balance operator but so are the error covariances fig 5 shows surface maps of the ensemble error sst variance at the top and the t s covariance at the bottom in the t s covariance maps t and s ensemble perturbations are sampled at the same point three windows 1 may 30 july and 28 september 2011 are selected to represent three different columbia river plume geometries on 1 may the plume stretches over the shelf northward of the river mouth on 30 july the plume is diverted southward and offshore by the upwelling favourable winds on 28 september 2011 at the end of the upwelling season the plume is found in the same area as on 30 july but the salinity signal is weaker also a new plume is forming northward of the mouth as the winds have reversed to northward on average the ensemble variance in sst fig 5a c is considerably smaller than the one assumed in the balanced b the latter is 0 81 c 2 while the former has a median value of 0 10 c 2 however locally in frontal areas where sst assimilation will have the largest impact the ensemble standard deviation can obtain much larger values up to 1 63 c 2 these high variances are found in particular near the 15 c isotherm solid black line along the coast between 41 48 n this isotherm is indicative of the location of the cold upwelling front similarly fig 5d f the median of the t s covariance over all windows is 0 002 c which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the 0 13 c used in the balanced b once again locally the strength of the sst sss ensemble covariance can become a factor 20 larger in magnitude than that of the balanced covariance reaching 2 7 c similarly to the large sst variances these large sst sss covariances can be found at frontal locations both at the inshore and offshore edge of the river plume however in contrast to the sst variances they can also be found within the river plume see fig 5e f the point by point ensemble covariance between sst and the daily averaged surface current in each direction as well as the surface velocity variance in each direction are calculated for the same dates then for each direction the absolute value is taken this generates a co variance ellipse for each location comparable to tidal ellipses obtained in tidal current analysis the length of the major semi axes of these ellipses i e the maximum absolute values of the sst surface current covariance and surface current variance are shown in fig 6a c and d f respectively the areas of the largest sst velocity covariance match the locations of the largest sst variances cf fig 5a c in contrast the largest surface current variances fig 6d e are found within the plume this is notwithstanding that the ensemble variability in the wind forcing in this region on these days is actually lower than in the adjacent areas near the coast and the west side of the model domain not shown this paradoxical result could be caused by the fact that the ekman depths in the plume area are smaller influenced by the stronger stratification in the shallower mixed layer fong and geyer 2001 gan et al 2009 mcwilliams et al 2009 price and sundermeyer 1999 hence the ekman transport in the plume is distributed over a relatively shallower water column and consequently currents in the plume are more sensitive to perturbations to the wind forcing 4 the da impact on the columbia river plume volume in the initial en4dvar runs performed without sc we noticed that the extent of the columbia river plume and generally salinity at the surface occasionally exhibited rapid changes as a result of the da to illustrate we use daily analysis fields and estimate the volume of fresh water in the river plume to compute this volume only grid cells for which s 31 5 are considered the amount of fresh water contained in each such grid cell v f r e s h i j k is computed using mass conservation 4 s i j k v i j k s r i v e r v f r e s h i j k s o c e a n v i j k v f r e s h i j k where s r i v e r 0 3 is taken as the salinity of the river water s o c e a n 32 2 as the salinity of the oceanic near surface water and v i j k is the grid cell volume then v f r e s h i j k is summed over grid cells for which s 31 5 to obtain the estimate of the total fresh water volume in the river plume v f r e s h fig 7 shows the difference in v f r e s h from its value on 19 april 2011 the starting point of all the da experiments for reference we also show the cumulative outflow of the columbia river since 19 april 2011 as the model forcing does not include evaporation and precipitation the columbia river is the only model source of fresh water in the plume region since vertical mixing reduces the fresh water volume within the plume volume hetland 2005 maccready et al 2009 this cumulative outflow represents an upper bound on v f r e s h however fig 7 shows that the fresh plume volume in experiment ens occasionally jumps e g on 3 july 21 july 26 august and exceeds the upper bound set by the cumulative river outflow experiment ens sc is not fully effective in constraining the unphysical instantaneous changes in fresh plume water volume concurrently with the jumps in experiment ens jumps of smaller amplitude are still noticeable in experiment ens sc however their magnitude is small enough such that the fresh plume water volume difference in experiment ens sc stays below the cumulative river outflow the problems with constraining the fresh plume volume are exclusive to en4dvar in experiment bal the change in freshwater volume is comparable to that in experiment no da the jumps in fresh plume water volume as shown in experiment ens are always found at the beginning of the windows and are caused by the instantaneous da correction as an example a particularly large change in fresh plume water volume occurred on 21 july 2011 in experiment ens fig 8a b show the sss field before and after the da correction on this day during this period the plume region is fully covered by the available sst data fig 8c without the additional salinity constraint the da correction in sss expands the plume area to the west and northwest of the plume and decreases the salinity within the plume by approximately 3 further analysis suggests that these large erroneous freshwater volume changes stretching over the whole plume area are associated with a bias in the assimilated sst observations compared to the forecast sst which is exaggerated by the large magnitude of the t s covariance in the plume area fig 8c on this day the ens forecast is colder than the observed sst over the majority of the model domain on average by 0 5 c if contour lines for the sst sss covariance are laid over the sss da correction fig 8d it becomes apparent that the instantaneous freshening introduced by da takes place in the area where large sst sss covariances overlap with regions in which the sst forecast is colder than the observations in this study the salinity constraints are also applied to experiment bal although this study did not investigate the need for salinity constraints in the balance operator case in more depth the abnormally large sss corrections observed in experiment ens have never been noticed in the operational osu coastal forecasting system which uses a balance operator without salinity contours so there seems to be no indication that the salinity constraints in experiment bal are essential to ensure physically realistic corrections to the sss a possible explanation for this difference between the balance b and ensemble b is that the surface temperature salinity covariances in the balance b used 0 13 c o v t s 0 c are an order of magnitude smaller than those that appear in and around the plume in the ensemble based b ranges in the plume region from 1 4 c and 0 1 c consequently the sss corrections created with the erroneous sst observations do not become non physically large when the balance b is used 5 en4dvar versus balance operator 4dvar in this section the results from the different experiments are compared to remote and in situ measurements to find whether en4dvar yields better model analyses and forecasts than the traditional 4dvar with the static covariance currently implemented in the or wa forecast system 5 1 surface here model results are compared with surface remote sensing observations the same data sets that are assimilated are used in this comparison but with different processing the hourly goes sst observation resolution is not reduced instead of using the radial daily averaged surface velocity hfr components the hfr maps of the zonal and meridional velocity components on a 6 km grid are used cook and paduan 2001 gurgel 1994 kosro 2005 and instead of presenting the along track altimetry as the 24 h averaged sea level anomaly it is compared to the instantaneous ssh minus the along track mean in this case model tidal predictions obtained from case no da using pawlowicz et al 2002 are added to the detided ssh observations prior to comparison with the model ssh the rms difference between the measured values for the aforementioned observations and their model predictions will be referred to as the root mean square error rmse fig 9 shows the time series of the area averaged 3 day time averaged rmse for each window the continuous blue line corresponds to the case no da each short line segment is associated with one six day analysis forecast cycle the value at the left side is the rmse over the first three days of this cycle i e the analysis period while the value on the right hand side is the rmse for the last three days i e the forecast the opaque bands around the lines represent the 90 confidence intervals indicating what other rmses could have been obtained if the observations had been spread over the domain differently and are constructed using bootstrapping details on the bootstrapping method used can be found in appendix c analysis rmses are consistently smaller than forecast rmses even though for individual windows the difference is not always significant at the 90 level forecast and analysis rmses are also predominantly smaller than the rmses in no da initially however improvement in the reduction is not significant at the 90 level as the upwelling seasons progresses rmses in all experiments increase but faster in no da than in the other experiments eventually rmses in sst ssh and meridional velocities are significantly smaller in the da experiment than in no da tables 2 and 3 present a summary of the rmse providing in each case the rms of the daily averaged rmses taking into account analysis or forecast days 1 2 and 3 from each da cycle all da runs yield rmses that are close to each other and all are a significant improvement over case no da at the 90 level however no one da experiment is significantly better than the others this is partly a testament to a reasonably good presently operating or wa ocean forecast system using the static balanced b and partly the result of extensive observational coverage of the surface a more detailed analysis of the model skill against the surface data is done using the taylor diagrams fig 10 where standard deviations normalised by the observational standard deviation and correlations with the observed values are shown for the forecasts and analyses the crosses mark the extent of the 90 confidence interval in the correlation and normalised standard deviation the model skill here defined as taylor 2001 5 s 4 1 ρ 4 2 σ m o d e l σ o b s 1 σ o b s σ m o d e l 1 is indicated by green lines in the diagrams measured by skill experiment no da performs significantly worse than the da experiments for all four types of surface observations shown this is mainly because its correlation with the observations is closer to zero than for the da cases the analyses in the da experiments are a significant improvement over the forecast the ranking of the different da experiments is the same for the forecasts as for the analyses e g if the forecast of experiment bal has the largest standard deviation of the three forecasts it also has the largest standard deviation of the three analyses by any measure the model provides better predictions for sst fig 10a than for any of the other surface observations shown we attribute this to the fact that large part of the variability of the sst around its mean is caused by the north south gradient in sst and the seasonal heating of the ocean surface over the model period these large scale long term processes are captured well by the model dynamics with the exception of ssh fig 10d for which the standard deviation of the en4dvar is closer to the observational standard deviation than in experiment bal the da experiments do not perform significantly different 5 2 subsurface in our tests subsurface observations are not assimilated but used only for verification in the following we compare model results with independent subsurface observations to see if using ens sc yields improvement over bal in any way special attention will be paid to salinity observations as this field is not assimilated at all on a regular basis temperature and salinity measurements are made by gliders low power autonomous underwater vehicles in cross shore sections along the newport line near 44 65 n erofeev 2011 fig 11 on their tracks slocum gliders repeatedly descend to depths of 200 m and return to the surface a single transect either west to east or east to west takes about three days the transects are located in a region with dynamics that are challenging to model it partly runs over the continental shelf depth 200 m just south of the point where the southward coastal current separates from the shore barth et al 2005a kosro 2005 kurapov et al 2005 oke et al 2002a during episodes of strong upwelling driven by the southward winds the glider samples the cold and salty upwelled water with a potential density 26 5 kg m 3 in the shallower portion of the transect austin and barth 2002 barth et al 2005b huyer 1977 pasmans et al 2019 as the glider goes farther offshore it crosses the columbia river front with relatively warmer and fresher water near the surface t s diagrams are presented in fig 12 using glider observations and model solutions results for ens are similar to those in ens sc are therefore not included in fig 12 diagrams at the top correspond to the first half of the study period 19 april through 29 june 2011 diagrams at the bottom correspond to the second half of the study period 30 june through 1 october in the beginning of the upwelling season observations show a cloud of points corresponding to the shallow river plume s 31 5 fig 12a the t s diagram in experiment no da fig 12b is qualitatively similar to the observed a problem emerges in case bal fig 12c where a line of points builds up along s α t enforced by the very simple choice of the t s relation in the balance operator 7 literally assuming this linear relation between corrections to s and t this line is absent in case no da fig 12b and the verification data fig 12a we mark the top portion of this line t 13 5 c in fig 12c with black dots and colour their counterparts in every diagram black as well the low salinities of the black points in the observations fig 12a indicate that they correspond to samples taken while the glider was in the river plume qualitatively ens sc da is more successful in reproducing the plume t s composition during this time period fig 12d in particular the artificial line implied by the specific choice in the balance operator is gone as the upwelling season progresses the cold water front and the river plume move farther offshore under these conditions the glider samples only inshore of the plume and the observed t s diagram reverts to a straight line with the slope close to α 1 fig 12e consequently the forecasts in experiment bal are able to correctly simulate the observed t s relation fig 12g the ensemble covariance is sensitive to adapt to the new background oceanic conditions and also yields the correct t s diagram along the glider section fig 12h rmse between the glider data and model analyses or forecasts are calculated separately close to the surface depth 22 m and below the seasonal thermocline depth 50 m and the results are shown in table 4 similarly to the rmse for the surface observations tables 2 and 3 the glider rmse for the ensemble da experiments below 22 m is generally better than for experiment bal but each difference by itself is not significant at the 90 level mooring nh10 is located on the shelf 10 nautical miles offshore of the oregon coast at the newport line anchored at 81 m below the surface see fig 11 temperature and salinity are measured by sensors at different depths hourly averaged measurements are compared with model output from the different experiments the differences are then filtered with a 24 h bartlett filter as we focus on subtitdal time scales next we will discuss the vertical profiles of the time averaged rmse and the mean of the differences i e the bias between the model outputs analyses and forecasts and the buoy observations shown in fig 13 temperature and fig 14 salinity the largest temperature rmse in experiment no da is found in the top 10 m where surface heating the river plume and coastal upwelling all contribute to model uncertainty in t below 10 m the no da rmse decreases sharply fig 13a at the surface the bias in experiment ens and ens sc analyses is higher than in experiment no da fig 13c d though not significantly at the 90 confidence level this bias is equal to the average error in the goes sst observations compared to the moored temperature measurements see the mark in the figure hence the increase in the bias results from the da correctly fitting erroneous sst observations below the 20 m depth the bias for experiments no da bal and experiments ens ens sc start to differ significantly with the bias in the latter lying closer to zero below 30 m depth as a result the rmse below 30 m is significantly smaller for the en4dvar experiments than in experiment no da and experiment bal these points hold true for both the analyses and the forecasts near the surface experiments ens and ens sc yield nh10 salinity analyses and forecasts with a smaller rmse and a smaller bias magnitude than the other experiments fig 14 esp when compared to the forecasts and analyses of experiment bal which are too fresh over the entire depth range for which nh10 salinity measurements are available fig 14c d however differences at each depth are not significant at the 90 level we note that the case with the balanced b yields worse rmses than the no da case both for t and s furthermore the forecast rmse is smaller than analysis rmse above the 40 m depth we can identify three reasons for the lacklustre performance of the standard 4dvar against the verification shelf mooring data first the nearby assimilated satellite sst differ the rmse and the time mean of the difference between satellite and buoy surface temperatures are marked by a in fig 13a b and fig 13c d respectively the average sst in no da matches the average buoy observations fig 13c d and consequently the assimilation of satellite sst observations which are on average too warm results in a deterioration of the model performance at the buoy location second in case bal surface velocity corrections must be fully balanced by corrections in the density when sst is not constrained by the satellite observations experiment bal can overcorrect the temperature whilst fitting the velocity observations this results in a higher temperature analysis rmse in experiment bal than in the other experiments after the erroneous t correction the forecast rmse relaxes to be closer to the no da rmse third in the static b errors in all the components of the roms state vector ssh horizontal velocity t and s can be derived if the error statistics for t and the depth integrated transport stream function are defined for the latter for the lack of a better guess zero variance has been assumed while the assumption that the depth integrated transport is not changed by da is reasonable over deep water it is limiting at the shelf where changes in the surface currents correlate with changes in the depth averaged current e g oke et al 2002b in case bal increase in the alongshore surface current by the da correction has to be compensated by the decreasing subsurface current which adversely influences variability in the subsurface temperature and salinity in the en4dvar cases we do not have to make an explicit assumption about the error in the depth averaged flow the ensemble provides the covariance that yields better performance and helps to reveal yet another limitation of the specific balance operator formulation chosen the observed differences in rmses between the experiments can partially be explained from the observed biases 13c d which are discussed in more detail next at the surface the bias in ens and ens sc analyses matches the bias in the sst observations marked by the in 13c d this results in an overall increase in the time averaged water temperature in the top 70 m during experiments ens and ens sc compared to experiment no da as all experiments overestimate the vertical temperature gradient at the buoy location this overall increase results in experiment no da having a smaller absolute bias than experiments ens and ens sc in the top 30 m but a larger absolute bias below it consequently in experiment no da the rmse is smaller than in experiments ens and ens sc between 10 30 m depth but significantly larger below 30 m the temperature bias in the forecasts and analyses below 30 m in case bal is not significantly different from no da at the surface the temperature bias in case bal is larger than the other experiments though not significant at the 90 confidence level which cannot be explained by the fact that sst observations are biased since the same observations are assimilated in all the cases we find that in case bal the correction to the surface t is stronger than in the other cases as a result of the assimilation of the surface currents particularly in windows where sst was unavailable this happens because of stronger coupling between surface velocity and temperature errors in the balanced b compared to the ensemble b see section 3 depending on the shape location and magnitude of the velocity errors the with the velocity corrections associated temperature corrections can result in the appearance of a local bias in the sst field while experiments ens and ens sc perform close to or better than the other experiment at the nh10 location they do not show good performance against a limited set of argo float locations argo 2000 farther away from the coast the locations used in this analysis are shown in fig 11 fig 15a and c show the average t and s profiles prior to 20 july 2011 when the profile locations were outside the river plume sss 31 5 and fig 15b and d show the average profile after 20 july 2011 when each of the profiles sampled was located inside the river plume the forecasts from experiments ens and ens sc fail to reproduce the strength of the vertical temperature gradient in the thermocline fig 15a b the deterioration of these forecasts at depths 30 100 m may result from random non zero correlations between sst and other subsurface fields present in b as no localisation is applied in the vertical direction the latter was not applied since the ensemble error variance generally strongly decreases with depth also worrisome is the fact that ens sc and ens contrary to cases bal and no da produce salinity forecasts that are too fresh above 50 m fig 15c d without salinity constraints the forecasts in experiment ens produce a river plume with salinity that is 3 units too low at the surface fig 15d applying salinity constraints is highly beneficial in this case it reduces the negative bias to about 1 however it does not completely eliminate the tendency of the ensemble da system to overestimate the magnitude of the sss corrections in and around the plume given the negative bias in the sst data in our particular case this in agreement with our findings in section 4 6 summary and discussion in this study the en4dvar da system described in pasmans and kurapov 2019 has been tested with the oregon washington coastal ocean circulation model an ensemble of 4dvar runs is used to estimate the background error covariance b the results of the en4dvar system are verified against observations that have yet to be assimilated or that will not be assimilated at all and compared with forecasts from a 4dvar system using a static balanced b the ensemble b yields t s error correlations and covariances that are different from those assumed in the static b in particular ensemble t s error correlations and covariances are weak outside the plume in and near the plume however the magnitude can be a factor 20 larger than in the static b these differences between the static and ensemble b have little impact on the accuracy of the forecasts for the fields associated with the assimilated observations sst surface velocity ssh time averaged forecast rmse in ens sc compared to surface data is 3 5 smaller but not significantly different from experiment bal at the 90 confidence level the story is different for fields for which no observations are assimilated like salinity or the subsurface fields comparison with glider observations showed that using the ensemble b yields corrections that can reproduce the observed spatial structure and temporal variability in the water properties on the t s plane this comparison helped us reveal one of the deficiencies of the presently used balance operator in which a very simple t s relation is assumed it fails to reproduce the observed t s relationship in the earlier half of the study period when water of different origins including the river plume is present in the area sampled by the glider the reason our balance operator b used such a simple t s relation is that more complicated approaches e g using the forecast state to provide a more realistic and spatially varying t s relation resulted in unstable results similarly comparison against the mooring t and s profile data not only showed the advantageous effect of using the ensemble error covariance on the subsurface results but also pointed to yet another problem with the balance operator where improvements must be made the correction to the depth integrated transport must be allowed on the shelf the problems revealed here will encourage future research to re evaluate the approach used to build the balance operator appropriate for the shelf flows we must note that although the en4dvar system performs better on many of the skill assessment metrics used the differences with the 4dvar using the static b are small when each metric is considered on its own the 90 confidence intervals of the rmse in the cases using en4dvar and 4dvar with the static b do overlap the salinity constraints were added as an additional term to the penalty function to inhibit large and erroneous variations in the surface salinity caused by the assimilation of the biased sst data amplified by the large ensemble t s covariance such an issue is specific only to the en4dvar and did not present a problem in the case with the balanced b the salinity constraint was found to suppress but not completely eliminate the erroneous sss corrections several measures could possibly improve this first the weights σ s i 2 in 3 can be increased especially for the larger boxes second a bias correction scheme e g dee and uppala 2009 derber and wu 1998 donlon et al 2012 lea et al 2008 lellouche et al 2013 that removes large scale systematic errors in the observations can be tried third currently only the wind velocities are perturbed in the ensemble the resulting perturbations in the transport and vertical mixing give rise to the large temperature salinity covariances particularly in the frontal regions adding perturbations to the atmospheric temperature and radiative flux in the ensemble members is expected to increase the sst ensemble variance whilst only weakly impacting the sss variance this would reduce the sst sss ensemble correlation and yield smaller sss corrections we also note that since the bulk flux formulation is utilised for the atmosphere ocean fluxes perturbations to the wind velocity already result in perturbations to sensible heat flux and latent heat flux we expect that the problem of amplification of large and erroneous da corrections to non assimilated fields due to the presence of large ensemble error covariances will not be limited to salinity for example it may also concern poorly constrained biochemical fields in coupled biogeochemical model applications ciavatta et al 2011 2014 furthermore erroneous observations are not the only possible source of unphysically large corrections to tracer fields if observational coverage is limited to specific areas corrections to the tracer field can be local to these areas such local corrections would not conserve the total tracer volume in the model model domain wide constraints as the one proposed in this paper would ideally help preserve the tracer in the volume averaged sense the benefits and drawbacks of en4dvar listed above have to be weighted against the extra wall time and computational resources required by the en4dvar compared to the 4dvar with the balanced b the en4dvar system used in this study requires 16 000 core hours per 3 day window on an intel xeon e5 2680v3 hyper threaded 2 5 ghz processor towns et al 2014 whilst the balanced b 4dvar only needs 100 core hours per window the major part of this 10 fold increase comes from the need to run an ensemble of nonlinear model runs in the en4dvar system fortunately en4dvar allows for significant parallelisation and the required wall clock time for both systems is 12 h per window in this study the da systems compared used either a purely static or a purely ensemble b in meteorology it was found that 4dvar systems in which a combination of the static and ensemble covariances are used so called hybrid systems outperform the purely ensemble or static systems clayton et al 2013 kuhl et al 2013 lorenc and jardak 2018 apart from finding a suitable weighting there are no impediments to implementing such a hybrid scheme in the en4dvar system described here performance of a da system using the static b will also depend on the formulation details in the ensemble b large covariances are located near the fronts and this spatial and temporal variability could possibly be reproduced in the static covariance without running the ensemble by estimating the point by point covariance at each point from the spatial variability around the point fu et al 1993 furthermore the assumption that the t s correlation is 1 was found to contradict the t s ensemble correlation this suggests that the addition of an unbalanced univariate part to the balance operator b derber and bouttier 1999 can help to produce a more realistic static b in conclusion here we have presented the first initial results using en4dvar in a realistic coastal ocean circulation setting the research on en4dvar must be continued although it may seem the en4dvar did not show sizeable improvement over the traditional 4dvar in every aspect it has helped us to resolve or at least identify several shortcomings of the traditional approach and point to future research directions some of these problems could be remedied by a more extensive sampling of the coastal ocean to better constrain the forecasts e g when satellite salinity products become more mature and more suitable for assimilation there will be less need in adding a constraint on the sss change based on the forecast model when wide swath altimetry rodriguez et al 2017 becomes routinely available it will provide a much better constraint on the location of the upwelling fronts and eddies than just a few nadir altimeters available for this study using data from several satellites for sst will improve coverage within an assimilation window while research towards the best representation of the background model errors in b must be continued without doubt at the coastal and regional scale we operate in the data hungry environment any future efforts to sample surface and subsurface fields at an ever improving spatial and temporal resolution are key to improved prediction credit authorship

23948,the ensemble four dimensional variational en4dvar data assimilation da system introduced in part i pasmans and kurapov 2019 is tested in the coastal waters offshore oregon and washington u s west coast during the spring and summer of 2011 the background error covariance b is derived from the forecast ensemble satellite sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh and daily averaged radial surface currents from high frequency radars hfrs are assimilated the performance of the en4dvar system is compared with a traditional 4dvar system using a static b it is found that the presence of the columbia river plume has a profound impact on the ensemble b near the plume front the sst sss covariance can be up to a factor 20 larger in magnitude than in the static b this introduces large spatial and temporal variability in the ensemble b the en4dvar system is more successful than the 4dvar with the static b preserving the temperature salinity properties when compared to glider data the en4dvar system also produces more accurate forecasts and analyses for temperature in the subsurface below 30 m at a buoy location on the continental shelf in comparisons with other surface and subsurface observations en4dvar shows consistent albeit not significant improvement over traditional 4dvar large surface temperature salinity covariances in combination with the episodic occurrence of large scale errors in the sst observations lead to erroneous freshening in the centre of the model domain adding constraints on the surface salinity corrections based on the prior model reduces this effect keywords 4dvar data assimilation coastal oceanography ensemble background error covariance river plume usa oregon 1 introduction for the benefit of the local fishing communities government agencies and other users the oregon state university osu coastal ocean forecast system has provided forecasts of temperature salinity currents and other oceanic fields of interest in the oregon washington or wa coastal area http nvs nanoos org explorer while the system does produce useful forecasts we continue exploring ways to improve its performance in this system initial conditions for the forecasts are corrected by assimilating surface observations using the 4dvar data assimilation da algorithm in a series of 3 day windows this requires specification of the forecast or background error covariance b the b currently implemented in the or wa system is static i e it does not change from one assimilation window to the next in this covariance the balance operator and its adjoint counterpart kurapov et al 2011 weaver et al 2005 are used to correlate errors in different components of the ocean state vector including ssh and three dimensional fields of the horizontal velocity temperature and salinity the balance operator uses diagnostic relations such as geostrophy thermal wind balance the linearised equation of state and a simplified linear temperature salinity relation based on multiyear glider observations details on the balance operator used can be found in appendix a coastal waters in the or wa area are very dynamic with wind driven currents in excess of 0 5 ms 1 strong temperature fronts geostrophic and ageostrophic baroclinic instabilities and jets separating from the shelf towards the ocean interior koch et al 2010 the freshwater outflow from the columbia river creates a shallow plume hereafter referred to as the plume that spreads over a large area berdeal et al 2002 hickey et al 2005 huyer et al 2005 liu et al 2009 the location of the columbia river plume changes on seasonal and shorter time scales in response to the winds in summer due to the predominantly southward winds the columbia river plume is transported to the south of the river mouth and offshore with the coastal upwelling during periods of wind relaxation the plume is advected towards the coast freshening the coastal waters off oregon in such a dynamic area the utility of a static b can be limited one way to capture the time varying dynamics in b is to estimate it from an ensemble of perturbed model runs this approach has been tested in meteorology with varying results kuhl et al 2013 found that replacing the static b with one coming partially from an ensemble 3dvar system in the naval research laboratory atmospheric variational data assimilation system accelerated representer navdas ar system reduced background errors in contrast running an ensemble kalman filter to produce b the met office found that a system using a pure ensemble b resulted in an overall degradation of performance and produced forecasts with larger root mean square errors rmse compared to a system using a static climatological background covariance lorenc and jardak 2018 in this study we aim to compare 4dvar with static b and ensemble b both applied to a realistic ocean model in part i pasmans and kurapov 2019 the en4dvar method generating the ensemble b was described the or wa coastal ocean forecast system was used to illustrate the computational efficiency of the cluster search minimisation algorithm and to introduce essential statistical tests of the dynamical ensemble and the resulting time variable b however we did not demonstrate if in any regard the use of the more computationally demanding en4dvar yields an improvement in the forecast accuracy compared to a traditional 4dvar system with the static balance operator b this void is filled here in the process of this study we recognise one of the general potential dangers using en4dvar for poorly observed fields by design an ensemble yields large variances and hence covariances in frontal areas at the same time if observations are affected by large scale errors or biases in these areas unobserved fields can receive a large and erroneous correction in our case satellite sst observations are occasionally found to contain large scale spatial biases combined with the large and negative temperature salinity covariance in the columbia river plume and along the oregon coastal upwelling front assimilation of the biased sst results in unrealistically large corrections to the surface salinity this issue motivated us to test methodology to constrain the near surface salinity based on the forecast solution the so called salinity constraint sc procedure this paper is organised as follows section 2 provides a summary of the ocean model en4dvar da and the 4dvar da system in this section we also introduce the sc procedure developed to deal with the erroneous corrections to the salinity discovered during this study horizontal and vertical spatial patterns of the static and the ensemble b are compared in section 3 the problems with the salinity field are illustrated in section 4 analyses and forecasts from the en4dvar system are compared to the model without assimilation and with the standard 4dvar in section 5 in section 6 our findings are summarised and some other approaches not considered here e g hybrid covariances are briefly discussed 2 model experiments in the or wa system nonlinear forecasts are obtained using the regional ocean modeling system roms www myroms org with a 2 km resolution in the horizontal and 40 terrain following layers in the vertical direction roms solves for temperature t salinity s zonal velocity u meridional velocity v and sea surface height ζ the salinity in this paper is reported according to the pss 78 standard and following iapso 1985 oceanographic standard is reported as dimensionless quantity the 4dvar da utilises the avrora tangent linear and adjoint codes that were developed by our group at osu and that are not part of the community code developed by the broader roms community kurapov et al 2009 2011 yu et al 2012 model forcing

precipitation evaporation is low in the region in summer and is not included in the model more details of the model forcing can be found in pasmans et al 2019 and pasmans and kurapov 2019 four experiments are discussed in this paper see table 1 experiment no da starts using the interpolated hycom analysis as initial condition on 2 january 2011 and is run continuously without da all da experiments use the no da ocean state on 19 april 2011 as the initial condition in all the da cases the model is propagated forward in time as a series of three day windows initial conditions for the control run cases bal ens and ens sc and each ensemble member ens ens sc are updated at the beginning of each window by the assimilation of the goes satellite sea surface temperature sst daily averaged radial current observations from high frequency radars hfr and along track satellite sea surface height ssh altimetry see pasmans and kurapov 2019 for the details on the data sets used prior to assimilation the resolution of the sst and hfr observations is reduced to the resolution of the tangent linear and adjoint models by averaging the sst observations over 4 4 km horizontal cells and radial hfr data over 5 5 km cells the 24 h average of the tides based on the harmonical analysis of the no da model is added to the detided absolute dynamic topography ssh observations in the da system this is matched against the 24 h average of the model ssh with the model and observed means removed along each satellite track no in situ observations are assimilated because of inherent problems assimilating very sparse hydrographic profiles pasmans et al 2019 in every assimilation forecast cycle the nonlinear roms is run for 6 days starting from the corrected initial conditions the model output over the first three days is referred to as the analysis and the next three days as the forecast corrections x m to the ocean state at the beginning of each da window for both the control run and each of the ensemble members m are calculated by maximising the conditional probability 1 p x m d m p d m x m p x m with respect to x m here indicates that the two sides are equal apart from a proportionality constant the equality in 1 follows from bayes theorem d m is the vector with innovations i e the differences between observations and the nonlinear forecast predictions for the observations p x m d m the probability that the background error is x m given the innovations d m p d m x m the probability that the innovations are d m given that the background error is x m and p x m is the a priori probability distribution for the background errors it is usually assumed that the aforementioned probabilities follow normal distributions i e p d m x m exp j o b s x m p x m exp j b x m with j b x m 1 2 x m t b 1 x m and j o b s x m 1 2 d m h m x m t r 1 d m h m x m here h is the sampling operator that generates predictions for the different observations from the model output and m the tangent linear model i e the roms model linearised around the forecast the observation error covariance r is assumed to be diagonal in this case the maximisation of p x m d m in 1 is equivalent to the minimisation of the cost function courtier et al 1994 egbert et al 1994 2 j x m j o b s x m j b x m in experiments ens and ens sc an ensemble of 40 forecasts is carried throughout the study period the control run is computed using the wind forcing without perturbations the other 39 runs are carried using perturbed winds and perturbed observations see pasmans and kurapov 2019 sec 4 the model fields for ssh salinity temperature and velocity are averaged over a period beginning 12 h prior to the da window start time and ending 12 h after the start time the time averaged fields of the 39 runs are then utilised to compute b based on the findings in pasmans and kurapov 2017 localisation is applied in the horizontal such that zero correlations are imposed on points spaced further than 100 km apart the wind perturbations are linear combinations of the empirical orthogonal functions eofs derived from the nam wind fields with their coefficients drawn from normal distributions daubechies wavelets are added to these wind perturbations to represent the small scale errors in the wind field distributions of the eof coefficients are determined by comparison of the model wind field with ascat scatterometer data using a bayesian hierarchical model pasmans and kurapov 2019 all ensemble members start off from the same initial state that is taken from experiment no da on 10 march 2011 and are run till 19 april with perturbed winds but without da as the ensemble perturbations to the ocean state are generated from the perturbations in the wind forcing using the physics that is contained in the model it is assumed that the ensemble perturbations are consistent with the ocean dynamics therefore it is expected that the da corrections are in leading order in geostrophic balance and that the amplitude of the transient solutions that emanate from the da corrections are sufficiently small that no model blow ups occur indeed in the control run of experiments ens and ens sc no blow ups are encountered sporadically a blow up is encountered in one of the ensemble members these blow ups however are not due to the da corrections as rerunning the ensemble member with different wind forcing perturbations resolves the problem the solution x m that minimises the cost function j in 2 for each ensemble is approximated using a numerical iterative solver in case of the popular reduced b conjugate gradient rbcg method gürol et al 2014 the approximation to x m would be sought in a subspace that is expanded by 1 dimension in each inner loop iteration for en4dvar this method was deemed too time and resource consuming instead the newly developed cluster search method is used to approximate x m in the cluster search method the search subspace is expanded by n s 1 dimensions per inner loop iteration if n s 1 the cluster search method is identical to the rbcg method for n s 1 the cluster search still searches for the same solution as ordinary 4dvar i e x m that minimises equation 2 or 3 but it converges faster than rbcg full details on the cluster search method can be found in pasmans and kurapov 2019 sec 3 for practical reasons we use the cluster search method with n s 4 and 12 inner loop iterations in this study in experiment bal no ensemble is available in order to use cluster search and thus accelerate convergence of the traditional 4dvar a low rank surrogate ensemble is generated as explained in appendix b it is found in case ens that unphysical da corrections to the sea surface salinity sss can occur to reduce this effect salinity constraints sc are added to the 4dvar cost function 2 these constrains nudge the da correction towards the prior model salinity we do not want to nudge sss to the prior model point by point since this would suppress changes to the location of the river plume front constraining simply the area averaged sss does not effectively mitigate the adverse effect of the biased sst since the domain averaged sss can be preserved when salinity is wildly redistributed instead we cover the surface area in the model interior with a hierarchy of boxes or rectangles fig 1 the largest box spans the entire domain area inside the blue edges in fig 1 excluding the domain edges and also excluding puget sound in the northeast corner of our domain the next level of boxes areas inside the green edges is obtained by dividing the largest box blue edges into 4 level 3 boxes areas bounded by the red edges are obtained by dividing level 2 boxes areas bounded by the green edges by 4 and so on in order not to impede corrections on the scale of the background error covariance r 25 km only five levels of boxes are used the areas bounded by the blue green red cyan edges respectively plus a level not shown in fig 1 in this way the smallest boxes have dimensions of 30 65 km the prior forecast sss from a earlier window can then be averaged in each of these boxes at the beginning of the current assimilation window by a sampling operator h s these averaged salinity values are treated as additional observations the computational cost of implementing this scheme in the 4dvar is negligible using the incremental 4dvar formulation 2 the innovation vector d m corresponding to these synthetic data is zero and an additional term is added to cost function 2 this term provides a penalty on the deviations of the box averaged sss from the prior 3 j s c i δ s i 2 σ s i 2 here δ s i is the da change in the box averaged salinity of box i and σ s i some specified variability we have opted to base these values for σ s i on the natural variance in experiment no da for two reasons first 4dvar corrections are applied to all ensemble members and consequently the large salinity corrections can exaggerate the ensemble spread resulting in unrealistically large estimates of σ s i 2 from the ensemble second the additional penalty terms serve solely to limit sss corrections to climatologically realistic values contrary to the no da solution the 4dvar ensemble is not available prior to da and therefore cannot be used to estimate climatological values specifically the value for σ s i 2 has been determined by first calculating the box sss in no da at the beginning of each window then taking differences in the box sss between consecutive windows and after this defining σ s i 2 as 5 of the variance in these sss differences for box i this yields average values of the standard deviation σ s i of 0 058 0 12 0 17 0 21 and 0 23 for the boxes at levels 1 through 5 respectively as the period covered in the case no da is limited to one upwelling season it is possible that in reality the plume front moved beyond the maximal extent of the plume in experiment no da in that case the values for σ s i obtained using the aforementioned procedure would underestimate the background error in the sss the application of salinity constraints under these conditions would lead to unnecessary local suppression of da corrections to the sss even though in practice the salinity constraints are implemented as additional observations they are no actual observations and j s c depends solely on the background errors in the model sss therefore in the interpretation of da based on bayes theorem the addition of j s c to the cost function is equivalent with replacing the a priori background error probability distribution p x m in 1 with p x m exp j b x m exp 1 2 x m t h s t σ 2 h s x m where σ is a diagonal matrix with the values σ i on its diagonal i e da corrections that change surface salinity on scales equal or larger than the scale of the smallest boxes become less probable than they would be without the addition of j s c in this way sss corrections on scales smaller than 20 km are not impacted by the additional penalty while large scale corrections will result in changes of box averaged salinity in multiple boxes at multiple levels thus rapidly increasing j s c the da case in which 3 is added to cost function 2 is referred to as ens sc experiment bal uses the standard 4dvar with the static balance operator b as described in kurapov et al 2011 and appendix a experiment bal also uses the sc to enable a fair comparison with ens sc the en4dvar experiment with physically acceptable salinity fields 3 covariances in this section spatial structures in the static balance operator based and ensemble b are compared first comparisons will be made for the offshore part of the ocean where dynamics are governed at the lowest order by geostrophy and where the balance operator covariance is expected to be an accurate approximation of the background error covariance then a similar analysis will be obtained for a location near the plume edge the focus will be on the correlations and covariances with sst as this is the field for which most observations are available surface maps of the background error correlation between t at a point far offshore r 0 127 57 w 47 00 n and fields of t s and surface currents are shown in fig 2 in the balanced b fig 2a b the sst velocity correlation plotted as a vector field exhibits an anticyclonic eddy consistent with lowering of the isopycnal surfaces in the core of such an eddy contrary to other implementations of the balance operator in oceanography balmaseda et al 2008 2013 weaver et al 2005 our implementation of the balance operator does not have an unbalanced component i e it is assumed that all background errors can be derived from the background error in the ocean temperature as a consequence the static balanced t s cross correlation fig 2b is apart from a sign change equal to the static balanced t t correlation fig 2a in particular the t s correlation at r 0 is 1 the correlation between t r 0 and the surface velocity in the vicinity of this location peaks at 0 41 we hypothesise that far offshore away from strong coastal fronts and jets the ensemble b computed using daily averaged member fields yields correlation structures that are overall close to the static balanced b to test this ensemble perturbations from the window ensemble mean are collected from all ensemble members and all windows in experiment ens these n n t perturbations with n t the number of da windows and n 39 the number of ensemble members forms a set to which we will refer as the super ensemble the correlation structures obtained from this super ensemble fig 2c d are qualitatively similar to the static balanced b fig 2a b a more quantitative assessment reveals that the t r 0 s r 0 correlation is only 0 58 compared to the value of 1 in the balanced b this is partly due to the fact that mean vertical profiles of t and s are different from window to window affected by the wind driven mixing and other conditions the cross correlation of t r 0 with the surface velocity field is also weaker with peak magnitudes reaching 0 15 0 21 correlation maps for locations near the upwelling front reveal more complicated horizontal structures particularly if computed for a single assimilation window fig 3 shows the surface ensemble error correlation for a point chosen at the inshore edge of the river plume s 31 5 on 9 july 2011 the fresher warmer plume water is found to the west and saltier and colder upwelled water to the east of this location the error in the surface t r 0 is strongly correlated with the error in the cross front surface current correlation magnitudes up to 0 79 reflecting the dominance of the advection mechanism displacing the front the point where the temperature velocity correlation is the largest is marked by a green dot the largest t s correlation in this surface map is also large in magnitude 0 86 to analyse the impact of the river plume on the t t and t s ensemble error correlations fifty 200 km meridional sections are selected randomly in each assimilation window along each section the ensemble averaged sss is determined using the same ensemble of 24 h averaged ocean states that is also used in the calculation of the ensemble based background covariance if the minimum ensemble averaged salinity along the section is larger than 31 5 the section is classified as outside the plume if the maximum ensemble averaged salinity along the section is lower than 31 5 the section is classified as inside the plume only sections fully inside or outside the plume are retained for analysis here the ensemble correlation between the sst at the middle point of each section and sst and sss along the length of each section have been calculated using all 39 ensemble members excluding the control forecast run the localised ensemble correlations found in this way along the different sections are shown in fig 4 grey lines the average ensemble correlations dashed lines are obtained by first removing the ensemble mean from each section and combining the ensemble perturbations from all different sections spanning all windows into one super ensemble the correlation is then calculated from this super ensemble the t s cross correlations in individual sections and windows grey lines vary widely e g taking either sign outside the plume fig 4c consequently the averaged cross correlation at the central point 0 25 is only a fraction of the 1 0 cross correlation used in the balance operator within the plume fig 4d the averaged t s ensemble correlation is closer to the balance operator correlation being mostly negative and yielding the averaged value of 0 73 at the section centre qualitative analysis of the satellite sst imagery and surface model fields suggests that the columbia river plume water is relatively warmer than the ambient ocean partly since the river source is warmer and possibly also since strong stratification inhibits downward vertical turbulent heat flux at the base of the river plume the higher temperature of the plume compared to the surrounding ocean explains the more definitive negative t s error correlation within the plume compared to areas outside in the balanced b the t t and t s horizontal correlations have a gaussian shape the correlation is thus 60 and 14 of its peak value at distances r 25 km and 2 r 50 km respectively where r is the horizontal correlation length scales assumed in the balance operator covariance for the averaged ensemble correlations in fig 4 we determine the distances from the centre r at which the average correlations have dropped to 60 and 14 of their value at r 0 for the correlation without localisation these distances are found to lie between 14 20 and 40 54 km while the latter is comparable to the 50 km value in the balance operator the former is smaller than its balance operator equivalent so although both correlations decrease to 14 of their maximum values in about the same distance the ensemble correlations decrease faster than the gaussian this is also directly visible in fig 4a b as expected the localisation scheme creates an additional reduction in scale for the localised correlations the above referenced correlation benchmarks lie between 12 16 and 34 40 km not only are the background error correlations produced by the ensemble different from those produced by the balance operator but so are the error covariances fig 5 shows surface maps of the ensemble error sst variance at the top and the t s covariance at the bottom in the t s covariance maps t and s ensemble perturbations are sampled at the same point three windows 1 may 30 july and 28 september 2011 are selected to represent three different columbia river plume geometries on 1 may the plume stretches over the shelf northward of the river mouth on 30 july the plume is diverted southward and offshore by the upwelling favourable winds on 28 september 2011 at the end of the upwelling season the plume is found in the same area as on 30 july but the salinity signal is weaker also a new plume is forming northward of the mouth as the winds have reversed to northward on average the ensemble variance in sst fig 5a c is considerably smaller than the one assumed in the balanced b the latter is 0 81 c 2 while the former has a median value of 0 10 c 2 however locally in frontal areas where sst assimilation will have the largest impact the ensemble standard deviation can obtain much larger values up to 1 63 c 2 these high variances are found in particular near the 15 c isotherm solid black line along the coast between 41 48 n this isotherm is indicative of the location of the cold upwelling front similarly fig 5d f the median of the t s covariance over all windows is 0 002 c which is two orders of magnitude smaller than the 0 13 c used in the balanced b once again locally the strength of the sst sss ensemble covariance can become a factor 20 larger in magnitude than that of the balanced covariance reaching 2 7 c similarly to the large sst variances these large sst sss covariances can be found at frontal locations both at the inshore and offshore edge of the river plume however in contrast to the sst variances they can also be found within the river plume see fig 5e f the point by point ensemble covariance between sst and the daily averaged surface current in each direction as well as the surface velocity variance in each direction are calculated for the same dates then for each direction the absolute value is taken this generates a co variance ellipse for each location comparable to tidal ellipses obtained in tidal current analysis the length of the major semi axes of these ellipses i e the maximum absolute values of the sst surface current covariance and surface current variance are shown in fig 6a c and d f respectively the areas of the largest sst velocity covariance match the locations of the largest sst variances cf fig 5a c in contrast the largest surface current variances fig 6d e are found within the plume this is notwithstanding that the ensemble variability in the wind forcing in this region on these days is actually lower than in the adjacent areas near the coast and the west side of the model domain not shown this paradoxical result could be caused by the fact that the ekman depths in the plume area are smaller influenced by the stronger stratification in the shallower mixed layer fong and geyer 2001 gan et al 2009 mcwilliams et al 2009 price and sundermeyer 1999 hence the ekman transport in the plume is distributed over a relatively shallower water column and consequently currents in the plume are more sensitive to perturbations to the wind forcing 4 the da impact on the columbia river plume volume in the initial en4dvar runs performed without sc we noticed that the extent of the columbia river plume and generally salinity at the surface occasionally exhibited rapid changes as a result of the da to illustrate we use daily analysis fields and estimate the volume of fresh water in the river plume to compute this volume only grid cells for which s 31 5 are considered the amount of fresh water contained in each such grid cell v f r e s h i j k is computed using mass conservation 4 s i j k v i j k s r i v e r v f r e s h i j k s o c e a n v i j k v f r e s h i j k where s r i v e r 0 3 is taken as the salinity of the river water s o c e a n 32 2 as the salinity of the oceanic near surface water and v i j k is the grid cell volume then v f r e s h i j k is summed over grid cells for which s 31 5 to obtain the estimate of the total fresh water volume in the river plume v f r e s h fig 7 shows the difference in v f r e s h from its value on 19 april 2011 the starting point of all the da experiments for reference we also show the cumulative outflow of the columbia river since 19 april 2011 as the model forcing does not include evaporation and precipitation the columbia river is the only model source of fresh water in the plume region since vertical mixing reduces the fresh water volume within the plume volume hetland 2005 maccready et al 2009 this cumulative outflow represents an upper bound on v f r e s h however fig 7 shows that the fresh plume volume in experiment ens occasionally jumps e g on 3 july 21 july 26 august and exceeds the upper bound set by the cumulative river outflow experiment ens sc is not fully effective in constraining the unphysical instantaneous changes in fresh plume water volume concurrently with the jumps in experiment ens jumps of smaller amplitude are still noticeable in experiment ens sc however their magnitude is small enough such that the fresh plume water volume difference in experiment ens sc stays below the cumulative river outflow the problems with constraining the fresh plume volume are exclusive to en4dvar in experiment bal the change in freshwater volume is comparable to that in experiment no da the jumps in fresh plume water volume as shown in experiment ens are always found at the beginning of the windows and are caused by the instantaneous da correction as an example a particularly large change in fresh plume water volume occurred on 21 july 2011 in experiment ens fig 8a b show the sss field before and after the da correction on this day during this period the plume region is fully covered by the available sst data fig 8c without the additional salinity constraint the da correction in sss expands the plume area to the west and northwest of the plume and decreases the salinity within the plume by approximately 3 further analysis suggests that these large erroneous freshwater volume changes stretching over the whole plume area are associated with a bias in the assimilated sst observations compared to the forecast sst which is exaggerated by the large magnitude of the t s covariance in the plume area fig 8c on this day the ens forecast is colder than the observed sst over the majority of the model domain on average by 0 5 c if contour lines for the sst sss covariance are laid over the sss da correction fig 8d it becomes apparent that the instantaneous freshening introduced by da takes place in the area where large sst sss covariances overlap with regions in which the sst forecast is colder than the observations in this study the salinity constraints are also applied to experiment bal although this study did not investigate the need for salinity constraints in the balance operator case in more depth the abnormally large sss corrections observed in experiment ens have never been noticed in the operational osu coastal forecasting system which uses a balance operator without salinity contours so there seems to be no indication that the salinity constraints in experiment bal are essential to ensure physically realistic corrections to the sss a possible explanation for this difference between the balance b and ensemble b is that the surface temperature salinity covariances in the balance b used 0 13 c o v t s 0 c are an order of magnitude smaller than those that appear in and around the plume in the ensemble based b ranges in the plume region from 1 4 c and 0 1 c consequently the sss corrections created with the erroneous sst observations do not become non physically large when the balance b is used 5 en4dvar versus balance operator 4dvar in this section the results from the different experiments are compared to remote and in situ measurements to find whether en4dvar yields better model analyses and forecasts than the traditional 4dvar with the static covariance currently implemented in the or wa forecast system 5 1 surface here model results are compared with surface remote sensing observations the same data sets that are assimilated are used in this comparison but with different processing the hourly goes sst observation resolution is not reduced instead of using the radial daily averaged surface velocity hfr components the hfr maps of the zonal and meridional velocity components on a 6 km grid are used cook and paduan 2001 gurgel 1994 kosro 2005 and instead of presenting the along track altimetry as the 24 h averaged sea level anomaly it is compared to the instantaneous ssh minus the along track mean in this case model tidal predictions obtained from case no da using pawlowicz et al 2002 are added to the detided ssh observations prior to comparison with the model ssh the rms difference between the measured values for the aforementioned observations and their model predictions will be referred to as the root mean square error rmse fig 9 shows the time series of the area averaged 3 day time averaged rmse for each window the continuous blue line corresponds to the case no da each short line segment is associated with one six day analysis forecast cycle the value at the left side is the rmse over the first three days of this cycle i e the analysis period while the value on the right hand side is the rmse for the last three days i e the forecast the opaque bands around the lines represent the 90 confidence intervals indicating what other rmses could have been obtained if the observations had been spread over the domain differently and are constructed using bootstrapping details on the bootstrapping method used can be found in appendix c analysis rmses are consistently smaller than forecast rmses even though for individual windows the difference is not always significant at the 90 level forecast and analysis rmses are also predominantly smaller than the rmses in no da initially however improvement in the reduction is not significant at the 90 level as the upwelling seasons progresses rmses in all experiments increase but faster in no da than in the other experiments eventually rmses in sst ssh and meridional velocities are significantly smaller in the da experiment than in no da tables 2 and 3 present a summary of the rmse providing in each case the rms of the daily averaged rmses taking into account analysis or forecast days 1 2 and 3 from each da cycle all da runs yield rmses that are close to each other and all are a significant improvement over case no da at the 90 level however no one da experiment is significantly better than the others this is partly a testament to a reasonably good presently operating or wa ocean forecast system using the static balanced b and partly the result of extensive observational coverage of the surface a more detailed analysis of the model skill against the surface data is done using the taylor diagrams fig 10 where standard deviations normalised by the observational standard deviation and correlations with the observed values are shown for the forecasts and analyses the crosses mark the extent of the 90 confidence interval in the correlation and normalised standard deviation the model skill here defined as taylor 2001 5 s 4 1 ρ 4 2 σ m o d e l σ o b s 1 σ o b s σ m o d e l 1 is indicated by green lines in the diagrams measured by skill experiment no da performs significantly worse than the da experiments for all four types of surface observations shown this is mainly because its correlation with the observations is closer to zero than for the da cases the analyses in the da experiments are a significant improvement over the forecast the ranking of the different da experiments is the same for the forecasts as for the analyses e g if the forecast of experiment bal has the largest standard deviation of the three forecasts it also has the largest standard deviation of the three analyses by any measure the model provides better predictions for sst fig 10a than for any of the other surface observations shown we attribute this to the fact that large part of the variability of the sst around its mean is caused by the north south gradient in sst and the seasonal heating of the ocean surface over the model period these large scale long term processes are captured well by the model dynamics with the exception of ssh fig 10d for which the standard deviation of the en4dvar is closer to the observational standard deviation than in experiment bal the da experiments do not perform significantly different 5 2 subsurface in our tests subsurface observations are not assimilated but used only for verification in the following we compare model results with independent subsurface observations to see if using ens sc yields improvement over bal in any way special attention will be paid to salinity observations as this field is not assimilated at all on a regular basis temperature and salinity measurements are made by gliders low power autonomous underwater vehicles in cross shore sections along the newport line near 44 65 n erofeev 2011 fig 11 on their tracks slocum gliders repeatedly descend to depths of 200 m and return to the surface a single transect either west to east or east to west takes about three days the transects are located in a region with dynamics that are challenging to model it partly runs over the continental shelf depth 200 m just south of the point where the southward coastal current separates from the shore barth et al 2005a kosro 2005 kurapov et al 2005 oke et al 2002a during episodes of strong upwelling driven by the southward winds the glider samples the cold and salty upwelled water with a potential density 26 5 kg m 3 in the shallower portion of the transect austin and barth 2002 barth et al 2005b huyer 1977 pasmans et al 2019 as the glider goes farther offshore it crosses the columbia river front with relatively warmer and fresher water near the surface t s diagrams are presented in fig 12 using glider observations and model solutions results for ens are similar to those in ens sc are therefore not included in fig 12 diagrams at the top correspond to the first half of the study period 19 april through 29 june 2011 diagrams at the bottom correspond to the second half of the study period 30 june through 1 october in the beginning of the upwelling season observations show a cloud of points corresponding to the shallow river plume s 31 5 fig 12a the t s diagram in experiment no da fig 12b is qualitatively similar to the observed a problem emerges in case bal fig 12c where a line of points builds up along s α t enforced by the very simple choice of the t s relation in the balance operator 7 literally assuming this linear relation between corrections to s and t this line is absent in case no da fig 12b and the verification data fig 12a we mark the top portion of this line t 13 5 c in fig 12c with black dots and colour their counterparts in every diagram black as well the low salinities of the black points in the observations fig 12a indicate that they correspond to samples taken while the glider was in the river plume qualitatively ens sc da is more successful in reproducing the plume t s composition during this time period fig 12d in particular the artificial line implied by the specific choice in the balance operator is gone as the upwelling season progresses the cold water front and the river plume move farther offshore under these conditions the glider samples only inshore of the plume and the observed t s diagram reverts to a straight line with the slope close to α 1 fig 12e consequently the forecasts in experiment bal are able to correctly simulate the observed t s relation fig 12g the ensemble covariance is sensitive to adapt to the new background oceanic conditions and also yields the correct t s diagram along the glider section fig 12h rmse between the glider data and model analyses or forecasts are calculated separately close to the surface depth 22 m and below the seasonal thermocline depth 50 m and the results are shown in table 4 similarly to the rmse for the surface observations tables 2 and 3 the glider rmse for the ensemble da experiments below 22 m is generally better than for experiment bal but each difference by itself is not significant at the 90 level mooring nh10 is located on the shelf 10 nautical miles offshore of the oregon coast at the newport line anchored at 81 m below the surface see fig 11 temperature and salinity are measured by sensors at different depths hourly averaged measurements are compared with model output from the different experiments the differences are then filtered with a 24 h bartlett filter as we focus on subtitdal time scales next we will discuss the vertical profiles of the time averaged rmse and the mean of the differences i e the bias between the model outputs analyses and forecasts and the buoy observations shown in fig 13 temperature and fig 14 salinity the largest temperature rmse in experiment no da is found in the top 10 m where surface heating the river plume and coastal upwelling all contribute to model uncertainty in t below 10 m the no da rmse decreases sharply fig 13a at the surface the bias in experiment ens and ens sc analyses is higher than in experiment no da fig 13c d though not significantly at the 90 confidence level this bias is equal to the average error in the goes sst observations compared to the moored temperature measurements see the mark in the figure hence the increase in the bias results from the da correctly fitting erroneous sst observations below the 20 m depth the bias for experiments no da bal and experiments ens ens sc start to differ significantly with the bias in the latter lying closer to zero below 30 m depth as a result the rmse below 30 m is significantly smaller for the en4dvar experiments than in experiment no da and experiment bal these points hold true for both the analyses and the forecasts near the surface experiments ens and ens sc yield nh10 salinity analyses and forecasts with a smaller rmse and a smaller bias magnitude than the other experiments fig 14 esp when compared to the forecasts and analyses of experiment bal which are too fresh over the entire depth range for which nh10 salinity measurements are available fig 14c d however differences at each depth are not significant at the 90 level we note that the case with the balanced b yields worse rmses than the no da case both for t and s furthermore the forecast rmse is smaller than analysis rmse above the 40 m depth we can identify three reasons for the lacklustre performance of the standard 4dvar against the verification shelf mooring data first the nearby assimilated satellite sst differ the rmse and the time mean of the difference between satellite and buoy surface temperatures are marked by a in fig 13a b and fig 13c d respectively the average sst in no da matches the average buoy observations fig 13c d and consequently the assimilation of satellite sst observations which are on average too warm results in a deterioration of the model performance at the buoy location second in case bal surface velocity corrections must be fully balanced by corrections in the density when sst is not constrained by the satellite observations experiment bal can overcorrect the temperature whilst fitting the velocity observations this results in a higher temperature analysis rmse in experiment bal than in the other experiments after the erroneous t correction the forecast rmse relaxes to be closer to the no da rmse third in the static b errors in all the components of the roms state vector ssh horizontal velocity t and s can be derived if the error statistics for t and the depth integrated transport stream function are defined for the latter for the lack of a better guess zero variance has been assumed while the assumption that the depth integrated transport is not changed by da is reasonable over deep water it is limiting at the shelf where changes in the surface currents correlate with changes in the depth averaged current e g oke et al 2002b in case bal increase in the alongshore surface current by the da correction has to be compensated by the decreasing subsurface current which adversely influences variability in the subsurface temperature and salinity in the en4dvar cases we do not have to make an explicit assumption about the error in the depth averaged flow the ensemble provides the covariance that yields better performance and helps to reveal yet another limitation of the specific balance operator formulation chosen the observed differences in rmses between the experiments can partially be explained from the observed biases 13c d which are discussed in more detail next at the surface the bias in ens and ens sc analyses matches the bias in the sst observations marked by the in 13c d this results in an overall increase in the time averaged water temperature in the top 70 m during experiments ens and ens sc compared to experiment no da as all experiments overestimate the vertical temperature gradient at the buoy location this overall increase results in experiment no da having a smaller absolute bias than experiments ens and ens sc in the top 30 m but a larger absolute bias below it consequently in experiment no da the rmse is smaller than in experiments ens and ens sc between 10 30 m depth but significantly larger below 30 m the temperature bias in the forecasts and analyses below 30 m in case bal is not significantly different from no da at the surface the temperature bias in case bal is larger than the other experiments though not significant at the 90 confidence level which cannot be explained by the fact that sst observations are biased since the same observations are assimilated in all the cases we find that in case bal the correction to the surface t is stronger than in the other cases as a result of the assimilation of the surface currents particularly in windows where sst was unavailable this happens because of stronger coupling between surface velocity and temperature errors in the balanced b compared to the ensemble b see section 3 depending on the shape location and magnitude of the velocity errors the with the velocity corrections associated temperature corrections can result in the appearance of a local bias in the sst field while experiments ens and ens sc perform close to or better than the other experiment at the nh10 location they do not show good performance against a limited set of argo float locations argo 2000 farther away from the coast the locations used in this analysis are shown in fig 11 fig 15a and c show the average t and s profiles prior to 20 july 2011 when the profile locations were outside the river plume sss 31 5 and fig 15b and d show the average profile after 20 july 2011 when each of the profiles sampled was located inside the river plume the forecasts from experiments ens and ens sc fail to reproduce the strength of the vertical temperature gradient in the thermocline fig 15a b the deterioration of these forecasts at depths 30 100 m may result from random non zero correlations between sst and other subsurface fields present in b as no localisation is applied in the vertical direction the latter was not applied since the ensemble error variance generally strongly decreases with depth also worrisome is the fact that ens sc and ens contrary to cases bal and no da produce salinity forecasts that are too fresh above 50 m fig 15c d without salinity constraints the forecasts in experiment ens produce a river plume with salinity that is 3 units too low at the surface fig 15d applying salinity constraints is highly beneficial in this case it reduces the negative bias to about 1 however it does not completely eliminate the tendency of the ensemble da system to overestimate the magnitude of the sss corrections in and around the plume given the negative bias in the sst data in our particular case this in agreement with our findings in section 4 6 summary and discussion in this study the en4dvar da system described in pasmans and kurapov 2019 has been tested with the oregon washington coastal ocean circulation model an ensemble of 4dvar runs is used to estimate the background error covariance b the results of the en4dvar system are verified against observations that have yet to be assimilated or that will not be assimilated at all and compared with forecasts from a 4dvar system using a static balanced b the ensemble b yields t s error correlations and covariances that are different from those assumed in the static b in particular ensemble t s error correlations and covariances are weak outside the plume in and near the plume however the magnitude can be a factor 20 larger than in the static b these differences between the static and ensemble b have little impact on the accuracy of the forecasts for the fields associated with the assimilated observations sst surface velocity ssh time averaged forecast rmse in ens sc compared to surface data is 3 5 smaller but not significantly different from experiment bal at the 90 confidence level the story is different for fields for which no observations are assimilated like salinity or the subsurface fields comparison with glider observations showed that using the ensemble b yields corrections that can reproduce the observed spatial structure and temporal variability in the water properties on the t s plane this comparison helped us reveal one of the deficiencies of the presently used balance operator in which a very simple t s relation is assumed it fails to reproduce the observed t s relationship in the earlier half of the study period when water of different origins including the river plume is present in the area sampled by the glider the reason our balance operator b used such a simple t s relation is that more complicated approaches e g using the forecast state to provide a more realistic and spatially varying t s relation resulted in unstable results similarly comparison against the mooring t and s profile data not only showed the advantageous effect of using the ensemble error covariance on the subsurface results but also pointed to yet another problem with the balance operator where improvements must be made the correction to the depth integrated transport must be allowed on the shelf the problems revealed here will encourage future research to re evaluate the approach used to build the balance operator appropriate for the shelf flows we must note that although the en4dvar system performs better on many of the skill assessment metrics used the differences with the 4dvar using the static b are small when each metric is considered on its own the 90 confidence intervals of the rmse in the cases using en4dvar and 4dvar with the static b do overlap the salinity constraints were added as an additional term to the penalty function to inhibit large and erroneous variations in the surface salinity caused by the assimilation of the biased sst data amplified by the large ensemble t s covariance such an issue is specific only to the en4dvar and did not present a problem in the case with the balanced b the salinity constraint was found to suppress but not completely eliminate the erroneous sss corrections several measures could possibly improve this first the weights σ s i 2 in 3 can be increased especially for the larger boxes second a bias correction scheme e g dee and uppala 2009 derber and wu 1998 donlon et al 2012 lea et al 2008 lellouche et al 2013 that removes large scale systematic errors in the observations can be tried third currently only the wind velocities are perturbed in the ensemble the resulting perturbations in the transport and vertical mixing give rise to the large temperature salinity covariances particularly in the frontal regions adding perturbations to the atmospheric temperature and radiative flux in the ensemble members is expected to increase the sst ensemble variance whilst only weakly impacting the sss variance this would reduce the sst sss ensemble correlation and yield smaller sss corrections we also note that since the bulk flux formulation is utilised for the atmosphere ocean fluxes perturbations to the wind velocity already result in perturbations to sensible heat flux and latent heat flux we expect that the problem of amplification of large and erroneous da corrections to non assimilated fields due to the presence of large ensemble error covariances will not be limited to salinity for example it may also concern poorly constrained biochemical fields in coupled biogeochemical model applications ciavatta et al 2011 2014 furthermore erroneous observations are not the only possible source of unphysically large corrections to tracer fields if observational coverage is limited to specific areas corrections to the tracer field can be local to these areas such local corrections would not conserve the total tracer volume in the model model domain wide constraints as the one proposed in this paper would ideally help preserve the tracer in the volume averaged sense the benefits and drawbacks of en4dvar listed above have to be weighted against the extra wall time and computational resources required by the en4dvar compared to the 4dvar with the balanced b the en4dvar system used in this study requires 16 000 core hours per 3 day window on an intel xeon e5 2680v3 hyper threaded 2 5 ghz processor towns et al 2014 whilst the balanced b 4dvar only needs 100 core hours per window the major part of this 10 fold increase comes from the need to run an ensemble of nonlinear model runs in the en4dvar system fortunately en4dvar allows for significant parallelisation and the required wall clock time for both systems is 12 h per window in this study the da systems compared used either a purely static or a purely ensemble b in meteorology it was found that 4dvar systems in which a combination of the static and ensemble covariances are used so called hybrid systems outperform the purely ensemble or static systems clayton et al 2013 kuhl et al 2013 lorenc and jardak 2018 apart from finding a suitable weighting there are no impediments to implementing such a hybrid scheme in the en4dvar system described here performance of a da system using the static b will also depend on the formulation details in the ensemble b large covariances are located near the fronts and this spatial and temporal variability could possibly be reproduced in the static covariance without running the ensemble by estimating the point by point covariance at each point from the spatial variability around the point fu et al 1993 furthermore the assumption that the t s correlation is 1 was found to contradict the t s ensemble correlation this suggests that the addition of an unbalanced univariate part to the balance operator b derber and bouttier 1999 can help to produce a more realistic static b in conclusion here we have presented the first initial results using en4dvar in a realistic coastal ocean circulation setting the research on en4dvar must be continued although it may seem the en4dvar did not show sizeable improvement over the traditional 4dvar in every aspect it has helped us to resolve or at least identify several shortcomings of the traditional approach and point to future research directions some of these problems could be remedied by a more extensive sampling of the coastal ocean to better constrain the forecasts e g when satellite salinity products become more mature and more suitable for assimilation there will be less need in adding a constraint on the sss change based on the forecast model when wide swath altimetry rodriguez et al 2017 becomes routinely available it will provide a much better constraint on the location of the upwelling fronts and eddies than just a few nadir altimeters available for this study using data from several satellites for sst will improve coverage within an assimilation window while research towards the best representation of the background model errors in b must be continued without doubt at the coastal and regional scale we operate in the data hungry environment any future efforts to sample surface and subsurface fields at an ever improving spatial and temporal resolution are key to improved prediction credit authorship

23949,the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme is commonly used in a coarse resolution global ocean model to parameterize the diffusive effect of mesoscale eddy stirring this scheme implemented in a depth coordinate model often accompanies a fail safe system to prevent numerical instability caused by large isopycnal diffusion around steeply sloped isopycnal surfaces its practical implementation artificially induces spurious diapycnal mixing across an isopycnal surface whose slope exceeds a prescribed slope maximum this slope maximum widely ranges from 1 1000 to 3 10 in a recent global ocean model intercomparison project of coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii this study quantitatively investigates the effects of isopycnal tracer diffusion on meridional overturning circulation by calculating water mass transformation rate due to isopycnal diffusion with the use of walin s 1982 methodology we focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model densification induced by nonlinearity of the equation of state spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean induced by practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and diapycnal mixing in the surface diabatic layer it is revealed that a slope maximum that is too small 1 1000 leads to large spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean this diapycnal mixing supplies much buoyancy to the bottom water around antarctica and makes it locally upwell within the southern ocean it results in less northward export of bottom waters from the southern ocean into the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans and weakening of the bottom cell of meridional overturning circulation this spurious diapycnal mixing is significantly suppressed if we use the slope maximum of more than 1 100 or tapering isopycnal diffusivity around steep isopycnal slopes this study also shows that these changes in the implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme also affect the various aspects of the simulated southern ocean the experiment tapering isopycnal diffusivity suppresses unrealistic open ocean deep convections and polynyas in the weddell sea by both diminishing spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean and applying the strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer associated with the isopycnal diffusion scheme it results in the smallest biases of the potential temperature distribution the winter sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea and the acc transport in our coarse resolution model keywords meridional overturning circulation ocean general circulation model isopycnal tracer diffusion spurious diapycnal mixing water mass transformation 1 introduction the thermohaline circulation or oceanic meridional overturning circulation moc is a global scale circulation characterized by localized deep water formation at high latitudes and deep water upwelling in the other vast areas this circulation is basically composed of the two major cells one is the upper cell of the atlantic moc amoc hereafter associated with the north atlantic deep water nadw formation and transport the other is the bottom cell of moc bmoc hereafter associated with the antarctic bottom water aabw and circumpolar deep water cdw formation and transport e g schmitz 1996a b these mocs transport enormous amounts of heat and materials such as carbon and constitute an essential component of the climate system thus it is important for climate modeling studies to develop and use a global ocean model that realistically represents the amoc and bmoc however current ocean models used in climate modeling studies especially depth coordinate models tend to underestimate the magnitude of the bmoc e g downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 lee et al 2019 as discussed in farneti et al 2015 the bmoc involves various kinds of physical processes such as dense shelf water dsw formation in the small coastal polynyas around antarctica tamura et al 2008 and descending currents of dsw along the continental shelf price and baringer 1994 orsi et al 1999 matsumura and hasumi 2008 2010 and proper representation of these processes in numerical models is important for realistic simulations of bmoc e g campin and goosse 1999 nakano and suginohara 2002 kusahara et al 2010 bates et al 2012 snow et al 2015 however coarse resolution models tend to incompletely reproduce these processes and tend to create aabw via the open ocean polynyas and deep convections kjellsson et al 2015 on the other hand it is widely accepted that diapycnal buoyancy supply plays an important role in upwelling of bottom water e g munk 1966 ferrari et al 2016 de lavergne et al 2016 and this is attributed to turbulent mixing as is induced by breaking of internal waves generated by wind and tide munk and wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 this effect is represented by vertical diffusion in a depth coordinate model many earlier studies show that strength of the bmoc in a model is sensitive to the choice of vertical diffusion parameterization with larger vertical diffusivity generally leading to a stronger bmoc e g marotzke 1997 hasumi and suginohara 1999 tsujino et al 2000 scott and marotzke 2002 melet et al 2013 the current study focuses on the diapycnal mixing among the various processes affecting the bmoc strength such as those introduced above diapycnal mixing in a depth coordinate model does not result only from the vertical diffusion term most global ocean models currently used in climate modeling studies do not resolve mesoscale eddies explicitly global ocean models in the early days parameterized a diffusive effect of mesoscale eddy stirring by horizontal diffusion e g 3 4 however this horizontal diffusion causes strong spurious diapycnal mixing in regions with steeply sloped isopycnals such as the western boundary which induces unrealistic upwelling of deep waters in order to close buoyancy budget the veronis effect veronis 1975 so modern global ocean models commonly adopt the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme following redi 1982 to eliminate this spurious diapycnal mixing on the other hand this isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model can induce numerical instability around steeply sloped isopycnals such as within the surface mixed layer the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number for diffusion with a feasible time step interval becomes large in such circumstances especially for the cross terms of isopycnal tracer diffusion tensor between horizontal and vertical directions which means this diffusion scheme becomes numerically unstable there griffies 2004 therefore we need some technical methods in implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme to avoid this problem this practical implementation can still introduce diapycnal mixing to a depth coordinate model in an undesirable manner there are two major technical methods to avoid the numerical instability associated with the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme appendix a in farneti et al 2015 one is called slope clipping method where we set a ceiling on an isopycnal slope value when calculating isopycnal tracer diffusion fluxes this technical treatment can result in strong diapycnal mixing even in the interior ocean where isopycnal diffusion is intrinsically free of diapycnal diffusion if a slope of an isopycnal surface exceeds the prescribed upper limit this method is used in our meteorological research institute community ocean model mri com tsujino et al 2017 in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii project and is also implemented in other models such as nemo madec et al 2016 and coco hasumi 2006 the other method is to introduce a tapering factor to isopycnal diffusivity like gfdl mom in the core ii project farneti et al 2015 this method is called tapering method hereafter its factor depends on a value of isopycnal slope danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 and or vertical location large et al 1997 designed to taper off the isopycnal diffusion coefficient around steeply sloped isopycnals this method can eliminate diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal diffusion however danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 report that diminishing the lateral diapycnal diffusion in the surface boundary layer using this method results in more frequent deep convection in their numerical model this is undesirable because it can make deep biases of winter mixed layer depth and associated cold biases in the weddell sea which are found in several models participating in the core ii project downes et al 2015 by enhancing unrealistic open ocean deep convection griffies 2004 proposes to multiply all isopycnal diffusion tensor terms except for horizontal diagonal ones by this factor in order to retain horizontal diffusion within the surface boundary layer this horizontal diffusion near the sea surface induces strong diapycnal mixing but it is not necessarily artificial because mesoscale eddies cannot carry water masses across the sea surface it is reasonable to assume that the stirring is oriented to the horizontal direction along the sea surface within the physically capped boundary layer nevertheless this practical implementation has a side effect that it can induce spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean away from surface and bottom boundaries when isopycnal surfaces steeply slope there the slope clipping and tapering methods both require setting an arbitrary threshold for an isopycnal slope its magnitude widely varies from 1 1000 to 3 10 among the depth coordinate models participating in the core ii farneti et al 2015 which is the precursor of ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 orr et al 2017 in the phase 6 of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 our model also participates in the core ii project it uses the smallest slope maximum 1 1000 and shows an extremely weak bmoc the choice of the technical method to prevent numerical instability slope clipping or tapering method its parameter value and its practical implementation for the isopycnal diffusion scheme will control the magnitude of diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in a depth coordinate model which may partly account for difference in the bmoc representation in the core ii models downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 our attention is also attracted to this diapycnal mixing problem by the fact that isopycnic models such as gold and noresm o show relatively large northward transport of bottom water at 30 s fig 13 of downes et al 2015 gnanadesikan et al 2007 show that the slope maximum in slope clipping method has a large impact on climate modeling but they focus on the role of the advective effect of mesoscale eddy stirring it has not been quantitatively investigated from the viewpoint of the isopycnal tracer diffusion how the global mocs are affected by differences of practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and its parameter values in this study we conduct three sensitivity experiments with each changing a configuration of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme one experiment adopts the slope clipping scheme with the small slope maximum 1 1000 as our core ii model another experiment also uses the slope clipping scheme but its slope maximum is set at commonly used 1 100 farneti et al 2015 although the tapering method is not a newly developed technique its impact on mocs has not been investigated enough thus the tapering method is adopted in the remaining experiment this experiment relaxes the regulation on the isopycnal slope more than the other two experiments which will lead to better representation of isopycnal slopes in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme recently groeskamp et al 2019a proposed a new method to minimize numerical errors in the calculation of isopycnal tracer diffusion fluxes their method directly calculates tracer gradients along isopycnal surfaces as well as the surfaces slopes and they show that the better gradients also contribute to more accurate representation of the diffusion fluxes unfortunately this state of the art method has not been implemented and tested in our model therefore the current study focuses on the effects of isopycnal slope limitations on our model s performances in the southern ocean the strength of the bmoc at 30 s varies widely from 5 5 to 14 5 sv in our sensitivity experiments the first experiment shows the minimal magnitude of bmoc we conduct a water mass transformation analysis e g walin 1982 and quantitatively estimate the transformation rate due to the isopycnal tracer diffusion we especially focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model 1 water mass densification due to nonlinear effects of the equation of state 2 spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean induced by practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and 3 diapycnal mixing within the surface mixed layer induced by the practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme it is quantitatively revealed that the spurious diapycnal mixing in the second effect supplies buoyancy to the bottom water within the southern ocean leading to stronger recirculation at high latitudes in the southern ocean this results in a weaker northward transport of the bottom water at low latitudes and a weaker bmoc on the whole our analysis indicates that lower diapycnal mixing in the interior the second effect and higher diapycnal mixing in the surface mixed layer the third effect suppress unrealistic open ocean deep convection in the weddell sea 2 experimental settings 2 1 model configuration the ocean modelers in the meteorological research institute mri have developed a series of global ocean ice coupled models called gondola for use in scientific researches and operational works in mri and the japan meteorological agency jma this study uses gondola 100 table 1 where the numeric suffix denotes its nominal horizontal resolution in units of km the model code is mri com version 4 developed in mri tsujino et al 2017 the oceanic part of mri com is based on the primitive equations under the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations with explicit free surface the model domain of gondola 100 is global extending from 78 5 s to 90 n it sets singularity points on land at siberia 64 n 80 e and canada 64 n 100 w by adopting murray 1996 s tripolar grid the horizontal resolution is primarily 1 degree in longitude and 0 5 degree in latitude with refinement down to 0 3 degree within 10 degrees north and south of the equator it has 60 layers vertically whose thickness ranges from 2 m for the top layer to 700 m for the bottom layer and also has one bottom boundary layer of 50 m thickness around antarctica and iceland nakano and suginohara 2002 there are 40 layers assigned to the upper layer above 1000 m the model topography is based on general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2014 version 20141103 weatherall et al 2015 merged with jtopo30v2 published by the marine information research center which describes the topography around japan with high accuracy we adopt a partial cell method of adcroft et al 1997 to represent realistic bottom topography momentum is advected using the takano and oonishi scheme as described in ishizaki and motoi 1999 we adopt anisotropic horizontal viscosity in the laplacian form proposed by smith and mcwilliams 2003 different viscosity coefficients are applied to both directions perpendicular and parallel to the local flow in the model the ratio of the perpendicular viscosity to the parallel one is set at 0 2 but linearly tapers to 0 1 at the equator from 5 n s in order to reproduce a realistic velocity distribution of equatorial undercurrent euc the viscosity coefficient parallel to local flow is calculated using the methodology of smagorinsky 1963 background vertical viscosity is constant at 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 this model solves the following prognostic equation for potential temperature and salinity 1 d c d t c t u c z k v c z q s w r f c i s o f c g m where c stands for potential temperature θ or salinity s k v is the vertical diffusion coefficient q s w r denotes potential temperature tendency due to absorption of solar shortwave radiation in the ocean interior which drops in the prognostic equation for salinity and f c i s o and f c g m denote the isopycnal tracer diffusion flux of redi 1982 and the isopycnal layer thickness diffusion flux of gent and mcwilliams 1990 respectively the detailed information about the isopycnal tracer diffusion is given in the following section the isopycnal layer thickness diffusion of gent and mcwilliams 1990 is implemented to parameterize advective tracer transports induced by mesoscale eddies our model adopts the layer thickness diffusivity proposed by danabasoglu and marshall 2007 which depends on a buoyancy frequency and ranges from 300 to 1500 m 2 s 1 in this study we also adopt the modification of surface eddy fluxes proposed by danabasoglu et al 2008 as follows thickness diffusion fluxes are modified within a surface diabatic layer dl so as to let a meridional streamfunction induced by mesoscale eddies linearly taper to zero at the sea surface from the bottom of dl the dl consists of a mixed layer ml and a transition layer tl which connects the ml and the interior ocean the slope limit used in the evaluation of the layer thickness diffusion fluxes is independent from that used in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in our model we put a ceiling on an isopycnal slope at 5 1 0 3 so as to prevent a residual meridional velocity flow southward in the ekman layer of the southern ocean this ceiling is also arbitrary along with the threshold used in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme and gnanadesikan et al 2007 show that a numerical model has high sensitivity on its choice this sensitivity is beyond the scope of the current study and is fixed at this value throughout the experiments conducted in this study background vertical diffusion coefficients have an empirical 3d distribution based on decloedt and luther 2010 dl10 hereafter and range from 0 056 to 51 1697 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 we adopt the generic length scale gls scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 as the ml scheme unstable stratifications are stabilized by adopting a large vertical diffusivity at 1 m 2 s 1 the model adopts the second order moment som advection scheme of prather 1986 for tracer equations the sea ice part of mri com is based on that of mellor and kantha 1989 mk89 hereafter which treats sea ice and snow some components or processes are upgraded to or incorporated from those of the los alamos sea ice model cice version 3 14 hunke and lipscomb 2006 such as an albedo scheme multiple thickness categories ridging and rheology the model adopts the elastic plastic viscous evp model by hunke and dukowicz 1997 2002 the sea ice and snow are advected with the use of the mpdata scheme of smolarkiewicz 1984 we have five sea ice categories whose upper boundaries are 0 6 1 4 2 4 3 6 and 30 m we use bulk coefficients recommended by large and yeager 2004 ly04 hereafter in calculation of wind stress and heat flux over the sea ice which are different from standard values proposed by mk89 2 2 isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme the isopycnal tracer diffusion flux is calculated from the following equation 2 f c i s o k c where k denotes the isopycnal diffusion tensor according to redi 1982 the isopycnal diffusion tensor k redi is written as 3 k redi a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 ϵ s x 2 ϵ 1 s x s y 1 ϵ s x ϵ 1 s x s y 1 s x 2 ϵ s y 2 1 ϵ s y 1 ϵ s x 1 ϵ s y ϵ s 2 where 4 s s x s y 0 ρ l x ρ l z ρ l y ρ l z 0 5 ϵ a d a iso the density ρ l denotes locally referenced potential density the isopycnal tracer diffusivity a iso is 1500 m 2 s 1 in this study unless otherwise stated the diapycnal tracer diffusivity a d is specified independently of the vertical diffusion coefficients actually used in our model and set at zero in the current study this means ϵ 0 in the current study and ϵ is dropped in equations hereafter as already noted a large diffusion flux along a steep isopycnal slope can violate the cfl condition and can cause numerical instability griffies 2004 a classical remedy for this problem is the slope clipping scheme which has been adopted for long in mri com tsujino et al 2017 in order to cap the corresponding vertical diffusion flux the vertical density gradient in eq 4 is modified so that the magnitude of the isopycnal slope s does not exceed a prescribed upper limit s clip the isopycnal diffusion flux does not follow an isopycnal surface around steep isopycnals where s s clip resulting in spurious diapycnal diffusion the isopycnal diffusion tensor with this method k k clip is written as follows 6 k clip k redi if s s clip a iso 1 s clip 2 1 r c 2 s y 2 r c 2 s x s y r c s x r c 2 s x s y 1 r c 2 s x 2 r c s y r c s x r c s y s clip 2 if s s clip where r c s clip s the alternative option in mri com is the tapering method where a tapering factor f is imposed on the isopycnal diffusion tensor the tapering factor f is a product of two different factors f 1 and f 2 large et al 1997 7 f f 1 f 2 8 f 1 1 2 1 tanh s c s s w 9 f 2 1 2 1 sin π r 1 2 the factor f 1 was originally proposed by danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 it rapidly tapers to zero as an isopycnal slope exceeds the threshold the threshold is prescribed by the two parameters s c and s w which are set at 8 100 and 1 100 in the current study respectively the factor f 1 quickly decreases from almost 1 0 99753 to almost 0 0 00247 as an isopycnal slope increases from 5 100 to 11 100 this factor works anywhere from the sea surface to the bottom on the other hand the factor f 2 targets sea surface boundary layers the variable r in eq 9 is calculated as follows 10 r max 0 min 1 d λ s where d is the depth from the bottom of ml and λ is an internal rossby radius of deformation the product λ s denotes the tl thickness this factor gradually tapers off from the bottom of dl to the bottom of ml and is equal to zero within the ml following the suggestion of griffies 2004 the tapering factor f is imposed on all terms of the diffusion tensor except for the horizontal diagonal ones of k redi the isopycnal diffusion tensor k k taper is written as follows 11 k taper a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 f s x s y f s x f s x s y 1 s x 2 f s y f s x f s y f s 2 12 f k redi 1 f a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 0 0 0 1 s x 2 0 0 0 0 the second term on the right hand side of the second line works to diffuse tracers in the horizontal direction which leads to diapycnal mixing this treatment is intended to gradually change isopycnal diffusion in the ocean interior below dl to horizontal diffusion within the ml where the tapering factor becomes 0 2 3 experimental design we conduct three experiments using the model described above we drive the model conforming to the protocol of omip griffies et al 2016 in each experiment we use the interannual forcing datasets of core ii from 1948 to 2009 our experiments are conducted by repeatedly imposing this forcing six times that is the integration duration is 372 years for each experiment each experiment starts from 1638 so that the model year in the last cycle corresponds with the actual forcing year the bulk formulae of large and yeager 2009 is used in the calculation of surface heat and momentum fluxes note that our model considers penetration of solar shortwave radiation into the ocean interior according to ishizaki and yamanaka 2010 we also apply sea surface salinity sss restoring to sss distribution of core ii its piston velocity is set at 50 m per 365 days the sss restoring is also applied under the sea ice but made invalid under the sea ice in coastal grid points the surface salt flux due to the sss damping and the net surface freshwater flux are modified by adding an offset for every time step so as to adjust their averages to zero for the purpose of the total salt and water content conservation of our ice ocean coupled system potential temperature and salinity are initialized by world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 woa13v2 whose horizontal resolution is 0 25 degree the january distributions are used for the upper 1500 m and the winter averages are used below the 1500 m depth velocity field starts from the state of rest an initial state of the sea ice model is taken from the january distribution of the preliminary experiment table 2 summarizes the differences of the three experiments two experiments adopt the slope clipping method and the remaining one uses the tapering method one of the former experiments adopts a small clipping slope of 1 1000 which is the same value used in our core ii model table 1 in farneti et al 2015 this experiment is called clip1 hereafter in order to investigate the impact of the clipping slope on mocs we conduct the other slope clipping experiment clip2 with the widely used value 1 100 table 1 in farneti et al 2015 the experiment with the tapering method is called taper hereafter the ocean model used in this experiment is almost the same as the ocean component of our earth system model mri esm2 0 developed for cmip6 yukimoto et al 2019 because the horizontal diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor are not multiplied by this factor the factor less than 1 leads to diapycnal mixing it depends solely on an isopycnal slope in the ocean interior the factor is almost 1 with a slope under 5 100 and almost 0 with a slope over 11 100 these two experiments clip2 and taper exhibit small spurious diapycnal mixing induced by the practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme table 2 on the other hand isopycnal diffusion flux in the model mixes tracers along a completely horizontal plane within the mixed layer in the experiment taper thus it results in large diapycnal mixing near the sea surface in this experiment the experiment clip2 also shows diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal diffusion scheme because isopycnal surfaces are steeply sloped within the mixed layer however its magnitude becomes smaller than the experiment taper because eddy stirring mainly occurs along the clipped isopycnal slope table 2 this study mainly compares climatological averages for the period of the last forcing cycle note that the model is not fully spun up because of its short integration time 372 years however initial model drift in each experiment almost settles down in the last cycle with respect to the magnitude of major cells of the mocs and volume transport through the drake passage refer to supplementary material thus we can quantitatively discuss impacts of the configuration changes of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme on the magnitude of the mocs and water mass transformation in the southern ocean we also note that the isopycnal diffusion coefficient is 1000 m 2 s 1 in the experiment clip1 which is smaller than that in the other two experiments we conduct another experiment using the same isopycnal diffusion coefficient as the experiments clip2 and taper a large unrealistic open ocean polynya frequently occurs in the weddell sea after 170 year integration in this experiment potential temperature and salinity structures collapse due to open ocean deep convections under this unrealistic polynya this experiment shows a completely different dense water formation process which affects the magnitude of the bmoc refer to the supplementary material this different dense water formation process obscures the direct effect of the implementation and settings of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme on the bmoc thus we use the smaller coefficient in the experiment clip1 3 results 3 1 impact on bmoc in the southern ocean fig 1 shows residual mocs south to 20 s which are calculated with the sum of the resolved and parameterized mesoscale eddy induced velocities in the potential density coordinate referenced to 2000 dbar σ 2 the general structure in the southern ocean is almost the same among the three experiments and consistent with the structures in earlier studies e g döös and webb 1994 hirst and mcdougall 1998 farneti et al 2015 there is an anti clockwise cell north of 42 s in a density layer lighter than 35 7 σ 2 which is called the subtropical cell an anti clockwise cell is also found in the densest layer denser than 36 9 σ 2 this cell is called the bmoc cell hereafter the clockwise cell exists between the subtropical cell and bmoc cell which is called the amoc cell hereafter we roughly classify the water masses in the southern ocean into the following four water mass groups by density as is done in downes et al 2015 in order to quantitatively investigate meridional volume transports induced by these three overturning cells surface thermocline water tw mode intermediate water mw deep water dw and bottom water bw isopycnal interfaces between tw and mw mw and dw and dw and bw are defined in each experiment by locations where the residual moc at 30 s takes its local minimal maximal values around 34 0 36 5 37 5 σ 2 respectively fig 1 also shows the meridional volume transports at 30 s by green numbers around 30 s in each panel the three experiments show few differences in the southward tw transport about 20 sv and the northward mw transport around 25 sv those are much larger than estimates by talley 2008 9 0 and 11 9 sv respectively but such overestimation is commonly found in the core ii models fig 13 in downes et al 2015 the volume transports of dw and bw vary significantly among three experiments fig 1 the experiment clip1 shows minimal northward transport of bw 5 5 sv the maximal bw export from the southern ocean is found in the experiment clip2 14 5 sv the bw transport in the experiment taper 11 4 sv is smaller than in the experiment clip2 but more than twice as large as in the experiment clip1 this bw export from the southern ocean in the experiments clip2 and taper is still smaller than previous estimates based on inverse models ranging from 21 to 27 sv ganachaud 2003 talley et al 2003 lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2008 but is on the same level as the northward transport of best performed depth coordinate models participating in core ii downes et al 2015 the differences in the bw transports account for differences in the southward transports of dw among the three experiments this means that the amoc cell differs little at 30 s and the changes in configuration of the isopycnal diffusion scheme largely affect the representation of the bmoc in our model the bmoc cell has a recirculation cell in its polar side fig 1 which is called the subpolar cell farneti et al 2015 the magnitude of the subpolar cell indicates a formation rate of the densest water around antarctica it is 22 5 18 5 and 15 1 sv for the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively fig 1 contrary to the northward bw transport at 30 s the dense water formation rate is smaller by more than 4 sv in the experiments clip2 and taper than in the experiment clip1 this means that the dense water created around antarctica is effectively exported from the southern ocean in the experiments clip2 and taper more than 75 of dense water flows into the atlantic and indo pacific basins at 30 s as bw on the other hand only 24 of the dense water becomes bw in the experiment clip1 this indicates that much buoyancy is supplied to the dense water in the interior region of the southern ocean in this experiment 3 2 water mass transformation analysis on bmoc we conduct water mass transformation analysis in order to investigate how the bw export increases in the experiments clip2 and taper compared to the experiment clip1 when we change the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme first we briefly introduce water mass transformation analysis fig 2 schematically shows an arbitrary isopycnal surface s outcropping to the sea surface in the southern ocean v denotes the volume of a space enclosed by the isopycnal surface s the sea surface the sea bottom and the northern boundary of the target region the northward volume transport at the northern boundary between the surface s and the sea bottom is equal to the sign reversed meridional overturning streamfunction mosf calculated in the density coordinate ψ shown in fig 1 the transformation rate toward denser water across the surface s ω satisfies the following relationship 13 ω ψ v t the right hand side denotes volume inflation of the isopycnal layer note that the sea surface freshwater flux is ignored as being sufficiently small compared to each term above following groeskamp et al 2019b ω is calculated as follows 14 ω s ω d s 15 s d σ d t σ 1 d s 16 σ v d σ d t d v where ω is velocity perpendicular to an isopycnal surface s toward denser waters σ is potential density and σ is a density gradient perpendicular to an isopycnal surface s note that the following relationship holds 17 ω σ d σ d t σ β d s d t α d θ d t where α and β stand for the thermal expansion and haline contraction coefficients respectively using eqs 1 16 and 17 we can calculate a contribution to the total water mass transformation rate ω of each diabatic process and or each active tracer potential temperature and salinity in a model as follows 18 ω e x p l i c i t σ v σ β z k v s z α z k v θ z α q s w r β f s i s o α f θ i s o d v 19 σ v σ β f s α f θ d v σ v σ β d s α d θ d v σ v σ β f s i s o α f θ i s o d v where the vertical diffusion term is decomposed into contributions of sea surface flux f s and f θ and vertical diffusion in the interior d s and d θ note that f θ includes the absorption of solar shortwave radiation q s w r as is done in iudicone et al 2008b and groeskamp and iudicone 2018 the first term in the right hand side of eq 19 denotes water mass transformation due to the sea surface buoyancy flux including solar shortwave radiation the second term is transformation rate by the vertical diffusion this vertical diffusion includes all vertical diffusive processes such as the vertical mixing in ml the enhanced mixing under unstable stratification and the background vertical diffusion flux originating from tidal dissipation the last term in eq 19 denotes water mass transformation due to isopycnal diffusion note that the divergence of f c g m found in eq 1 is dropped here because it parameterizes the advective effect of mesoscale eddies and does not involve water mass transformation this study discusses climatological water mass transformation rates averaged over the period of the last cycle from 1948 to 2009 each component of water mass transformation due to the diabatic process surface buoyancy flux vertical diffusion and isopycnal diffusion is diagnosed with the equation introduced above using monthly averages of potential temperature salinity and their tendency terms due to each diabatic process in the model the potential density tendency due to each diabatic process is calculated in the depth coordinate and then is remapped to the potential density coordinate according to the method proposed by getzlaff et al 2010 this tendency is used in eq 19 to calculate the water mass transformation rate in each month which is temporally averaged over the period from 1948 to 2009 megann 2018 diagnoses the water mass transformation rates in his eddy permitting model and discusses that 5 day mean data give smoother mosf and water mass transformation field than monthly mean data do because our analysis is based on the monthly mean data the diagnosed mosf and water mass transformation rate might contain large sampling errors associated with the offline calculation i e post run calculation using sampled mean fields in order to investigate this issue we compared two mosfs calculated with two other datasets of horizontal volume transports in the potential density coordinate those are different from mosfs in our main analysis because they are calculated with a different remapping method from the one proposed by getzlaff et al 2010 one is remapped offline as is done in our main analysis but the other is remapped online i e at every time step during the model integration and is free from the sampling errors the difference is negligible especially in the denser density range less than 0 1 sv in all sensitivity experiments refer to the supplementary material for details this indicates that the offline analysis with the monthly mean data suffices for mosf calculation in this study our model does not resolve and permit mesoscale eddies and their effects are implicitly parameterized thus the model s resolved fields show smaller temporal variability than those in eddy permitting models and this results in the small sampling errors of mosf we believe that this also holds true for our water mass transformation analysis the total water mass transformation rate ω is calculated as the difference between the volume inflation term v t and mosf ψ eq 13 as is done in some earlier studies lee et al 2002 urakawa and hasumi 2014 the volume inflation term is calculated using instantaneous fields of potential temperature and salinity at the initial and final states of the averaging period this total transformation rate does not equal to the sum of explicitly diagnosed components using eq 19 ω e x p l i c i t the residual term ω ω e x p l i c i t results from various numerical errors associated with our model and water mass transformation analysis such as spurious diapycnal mixing associated with the advection scheme griffies et al 2000 lee et al 2002 ilicak et al 2012 urakawa and hasumi 2014 megann 2018 and analytical errors associated with vertical coordinate conversion getzlaff et al 2010 it also includes sampling errors resulting from offline analysis with monthly mean model data which may be assumed to be negligible in the current study as already noted we especially focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model the first effect comes from nonlinearity of the equation of state of the sea water although isopycnal diffusion is intrinsically free of diapycnal mixing it can result in density change through this nonlinearity e g mcdougall 1987 it is known that this water mass transformation is not negligible especially in the southern ocean e g 23 38 41 81 the remaining two effects are caused by lateral diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer and spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean due to our practical implementation of mesoscale eddy parameterization figs 3a and b show the sign reversed mosf the northward transport at 30 s between the sea floor and an arbitrary isopycnal surface and the total water mass transformation rate through an isopycnal surface south to 30 s respectively they correspond well to each other in the experiments clip2 and taper this indicates that the change in the bw export is mostly explained by the difference in water mass transformation rate due to a specific diabatic process in these experiments on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows a relatively large difference in the layer denser than 36 9 σ 2 the difference denotes the volume contraction of the bw density layer it means that the bw formation and transformation from lighter waters are insufficient to compensate the northward bw transport at 30 s and that their gap is filled by the consumption of the existing bw in this experiment thus this negative volume inflation term does not explain the smallest bw export in the experiment clip1 it should be accounted for by the differences in water mass transformation the total water mass transformation fig 3b does not correspond to the net water mass transformation due to the diabatic processes that can be explicitly diagnosed from eq 19 their difference results from numerical errors associated with the advection scheme the vertical coordinate conversion the sampling interval of the model s outputs and so on this residual term is not negligible fig 3c but smaller than the water mass transformation due to each diabatic process shown in figs 3d f the total bw transformation rate amounts to 1 1 16 2 and 11 0 sv in the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively fig 4 the experiment clip1 shows the smallest transformation rate which is consistent with the relatively small northward bw transport shown in the previous section figs 1 and 4 the major contributors to the overall water mass transformation in the southern ocean are the surface buoyancy flux and the vertical diffusion flux figs 3d and e respectively the former tends to make dense light water denser lighter whereas the latter works to homogenize water masses in the southern ocean which is consistent with earlier studies e g iudicone et al 2008b urakawa and hasumi 2012 groeskamp et al 2016 the bw transformation rate due to surface buoyancy flux differs little among the three experiments 19 0 sv for clip1 and clip2 and 18 3 sv for taper fig 4 the same goes for the bw transformation rate due to vertical diffusion 5 9 sv for clip1 6 9 sv for clip2 and 5 8 sv for taper fig 4 the net transformation rates of these two processes do not account for the differences in the bw export among the three experiments 5 5 sv for clip1 14 5 sv for clip2 and 11 4 sv for taper fig 4 fig 3f shows the remaining water mass transformation rate due to isopycnal diffusion solid lines it only plays a secondary role in the lighter density range 36 9 σ 2 but is comparable in magnitude to the water mass transformation by surface buoyancy flux in the dense water range 36 9 σ 2 in the latter density range the isopycnal diffusion counteracts the net dense water formation by surface buoyancy flux and vertical diffusion dashed lines in fig 3f this negative transformation is caused by diapycnal mixing within the surface diabatic layer fig 3g and or spurious diapycnal mixing induced by the practical implementations of isopycnal diffusion schemes fig 3h these conceal the water mass densification by the nonlinearity of the equation of state due to isopycnal diffusion only cabbeling is expressed in the potential density framework in fact the isopycnal diffusion in the experiments clip2 and taper densifies water masses for almost all density classes in the ocean interior where isopycnal surfaces are gently sloped and thus isopycnal diffusion in the model causes little diapycnal mixing fig 3h on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows the large water mass transformation toward lighter waters even in the ocean interior fig 3h because the small maximum is small 1 1000 in this experiment the slope clipping works even in the interior ocean which results in this spurious diapycnal mixing there in the experiment clip2 this isopycnal diffusion leads to water mass transformation from dw to bw by the rate of 5 2 sv in the southern ocean fig 4 the bw transformation rate is small in the experiment taper amounting to 0 3 sv on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows large destruction of bw 6 4 sv due to the isopycnal diffusion which is caused by the spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean fig 4 this spurious diapycnal mixing supplies buoyancy to the bw within the southern ocean and enhances the subpolar cell it results in the smaller northward transport of the bw at 30 s in the experiment clip1 compared to the other two experiments it should be noted that the water mass transformation due to numerical errors also contributes to the smaller bw export in the experiment clip1 the transformation rate is 5 6 1 2 and 1 8 sv for the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively more bw is transformed to lighter waters by about 4 sv in the experiment clip1 than in the other two experiments however its contribution is smaller than that of isopycnal tracer diffusion 3 3 slope clipping versus tapering factor the experiment clip1 shows that the slope clipping scheme with a slope maximum that is too small induces substantial spurious diapycnal mixing which supplies buoyancy to the bw within the southern ocean resulting in underestimation of the northward export of bw into the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans the bw export in the experiments clip2 and taper still goes below the observational estimate but is much larger than that in the experiment clip1 then which configuration is better for climate modeling that of the experiment clip2 or that of the experiment taper the experiment clip2 shows the larger bw export than the experiment taper but we choose the configuration of the latter experiment for our coupled model mri esm2 0 yukimoto et al 2019 as noted in section 2 3 considering several aspects of the southern ocean representation in the model such as sea ice concentration the antarctic circumpolar current acc transport and the potential temperature profiles fig 5 shows the southern hemisphere sea ice concentration in the austral winter climatologically averaged over the period from 1980 to 2009 the experiment clip1 shows an open ocean area with low sea ice concentration less than 0 9 in the weddell sea this is a signal of unrealistic open ocean polynya fig 6 shows time series of minimal values of winter sea ice concentration and maximal values of winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea at each latitude band a huge ice free area with sea ice concentration less than 10 4 is found in the last decade in the experiment clip1 this unrealistic weddell sea polynya accompanies open ocean deep convection and deep mixed layer in that area the experiment clip2 does not show such ice free areas but the small weddell sea polynyas cyclically appear in the offshore regions of the sea from the earlier stage of simulation fig 6c moreover the mixed layer is deeper and extends to the broader area of the weddell sea than in the experiment clip1 fig 5d these indicate that the open ocean deep convection occurs under the sea ice in the central weddell sea and it transports relatively warm deep water upward and partly melts the sea ice there on the other hand the low concentration area of the winter sea ice is not observed in the open ocean region of the weddell sea over the whole period of this simulation fig 6e in the experiment taper the winter mixed layer in this area is still deeper than the observational estimate fig 5f but the biases are much smaller than those in the other two experiments which indicates the weaker open ocean deep convection there huge open ocean polynyas in the weddell sea were also observed in the real ocean around the maud rise in the mid 1970s zwally et al 1983 and their causes have been investigated by earlier studies holland 2001 shows that the cyclonic eddy formed by the currents over the maud rise creates the sea ice opening and that deep convections induced by the strong sea surface cooling enlarge this opening leading to the huge open ocean polynyas in the area hirabara et al 2012 point out the importance of the preconditioning of potential temperature and salinity fields over the maud rise in the weddell sea polynya formation warming of the deep layer due to the lateral cdw transport and the anomalously saline surface water weaken the stratification over the maud rise which is favorable for the deep convection then the divergent sea ice drift due to the cyclonic wind stress triggers the formation of the huge weddell polynya in this area kjellsson et al 2015 show that open ocean convections in the weddell and ross seas are sensitive to the vertical mixing in the surface boundary layer and to the freshwater input from the antarctic ice sheet and its spatial distribution all model and experimental configurations however are common among the three experiments in the current study except for the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme thus the differences in the sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea result from the differences in this scheme here we discuss the causes of the weddell sea polynyas in the current study from the standpoint of diapycnal mixing induced by practical implementations of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in the sea surface boundary layer and in the interior ocean note that the former diapycnal mixing is assumed to be large in the experiments clip1 and taper whereas the latter mixing is large in the experiment clip1 table 2 the major difference between the experiments clip2 and taper is the magnitude of diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer because both the experiments show less spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean as discussed in the previous section the isopycnal diffusion becomes the horizontal diffusion in the experiment taper and shows stronger diapycnal mixing than that in the experiment clip2 where tracers are diffused along the clipped surfaces which are aligned more closely with the isopycnal surfaces than the horizontal plane it is assumed that strong diapycnal diffusion associated with this horizontal diffusion takes lighter waters into the convection site from the surrounding areas and leads to the stabilization of the stratification in the area and the suppression of further development of deep convection this assumption is also supported by the fact that the experiment clip1 does not show the weddell sea polynyas and the winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea is shallower than in the experiment clip2 for the first five forcing cycles from 1638 to 1947 fig 6 this is because the experiment clip1 adopts a smaller slope maximum than the experiment clip2 and this results in the larger diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer the difference between the experiments clip1 and taper is the magnitude of the spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean table 2 the experiment taper does not show any open ocean polynya in the weddell sea during the whole integration period but the huge open ocean ice free areas are observed in the last cycle in the experiment clip1 the experiment clip1 shows the large spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean associated with the slope clipping scheme with a slope maximum that is too small it strongly mixes dense bws around antarctica and relatively light waters at lower latitudes resulting in warming the deep and bottom layers of the southern ocean in the experiment clip1 fig 7a this gradually weakens the stratification in the deep southern ocean setting up a favorable environment for deep convection there eventually resulting in large open ocean deep convection and polynya in the weddell sea in the last cycle to summarize the occurrence of the weddell sea polynyas in the experiment taper is suppressed by both applying strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer and diminishing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean these differences also affect other aspects of the southern ocean state because the open ocean convections in the weddell sea accompany intense dense water formation there the appearance of the huge ice free areas in the experiment clip1 leads to excessive dense water formation in the area resulting in abrupt enhancement of the subpolar cell in the last decade fig 8a the dense water formation also enhances the meridional gradient of density in the acc region and leads to the unrealistic abrupt increase in the acc transport fig 8b as is discussed in hirabara et al 2012 and farneti et al 2015 because these huge open ocean convections only occur in the last cycle the cold bottom water created there does not have enough time to spread over the global bottom layers thus zonally averaged potential temperature shows warm biases of bottom waters fig 7a which result from buoyancy supply due to the spurious diapycnal mixing in the experiment clip1 as already discussed on the other hand the experiment clip2 shows large deep ocean convections from earlier forcing cycles fig 6d the unrealistically cold dense water created there occupies the deep and bottom layers of the southern ocean and results in large cold biases fig 7b the deep convection also enhances baroclinicity in the southern ocean and leads to the large acc transport fig 8b amounting to 196 5 sv as the average from 2007 to 2009 the latest observational estimate for the acc transport is 173 3 10 7 sv as the average from 2007 to 2011 donohue et al 2016 the acc transport in the experiment clip2 exceeds the upper bound of this observational estimate the unrealistic open ocean convections and polynyas are well suppressed in the experiment taper by applying strong diapycnal mixing near the sea surface and diminishing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean it results in modest temperature biases in the deep and bottom layers fig 7c and the weaker acc transport compared to the experiment clip2 fig 8b the mean acc transport from 2007 to 2009 for this experiment amounts to 172 9 sv which is within the range of the observational estimate by donohue et al 2016 4 conclusions and discussions the ocean model intercomparison in the core ii project reveals that the global models tend to underestimate the magnitude of the bottom cell of moc bmoc downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 our model which is participating in this project especially underestimates the strength of the bmoc this study focuses on the practical implementations of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme to depth coordinate models that induce diapycnal mixing and cause this underestimation of the bmoc the experiment clip1 uses the classical slope clipping method with the small maximal slope 1 1000 this is the same configuration as our model in core ii farneti et al 2015 the water mass transformation analysis reveals that the isopycnal diffusion in this experiment causes enormous spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior region of the southern ocean and supplies much buoyancy to the bottom water bw around antarctica this makes the bws upwell locally within the southern ocean and results in less bw export to the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans 5 5 sv at 30 s this spurious mixing is remedied by using the larger slope maximum 1 100 in the slope clipping scheme the experiment clip2 or adopting the tapering factor to the isopycnal diffusivity with an adequately large slope maximum instead of using the slope clipping scheme the experiment taper it results in the larger northward transport of the bw at 30 s in these two experiments 14 5 sv for clip2 and 11 4 sv for taper these are still smaller than the observational estimates ranging from 21 to 27 sv ganachaud 2003 talley et al 2003 lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2008 but are on a comparable level with the best performed depth coordinate models in core ii downes et al 2015 the changes in the isopycnal diffusion scheme affect not only the bmoc magnitude but also other aspects of the southern ocean state in the numerical model the experiment taper shows a shallower mixed layer than the experiment clip2 figs 5 and 6 weak stratification results in enormously steep isopycnals within the surface mixed layer the isopycnal diffusion flux is oriented to the horizontal direction within the surface mixed layer in the experiment taper causing strong diapycnal mixing such diapycnal mixing within the surface boundary layer is not necessarily spurious as mesoscale eddies do not stir water masses purely along the isopycnal surface in such a narrow region which is physically capped by the air sea interface this also holds true in the experiment clip2 but the isopycnal diffusion in this experiment diffuses tracers along the slope clipped surface which is aligned more closely with the isopycnal surface than the horizontal plane and involves less diapycnal mixing it is supposed that the stronger diapycnal mixing within the mixed layer incorporates lighter waters into the convection site from the surrounding areas and suppresses further development of the deep convection by stabilizing the stratification in the experiment taper suppressing these unrealistic deep convections relaxes the intense cold bw formation there resulting in the reduced cold bias of the bottom layer in the experiment taper fig 7 it also weakens the meridional density gradient and leads to the realistic magnitude of the acc transport fig 8 it is not surprising that the experiment clip1 shows shallower winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea than the experiment clip2 figs 6b and d except for the periods when the huge open ocean polynya appears in the experiment clip1 fig 6a because the surface diapycnal mixing is stronger than in the experiment clip2 due to the smaller slope maximum in the experiment clip1 however the deep convections eventually occur in the last forcing cycle in the experiment clip1 fig 6a the experiment taper does not show an open ocean polynya in the weddell sea during the integration period fig 6e this difference results from spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean the spurious diapycnal mixing in the experiment clip1 supplies much buoyancy to the bw and leads to the warm bias in the bottom layer fig 7a this gradually weakens the deep stratification and eventually results in the open ocean polynyas with the huge ice free areas the excessive dense water formation there leads to the unrealistically abrupt increase in the acc transport and the magnitude of the sub polar cell fig 8 the unrealistic open ocean polynyas and deep convections in the weddell sea create excessively cold deep and bottom waters throughout the water columns which leads to unrealistic distribution of potential temperature in the southern ocean this temperature field enhances baroclinicity in the southern ocean and results in the unrealistic acc transport thus they have been regarded as unfavorable features in this study the experiment taper suppresses them by both reducing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean and applying the strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer it results in the smallest biases in the zonal mean potential temperature winter sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea and the acc transport this experiment also shows the large northward transport of bw at 30 s although it is still smaller than the previous estimates based on inverse models these are the reasons why we adopt the configuration of this experiment in our earth system model mri esm2 0 yukimoto et al 2019 on the other hand we must pay attention to the fact that the smallest biases do not necessarily guarantee the physical correctness of the numerical scheme there does not exist a perfect numerical model and numerical models generally include several flaws whose bad effects can compensate each other and yield apparently good results for example coarse resolution models tend to incompletely reproduce the real bw formation processes along the antarctic continental slope and tend to create bws via the open ocean polynyas and deep convections kjellsson et al 2015 thus suppressing the open ocean polynyas in the weddell sea in the experiment taper might result in unrealistically weak ventilation of the deep ocean in the current model we cannot deny the possibility that the model configuration of the experiment taper is just optimized to this situation we must also note that none of the experiments reach a steady state in the current study because of the experiment s short integration period the winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea continues to increase even in the last forcing cycle in the experiment taper several processes potentially contribute to this drift the insufficient bw formation could lead to gradual warming of the bottom layer that results in weak stratification and triggers the deep convections the drift might be induced by inadequate representation of mesoscale eddies in the mixed layer in our model it has not been established how this mesoscale eddy stirring in the boundary layers should be parameterized in a coarse resolution ocean model it is highly possible that the experiments clip2 and taper still have the considerable spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean which can lead to the deep convections groeskamp et al 2019a show that the slope clipping method with the slope maximum of 1 100 produces significantly large fictitious diffusivity in the interior ocean with the use of observational climatology of potential temperature and salinity this is the same configuration as our experiment clip2 the fictitious diffusivity is reduced by calculating the isopycnal slope more accurately as is done in our experiment taper but is still large in the acc region and near the sea bottom groeskamp et al 2019a propose a completely new approach to calculate isopycnal diffusion fluxes where tracer gradients along isopycnal surface are directly evaluated along with the isopycnal slopes they show that this method significantly decreases the fictitious diffusivity in the interior ocean another benefit of this approach is that it does not require an arbitrary ceiling on the isopycnal slope this state of the art method should be implemented and tested in numerical models to summarize the current study highlights the sensitivity of a coarse resolution model to the details of the implementation of an isopycnal diffusion scheme but it is difficult to propose the best practice of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme for a coarse resolution model in the current study it will require a longer numerical integration of the model the proper representation of all processes associated with the bottom water formation around antarctica and numerical simulations with eddy resolving models as well as the proper parameterization of mesoscale eddies further investigations are required in the future in this field for more

23949,the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme is commonly used in a coarse resolution global ocean model to parameterize the diffusive effect of mesoscale eddy stirring this scheme implemented in a depth coordinate model often accompanies a fail safe system to prevent numerical instability caused by large isopycnal diffusion around steeply sloped isopycnal surfaces its practical implementation artificially induces spurious diapycnal mixing across an isopycnal surface whose slope exceeds a prescribed slope maximum this slope maximum widely ranges from 1 1000 to 3 10 in a recent global ocean model intercomparison project of coordinated ocean ice reference experiments phase ii this study quantitatively investigates the effects of isopycnal tracer diffusion on meridional overturning circulation by calculating water mass transformation rate due to isopycnal diffusion with the use of walin s 1982 methodology we focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model densification induced by nonlinearity of the equation of state spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean induced by practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and diapycnal mixing in the surface diabatic layer it is revealed that a slope maximum that is too small 1 1000 leads to large spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean this diapycnal mixing supplies much buoyancy to the bottom water around antarctica and makes it locally upwell within the southern ocean it results in less northward export of bottom waters from the southern ocean into the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans and weakening of the bottom cell of meridional overturning circulation this spurious diapycnal mixing is significantly suppressed if we use the slope maximum of more than 1 100 or tapering isopycnal diffusivity around steep isopycnal slopes this study also shows that these changes in the implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme also affect the various aspects of the simulated southern ocean the experiment tapering isopycnal diffusivity suppresses unrealistic open ocean deep convections and polynyas in the weddell sea by both diminishing spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean and applying the strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer associated with the isopycnal diffusion scheme it results in the smallest biases of the potential temperature distribution the winter sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea and the acc transport in our coarse resolution model keywords meridional overturning circulation ocean general circulation model isopycnal tracer diffusion spurious diapycnal mixing water mass transformation 1 introduction the thermohaline circulation or oceanic meridional overturning circulation moc is a global scale circulation characterized by localized deep water formation at high latitudes and deep water upwelling in the other vast areas this circulation is basically composed of the two major cells one is the upper cell of the atlantic moc amoc hereafter associated with the north atlantic deep water nadw formation and transport the other is the bottom cell of moc bmoc hereafter associated with the antarctic bottom water aabw and circumpolar deep water cdw formation and transport e g schmitz 1996a b these mocs transport enormous amounts of heat and materials such as carbon and constitute an essential component of the climate system thus it is important for climate modeling studies to develop and use a global ocean model that realistically represents the amoc and bmoc however current ocean models used in climate modeling studies especially depth coordinate models tend to underestimate the magnitude of the bmoc e g downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 lee et al 2019 as discussed in farneti et al 2015 the bmoc involves various kinds of physical processes such as dense shelf water dsw formation in the small coastal polynyas around antarctica tamura et al 2008 and descending currents of dsw along the continental shelf price and baringer 1994 orsi et al 1999 matsumura and hasumi 2008 2010 and proper representation of these processes in numerical models is important for realistic simulations of bmoc e g campin and goosse 1999 nakano and suginohara 2002 kusahara et al 2010 bates et al 2012 snow et al 2015 however coarse resolution models tend to incompletely reproduce these processes and tend to create aabw via the open ocean polynyas and deep convections kjellsson et al 2015 on the other hand it is widely accepted that diapycnal buoyancy supply plays an important role in upwelling of bottom water e g munk 1966 ferrari et al 2016 de lavergne et al 2016 and this is attributed to turbulent mixing as is induced by breaking of internal waves generated by wind and tide munk and wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 this effect is represented by vertical diffusion in a depth coordinate model many earlier studies show that strength of the bmoc in a model is sensitive to the choice of vertical diffusion parameterization with larger vertical diffusivity generally leading to a stronger bmoc e g marotzke 1997 hasumi and suginohara 1999 tsujino et al 2000 scott and marotzke 2002 melet et al 2013 the current study focuses on the diapycnal mixing among the various processes affecting the bmoc strength such as those introduced above diapycnal mixing in a depth coordinate model does not result only from the vertical diffusion term most global ocean models currently used in climate modeling studies do not resolve mesoscale eddies explicitly global ocean models in the early days parameterized a diffusive effect of mesoscale eddy stirring by horizontal diffusion e g 3 4 however this horizontal diffusion causes strong spurious diapycnal mixing in regions with steeply sloped isopycnals such as the western boundary which induces unrealistic upwelling of deep waters in order to close buoyancy budget the veronis effect veronis 1975 so modern global ocean models commonly adopt the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme following redi 1982 to eliminate this spurious diapycnal mixing on the other hand this isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model can induce numerical instability around steeply sloped isopycnals such as within the surface mixed layer the courant friedrichs lewy cfl number for diffusion with a feasible time step interval becomes large in such circumstances especially for the cross terms of isopycnal tracer diffusion tensor between horizontal and vertical directions which means this diffusion scheme becomes numerically unstable there griffies 2004 therefore we need some technical methods in implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme to avoid this problem this practical implementation can still introduce diapycnal mixing to a depth coordinate model in an undesirable manner there are two major technical methods to avoid the numerical instability associated with the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme appendix a in farneti et al 2015 one is called slope clipping method where we set a ceiling on an isopycnal slope value when calculating isopycnal tracer diffusion fluxes this technical treatment can result in strong diapycnal mixing even in the interior ocean where isopycnal diffusion is intrinsically free of diapycnal diffusion if a slope of an isopycnal surface exceeds the prescribed upper limit this method is used in our meteorological research institute community ocean model mri com tsujino et al 2017 in the second phase of the coordinated ocean ice reference experiments core ii project and is also implemented in other models such as nemo madec et al 2016 and coco hasumi 2006 the other method is to introduce a tapering factor to isopycnal diffusivity like gfdl mom in the core ii project farneti et al 2015 this method is called tapering method hereafter its factor depends on a value of isopycnal slope danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 and or vertical location large et al 1997 designed to taper off the isopycnal diffusion coefficient around steeply sloped isopycnals this method can eliminate diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal diffusion however danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 report that diminishing the lateral diapycnal diffusion in the surface boundary layer using this method results in more frequent deep convection in their numerical model this is undesirable because it can make deep biases of winter mixed layer depth and associated cold biases in the weddell sea which are found in several models participating in the core ii project downes et al 2015 by enhancing unrealistic open ocean deep convection griffies 2004 proposes to multiply all isopycnal diffusion tensor terms except for horizontal diagonal ones by this factor in order to retain horizontal diffusion within the surface boundary layer this horizontal diffusion near the sea surface induces strong diapycnal mixing but it is not necessarily artificial because mesoscale eddies cannot carry water masses across the sea surface it is reasonable to assume that the stirring is oriented to the horizontal direction along the sea surface within the physically capped boundary layer nevertheless this practical implementation has a side effect that it can induce spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean away from surface and bottom boundaries when isopycnal surfaces steeply slope there the slope clipping and tapering methods both require setting an arbitrary threshold for an isopycnal slope its magnitude widely varies from 1 1000 to 3 10 among the depth coordinate models participating in the core ii farneti et al 2015 which is the precursor of ocean model intercomparison project omip griffies et al 2016 orr et al 2017 in the phase 6 of coupled model intercomparison project cmip6 our model also participates in the core ii project it uses the smallest slope maximum 1 1000 and shows an extremely weak bmoc the choice of the technical method to prevent numerical instability slope clipping or tapering method its parameter value and its practical implementation for the isopycnal diffusion scheme will control the magnitude of diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in a depth coordinate model which may partly account for difference in the bmoc representation in the core ii models downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 our attention is also attracted to this diapycnal mixing problem by the fact that isopycnic models such as gold and noresm o show relatively large northward transport of bottom water at 30 s fig 13 of downes et al 2015 gnanadesikan et al 2007 show that the slope maximum in slope clipping method has a large impact on climate modeling but they focus on the role of the advective effect of mesoscale eddy stirring it has not been quantitatively investigated from the viewpoint of the isopycnal tracer diffusion how the global mocs are affected by differences of practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and its parameter values in this study we conduct three sensitivity experiments with each changing a configuration of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme one experiment adopts the slope clipping scheme with the small slope maximum 1 1000 as our core ii model another experiment also uses the slope clipping scheme but its slope maximum is set at commonly used 1 100 farneti et al 2015 although the tapering method is not a newly developed technique its impact on mocs has not been investigated enough thus the tapering method is adopted in the remaining experiment this experiment relaxes the regulation on the isopycnal slope more than the other two experiments which will lead to better representation of isopycnal slopes in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme recently groeskamp et al 2019a proposed a new method to minimize numerical errors in the calculation of isopycnal tracer diffusion fluxes their method directly calculates tracer gradients along isopycnal surfaces as well as the surfaces slopes and they show that the better gradients also contribute to more accurate representation of the diffusion fluxes unfortunately this state of the art method has not been implemented and tested in our model therefore the current study focuses on the effects of isopycnal slope limitations on our model s performances in the southern ocean the strength of the bmoc at 30 s varies widely from 5 5 to 14 5 sv in our sensitivity experiments the first experiment shows the minimal magnitude of bmoc we conduct a water mass transformation analysis e g walin 1982 and quantitatively estimate the transformation rate due to the isopycnal tracer diffusion we especially focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model 1 water mass densification due to nonlinear effects of the equation of state 2 spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean induced by practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme and 3 diapycnal mixing within the surface mixed layer induced by the practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme it is quantitatively revealed that the spurious diapycnal mixing in the second effect supplies buoyancy to the bottom water within the southern ocean leading to stronger recirculation at high latitudes in the southern ocean this results in a weaker northward transport of the bottom water at low latitudes and a weaker bmoc on the whole our analysis indicates that lower diapycnal mixing in the interior the second effect and higher diapycnal mixing in the surface mixed layer the third effect suppress unrealistic open ocean deep convection in the weddell sea 2 experimental settings 2 1 model configuration the ocean modelers in the meteorological research institute mri have developed a series of global ocean ice coupled models called gondola for use in scientific researches and operational works in mri and the japan meteorological agency jma this study uses gondola 100 table 1 where the numeric suffix denotes its nominal horizontal resolution in units of km the model code is mri com version 4 developed in mri tsujino et al 2017 the oceanic part of mri com is based on the primitive equations under the hydrostatic and boussinesq approximations with explicit free surface the model domain of gondola 100 is global extending from 78 5 s to 90 n it sets singularity points on land at siberia 64 n 80 e and canada 64 n 100 w by adopting murray 1996 s tripolar grid the horizontal resolution is primarily 1 degree in longitude and 0 5 degree in latitude with refinement down to 0 3 degree within 10 degrees north and south of the equator it has 60 layers vertically whose thickness ranges from 2 m for the top layer to 700 m for the bottom layer and also has one bottom boundary layer of 50 m thickness around antarctica and iceland nakano and suginohara 2002 there are 40 layers assigned to the upper layer above 1000 m the model topography is based on general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2014 version 20141103 weatherall et al 2015 merged with jtopo30v2 published by the marine information research center which describes the topography around japan with high accuracy we adopt a partial cell method of adcroft et al 1997 to represent realistic bottom topography momentum is advected using the takano and oonishi scheme as described in ishizaki and motoi 1999 we adopt anisotropic horizontal viscosity in the laplacian form proposed by smith and mcwilliams 2003 different viscosity coefficients are applied to both directions perpendicular and parallel to the local flow in the model the ratio of the perpendicular viscosity to the parallel one is set at 0 2 but linearly tapers to 0 1 at the equator from 5 n s in order to reproduce a realistic velocity distribution of equatorial undercurrent euc the viscosity coefficient parallel to local flow is calculated using the methodology of smagorinsky 1963 background vertical viscosity is constant at 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 this model solves the following prognostic equation for potential temperature and salinity 1 d c d t c t u c z k v c z q s w r f c i s o f c g m where c stands for potential temperature θ or salinity s k v is the vertical diffusion coefficient q s w r denotes potential temperature tendency due to absorption of solar shortwave radiation in the ocean interior which drops in the prognostic equation for salinity and f c i s o and f c g m denote the isopycnal tracer diffusion flux of redi 1982 and the isopycnal layer thickness diffusion flux of gent and mcwilliams 1990 respectively the detailed information about the isopycnal tracer diffusion is given in the following section the isopycnal layer thickness diffusion of gent and mcwilliams 1990 is implemented to parameterize advective tracer transports induced by mesoscale eddies our model adopts the layer thickness diffusivity proposed by danabasoglu and marshall 2007 which depends on a buoyancy frequency and ranges from 300 to 1500 m 2 s 1 in this study we also adopt the modification of surface eddy fluxes proposed by danabasoglu et al 2008 as follows thickness diffusion fluxes are modified within a surface diabatic layer dl so as to let a meridional streamfunction induced by mesoscale eddies linearly taper to zero at the sea surface from the bottom of dl the dl consists of a mixed layer ml and a transition layer tl which connects the ml and the interior ocean the slope limit used in the evaluation of the layer thickness diffusion fluxes is independent from that used in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in our model we put a ceiling on an isopycnal slope at 5 1 0 3 so as to prevent a residual meridional velocity flow southward in the ekman layer of the southern ocean this ceiling is also arbitrary along with the threshold used in the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme and gnanadesikan et al 2007 show that a numerical model has high sensitivity on its choice this sensitivity is beyond the scope of the current study and is fixed at this value throughout the experiments conducted in this study background vertical diffusion coefficients have an empirical 3d distribution based on decloedt and luther 2010 dl10 hereafter and range from 0 056 to 51 1697 1 0 4 m 2 s 1 we adopt the generic length scale gls scheme umlauf and burchard 2003 as the ml scheme unstable stratifications are stabilized by adopting a large vertical diffusivity at 1 m 2 s 1 the model adopts the second order moment som advection scheme of prather 1986 for tracer equations the sea ice part of mri com is based on that of mellor and kantha 1989 mk89 hereafter which treats sea ice and snow some components or processes are upgraded to or incorporated from those of the los alamos sea ice model cice version 3 14 hunke and lipscomb 2006 such as an albedo scheme multiple thickness categories ridging and rheology the model adopts the elastic plastic viscous evp model by hunke and dukowicz 1997 2002 the sea ice and snow are advected with the use of the mpdata scheme of smolarkiewicz 1984 we have five sea ice categories whose upper boundaries are 0 6 1 4 2 4 3 6 and 30 m we use bulk coefficients recommended by large and yeager 2004 ly04 hereafter in calculation of wind stress and heat flux over the sea ice which are different from standard values proposed by mk89 2 2 isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme the isopycnal tracer diffusion flux is calculated from the following equation 2 f c i s o k c where k denotes the isopycnal diffusion tensor according to redi 1982 the isopycnal diffusion tensor k redi is written as 3 k redi a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 ϵ s x 2 ϵ 1 s x s y 1 ϵ s x ϵ 1 s x s y 1 s x 2 ϵ s y 2 1 ϵ s y 1 ϵ s x 1 ϵ s y ϵ s 2 where 4 s s x s y 0 ρ l x ρ l z ρ l y ρ l z 0 5 ϵ a d a iso the density ρ l denotes locally referenced potential density the isopycnal tracer diffusivity a iso is 1500 m 2 s 1 in this study unless otherwise stated the diapycnal tracer diffusivity a d is specified independently of the vertical diffusion coefficients actually used in our model and set at zero in the current study this means ϵ 0 in the current study and ϵ is dropped in equations hereafter as already noted a large diffusion flux along a steep isopycnal slope can violate the cfl condition and can cause numerical instability griffies 2004 a classical remedy for this problem is the slope clipping scheme which has been adopted for long in mri com tsujino et al 2017 in order to cap the corresponding vertical diffusion flux the vertical density gradient in eq 4 is modified so that the magnitude of the isopycnal slope s does not exceed a prescribed upper limit s clip the isopycnal diffusion flux does not follow an isopycnal surface around steep isopycnals where s s clip resulting in spurious diapycnal diffusion the isopycnal diffusion tensor with this method k k clip is written as follows 6 k clip k redi if s s clip a iso 1 s clip 2 1 r c 2 s y 2 r c 2 s x s y r c s x r c 2 s x s y 1 r c 2 s x 2 r c s y r c s x r c s y s clip 2 if s s clip where r c s clip s the alternative option in mri com is the tapering method where a tapering factor f is imposed on the isopycnal diffusion tensor the tapering factor f is a product of two different factors f 1 and f 2 large et al 1997 7 f f 1 f 2 8 f 1 1 2 1 tanh s c s s w 9 f 2 1 2 1 sin π r 1 2 the factor f 1 was originally proposed by danabasoglu and mcwilliams 1995 it rapidly tapers to zero as an isopycnal slope exceeds the threshold the threshold is prescribed by the two parameters s c and s w which are set at 8 100 and 1 100 in the current study respectively the factor f 1 quickly decreases from almost 1 0 99753 to almost 0 0 00247 as an isopycnal slope increases from 5 100 to 11 100 this factor works anywhere from the sea surface to the bottom on the other hand the factor f 2 targets sea surface boundary layers the variable r in eq 9 is calculated as follows 10 r max 0 min 1 d λ s where d is the depth from the bottom of ml and λ is an internal rossby radius of deformation the product λ s denotes the tl thickness this factor gradually tapers off from the bottom of dl to the bottom of ml and is equal to zero within the ml following the suggestion of griffies 2004 the tapering factor f is imposed on all terms of the diffusion tensor except for the horizontal diagonal ones of k redi the isopycnal diffusion tensor k k taper is written as follows 11 k taper a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 f s x s y f s x f s x s y 1 s x 2 f s y f s x f s y f s 2 12 f k redi 1 f a iso 1 s 2 1 s y 2 0 0 0 1 s x 2 0 0 0 0 the second term on the right hand side of the second line works to diffuse tracers in the horizontal direction which leads to diapycnal mixing this treatment is intended to gradually change isopycnal diffusion in the ocean interior below dl to horizontal diffusion within the ml where the tapering factor becomes 0 2 3 experimental design we conduct three experiments using the model described above we drive the model conforming to the protocol of omip griffies et al 2016 in each experiment we use the interannual forcing datasets of core ii from 1948 to 2009 our experiments are conducted by repeatedly imposing this forcing six times that is the integration duration is 372 years for each experiment each experiment starts from 1638 so that the model year in the last cycle corresponds with the actual forcing year the bulk formulae of large and yeager 2009 is used in the calculation of surface heat and momentum fluxes note that our model considers penetration of solar shortwave radiation into the ocean interior according to ishizaki and yamanaka 2010 we also apply sea surface salinity sss restoring to sss distribution of core ii its piston velocity is set at 50 m per 365 days the sss restoring is also applied under the sea ice but made invalid under the sea ice in coastal grid points the surface salt flux due to the sss damping and the net surface freshwater flux are modified by adding an offset for every time step so as to adjust their averages to zero for the purpose of the total salt and water content conservation of our ice ocean coupled system potential temperature and salinity are initialized by world ocean atlas 2013 version 2 woa13v2 whose horizontal resolution is 0 25 degree the january distributions are used for the upper 1500 m and the winter averages are used below the 1500 m depth velocity field starts from the state of rest an initial state of the sea ice model is taken from the january distribution of the preliminary experiment table 2 summarizes the differences of the three experiments two experiments adopt the slope clipping method and the remaining one uses the tapering method one of the former experiments adopts a small clipping slope of 1 1000 which is the same value used in our core ii model table 1 in farneti et al 2015 this experiment is called clip1 hereafter in order to investigate the impact of the clipping slope on mocs we conduct the other slope clipping experiment clip2 with the widely used value 1 100 table 1 in farneti et al 2015 the experiment with the tapering method is called taper hereafter the ocean model used in this experiment is almost the same as the ocean component of our earth system model mri esm2 0 developed for cmip6 yukimoto et al 2019 because the horizontal diagonal terms in the diffusion tensor are not multiplied by this factor the factor less than 1 leads to diapycnal mixing it depends solely on an isopycnal slope in the ocean interior the factor is almost 1 with a slope under 5 100 and almost 0 with a slope over 11 100 these two experiments clip2 and taper exhibit small spurious diapycnal mixing induced by the practical implementation of the isopycnal diffusion scheme table 2 on the other hand isopycnal diffusion flux in the model mixes tracers along a completely horizontal plane within the mixed layer in the experiment taper thus it results in large diapycnal mixing near the sea surface in this experiment the experiment clip2 also shows diapycnal mixing associated with the isopycnal diffusion scheme because isopycnal surfaces are steeply sloped within the mixed layer however its magnitude becomes smaller than the experiment taper because eddy stirring mainly occurs along the clipped isopycnal slope table 2 this study mainly compares climatological averages for the period of the last forcing cycle note that the model is not fully spun up because of its short integration time 372 years however initial model drift in each experiment almost settles down in the last cycle with respect to the magnitude of major cells of the mocs and volume transport through the drake passage refer to supplementary material thus we can quantitatively discuss impacts of the configuration changes of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme on the magnitude of the mocs and water mass transformation in the southern ocean we also note that the isopycnal diffusion coefficient is 1000 m 2 s 1 in the experiment clip1 which is smaller than that in the other two experiments we conduct another experiment using the same isopycnal diffusion coefficient as the experiments clip2 and taper a large unrealistic open ocean polynya frequently occurs in the weddell sea after 170 year integration in this experiment potential temperature and salinity structures collapse due to open ocean deep convections under this unrealistic polynya this experiment shows a completely different dense water formation process which affects the magnitude of the bmoc refer to the supplementary material this different dense water formation process obscures the direct effect of the implementation and settings of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme on the bmoc thus we use the smaller coefficient in the experiment clip1 3 results 3 1 impact on bmoc in the southern ocean fig 1 shows residual mocs south to 20 s which are calculated with the sum of the resolved and parameterized mesoscale eddy induced velocities in the potential density coordinate referenced to 2000 dbar σ 2 the general structure in the southern ocean is almost the same among the three experiments and consistent with the structures in earlier studies e g döös and webb 1994 hirst and mcdougall 1998 farneti et al 2015 there is an anti clockwise cell north of 42 s in a density layer lighter than 35 7 σ 2 which is called the subtropical cell an anti clockwise cell is also found in the densest layer denser than 36 9 σ 2 this cell is called the bmoc cell hereafter the clockwise cell exists between the subtropical cell and bmoc cell which is called the amoc cell hereafter we roughly classify the water masses in the southern ocean into the following four water mass groups by density as is done in downes et al 2015 in order to quantitatively investigate meridional volume transports induced by these three overturning cells surface thermocline water tw mode intermediate water mw deep water dw and bottom water bw isopycnal interfaces between tw and mw mw and dw and dw and bw are defined in each experiment by locations where the residual moc at 30 s takes its local minimal maximal values around 34 0 36 5 37 5 σ 2 respectively fig 1 also shows the meridional volume transports at 30 s by green numbers around 30 s in each panel the three experiments show few differences in the southward tw transport about 20 sv and the northward mw transport around 25 sv those are much larger than estimates by talley 2008 9 0 and 11 9 sv respectively but such overestimation is commonly found in the core ii models fig 13 in downes et al 2015 the volume transports of dw and bw vary significantly among three experiments fig 1 the experiment clip1 shows minimal northward transport of bw 5 5 sv the maximal bw export from the southern ocean is found in the experiment clip2 14 5 sv the bw transport in the experiment taper 11 4 sv is smaller than in the experiment clip2 but more than twice as large as in the experiment clip1 this bw export from the southern ocean in the experiments clip2 and taper is still smaller than previous estimates based on inverse models ranging from 21 to 27 sv ganachaud 2003 talley et al 2003 lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2008 but is on the same level as the northward transport of best performed depth coordinate models participating in core ii downes et al 2015 the differences in the bw transports account for differences in the southward transports of dw among the three experiments this means that the amoc cell differs little at 30 s and the changes in configuration of the isopycnal diffusion scheme largely affect the representation of the bmoc in our model the bmoc cell has a recirculation cell in its polar side fig 1 which is called the subpolar cell farneti et al 2015 the magnitude of the subpolar cell indicates a formation rate of the densest water around antarctica it is 22 5 18 5 and 15 1 sv for the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively fig 1 contrary to the northward bw transport at 30 s the dense water formation rate is smaller by more than 4 sv in the experiments clip2 and taper than in the experiment clip1 this means that the dense water created around antarctica is effectively exported from the southern ocean in the experiments clip2 and taper more than 75 of dense water flows into the atlantic and indo pacific basins at 30 s as bw on the other hand only 24 of the dense water becomes bw in the experiment clip1 this indicates that much buoyancy is supplied to the dense water in the interior region of the southern ocean in this experiment 3 2 water mass transformation analysis on bmoc we conduct water mass transformation analysis in order to investigate how the bw export increases in the experiments clip2 and taper compared to the experiment clip1 when we change the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme first we briefly introduce water mass transformation analysis fig 2 schematically shows an arbitrary isopycnal surface s outcropping to the sea surface in the southern ocean v denotes the volume of a space enclosed by the isopycnal surface s the sea surface the sea bottom and the northern boundary of the target region the northward volume transport at the northern boundary between the surface s and the sea bottom is equal to the sign reversed meridional overturning streamfunction mosf calculated in the density coordinate ψ shown in fig 1 the transformation rate toward denser water across the surface s ω satisfies the following relationship 13 ω ψ v t the right hand side denotes volume inflation of the isopycnal layer note that the sea surface freshwater flux is ignored as being sufficiently small compared to each term above following groeskamp et al 2019b ω is calculated as follows 14 ω s ω d s 15 s d σ d t σ 1 d s 16 σ v d σ d t d v where ω is velocity perpendicular to an isopycnal surface s toward denser waters σ is potential density and σ is a density gradient perpendicular to an isopycnal surface s note that the following relationship holds 17 ω σ d σ d t σ β d s d t α d θ d t where α and β stand for the thermal expansion and haline contraction coefficients respectively using eqs 1 16 and 17 we can calculate a contribution to the total water mass transformation rate ω of each diabatic process and or each active tracer potential temperature and salinity in a model as follows 18 ω e x p l i c i t σ v σ β z k v s z α z k v θ z α q s w r β f s i s o α f θ i s o d v 19 σ v σ β f s α f θ d v σ v σ β d s α d θ d v σ v σ β f s i s o α f θ i s o d v where the vertical diffusion term is decomposed into contributions of sea surface flux f s and f θ and vertical diffusion in the interior d s and d θ note that f θ includes the absorption of solar shortwave radiation q s w r as is done in iudicone et al 2008b and groeskamp and iudicone 2018 the first term in the right hand side of eq 19 denotes water mass transformation due to the sea surface buoyancy flux including solar shortwave radiation the second term is transformation rate by the vertical diffusion this vertical diffusion includes all vertical diffusive processes such as the vertical mixing in ml the enhanced mixing under unstable stratification and the background vertical diffusion flux originating from tidal dissipation the last term in eq 19 denotes water mass transformation due to isopycnal diffusion note that the divergence of f c g m found in eq 1 is dropped here because it parameterizes the advective effect of mesoscale eddies and does not involve water mass transformation this study discusses climatological water mass transformation rates averaged over the period of the last cycle from 1948 to 2009 each component of water mass transformation due to the diabatic process surface buoyancy flux vertical diffusion and isopycnal diffusion is diagnosed with the equation introduced above using monthly averages of potential temperature salinity and their tendency terms due to each diabatic process in the model the potential density tendency due to each diabatic process is calculated in the depth coordinate and then is remapped to the potential density coordinate according to the method proposed by getzlaff et al 2010 this tendency is used in eq 19 to calculate the water mass transformation rate in each month which is temporally averaged over the period from 1948 to 2009 megann 2018 diagnoses the water mass transformation rates in his eddy permitting model and discusses that 5 day mean data give smoother mosf and water mass transformation field than monthly mean data do because our analysis is based on the monthly mean data the diagnosed mosf and water mass transformation rate might contain large sampling errors associated with the offline calculation i e post run calculation using sampled mean fields in order to investigate this issue we compared two mosfs calculated with two other datasets of horizontal volume transports in the potential density coordinate those are different from mosfs in our main analysis because they are calculated with a different remapping method from the one proposed by getzlaff et al 2010 one is remapped offline as is done in our main analysis but the other is remapped online i e at every time step during the model integration and is free from the sampling errors the difference is negligible especially in the denser density range less than 0 1 sv in all sensitivity experiments refer to the supplementary material for details this indicates that the offline analysis with the monthly mean data suffices for mosf calculation in this study our model does not resolve and permit mesoscale eddies and their effects are implicitly parameterized thus the model s resolved fields show smaller temporal variability than those in eddy permitting models and this results in the small sampling errors of mosf we believe that this also holds true for our water mass transformation analysis the total water mass transformation rate ω is calculated as the difference between the volume inflation term v t and mosf ψ eq 13 as is done in some earlier studies lee et al 2002 urakawa and hasumi 2014 the volume inflation term is calculated using instantaneous fields of potential temperature and salinity at the initial and final states of the averaging period this total transformation rate does not equal to the sum of explicitly diagnosed components using eq 19 ω e x p l i c i t the residual term ω ω e x p l i c i t results from various numerical errors associated with our model and water mass transformation analysis such as spurious diapycnal mixing associated with the advection scheme griffies et al 2000 lee et al 2002 ilicak et al 2012 urakawa and hasumi 2014 megann 2018 and analytical errors associated with vertical coordinate conversion getzlaff et al 2010 it also includes sampling errors resulting from offline analysis with monthly mean model data which may be assumed to be negligible in the current study as already noted we especially focus on the following three effects of isopycnal diffusion in a depth coordinate model the first effect comes from nonlinearity of the equation of state of the sea water although isopycnal diffusion is intrinsically free of diapycnal mixing it can result in density change through this nonlinearity e g mcdougall 1987 it is known that this water mass transformation is not negligible especially in the southern ocean e g 23 38 41 81 the remaining two effects are caused by lateral diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer and spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean due to our practical implementation of mesoscale eddy parameterization figs 3a and b show the sign reversed mosf the northward transport at 30 s between the sea floor and an arbitrary isopycnal surface and the total water mass transformation rate through an isopycnal surface south to 30 s respectively they correspond well to each other in the experiments clip2 and taper this indicates that the change in the bw export is mostly explained by the difference in water mass transformation rate due to a specific diabatic process in these experiments on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows a relatively large difference in the layer denser than 36 9 σ 2 the difference denotes the volume contraction of the bw density layer it means that the bw formation and transformation from lighter waters are insufficient to compensate the northward bw transport at 30 s and that their gap is filled by the consumption of the existing bw in this experiment thus this negative volume inflation term does not explain the smallest bw export in the experiment clip1 it should be accounted for by the differences in water mass transformation the total water mass transformation fig 3b does not correspond to the net water mass transformation due to the diabatic processes that can be explicitly diagnosed from eq 19 their difference results from numerical errors associated with the advection scheme the vertical coordinate conversion the sampling interval of the model s outputs and so on this residual term is not negligible fig 3c but smaller than the water mass transformation due to each diabatic process shown in figs 3d f the total bw transformation rate amounts to 1 1 16 2 and 11 0 sv in the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively fig 4 the experiment clip1 shows the smallest transformation rate which is consistent with the relatively small northward bw transport shown in the previous section figs 1 and 4 the major contributors to the overall water mass transformation in the southern ocean are the surface buoyancy flux and the vertical diffusion flux figs 3d and e respectively the former tends to make dense light water denser lighter whereas the latter works to homogenize water masses in the southern ocean which is consistent with earlier studies e g iudicone et al 2008b urakawa and hasumi 2012 groeskamp et al 2016 the bw transformation rate due to surface buoyancy flux differs little among the three experiments 19 0 sv for clip1 and clip2 and 18 3 sv for taper fig 4 the same goes for the bw transformation rate due to vertical diffusion 5 9 sv for clip1 6 9 sv for clip2 and 5 8 sv for taper fig 4 the net transformation rates of these two processes do not account for the differences in the bw export among the three experiments 5 5 sv for clip1 14 5 sv for clip2 and 11 4 sv for taper fig 4 fig 3f shows the remaining water mass transformation rate due to isopycnal diffusion solid lines it only plays a secondary role in the lighter density range 36 9 σ 2 but is comparable in magnitude to the water mass transformation by surface buoyancy flux in the dense water range 36 9 σ 2 in the latter density range the isopycnal diffusion counteracts the net dense water formation by surface buoyancy flux and vertical diffusion dashed lines in fig 3f this negative transformation is caused by diapycnal mixing within the surface diabatic layer fig 3g and or spurious diapycnal mixing induced by the practical implementations of isopycnal diffusion schemes fig 3h these conceal the water mass densification by the nonlinearity of the equation of state due to isopycnal diffusion only cabbeling is expressed in the potential density framework in fact the isopycnal diffusion in the experiments clip2 and taper densifies water masses for almost all density classes in the ocean interior where isopycnal surfaces are gently sloped and thus isopycnal diffusion in the model causes little diapycnal mixing fig 3h on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows the large water mass transformation toward lighter waters even in the ocean interior fig 3h because the small maximum is small 1 1000 in this experiment the slope clipping works even in the interior ocean which results in this spurious diapycnal mixing there in the experiment clip2 this isopycnal diffusion leads to water mass transformation from dw to bw by the rate of 5 2 sv in the southern ocean fig 4 the bw transformation rate is small in the experiment taper amounting to 0 3 sv on the other hand the experiment clip1 shows large destruction of bw 6 4 sv due to the isopycnal diffusion which is caused by the spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean fig 4 this spurious diapycnal mixing supplies buoyancy to the bw within the southern ocean and enhances the subpolar cell it results in the smaller northward transport of the bw at 30 s in the experiment clip1 compared to the other two experiments it should be noted that the water mass transformation due to numerical errors also contributes to the smaller bw export in the experiment clip1 the transformation rate is 5 6 1 2 and 1 8 sv for the experiments clip1 clip2 and taper respectively more bw is transformed to lighter waters by about 4 sv in the experiment clip1 than in the other two experiments however its contribution is smaller than that of isopycnal tracer diffusion 3 3 slope clipping versus tapering factor the experiment clip1 shows that the slope clipping scheme with a slope maximum that is too small induces substantial spurious diapycnal mixing which supplies buoyancy to the bw within the southern ocean resulting in underestimation of the northward export of bw into the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans the bw export in the experiments clip2 and taper still goes below the observational estimate but is much larger than that in the experiment clip1 then which configuration is better for climate modeling that of the experiment clip2 or that of the experiment taper the experiment clip2 shows the larger bw export than the experiment taper but we choose the configuration of the latter experiment for our coupled model mri esm2 0 yukimoto et al 2019 as noted in section 2 3 considering several aspects of the southern ocean representation in the model such as sea ice concentration the antarctic circumpolar current acc transport and the potential temperature profiles fig 5 shows the southern hemisphere sea ice concentration in the austral winter climatologically averaged over the period from 1980 to 2009 the experiment clip1 shows an open ocean area with low sea ice concentration less than 0 9 in the weddell sea this is a signal of unrealistic open ocean polynya fig 6 shows time series of minimal values of winter sea ice concentration and maximal values of winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea at each latitude band a huge ice free area with sea ice concentration less than 10 4 is found in the last decade in the experiment clip1 this unrealistic weddell sea polynya accompanies open ocean deep convection and deep mixed layer in that area the experiment clip2 does not show such ice free areas but the small weddell sea polynyas cyclically appear in the offshore regions of the sea from the earlier stage of simulation fig 6c moreover the mixed layer is deeper and extends to the broader area of the weddell sea than in the experiment clip1 fig 5d these indicate that the open ocean deep convection occurs under the sea ice in the central weddell sea and it transports relatively warm deep water upward and partly melts the sea ice there on the other hand the low concentration area of the winter sea ice is not observed in the open ocean region of the weddell sea over the whole period of this simulation fig 6e in the experiment taper the winter mixed layer in this area is still deeper than the observational estimate fig 5f but the biases are much smaller than those in the other two experiments which indicates the weaker open ocean deep convection there huge open ocean polynyas in the weddell sea were also observed in the real ocean around the maud rise in the mid 1970s zwally et al 1983 and their causes have been investigated by earlier studies holland 2001 shows that the cyclonic eddy formed by the currents over the maud rise creates the sea ice opening and that deep convections induced by the strong sea surface cooling enlarge this opening leading to the huge open ocean polynyas in the area hirabara et al 2012 point out the importance of the preconditioning of potential temperature and salinity fields over the maud rise in the weddell sea polynya formation warming of the deep layer due to the lateral cdw transport and the anomalously saline surface water weaken the stratification over the maud rise which is favorable for the deep convection then the divergent sea ice drift due to the cyclonic wind stress triggers the formation of the huge weddell polynya in this area kjellsson et al 2015 show that open ocean convections in the weddell and ross seas are sensitive to the vertical mixing in the surface boundary layer and to the freshwater input from the antarctic ice sheet and its spatial distribution all model and experimental configurations however are common among the three experiments in the current study except for the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme thus the differences in the sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea result from the differences in this scheme here we discuss the causes of the weddell sea polynyas in the current study from the standpoint of diapycnal mixing induced by practical implementations of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme in the sea surface boundary layer and in the interior ocean note that the former diapycnal mixing is assumed to be large in the experiments clip1 and taper whereas the latter mixing is large in the experiment clip1 table 2 the major difference between the experiments clip2 and taper is the magnitude of diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer because both the experiments show less spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean as discussed in the previous section the isopycnal diffusion becomes the horizontal diffusion in the experiment taper and shows stronger diapycnal mixing than that in the experiment clip2 where tracers are diffused along the clipped surfaces which are aligned more closely with the isopycnal surfaces than the horizontal plane it is assumed that strong diapycnal diffusion associated with this horizontal diffusion takes lighter waters into the convection site from the surrounding areas and leads to the stabilization of the stratification in the area and the suppression of further development of deep convection this assumption is also supported by the fact that the experiment clip1 does not show the weddell sea polynyas and the winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea is shallower than in the experiment clip2 for the first five forcing cycles from 1638 to 1947 fig 6 this is because the experiment clip1 adopts a smaller slope maximum than the experiment clip2 and this results in the larger diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer the difference between the experiments clip1 and taper is the magnitude of the spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean table 2 the experiment taper does not show any open ocean polynya in the weddell sea during the whole integration period but the huge open ocean ice free areas are observed in the last cycle in the experiment clip1 the experiment clip1 shows the large spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean associated with the slope clipping scheme with a slope maximum that is too small it strongly mixes dense bws around antarctica and relatively light waters at lower latitudes resulting in warming the deep and bottom layers of the southern ocean in the experiment clip1 fig 7a this gradually weakens the stratification in the deep southern ocean setting up a favorable environment for deep convection there eventually resulting in large open ocean deep convection and polynya in the weddell sea in the last cycle to summarize the occurrence of the weddell sea polynyas in the experiment taper is suppressed by both applying strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer and diminishing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean these differences also affect other aspects of the southern ocean state because the open ocean convections in the weddell sea accompany intense dense water formation there the appearance of the huge ice free areas in the experiment clip1 leads to excessive dense water formation in the area resulting in abrupt enhancement of the subpolar cell in the last decade fig 8a the dense water formation also enhances the meridional gradient of density in the acc region and leads to the unrealistic abrupt increase in the acc transport fig 8b as is discussed in hirabara et al 2012 and farneti et al 2015 because these huge open ocean convections only occur in the last cycle the cold bottom water created there does not have enough time to spread over the global bottom layers thus zonally averaged potential temperature shows warm biases of bottom waters fig 7a which result from buoyancy supply due to the spurious diapycnal mixing in the experiment clip1 as already discussed on the other hand the experiment clip2 shows large deep ocean convections from earlier forcing cycles fig 6d the unrealistically cold dense water created there occupies the deep and bottom layers of the southern ocean and results in large cold biases fig 7b the deep convection also enhances baroclinicity in the southern ocean and leads to the large acc transport fig 8b amounting to 196 5 sv as the average from 2007 to 2009 the latest observational estimate for the acc transport is 173 3 10 7 sv as the average from 2007 to 2011 donohue et al 2016 the acc transport in the experiment clip2 exceeds the upper bound of this observational estimate the unrealistic open ocean convections and polynyas are well suppressed in the experiment taper by applying strong diapycnal mixing near the sea surface and diminishing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean it results in modest temperature biases in the deep and bottom layers fig 7c and the weaker acc transport compared to the experiment clip2 fig 8b the mean acc transport from 2007 to 2009 for this experiment amounts to 172 9 sv which is within the range of the observational estimate by donohue et al 2016 4 conclusions and discussions the ocean model intercomparison in the core ii project reveals that the global models tend to underestimate the magnitude of the bottom cell of moc bmoc downes et al 2015 farneti et al 2015 our model which is participating in this project especially underestimates the strength of the bmoc this study focuses on the practical implementations of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme to depth coordinate models that induce diapycnal mixing and cause this underestimation of the bmoc the experiment clip1 uses the classical slope clipping method with the small maximal slope 1 1000 this is the same configuration as our model in core ii farneti et al 2015 the water mass transformation analysis reveals that the isopycnal diffusion in this experiment causes enormous spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior region of the southern ocean and supplies much buoyancy to the bottom water bw around antarctica this makes the bws upwell locally within the southern ocean and results in less bw export to the atlantic and the indo pacific oceans 5 5 sv at 30 s this spurious mixing is remedied by using the larger slope maximum 1 100 in the slope clipping scheme the experiment clip2 or adopting the tapering factor to the isopycnal diffusivity with an adequately large slope maximum instead of using the slope clipping scheme the experiment taper it results in the larger northward transport of the bw at 30 s in these two experiments 14 5 sv for clip2 and 11 4 sv for taper these are still smaller than the observational estimates ranging from 21 to 27 sv ganachaud 2003 talley et al 2003 lumpkin and speer 2007 talley 2008 but are on a comparable level with the best performed depth coordinate models in core ii downes et al 2015 the changes in the isopycnal diffusion scheme affect not only the bmoc magnitude but also other aspects of the southern ocean state in the numerical model the experiment taper shows a shallower mixed layer than the experiment clip2 figs 5 and 6 weak stratification results in enormously steep isopycnals within the surface mixed layer the isopycnal diffusion flux is oriented to the horizontal direction within the surface mixed layer in the experiment taper causing strong diapycnal mixing such diapycnal mixing within the surface boundary layer is not necessarily spurious as mesoscale eddies do not stir water masses purely along the isopycnal surface in such a narrow region which is physically capped by the air sea interface this also holds true in the experiment clip2 but the isopycnal diffusion in this experiment diffuses tracers along the slope clipped surface which is aligned more closely with the isopycnal surface than the horizontal plane and involves less diapycnal mixing it is supposed that the stronger diapycnal mixing within the mixed layer incorporates lighter waters into the convection site from the surrounding areas and suppresses further development of the deep convection by stabilizing the stratification in the experiment taper suppressing these unrealistic deep convections relaxes the intense cold bw formation there resulting in the reduced cold bias of the bottom layer in the experiment taper fig 7 it also weakens the meridional density gradient and leads to the realistic magnitude of the acc transport fig 8 it is not surprising that the experiment clip1 shows shallower winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea than the experiment clip2 figs 6b and d except for the periods when the huge open ocean polynya appears in the experiment clip1 fig 6a because the surface diapycnal mixing is stronger than in the experiment clip2 due to the smaller slope maximum in the experiment clip1 however the deep convections eventually occur in the last forcing cycle in the experiment clip1 fig 6a the experiment taper does not show an open ocean polynya in the weddell sea during the integration period fig 6e this difference results from spurious diapycnal mixing within the interior ocean the spurious diapycnal mixing in the experiment clip1 supplies much buoyancy to the bw and leads to the warm bias in the bottom layer fig 7a this gradually weakens the deep stratification and eventually results in the open ocean polynyas with the huge ice free areas the excessive dense water formation there leads to the unrealistically abrupt increase in the acc transport and the magnitude of the sub polar cell fig 8 the unrealistic open ocean polynyas and deep convections in the weddell sea create excessively cold deep and bottom waters throughout the water columns which leads to unrealistic distribution of potential temperature in the southern ocean this temperature field enhances baroclinicity in the southern ocean and results in the unrealistic acc transport thus they have been regarded as unfavorable features in this study the experiment taper suppresses them by both reducing the spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean and applying the strong diapycnal mixing in the surface boundary layer it results in the smallest biases in the zonal mean potential temperature winter sea ice concentration and mixed layer depth in the weddell sea and the acc transport this experiment also shows the large northward transport of bw at 30 s although it is still smaller than the previous estimates based on inverse models these are the reasons why we adopt the configuration of this experiment in our earth system model mri esm2 0 yukimoto et al 2019 on the other hand we must pay attention to the fact that the smallest biases do not necessarily guarantee the physical correctness of the numerical scheme there does not exist a perfect numerical model and numerical models generally include several flaws whose bad effects can compensate each other and yield apparently good results for example coarse resolution models tend to incompletely reproduce the real bw formation processes along the antarctic continental slope and tend to create bws via the open ocean polynyas and deep convections kjellsson et al 2015 thus suppressing the open ocean polynyas in the weddell sea in the experiment taper might result in unrealistically weak ventilation of the deep ocean in the current model we cannot deny the possibility that the model configuration of the experiment taper is just optimized to this situation we must also note that none of the experiments reach a steady state in the current study because of the experiment s short integration period the winter mixed layer depth in the weddell sea continues to increase even in the last forcing cycle in the experiment taper several processes potentially contribute to this drift the insufficient bw formation could lead to gradual warming of the bottom layer that results in weak stratification and triggers the deep convections the drift might be induced by inadequate representation of mesoscale eddies in the mixed layer in our model it has not been established how this mesoscale eddy stirring in the boundary layers should be parameterized in a coarse resolution ocean model it is highly possible that the experiments clip2 and taper still have the considerable spurious diapycnal mixing in the interior ocean which can lead to the deep convections groeskamp et al 2019a show that the slope clipping method with the slope maximum of 1 100 produces significantly large fictitious diffusivity in the interior ocean with the use of observational climatology of potential temperature and salinity this is the same configuration as our experiment clip2 the fictitious diffusivity is reduced by calculating the isopycnal slope more accurately as is done in our experiment taper but is still large in the acc region and near the sea bottom groeskamp et al 2019a propose a completely new approach to calculate isopycnal diffusion fluxes where tracer gradients along isopycnal surface are directly evaluated along with the isopycnal slopes they show that this method significantly decreases the fictitious diffusivity in the interior ocean another benefit of this approach is that it does not require an arbitrary ceiling on the isopycnal slope this state of the art method should be implemented and tested in numerical models to summarize the current study highlights the sensitivity of a coarse resolution model to the details of the implementation of an isopycnal diffusion scheme but it is difficult to propose the best practice of the isopycnal tracer diffusion scheme for a coarse resolution model in the current study it will require a longer numerical integration of the model the proper representation of all processes associated with the bottom water formation around antarctica and numerical simulations with eddy resolving models as well as the proper parameterization of mesoscale eddies further investigations are required in the future in this field for more
