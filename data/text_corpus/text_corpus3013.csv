15065,climate change has led to the increased intensity and frequency of extreme meteorological events threatening the drainage capacity in urban catchments and densely built up cities to alleviate urban flooding disasters strategies coupled with green and grey infrastructure have been proposed to support urban stormwater management however most strategies rely largely on diachronic rainfall data and ignore long term climate change impacts this study described a novel framework to assess and to identify the optimal solution in response to uncertainties following climate change the assessment framework consists of three components 1 assess and process climate data to generate long term time series of meteorological parameters under different climate conditions 2 optimise the design of grey green infrastructure systems to establish the optimal design solutions and 3 perform a multi criteria assessment of economic and hydrological performance to support decision making a case study in guangzhou china was carried out to demonstrate the usability and application processes of the framework the results of the case study illustrated that the optimised grey green infrastructure could save life cycle costs and reduce total outflow 56 66 peak flow 22 85 and tss more than 60 compared to the fully centralised grey infrastructure system indicating its high superior in economic competitiveness and hydrological performance under climate uncertainties in terms of spatial configuration the contribution of green infrastructure appeared not as critical as the adoption of decentralisation of the drainage networks furthermore under extreme drought scenarios the decentralised infrastructure system exhibited an exceptionally high degree of removal performance for non point source pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban stormwater management green infrastructure coupled grey green system climate change regional climate model antecedent

rapid urbanisation leads to a significant increase of impermeable surfaces resulting in increased surface runoff and thereby threatening the hydrological safety of cities and waterlog larsen et al 2016 nazari sharabian et al 2019 aerts et al 2014 reported that urban waterlog caused direct economic losses of 650 billion over the past decade conventionally grey infrastructure gr is designed to intercept collect and channel the runoff for effective drainage however gr had the side effect of concentrating non point source pollutants in the catchment area resulting in extensive deterioration of the water quality of the recipient water body nika et al 2020 wang et al 2021a comparatively green infrastructure gi with natural based solutions including low impact development water sensitive cities sustainable urban drainage systems and sponge city could counter the pollution issues fletcher et al 2015 ying et al 2021 these gis are typically incorporated in decentralised structural practices and manage the surface runoff at the source as they are typically designed to mimic the natural hydrological condition before urbanisation and are aesthetically pleasing gis could be strategically integrated as part of the urban stormwater management scheme and the city s development plan mcfarland et al 2019 nickel et al 2014 versini et al 2018 although the advantages of these strategies have been widely discussed and accepted gi is recognized as being appropriate for stormwater management for rainfall of short return periods and in many cases cannot replace the role of gr especially in the case of densely built up urban environments xu et al 2019 in such an urban environment over 60 of the land surface is occupied by pavements and roofs and is drained through grey infrastructures qi et al 2019 the remaining open space limits the scope and hydrological capacity of gi in response to extreme storms for example mei et al 2018 assessed 15 gi scenarios subject to rainfall with return periods of 2 100 years in beijing china and concluded that the hydrological performance of the gis was not satisfactory and could not eliminate urban flooding even for the case of the most optimistic scenario although gi can benefit stormwater management in multiple ways including water quality volumes and frequency of runoff and floods one should not expect to achieve high performance in flooding mitigation particularly for long return periods by just applying gi only gr and gi could be integrated appropriately and applied as potential advanced solutions for urban stormwater management browder et al 2019 the integrated system leverages on the versatility and ecological aspects of gi and the engineering reliability and practicability of gr wang et al 2021d 2017b yang and zhang 2021 zhou et al 2022 to date several integration schemes have been reported and they include the grey green infrastructure gr gi system to reduce the life cycle cost lcc bakhshipour et al 2019a the system for urban stormwater treatment and analysis integration to evaluate the optimal location type and cost of stormwater best management practices lee et al 2012 and integrated gr and low impact development to measure the technical and operational resilience of best management practices wang et al 2021c other reported works include assessment of hydraulic reliability and hydrological resilience based on the selected rainfall events instead of continuous rainfall time series da silva et al 2018 mohanty et al 2020 sohn et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a long term time series analysis for urban stormwater management would have considered multiple climatic variables such as rainfall intensity duration and antecedent dry days to mention a few as these parameters could influence the generation of runoff in the catchment soil water storage capacity of the underlying surface and source accumulation process of non point source pollutants madarang and kang 2013 rossman and huber 2016 salim et al 2019 in adopting a single climatic variable e g rainfall intensity the hydrologic performance of the integrated gr gi drainage system may be overestimated under certain hydrological conditions yu et al 2022 not to mention the inherent limitation of using one single parameter to optimise the location type and cost of urban drainage systems for long term applications recently climate models have also been used to assess the hydraulic performance of the gr or gi under various climate scenarios such as representative concentration pathways rcps to help understand better the potential impact of design planning decisions on urban hydrology zeng et al 2021 evaluated the performance of gi in runoff quantity control and water quality improvement under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios total radiative forcing topped at a stable 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 respectively by 2100 at the grid scale see meinshausen et al 2011 el housni et al 2019 made projection of the hydraulic performance of the urban pipe network 2041 to 2070 based on the simulation results of the canadian regional climate model however the majority of the reported studies assessed and optimised the adaptive capacity of gr and gi in response to stationary or event based climate scenarios neglecting the effects of non stationarity and nonlinearity of long term climate change since climate change is dynamic and nonlinear optimising the synergistic effects of gr and gi as the means to adapt to non stationary climate change needs to be addressed urgently the relevant long term time series parameters are readily influenced by climate change for example noor et al 2022 reported potential projected changes in rainfall intensity attributable to climate change of 3 4 26 7 2010 2039 0 1 34 5 2040 2069 and 4 3 96 8 2070 2099 from that observed during the base period 1971 2000 therefore forecasting reliable long term time series data under various climate changes is also a vital component for accurate gr gi optimisation global climate model gcm could be used to simulate the data of air temperature precipitation and atmospheric circulation on a global scale and is considered to be an essential tool for the projection of climate change ipcc 2014 o neill et al 2016 however the gcm is appropriate at a large scale due to certain defects and uncertainties of simulation data in geographic space willems et al 2012 regional climate model rcm a downscaling model driven by output from a gcm can be applied to capture topographic and surface characteristics at local minor scales as well as deviations of boundary conditions providing parameterisation with observed cumulus which in turn facilitated better simulation of extreme rainfall events giorgi and mearns 1999 regcm4 6 a common rcm developed by the national center for atmospheric research and pennsylvania state university has been used to perform bias correction on each grid point and showed high reliability and excellent predictive effect gao et al 2017 pan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 several studies had made use of these models to perform comparative study of the results of present and future scenarios however only a handful of studies highlighted the dynamic changes in the climate change process yu et al 2022 to better capture the dynamic changes some researchers proposed using the bernaola galván algorithm to identify mutation information in long term time series data the bernaola galván algorithm is a segmentation algorithm originally used to probe the temporal organisation of heterogeneities in human heartbeat interval time series bernaola galván et al 2001 since the algorithm could be used to detect mutations in the climate change process it might also be used to capture nonlinear and non stationary climate change information chen et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 yu et al 2022 and provide insights on parameters at various stages of climate change hence knowing the temporal variation or time series of the climate change one would also be able to establish the time series of the various parameters in short both simulation models and segmented time series are crucial to obtaining realistic and reliable long term time series parameters for accurately assessing and optimizing the gr gi performance under various climate change scenarios since the performance varies significantly across the time series parameters such as precipitation amount intensity and interval time this paper presents a novel assessment framework to support the selection of gr gi based on long term time series information in tandem with non stationary climate change the specific objectives are 1 to integrate regcm 4 6 and bernaola galván algorithm into establishing the long term time series of parameters in tandem with non stationary climate changes the time series will be used to test the optimised gr gi design and configuration 2 to optimise the life cycle cost and hydrological performance of gr gi using the graph theory based algorithm and genetic algorithm ga and 3 to optimise gr gi under various climate scenarios in guangzhou china 2 methodology the developmental framework consists of three parts fig 1 1 assess and process the climate information to establish the appropriate climate change time series 2 establish the optimal drainage design strategy and 3 evaluate the hydrological performance of the drainage system in response to climate change the long term time series of precipitation is obtained by using dynamic downscaling of regcm based on two rcps as for the spatial configuration of urban stormwater infrastructure the optimal strategies at various levels of decentralised layouts are obtained through integrating graph theory and genetic algorithms then the hydrological performance of the recommended strategies for various representative climate change scenarios is evaluated using a hydrological model 2 1 case study guangzhou is located at the pearl river basin and has a subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1700 mm but the rainfalls are non uniformly distributed also guangzhou is one of the cities with the most waterlogged and severe flood risk amongst 136 large coastal cities hallegatte et al 2013 covering an area of 101 8 hectares zhujiang new town fig 2 is the most prominent central business district in guangzhou and has the typical characteristics of a densely built up city such as high impervious surface high population density and highly developed economy this study selected zhujiang new town as the case study area zhujiang new town consists of 43 sub catchments the storm water management model swmm an open access hydrological model developed by united states environmental protection agency was used to simulate the surface runoff peak flow and the total suspended solids tss in an urban catchment rossman 2010 the parameters of the sub catchments in swmm were obtained from the wang et al 2021c and are listed in table s1 the dynamic wave approach was used for the network confluence computation model and the horton model was used to describe the infiltration process appropriate saturation and exponential function were adopted for pollutant accumulation and the wash off model respectively 2 2 climate information processing and assessment 2 2 1 climate data simulation gfdl esm 2 m which had been found to perform well for the pearl river basin of china zhang et al 2021 was chosen to simulate climate data in this study the simulation results were used as the initial and lateral boundary conditions for climate projection in this study regcm4 6 was adopted for dynamic downscaling 0 25 0 25 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were selected as climate scenarios as they may be used to represent similar intermediate and extreme scenarios for climate change respectively and had been widely utilised and reported in many studies requena et al 2019 yu et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 the base period 2008 2021 was used and for a 30 year life cycle of the coupled gr gi system the target future period was set for 2022 2051 2 2 2 managing the time series stage division of data climate change is a change process with phase regularity reliable assessment of the projected climate changes is helpful to identify and explore the effects of meteorological factors on the performance of grey green coupled strategy the bernaola galván algorithm has often been used to identify mutation information in long term time series and has been found applicable to nonlinear and non stationary climate change information chen et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 yu et al 2022 in this study the bernaola galván algorithm was chosen for stage division of the future period it should be noted that before applying the bernaola galván algorithm an augmented dickey fuller test is required to verify the non stationarity of the time series to be sub divided dickey and fuller 1979 the augmented dickey fuller is used to test a time series by detecting the existence of unit root in a time series sample so as to ensure that the premise of bernaola galván algorithm is met the corresponding procedures of applying bernaola galván algorithm are included in the annex text s1 2 2 3 data extraction and analysis three sets of data precipitation duration and antecedent dry days have been found significant and relevant in the generation and analysis of climate change time series for the purpose of drainage design gong et al 2016 rasheed et al 2019 sohn et al 2019 they were extracted from the simulated long term time series a rainfall event is defined as one with a rainfall depth exceeding 1 mm and the minimum interval between two rainfall events is 6 hr or more joo et al 2014 the probability density function used to describe the variation and distribution of rainfall is based on a two parameter gamma distribution chapman 1997 eq 1 1 f x x α 1 e x β β α γ α where α μ 2 σ 2 is the shape parameter β σ 2 μ is the scale parameter and μ is the mean value of the precipitation duration or antecedent dry days series and σ is the variance the joint probability distribution function may be used for fitting the distribution relationship of the two factors yu et al 2022 contributing to observing the distribution of precipitation with duration and antecedent dry days from a broader dimension eq 2 2 f x y f x f y x α x 1 y α y 1 e x β x y β y β x α x β y a y γ α x γ α y where f x y is the joint probability distribution of the precipitation and duration or precipitation and antecedent dry days where f x is the gamma distribution of precipitation and f y is the gamma distribution of duration or antecedent dry days the joint probability density distribution of long term time series was employed to assess the characteristics of climate change in different stages under various climate scenarios 2 3 optimal strategy development 2 3 1 optimisation objectives and constraints in general the calculation function used for searching the optimal minimum cost of a coupled system is expressed as wang et al 2021c 3 d opt arg min d d f cost where d is the decision variable d represents all feasible plans for the system and d opt is the optimal solution when gi is included in the optimisation d may be extended as eq 4 4 d d d l l a y o u t p a r a m e t e r s h y d r a u l i c p a r a m e t e r s g i p a r a m e t e r s where the decision variable d contains the degree of decentralisation of the drainage layout ddl layout parameters i e connections between different sewers hydraulic parameters i e pipe diameters and slopes that satisfy the hydraulic constraints and gi parameters of the coupled system type size and location of gi to characterise the minimum cost quantitatively lcc expressed in present value pv is an important indicator of the capital urban infrastructure investment and operation and maintenance o m cost of the infrastructure chui et al 2016 dos santos et al 2021 the optimal strategies at various levels of decentralised layouts for the least lcc is expressed as eqs 5 and 6 5 l c c c a p i t a l i n f r a s t r u c t u r e p v o m i n f r a s t r u c t u r e 6 p v o m i n f r a s t r u c t u r e 1 n o m 1 1 i n where p v o m is the pv cost of o m during the life span i is the discount rate which is taken as 2 dong 2018 n is the lifespan and which is taken as 30 years according to xu et al 2017 in this study the capital costs were calculated based on local engineering market and the annual o m costs of gr and gi in guangzhou were taken as 10 and 8 of the capital cost respectively according to houle et al 2013 in addition we include hydraulic reliability as a constraint in the optimisation process according to local outdoor drainage design standards mhurd 2016 that is no flooding occurred following the design rainfall the design rainfall selected was a 5 yr return period and 6 hr duration which was 121 mm rainfall depth in guangzhou the internal characteristics followed that of a chicago hyetograph the current engineering practice is such that the design of gr is based on a specific design rainfall certain return period and duration the performance of the so designed infrastructure is subsequently in the assessment of the overall system subject to certain selected events there are obvious advantages to evaluate the system performance based on a series of events and the ultimate test would be based on a time series of hydrological and climate change incorporating various relevant parameters given the nature of the hydrological and climate change events the list of parameters would be large and almost always not exhaustive enough to describe all aspects of the change we discovered that an exorbitant amount of computation hardware and software resources is required to perform optimisation for discrete events with a short list of carefully selected parameters using a time series of selected parameters would be hard put given our available resources after much deliberation we compromised by adopting an alternative approach in the formulation of the algorithm and had chosen to use certain discrete design rainfall event for the optimisation instead 2 3 2 gr strategy optimisation initially the spatial configuration algorithm based on a graph theory is utilised to search for various decentralised layouts of gr that is expected to provide suitable and hydraulically adequate basic networks for gr gi bakhshipour et al 2019a this algorithm can generate all possible sewer spatial configurations with various degrees of decentralisation from a base plan drainage network follows the street alignments it is a connected cyclic graph that includes all drainage possibilities in the base plan vertices represent manholes and edges joining the vertices represent sewers according to bakhshipour et al 2019a the first step is to define the degree of decentralisation of the layout which is determined by the number of selected and candidate outlets across the system 7 d d l n so 1 n co 1 100 where n so denotes the selected number of outlets and n co represents the total number of candidate outlets the main objective of the study is to develop a replicable approach for the assessment of gr gi in response to non stationary climate change and demonstrate its feasibility and application either fully centralised i e ddl 0 and fully decentralised network ddl 100 are investigated in this study the optimisation process follows first a fully centralised layout is selected only one outlet out of nco possible outlets this is the fully centralised network cl gr then a second outlet from the remaining nco 1 outlets is selected randomly and added to the first network including a second outlet means that the first network would be partitioned to form two sub networks each discharges through the respective outlet the configuration of the sub network is selected by using the algorithm which uses graph theory to assign different parts of the network to different outlets and generates the decentralised layout then the process is repeated by adding a third fourth and fifth outlets etc until all nco outlets are included and the corresponding subnetworks were configured using the above mentioned algorithm the algorithm needs 2 ns decision variables to generate one feasible layout ns is the number of sub catchments in the base graph after generating the layout the size of the gr network components e g pipe diameters and manholes invert elevation must be designed in such a way that satisfies all hydraulic and technical criteria for this purpose the adaptive sewer design algorithm introduced by haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 was adopted in this study the constraints are the telescopic pattern of sewer diameters minimum and maximum cover depths slopes flow velocity and hydraulic reliability each alternative layout requires 2 np decision variables in the genetic algorithm here np represents the total number of pipes for each pipe one variable determines the pipe s diameter and other one determines pipe s slope by adjusting the invert level of the manhole therefore the total number of decision variables for gr strategy and optimisation generating a decentralised layout and sizing it is 2 np ns 2 3 3 grey green infrastructure system optimisation considerable investment is required to construct and maintain the conventional gr and the introduction of gi may somewhat decrease the construction demand for gr and thus reduce the investment as the cost for construction and maintenance of gr gi is relatively lower wang et al 2021c the general constraints for configuring a grey green infrastructure system include the street network the sewer pipe runs parallel and at the side of the streets ground elevation obstacles distance of receipient water body from the outlet s and space available for the construction moreover considering the actual construction are located in a high density city space the construction scale of gi needs to be controlled to no larger than 10 of the sub catchment areas eckart et al 2017 being one of the most popular types of gi a bioretention cell comprises surface vegetation graded soil pore space storage and underground drainage layers and is widely and flexibly used in high density cities where open space is scarce lim and lu 2016 wang et al 2021b for most practical purposes bioretention cells are mainly designed to reduce the amount and delay the flow of surface runoff remove non point source pollutants and beautify the environment liu et al 2015 the parameters of the bioretention cell module in swmm can be found in table s2 after optimising gr networks as explained in section 2 3 2 gi can be introduced to the system to formulate coupled gr gi configuration here a binary system is used to annotate ga that is utilised to optimise the coupled system and hence determine the minimum lcc ene et al 2016 in this process the decision variables are encoded as binary values i e 0 and 1 and a chromosome equivalent composed of these values is used to represent one design scheme hsu et al 2005 in the present study there are ns number of sub catchments 2np number of pipes values in each chromosome to reflect the decision variables where ns values control gi in each sub catchment i and each value is decoded as follow 8 g i i 1 s u b c a t c h m e n t i h a s g i 0 s u b c a t c h m e n t i h a s n o g i as gi is introduced into the gr layout the gr diameter could be and will be reduced to achieve minimum lcc while hydraulic reliability is held at the same level as before the pipe diameter d will be controlled by 2np values represented by a two bits code and define the relative diameter of a pipe j 9 d j 11 d s a m e a s i n t h e g r s c h e m e 10 d o n e s i z e s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e 01 d t w o s i z e s s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e 00 d t h r e e s i z e s s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e to obtain the minimum cost configuration these pipe diameters need to be iterated through ga to minimize the lcc finally the centralised grey green infrastructure cl gr gi system and decentralised grey green infrastructure dl gr gi system alternatives are generated based on the two optimal gr layouts centralised and fully decentralised with the corresponding ddl 2 4 hydrological performance assessment the ability to control water quantity and quality are two critical aspects of urban stormwater system assessment islam et al 2021 rezaei et al 2021 as for water quantity the reducing ratios of total outflow and peak flow were chosen as the indicators in this study which had been used hydrological performance assessment gong et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 xing et al 2016 here total outflow refers to the full amount of the final outflow from the end of the network sum of all outlet flow and peak flow refers to the maximum outflow from the end of the drainage system over the whole period the strategy with the highest cost amongst the four optimised strategies was taken as the benchmark the ratios of the total outflow and peak flow relative to the corresponding values for the benchmark were used as evaluation indexes for the optimised strategy and the expressions are as follows 10 t o n 1 v t o t a l n v t o t a l b e n c h m a r k 100 11 r p n 1 v p e a k n v p e a k b e n c h m a r k 100 where ton and rpn are the ratios of total outflow and peak flow respectively similarly the total suspended solids tss a reflection of water quality in the recipient water body bilotta and brazier 2008 wang et al 2018 2017a may be treated in the same manner 12 r t n m r e m o v a l m b u i l d u p 100 where rtn is the removal rate of tss and mremoval and mbulidup present the removed and accumulated mass of tss respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate simulation results rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 2008 to 2051 were adopted to represent the annual precipitation for the two scenarios both time series showed upward rising trend and the upward trend of rcp8 5 coefficient of variation 0 3 was more prominent than that of rcp4 5 fig 3 a and 3b these characteristics were consistent with the local future rainfall predictions wu and huang 2016 zhang et al 2021 compared with rcp8 5 more events were observed in rcp4 5 and showed higher amount and intensity of rainfall fig 3c based on the results of the augmented dickey fuller test the long term series data were shown to be non stationary p 0 768 the bernaola galván algorithm was also used to identify the nodes between the prediction stages 2022 2051 based on rcp4 5 the future meteorological stage was sub divided into two stages stage 1 2022 2028 n 977 and stage 2 2029 2051 n 3187 in the case of rcp8 5 the two stages were 2022 2031 n 1161 and 2032 2051 n 2225 even though the rcp8 5 scenario contained less rainfall the annual average rainfall increased more than those of the base period 7 in stage 1 and 17 in stage 2 based on the statistics of independent events obtained table 1 an average rainfall event during stage 1 in rcp4 5 was 13 9 mm while the average in stage 2 was 15 0 mm while the independent rainfall in rcp8 5 remained at about 8 7 mm on average in terms of rainfall duration each stage in rcp4 5 remained at about 13 0 h while the corresponding duration for each stage of rcp8 5 was close to 10 h the longer rainfall duration means higher probability of higher rainfall amount one may conclude that the frequency of rainstorms was higher based on the rcp4 5 scenario furthermore the frequency for rainfall exceeding 50 mm increased from 4 7 observed during the base period to 6 3 in stage 2 and the frequency of rainfall exceeding 100 mm increases from 1 6 observed during the base period to 2 3 in stage 2 a downward trend in the frequency of heavy storms in rcp8 5 was observed it can be seen in table 1 that the frequency for rainfall exceeding 50 mm decreases from 2 2 observed during the base period to 1 7 in stage 2 and the frequency of rainfall exceeding 100 mm decreases from 0 5 observed during the base period to 0 4 in stage 2 significant changes of antecedent dry days were observed in rcp8 5 indicating a more frequent arid climate compared to that observed during the base period the antecedent dry days of stage 1 and stage 2 increased by 39 1 and 51 5 respectively in rcp8 5 with the average antecedent dry days increased from 1 9 days to 2 9 days the maximum antecedent dry days could reach 150 days in contrast the antecedent dry days of rcp4 5 were relatively constant showing a mean of 2 1 days this observation was in line with that reported by wu and huang 2016 and shi et al 2020 the joint probability distributions of the precipitation amount and duration and the precipitation amount and antecedent dry days are shown in fig 4 in the case of rcp4 5 most of the rainfall events which exceed 100 mm are accompanied by long duration fig 4a thus the overall rainfall intensity was not high on the other hand the duration of rainfall events was shorter in rcp8 5 indicating higher rainfall intensities especially so for extreme rainfall events since urban waterlog is often triggered by rainstorms with high rainfall intensity therefore we focused on rainfall events with high precipitation fig 4b it is noted that high precipitation typically coincides with shorter antecedent dry days from fig 4b it can be seen that rainstorms are usually continuous and intense in the study area which is also consistent with the precipitation in the subtropical monsoon region according to rcp8 5 antecedent dry days showed a longer duration and hence more frequent drought events however the antecedent dry days of extreme rainstorm events appeared an exception as the antecedent dry days were relatively small isolated rainstorm mode appeared not changed significantly 3 2 optimum drainage configuration the optimised configuration of gr and gr gi at various degrees of decentralisation are shown in fig 5 each configuration were run through 320 000 iterations to obtain the optimum design a process that took 30 h based on a pc equipped with intel core i5 2 9 ghz dual core cpu and 16 gb of ram fig 5 shows the pipe diameter and the corresponding pipe slope reflected as burial depth of the coupled system the pipe diameters are significantly smaller than that designed for the single grey system in the coupled system the gi area in a fully centralised gr gi cl gr gi accounts for 6 6 of the drainage area while the area in a fully decentralised gr gi dl gr gi accounts for 5 8 of the catchment area a cl gr gi design contained a larger proportion of gis an optimised coupled gr gi system is more attractive than fully gr system in terms of the cost fig 6 specifically it is clear that at the same degree of decentralisation the lcc savings of a fully centralised and decentralised gr gi systems are 18 and 11 compared to the fully gr system at the same degree of decentralisation respectively this observation also shows that gi has the potential of replacing a significant proportion of the centralised layout and lead to significant cost reduction compared to a centralised gr gi the decentralised solution produced an additional 16 2 saving of the lcc this is because of the relatively low cost associated with a highly decentralised layout wang et al 2021c it is also noted that large scale gi construction is typically not required which further compresses the construction investment of the decentralised gr gi therefore an optimised and fully decentralised grey green design is most economical and competitive while satisfying the hydraulic reliability requirement 3 3 hydrological performance the hydrological performances of the optimised strategies were evaluated using a catchment runoff model swmm and included considerations of reducing the outflow peak flow and tss the simulation was calculated for 12 h simulation time since the lcc of the centralised gr is the least ideal it was used as a benchmark strategy to evaluate the systems performance of runoff volume based on the findings of the simulation it is found that with regards to outflow discharge gr gis could achieve reduction ratios of 56 66 fig 7 a in terms of hydrological performance the cl gr gi system scored the best as a result of the configuration of larger scale gi implemented in cl gr gi most of the light rainfalls were effectively retained at source and the outflows were not affected significantly with climate change this result demonstrates that as an annualised index reduction of annual outflow is not sensitive with climate change similar results have been reported by kim et al 2018 and yang and zhang 2021 fig 7b shows that dl gr gi achieved the most effective performance in reducing peak flow with a score between 71 and 85 which is significantly different from the outflow discharge it is worth noting that the performance of decentralised gr was second only to dl gr gi and was significantly higher than cl gr gi the reason is the strong role of decentralised networks in attenuating peak flow bakhshipour et al 2019b wang et al 2021c there is also the added positive characterisrtics of a decentralised layout with multiple outlets which could effectively moderate the impacts of the discharge even when the storage capacity of gi is reached meanwhile there is observed that peak flow reduction in dl gr was generally maintained at 65 for various climate scenarios in comparison the capacity for peak flow reduction in the case of gr gis was highly sensitive to climate change in the case of rcp4 5 the performance of gr gi decreases to certain degrees from stage 1 to stage 2 and the reducing rate of cl gr gi decreases from 50 to 22 this is primarily due to more intense extreme rainfall events being observed during stage 2 the hydrological performance of cl gr gi was less favourable as the gi portion of the drainage system does not perform well during extreme rainfall similar results have been obtained in studies of independence gi performance bae and lee 2020 hu et al 2019 the centralised layout lacks sufficient resilience and gi is usually only used to manage runoff at source when extreme events generate more runoff than the upper retention limit gi basically fails to limit flood peaks zeng et al 2021 in terms of the removal rate of tss the gr gis depicted a rate of more than 60 fig 7c which is largely dependent on the pre retention property of gi on tss in gr gi the removal efficiency of tss is unstable under rcp8 5 in rcp8 5 antecedent dry days are increased significantly potentially results in increased tss accumulation in the catchment consequently the removal efficiency of tss in gr gi would decrease while a larger scale gi is anticipated to retain the tss intriguingly the dl gr gi with lesser extent of gi was observed to show better performance in removing tss plausibly the decentralised spatial topology may have increased the contact opportunities between runoff and gi leading to better retention of tss in the catchment 3 4 limitations and future work certain limitations of this study could be improved and carried out in future work first with the updating of gcms more possibilities for climate change have been proposed which may not be able to be fully covered by a single climate model in the future the ensemble of multi climate models can be considered to provide a varied and reliable prediction of the non stationarity of future climate change and to achieve a more reasonable layout optimisation second the simulation process is time consuming an improvement of the optimisation algorithm could be carried out to refine the search for an optimum solution third this study employed ga optimisation and focused on economic performance in the optimisation which may not be comprehensive and adequate for addressing real life applications with multiple objectives such as more non point source pollution indicators e g nitrogen compounds and chemical oxygen demand more advanced optimisation algorithms could be developed and used to tackle multi objective problems in the future finally the framework presented in this paper considered only bioretention cells as a gi example and may not be universally applicable for gi allocation future applications could include more gi types to support comprehensive and universally applicable decision making considerations 4 conclusions a novel assessment framework for an urban grey green infrastructure system is described in response to climate change the current framework leverages the synergistic effect of gr and gi within a coupled drainage system to produce a superior hydrological performance at the least life cycle cost it highlights the impacts of non stationary time series rather than stationary or event based climate scenarios emphasised in previous studies on gr gi optimisation applying the framework to optimize gr gi in guangzhou china with respect to over 30 years of climate change shows that first compared to the conventional grey infrastructure drainage solution the decentralised and centralised gr gi are economically competitive with a saving of 11 and 18 of the whole life cycle cost compared with that of conventional gr respectively second the degree of decentralisation of gr gi has higher impacts than the areal proportion of gi in gr gi on hydrological and economic performance the less extent of gi in a decentralised gr gi depicted high performance in removing tss in long term time series simulations finally the decentralised gr gi shows superior performance in scenarios with extremely long antecedent dry days therefore in addition to the factors of precipitation and rainfall duration antecedent dry days should be taken into consideration to evaluate the impacts of climate change on optimised gr gi strategies in a more comprehensive way the assessment methods developed in this study have the potential to provide a reference for the planning and decision making of gr gi in high density urban areas the proposed framework can not only assess and optimize gr gi under non stationarity time series but also be a powerful support for stormwater management in response to climate change declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the

15065,climate change has led to the increased intensity and frequency of extreme meteorological events threatening the drainage capacity in urban catchments and densely built up cities to alleviate urban flooding disasters strategies coupled with green and grey infrastructure have been proposed to support urban stormwater management however most strategies rely largely on diachronic rainfall data and ignore long term climate change impacts this study described a novel framework to assess and to identify the optimal solution in response to uncertainties following climate change the assessment framework consists of three components 1 assess and process climate data to generate long term time series of meteorological parameters under different climate conditions 2 optimise the design of grey green infrastructure systems to establish the optimal design solutions and 3 perform a multi criteria assessment of economic and hydrological performance to support decision making a case study in guangzhou china was carried out to demonstrate the usability and application processes of the framework the results of the case study illustrated that the optimised grey green infrastructure could save life cycle costs and reduce total outflow 56 66 peak flow 22 85 and tss more than 60 compared to the fully centralised grey infrastructure system indicating its high superior in economic competitiveness and hydrological performance under climate uncertainties in terms of spatial configuration the contribution of green infrastructure appeared not as critical as the adoption of decentralisation of the drainage networks furthermore under extreme drought scenarios the decentralised infrastructure system exhibited an exceptionally high degree of removal performance for non point source pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban stormwater management green infrastructure coupled grey green system climate change regional climate model antecedent

rapid urbanisation leads to a significant increase of impermeable surfaces resulting in increased surface runoff and thereby threatening the hydrological safety of cities and waterlog larsen et al 2016 nazari sharabian et al 2019 aerts et al 2014 reported that urban waterlog caused direct economic losses of 650 billion over the past decade conventionally grey infrastructure gr is designed to intercept collect and channel the runoff for effective drainage however gr had the side effect of concentrating non point source pollutants in the catchment area resulting in extensive deterioration of the water quality of the recipient water body nika et al 2020 wang et al 2021a comparatively green infrastructure gi with natural based solutions including low impact development water sensitive cities sustainable urban drainage systems and sponge city could counter the pollution issues fletcher et al 2015 ying et al 2021 these gis are typically incorporated in decentralised structural practices and manage the surface runoff at the source as they are typically designed to mimic the natural hydrological condition before urbanisation and are aesthetically pleasing gis could be strategically integrated as part of the urban stormwater management scheme and the city s development plan mcfarland et al 2019 nickel et al 2014 versini et al 2018 although the advantages of these strategies have been widely discussed and accepted gi is recognized as being appropriate for stormwater management for rainfall of short return periods and in many cases cannot replace the role of gr especially in the case of densely built up urban environments xu et al 2019 in such an urban environment over 60 of the land surface is occupied by pavements and roofs and is drained through grey infrastructures qi et al 2019 the remaining open space limits the scope and hydrological capacity of gi in response to extreme storms for example mei et al 2018 assessed 15 gi scenarios subject to rainfall with return periods of 2 100 years in beijing china and concluded that the hydrological performance of the gis was not satisfactory and could not eliminate urban flooding even for the case of the most optimistic scenario although gi can benefit stormwater management in multiple ways including water quality volumes and frequency of runoff and floods one should not expect to achieve high performance in flooding mitigation particularly for long return periods by just applying gi only gr and gi could be integrated appropriately and applied as potential advanced solutions for urban stormwater management browder et al 2019 the integrated system leverages on the versatility and ecological aspects of gi and the engineering reliability and practicability of gr wang et al 2021d 2017b yang and zhang 2021 zhou et al 2022 to date several integration schemes have been reported and they include the grey green infrastructure gr gi system to reduce the life cycle cost lcc bakhshipour et al 2019a the system for urban stormwater treatment and analysis integration to evaluate the optimal location type and cost of stormwater best management practices lee et al 2012 and integrated gr and low impact development to measure the technical and operational resilience of best management practices wang et al 2021c other reported works include assessment of hydraulic reliability and hydrological resilience based on the selected rainfall events instead of continuous rainfall time series da silva et al 2018 mohanty et al 2020 sohn et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a long term time series analysis for urban stormwater management would have considered multiple climatic variables such as rainfall intensity duration and antecedent dry days to mention a few as these parameters could influence the generation of runoff in the catchment soil water storage capacity of the underlying surface and source accumulation process of non point source pollutants madarang and kang 2013 rossman and huber 2016 salim et al 2019 in adopting a single climatic variable e g rainfall intensity the hydrologic performance of the integrated gr gi drainage system may be overestimated under certain hydrological conditions yu et al 2022 not to mention the inherent limitation of using one single parameter to optimise the location type and cost of urban drainage systems for long term applications recently climate models have also been used to assess the hydraulic performance of the gr or gi under various climate scenarios such as representative concentration pathways rcps to help understand better the potential impact of design planning decisions on urban hydrology zeng et al 2021 evaluated the performance of gi in runoff quantity control and water quality improvement under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios total radiative forcing topped at a stable 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 respectively by 2100 at the grid scale see meinshausen et al 2011 el housni et al 2019 made projection of the hydraulic performance of the urban pipe network 2041 to 2070 based on the simulation results of the canadian regional climate model however the majority of the reported studies assessed and optimised the adaptive capacity of gr and gi in response to stationary or event based climate scenarios neglecting the effects of non stationarity and nonlinearity of long term climate change since climate change is dynamic and nonlinear optimising the synergistic effects of gr and gi as the means to adapt to non stationary climate change needs to be addressed urgently the relevant long term time series parameters are readily influenced by climate change for example noor et al 2022 reported potential projected changes in rainfall intensity attributable to climate change of 3 4 26 7 2010 2039 0 1 34 5 2040 2069 and 4 3 96 8 2070 2099 from that observed during the base period 1971 2000 therefore forecasting reliable long term time series data under various climate changes is also a vital component for accurate gr gi optimisation global climate model gcm could be used to simulate the data of air temperature precipitation and atmospheric circulation on a global scale and is considered to be an essential tool for the projection of climate change ipcc 2014 o neill et al 2016 however the gcm is appropriate at a large scale due to certain defects and uncertainties of simulation data in geographic space willems et al 2012 regional climate model rcm a downscaling model driven by output from a gcm can be applied to capture topographic and surface characteristics at local minor scales as well as deviations of boundary conditions providing parameterisation with observed cumulus which in turn facilitated better simulation of extreme rainfall events giorgi and mearns 1999 regcm4 6 a common rcm developed by the national center for atmospheric research and pennsylvania state university has been used to perform bias correction on each grid point and showed high reliability and excellent predictive effect gao et al 2017 pan et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 several studies had made use of these models to perform comparative study of the results of present and future scenarios however only a handful of studies highlighted the dynamic changes in the climate change process yu et al 2022 to better capture the dynamic changes some researchers proposed using the bernaola galván algorithm to identify mutation information in long term time series data the bernaola galván algorithm is a segmentation algorithm originally used to probe the temporal organisation of heterogeneities in human heartbeat interval time series bernaola galván et al 2001 since the algorithm could be used to detect mutations in the climate change process it might also be used to capture nonlinear and non stationary climate change information chen et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 yu et al 2022 and provide insights on parameters at various stages of climate change hence knowing the temporal variation or time series of the climate change one would also be able to establish the time series of the various parameters in short both simulation models and segmented time series are crucial to obtaining realistic and reliable long term time series parameters for accurately assessing and optimizing the gr gi performance under various climate change scenarios since the performance varies significantly across the time series parameters such as precipitation amount intensity and interval time this paper presents a novel assessment framework to support the selection of gr gi based on long term time series information in tandem with non stationary climate change the specific objectives are 1 to integrate regcm 4 6 and bernaola galván algorithm into establishing the long term time series of parameters in tandem with non stationary climate changes the time series will be used to test the optimised gr gi design and configuration 2 to optimise the life cycle cost and hydrological performance of gr gi using the graph theory based algorithm and genetic algorithm ga and 3 to optimise gr gi under various climate scenarios in guangzhou china 2 methodology the developmental framework consists of three parts fig 1 1 assess and process the climate information to establish the appropriate climate change time series 2 establish the optimal drainage design strategy and 3 evaluate the hydrological performance of the drainage system in response to climate change the long term time series of precipitation is obtained by using dynamic downscaling of regcm based on two rcps as for the spatial configuration of urban stormwater infrastructure the optimal strategies at various levels of decentralised layouts are obtained through integrating graph theory and genetic algorithms then the hydrological performance of the recommended strategies for various representative climate change scenarios is evaluated using a hydrological model 2 1 case study guangzhou is located at the pearl river basin and has a subtropical monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is about 1700 mm but the rainfalls are non uniformly distributed also guangzhou is one of the cities with the most waterlogged and severe flood risk amongst 136 large coastal cities hallegatte et al 2013 covering an area of 101 8 hectares zhujiang new town fig 2 is the most prominent central business district in guangzhou and has the typical characteristics of a densely built up city such as high impervious surface high population density and highly developed economy this study selected zhujiang new town as the case study area zhujiang new town consists of 43 sub catchments the storm water management model swmm an open access hydrological model developed by united states environmental protection agency was used to simulate the surface runoff peak flow and the total suspended solids tss in an urban catchment rossman 2010 the parameters of the sub catchments in swmm were obtained from the wang et al 2021c and are listed in table s1 the dynamic wave approach was used for the network confluence computation model and the horton model was used to describe the infiltration process appropriate saturation and exponential function were adopted for pollutant accumulation and the wash off model respectively 2 2 climate information processing and assessment 2 2 1 climate data simulation gfdl esm 2 m which had been found to perform well for the pearl river basin of china zhang et al 2021 was chosen to simulate climate data in this study the simulation results were used as the initial and lateral boundary conditions for climate projection in this study regcm4 6 was adopted for dynamic downscaling 0 25 0 25 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were selected as climate scenarios as they may be used to represent similar intermediate and extreme scenarios for climate change respectively and had been widely utilised and reported in many studies requena et al 2019 yu et al 2022 zeng et al 2021 the base period 2008 2021 was used and for a 30 year life cycle of the coupled gr gi system the target future period was set for 2022 2051 2 2 2 managing the time series stage division of data climate change is a change process with phase regularity reliable assessment of the projected climate changes is helpful to identify and explore the effects of meteorological factors on the performance of grey green coupled strategy the bernaola galván algorithm has often been used to identify mutation information in long term time series and has been found applicable to nonlinear and non stationary climate change information chen et al 2019 jehanzaib et al 2020 yu et al 2022 in this study the bernaola galván algorithm was chosen for stage division of the future period it should be noted that before applying the bernaola galván algorithm an augmented dickey fuller test is required to verify the non stationarity of the time series to be sub divided dickey and fuller 1979 the augmented dickey fuller is used to test a time series by detecting the existence of unit root in a time series sample so as to ensure that the premise of bernaola galván algorithm is met the corresponding procedures of applying bernaola galván algorithm are included in the annex text s1 2 2 3 data extraction and analysis three sets of data precipitation duration and antecedent dry days have been found significant and relevant in the generation and analysis of climate change time series for the purpose of drainage design gong et al 2016 rasheed et al 2019 sohn et al 2019 they were extracted from the simulated long term time series a rainfall event is defined as one with a rainfall depth exceeding 1 mm and the minimum interval between two rainfall events is 6 hr or more joo et al 2014 the probability density function used to describe the variation and distribution of rainfall is based on a two parameter gamma distribution chapman 1997 eq 1 1 f x x α 1 e x β β α γ α where α μ 2 σ 2 is the shape parameter β σ 2 μ is the scale parameter and μ is the mean value of the precipitation duration or antecedent dry days series and σ is the variance the joint probability distribution function may be used for fitting the distribution relationship of the two factors yu et al 2022 contributing to observing the distribution of precipitation with duration and antecedent dry days from a broader dimension eq 2 2 f x y f x f y x α x 1 y α y 1 e x β x y β y β x α x β y a y γ α x γ α y where f x y is the joint probability distribution of the precipitation and duration or precipitation and antecedent dry days where f x is the gamma distribution of precipitation and f y is the gamma distribution of duration or antecedent dry days the joint probability density distribution of long term time series was employed to assess the characteristics of climate change in different stages under various climate scenarios 2 3 optimal strategy development 2 3 1 optimisation objectives and constraints in general the calculation function used for searching the optimal minimum cost of a coupled system is expressed as wang et al 2021c 3 d opt arg min d d f cost where d is the decision variable d represents all feasible plans for the system and d opt is the optimal solution when gi is included in the optimisation d may be extended as eq 4 4 d d d l l a y o u t p a r a m e t e r s h y d r a u l i c p a r a m e t e r s g i p a r a m e t e r s where the decision variable d contains the degree of decentralisation of the drainage layout ddl layout parameters i e connections between different sewers hydraulic parameters i e pipe diameters and slopes that satisfy the hydraulic constraints and gi parameters of the coupled system type size and location of gi to characterise the minimum cost quantitatively lcc expressed in present value pv is an important indicator of the capital urban infrastructure investment and operation and maintenance o m cost of the infrastructure chui et al 2016 dos santos et al 2021 the optimal strategies at various levels of decentralised layouts for the least lcc is expressed as eqs 5 and 6 5 l c c c a p i t a l i n f r a s t r u c t u r e p v o m i n f r a s t r u c t u r e 6 p v o m i n f r a s t r u c t u r e 1 n o m 1 1 i n where p v o m is the pv cost of o m during the life span i is the discount rate which is taken as 2 dong 2018 n is the lifespan and which is taken as 30 years according to xu et al 2017 in this study the capital costs were calculated based on local engineering market and the annual o m costs of gr and gi in guangzhou were taken as 10 and 8 of the capital cost respectively according to houle et al 2013 in addition we include hydraulic reliability as a constraint in the optimisation process according to local outdoor drainage design standards mhurd 2016 that is no flooding occurred following the design rainfall the design rainfall selected was a 5 yr return period and 6 hr duration which was 121 mm rainfall depth in guangzhou the internal characteristics followed that of a chicago hyetograph the current engineering practice is such that the design of gr is based on a specific design rainfall certain return period and duration the performance of the so designed infrastructure is subsequently in the assessment of the overall system subject to certain selected events there are obvious advantages to evaluate the system performance based on a series of events and the ultimate test would be based on a time series of hydrological and climate change incorporating various relevant parameters given the nature of the hydrological and climate change events the list of parameters would be large and almost always not exhaustive enough to describe all aspects of the change we discovered that an exorbitant amount of computation hardware and software resources is required to perform optimisation for discrete events with a short list of carefully selected parameters using a time series of selected parameters would be hard put given our available resources after much deliberation we compromised by adopting an alternative approach in the formulation of the algorithm and had chosen to use certain discrete design rainfall event for the optimisation instead 2 3 2 gr strategy optimisation initially the spatial configuration algorithm based on a graph theory is utilised to search for various decentralised layouts of gr that is expected to provide suitable and hydraulically adequate basic networks for gr gi bakhshipour et al 2019a this algorithm can generate all possible sewer spatial configurations with various degrees of decentralisation from a base plan drainage network follows the street alignments it is a connected cyclic graph that includes all drainage possibilities in the base plan vertices represent manholes and edges joining the vertices represent sewers according to bakhshipour et al 2019a the first step is to define the degree of decentralisation of the layout which is determined by the number of selected and candidate outlets across the system 7 d d l n so 1 n co 1 100 where n so denotes the selected number of outlets and n co represents the total number of candidate outlets the main objective of the study is to develop a replicable approach for the assessment of gr gi in response to non stationary climate change and demonstrate its feasibility and application either fully centralised i e ddl 0 and fully decentralised network ddl 100 are investigated in this study the optimisation process follows first a fully centralised layout is selected only one outlet out of nco possible outlets this is the fully centralised network cl gr then a second outlet from the remaining nco 1 outlets is selected randomly and added to the first network including a second outlet means that the first network would be partitioned to form two sub networks each discharges through the respective outlet the configuration of the sub network is selected by using the algorithm which uses graph theory to assign different parts of the network to different outlets and generates the decentralised layout then the process is repeated by adding a third fourth and fifth outlets etc until all nco outlets are included and the corresponding subnetworks were configured using the above mentioned algorithm the algorithm needs 2 ns decision variables to generate one feasible layout ns is the number of sub catchments in the base graph after generating the layout the size of the gr network components e g pipe diameters and manholes invert elevation must be designed in such a way that satisfies all hydraulic and technical criteria for this purpose the adaptive sewer design algorithm introduced by haghighi and bakhshipour 2012 was adopted in this study the constraints are the telescopic pattern of sewer diameters minimum and maximum cover depths slopes flow velocity and hydraulic reliability each alternative layout requires 2 np decision variables in the genetic algorithm here np represents the total number of pipes for each pipe one variable determines the pipe s diameter and other one determines pipe s slope by adjusting the invert level of the manhole therefore the total number of decision variables for gr strategy and optimisation generating a decentralised layout and sizing it is 2 np ns 2 3 3 grey green infrastructure system optimisation considerable investment is required to construct and maintain the conventional gr and the introduction of gi may somewhat decrease the construction demand for gr and thus reduce the investment as the cost for construction and maintenance of gr gi is relatively lower wang et al 2021c the general constraints for configuring a grey green infrastructure system include the street network the sewer pipe runs parallel and at the side of the streets ground elevation obstacles distance of receipient water body from the outlet s and space available for the construction moreover considering the actual construction are located in a high density city space the construction scale of gi needs to be controlled to no larger than 10 of the sub catchment areas eckart et al 2017 being one of the most popular types of gi a bioretention cell comprises surface vegetation graded soil pore space storage and underground drainage layers and is widely and flexibly used in high density cities where open space is scarce lim and lu 2016 wang et al 2021b for most practical purposes bioretention cells are mainly designed to reduce the amount and delay the flow of surface runoff remove non point source pollutants and beautify the environment liu et al 2015 the parameters of the bioretention cell module in swmm can be found in table s2 after optimising gr networks as explained in section 2 3 2 gi can be introduced to the system to formulate coupled gr gi configuration here a binary system is used to annotate ga that is utilised to optimise the coupled system and hence determine the minimum lcc ene et al 2016 in this process the decision variables are encoded as binary values i e 0 and 1 and a chromosome equivalent composed of these values is used to represent one design scheme hsu et al 2005 in the present study there are ns number of sub catchments 2np number of pipes values in each chromosome to reflect the decision variables where ns values control gi in each sub catchment i and each value is decoded as follow 8 g i i 1 s u b c a t c h m e n t i h a s g i 0 s u b c a t c h m e n t i h a s n o g i as gi is introduced into the gr layout the gr diameter could be and will be reduced to achieve minimum lcc while hydraulic reliability is held at the same level as before the pipe diameter d will be controlled by 2np values represented by a two bits code and define the relative diameter of a pipe j 9 d j 11 d s a m e a s i n t h e g r s c h e m e 10 d o n e s i z e s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e 01 d t w o s i z e s s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e 00 d t h r e e s i z e s s m a l l e r t h a n i n t h e g r s c h e m e to obtain the minimum cost configuration these pipe diameters need to be iterated through ga to minimize the lcc finally the centralised grey green infrastructure cl gr gi system and decentralised grey green infrastructure dl gr gi system alternatives are generated based on the two optimal gr layouts centralised and fully decentralised with the corresponding ddl 2 4 hydrological performance assessment the ability to control water quantity and quality are two critical aspects of urban stormwater system assessment islam et al 2021 rezaei et al 2021 as for water quantity the reducing ratios of total outflow and peak flow were chosen as the indicators in this study which had been used hydrological performance assessment gong et al 2019 jiang et al 2017 xing et al 2016 here total outflow refers to the full amount of the final outflow from the end of the network sum of all outlet flow and peak flow refers to the maximum outflow from the end of the drainage system over the whole period the strategy with the highest cost amongst the four optimised strategies was taken as the benchmark the ratios of the total outflow and peak flow relative to the corresponding values for the benchmark were used as evaluation indexes for the optimised strategy and the expressions are as follows 10 t o n 1 v t o t a l n v t o t a l b e n c h m a r k 100 11 r p n 1 v p e a k n v p e a k b e n c h m a r k 100 where ton and rpn are the ratios of total outflow and peak flow respectively similarly the total suspended solids tss a reflection of water quality in the recipient water body bilotta and brazier 2008 wang et al 2018 2017a may be treated in the same manner 12 r t n m r e m o v a l m b u i l d u p 100 where rtn is the removal rate of tss and mremoval and mbulidup present the removed and accumulated mass of tss respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate simulation results rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 2008 to 2051 were adopted to represent the annual precipitation for the two scenarios both time series showed upward rising trend and the upward trend of rcp8 5 coefficient of variation 0 3 was more prominent than that of rcp4 5 fig 3 a and 3b these characteristics were consistent with the local future rainfall predictions wu and huang 2016 zhang et al 2021 compared with rcp8 5 more events were observed in rcp4 5 and showed higher amount and intensity of rainfall fig 3c based on the results of the augmented dickey fuller test the long term series data were shown to be non stationary p 0 768 the bernaola galván algorithm was also used to identify the nodes between the prediction stages 2022 2051 based on rcp4 5 the future meteorological stage was sub divided into two stages stage 1 2022 2028 n 977 and stage 2 2029 2051 n 3187 in the case of rcp8 5 the two stages were 2022 2031 n 1161 and 2032 2051 n 2225 even though the rcp8 5 scenario contained less rainfall the annual average rainfall increased more than those of the base period 7 in stage 1 and 17 in stage 2 based on the statistics of independent events obtained table 1 an average rainfall event during stage 1 in rcp4 5 was 13 9 mm while the average in stage 2 was 15 0 mm while the independent rainfall in rcp8 5 remained at about 8 7 mm on average in terms of rainfall duration each stage in rcp4 5 remained at about 13 0 h while the corresponding duration for each stage of rcp8 5 was close to 10 h the longer rainfall duration means higher probability of higher rainfall amount one may conclude that the frequency of rainstorms was higher based on the rcp4 5 scenario furthermore the frequency for rainfall exceeding 50 mm increased from 4 7 observed during the base period to 6 3 in stage 2 and the frequency of rainfall exceeding 100 mm increases from 1 6 observed during the base period to 2 3 in stage 2 a downward trend in the frequency of heavy storms in rcp8 5 was observed it can be seen in table 1 that the frequency for rainfall exceeding 50 mm decreases from 2 2 observed during the base period to 1 7 in stage 2 and the frequency of rainfall exceeding 100 mm decreases from 0 5 observed during the base period to 0 4 in stage 2 significant changes of antecedent dry days were observed in rcp8 5 indicating a more frequent arid climate compared to that observed during the base period the antecedent dry days of stage 1 and stage 2 increased by 39 1 and 51 5 respectively in rcp8 5 with the average antecedent dry days increased from 1 9 days to 2 9 days the maximum antecedent dry days could reach 150 days in contrast the antecedent dry days of rcp4 5 were relatively constant showing a mean of 2 1 days this observation was in line with that reported by wu and huang 2016 and shi et al 2020 the joint probability distributions of the precipitation amount and duration and the precipitation amount and antecedent dry days are shown in fig 4 in the case of rcp4 5 most of the rainfall events which exceed 100 mm are accompanied by long duration fig 4a thus the overall rainfall intensity was not high on the other hand the duration of rainfall events was shorter in rcp8 5 indicating higher rainfall intensities especially so for extreme rainfall events since urban waterlog is often triggered by rainstorms with high rainfall intensity therefore we focused on rainfall events with high precipitation fig 4b it is noted that high precipitation typically coincides with shorter antecedent dry days from fig 4b it can be seen that rainstorms are usually continuous and intense in the study area which is also consistent with the precipitation in the subtropical monsoon region according to rcp8 5 antecedent dry days showed a longer duration and hence more frequent drought events however the antecedent dry days of extreme rainstorm events appeared an exception as the antecedent dry days were relatively small isolated rainstorm mode appeared not changed significantly 3 2 optimum drainage configuration the optimised configuration of gr and gr gi at various degrees of decentralisation are shown in fig 5 each configuration were run through 320 000 iterations to obtain the optimum design a process that took 30 h based on a pc equipped with intel core i5 2 9 ghz dual core cpu and 16 gb of ram fig 5 shows the pipe diameter and the corresponding pipe slope reflected as burial depth of the coupled system the pipe diameters are significantly smaller than that designed for the single grey system in the coupled system the gi area in a fully centralised gr gi cl gr gi accounts for 6 6 of the drainage area while the area in a fully decentralised gr gi dl gr gi accounts for 5 8 of the catchment area a cl gr gi design contained a larger proportion of gis an optimised coupled gr gi system is more attractive than fully gr system in terms of the cost fig 6 specifically it is clear that at the same degree of decentralisation the lcc savings of a fully centralised and decentralised gr gi systems are 18 and 11 compared to the fully gr system at the same degree of decentralisation respectively this observation also shows that gi has the potential of replacing a significant proportion of the centralised layout and lead to significant cost reduction compared to a centralised gr gi the decentralised solution produced an additional 16 2 saving of the lcc this is because of the relatively low cost associated with a highly decentralised layout wang et al 2021c it is also noted that large scale gi construction is typically not required which further compresses the construction investment of the decentralised gr gi therefore an optimised and fully decentralised grey green design is most economical and competitive while satisfying the hydraulic reliability requirement 3 3 hydrological performance the hydrological performances of the optimised strategies were evaluated using a catchment runoff model swmm and included considerations of reducing the outflow peak flow and tss the simulation was calculated for 12 h simulation time since the lcc of the centralised gr is the least ideal it was used as a benchmark strategy to evaluate the systems performance of runoff volume based on the findings of the simulation it is found that with regards to outflow discharge gr gis could achieve reduction ratios of 56 66 fig 7 a in terms of hydrological performance the cl gr gi system scored the best as a result of the configuration of larger scale gi implemented in cl gr gi most of the light rainfalls were effectively retained at source and the outflows were not affected significantly with climate change this result demonstrates that as an annualised index reduction of annual outflow is not sensitive with climate change similar results have been reported by kim et al 2018 and yang and zhang 2021 fig 7b shows that dl gr gi achieved the most effective performance in reducing peak flow with a score between 71 and 85 which is significantly different from the outflow discharge it is worth noting that the performance of decentralised gr was second only to dl gr gi and was significantly higher than cl gr gi the reason is the strong role of decentralised networks in attenuating peak flow bakhshipour et al 2019b wang et al 2021c there is also the added positive characterisrtics of a decentralised layout with multiple outlets which could effectively moderate the impacts of the discharge even when the storage capacity of gi is reached meanwhile there is observed that peak flow reduction in dl gr was generally maintained at 65 for various climate scenarios in comparison the capacity for peak flow reduction in the case of gr gis was highly sensitive to climate change in the case of rcp4 5 the performance of gr gi decreases to certain degrees from stage 1 to stage 2 and the reducing rate of cl gr gi decreases from 50 to 22 this is primarily due to more intense extreme rainfall events being observed during stage 2 the hydrological performance of cl gr gi was less favourable as the gi portion of the drainage system does not perform well during extreme rainfall similar results have been obtained in studies of independence gi performance bae and lee 2020 hu et al 2019 the centralised layout lacks sufficient resilience and gi is usually only used to manage runoff at source when extreme events generate more runoff than the upper retention limit gi basically fails to limit flood peaks zeng et al 2021 in terms of the removal rate of tss the gr gis depicted a rate of more than 60 fig 7c which is largely dependent on the pre retention property of gi on tss in gr gi the removal efficiency of tss is unstable under rcp8 5 in rcp8 5 antecedent dry days are increased significantly potentially results in increased tss accumulation in the catchment consequently the removal efficiency of tss in gr gi would decrease while a larger scale gi is anticipated to retain the tss intriguingly the dl gr gi with lesser extent of gi was observed to show better performance in removing tss plausibly the decentralised spatial topology may have increased the contact opportunities between runoff and gi leading to better retention of tss in the catchment 3 4 limitations and future work certain limitations of this study could be improved and carried out in future work first with the updating of gcms more possibilities for climate change have been proposed which may not be able to be fully covered by a single climate model in the future the ensemble of multi climate models can be considered to provide a varied and reliable prediction of the non stationarity of future climate change and to achieve a more reasonable layout optimisation second the simulation process is time consuming an improvement of the optimisation algorithm could be carried out to refine the search for an optimum solution third this study employed ga optimisation and focused on economic performance in the optimisation which may not be comprehensive and adequate for addressing real life applications with multiple objectives such as more non point source pollution indicators e g nitrogen compounds and chemical oxygen demand more advanced optimisation algorithms could be developed and used to tackle multi objective problems in the future finally the framework presented in this paper considered only bioretention cells as a gi example and may not be universally applicable for gi allocation future applications could include more gi types to support comprehensive and universally applicable decision making considerations 4 conclusions a novel assessment framework for an urban grey green infrastructure system is described in response to climate change the current framework leverages the synergistic effect of gr and gi within a coupled drainage system to produce a superior hydrological performance at the least life cycle cost it highlights the impacts of non stationary time series rather than stationary or event based climate scenarios emphasised in previous studies on gr gi optimisation applying the framework to optimize gr gi in guangzhou china with respect to over 30 years of climate change shows that first compared to the conventional grey infrastructure drainage solution the decentralised and centralised gr gi are economically competitive with a saving of 11 and 18 of the whole life cycle cost compared with that of conventional gr respectively second the degree of decentralisation of gr gi has higher impacts than the areal proportion of gi in gr gi on hydrological and economic performance the less extent of gi in a decentralised gr gi depicted high performance in removing tss in long term time series simulations finally the decentralised gr gi shows superior performance in scenarios with extremely long antecedent dry days therefore in addition to the factors of precipitation and rainfall duration antecedent dry days should be taken into consideration to evaluate the impacts of climate change on optimised gr gi strategies in a more comprehensive way the assessment methods developed in this study have the potential to provide a reference for the planning and decision making of gr gi in high density urban areas the proposed framework can not only assess and optimize gr gi under non stationarity time series but also be a powerful support for stormwater management in response to climate change declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this work was supported by the

15066,silica scaling is a rising concern in forward osmosis membrane based water treatment process the coexistence of ubiquitous organic macromolecules causes complex silica scaling the silica scaling mechanism on the surface of the organic conditioned membrane remains unclear an integrated multi scale thermodynamic and dynamic approach was used in this study to provide in depth insights into the binding effect at the interface between the silica and the organic conditioned membrane at the molecular level sodium alginate sa was used as the model polysaccharide bovine serum albumin bsa and lysozyme lyz were chosen as two oppositely charged proteins the results show that the silica scaling degree of different organic conditioned membranes follows the order lyz bsa sa the binding strength between silica and organic macromolecules and the membrane surface charge are the major factors governing the degree of silica scaling quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation qcm d isothermal titration calorimetry itc and extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo model analyses were conducted to quantify the binding capacity of silica to the organic conditioned membrane the lyz conditioned membrane exhibits the highest affinity for silica adsorption and electrostatic interaction was the main molecular interaction force this study provides fresh insights into how silica and an organic conditioned membrane interact and induce silica scaling providing new information on potential mechanisms and control strategies to prevent membrane scaling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis silica scaling organic conditioning interface interaction thermodynamics mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used in sewage treatment seawater brackish water desalination and industrial wastewater treatment elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 werber et al 2016 silica is the most common inorganic constituent in reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo membrane based water treatment systems mi and elimelech 2013 milne et al 2014 thompson et al 2017 fo is an emerging membrane separation technology that uses the osmotic pressure difference on both sides of the selective membrane for filtration process shaffer et al 2015 winfred rufuss et al 2022 it has attracted wide attention because it does not require external pressure and has low energy consumption without the regeneration of draw solution awad et al 2019 rufuss et al 2022 suwaileh et al 2020 wang et al 2021 fo has promising application prospect in treating wastewater with high fouling potentials such as ro concentrate with high salinity shale gas and coal gasification produced water and seawater desalination awad et al 2019 bell et al 2017 chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 however silica scaling in fo system has arouse serious concerns and a series of studies have reported the situation in the fo application in actual water treatment scenarios bell et al 2017 chen et al 2016 kim et al 2020 li et al 2012 nawaz et al 2021 for instance the authors have found that colloidal silica might cause severe scaling on the fo membrane surface treating oil and gas produced water and the silica fouling layer still existed even after physical and chemical cleaning bell et al 2017 kim et al 2020 nawaz et al 2021 therefore silica scaling has been recognized as an important problem in treating water or wastewater via fo applications of which the underlying scaling mechanism needs to be unraveled inorganic silica and organic foulants commonly coexist in the feedwaters of membrane based wastewater treatment systems for example wastewater generally contains various organic substances e g polysaccharides proteins and humic acids which the coexistence of organic foulants has a more significant impact on silica scaling and leads to more complex membrane fouling li et al 2021 liu and mi 2012 2014 lu et al 2020 quay et al 2018 wang et al 2020 however these studies on the membrane fouling between silica and organic matter coexisted in the feed solution organic fouling often occurs prior to inorganic scaling in the membrane system gorzalski and coronell 2014 lu et al 2020 thompson et al 2012 yang et al 2008 even if organics exist in the solution they are quickly adsorbed on the membrane surface changing the membrane s physical and chemical properties and transforming it into an organic conditioned membrane liu and mi 2014 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2016 because membrane fouling is a foulant foulant interaction on the membrane surface the organic conditioned membrane pose a remarkable impact on the scaling behavior liu and mi 2014 lu et al 2020 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 therefore the interactions between silica and organic matter in the feed solution could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface however there is limited information on silica organic interaction and scaling on the fo membrane after organic conditioning in the previous researches evaluating gypsum scaling it was found that the scaling behavior of gypsum when organic substances e g sodium alginate and gypsum co existed in feed solution was different from that after the membrane was conditioned by organic substances liu and mi 2012 2014 wang et al 2016 compared with the coexistence one the properties of the conditioned membrane were changed which provided a nucleation site for gypsum crystallization and aggravated gypsum scaling the organic matter conditioning changes the mechanism of gypsum scaling from homogeneous crystallization to heterogeneous crystallization liu and mi 2012 2014 similarly organics affect the silica scaling behaviors in two different ways 1 organics directly interact with silica and form complexes in feed solutions which changes the physicochemical surface properties of silica and affects silica scaling for example silica can promote the formation of a large number of bovine serum albumin bsa aggregation and controls silica particles size accelerating membrane scaling coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 in this mode silica and organic matter have interactions e g adsorption and polymerization in solution 2 organics firstly adsorb on the membrane surface changing the surface properties of membrane roughness charge hydrophobicity etc thus affecting the behavior of silica scaling in comparison with the former way silica deposits polymerizes and grows directly on the conditioned membrane surface however to the best of our knowledge an in depth interface analysis of the binding between silica and organic substances on the organic conditioned membrane during fo process at the molecular level has not been reported in the literature this paper investigates the influence of organic conditioning of an fo membrane on silica scaling and the interface mechanism of silica and typical organics membrane at the molecular level sodium alginate sa was used as the model polysaccharide bsa and lysozyme lyz were chosen as two oppositely charged proteins several silica scaling tests and fouling layer characterization of the organic matter conditioned membranes are carried out a multi scale method based on dynamics and thermodynamics is established to provide in depth insights into the underlying mechanism of silica scaling at the molecular level this study deepens the understanding of the role of physicochemical properties of the membrane interface in silica scaling and highlights the interaction between silica and organic matter at the membrane interface to guide the development of targeted control strategies for silica scaling during fo 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals the fo membrane used in this study was a commercial polyamide thin film composite pa tfc membrane toray chemical korea inc south korea composed of a thin polyamide active layer and a polysulfone supporting layer before the experiments the membrane was immersed in deionized water for 24 h sodium chloride nacl with purity of analytical grade was purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china ludox hs 40 silica colloids 40 wt particle size 12 nm used to induce scaling were provided by sigma aldrich inc usa sa and bsa were purchased from sigma aldrich inc usa and lyz was purchased from mclean biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china three polysaccharides and proteins with opposite charges at near neutral ph were used as typical organic macromolecular substances sa hydrophilic negatively charged bsa hydrophobic negatively charged and lyz hydrophobic positively charged a stock solution 1 g l was prepared by dissolving each organic macromolecular substance into deionized water and storing it at 4 c the silica suspension was sonicated for 10 min to ensure complete dispersion before adding it to the feed solution the deionized water used in the experiment was obtained from a milli q ultrapure water purification system millipore 18 2 mω cm 2 2 experimental set up the diagram of the laboratory fo set up is shown in figure s1 which was previously used for an fo membrane fouling study zhu et al 2021 it was composed of two plexiglass plates the depressions in the middle of the plexiglass plates were the fs and draw solution ds chambers the membrane was sandwiched between the two chambers with an effective membrane area of 40 cm2 the fo membrane and plexiglass plate were separated by a silicone pad the active layer feed solution al fs mode was employed i e the active layer of the membrane was in contact with the fs while the supporting layer was in contact with the ds the fs and ds were pumped into the chambers by two peristaltic pumps in crossflow at the same volumetric flow rate of 8 5 cm s the ds stock bottle was placed on an electronic balance connected to a computer for the real time monitoring of the ds mass change to calculate the water flux 2 3 protocols of membrane fouling and scaling experiments silica 1 g l sa 0 2 g l bsa 0 2 g l and lyz 0 2 g l solutions were used as the fss all fss contained 20 mm nacl as background electrolytes to maintain the same ionic strength the concentration of silica in this study was set to be 1 g l similar to the values reported in previous studies to accelerate membrane fouling boo et al 2012 kim et al 2020 motsa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 a 1 m nacl solution was adopted as the ds the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 1 the experimental protocols had the following steps 1 before the fouling experiments a virgin membrane was installed and deionized water was used as the fs and ds with a rate of 17 cm s for 1 h 2 the fs and ds were replaced with the 20 mm nacl background solution and 1 m nacl solution respectively and the volumetric flow rate was adjusted to 8 5 cm s to obtain a stable initial membrane flux 3 the fs was replaced with the organic solution sa bsa lyz and the experiment with the organic conditioned membrane was conducted for 24 h 4 subsequently the fs was replaced with the silica scaling solution the ds was replaced with a new nacl solution then the silica scaling experiment was carried out for another 24 h the volumetric flow rates of the fs and ds were maintained at 8 5 cm s throughout the experiment a virgin membrane was used in each group of experiments and each set of experiments was repeated since the ds was continuously diluted during the experiments a baseline test using a background electrolyte solution as the fs was implemented following the above steps to characterize the contribution of membrane fouling to the water flux decline unless otherwise stated the organic conditioning and scaling procedures were performed with the active layer facing the fs 2 4 membrane characterization the membrane samples collected at the end of the operation were pretreated in a vacuum freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan at 50 for 24 h for further analyses the surface morphology and roughness of the membrane were observed by sem geminisem 500 zeiss germany and atomic force microscope afm flexafm nanosurf switzerland respectively the elemental composition of membrane surface were detected by xps phi quantera ⅱ ulvac phi inc japan the membrane surface charge was measured by a solid surface zeta potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria the contact angle was determined by a contact angle analyzer oca 20 dataphysics germany using the sessile drop method with deionized water 30 and 30 humidity 2 5 qcm d measurement qcm d has been widely used for kinetic analysis and microscopic mechanism analysis because it can characterize the trace interactions between different substances rathinam et al 2019 wang et al 2017 we used qcm d q sense ab gothenburg sweden to evaluate the degree of binding between the silica and the membrane coated with different organic a background electrolyte solution 20 mm nacl three organic solutions 0 2 g l sa bsa lyz with 20 mm nacl and an inorganic solution 1 g l silica with 20 mm nacl were used for qcm d measurement respectively the testing steps were as follows 1 we added the background electrolyte solution to rinse the system s pipes and establish a stable baseline of the frequency shift f hz and energy dissipation change d 2 the organic solution sa bsa lyz was added to adhere to the sensor surface to simulate an organic molecule conditioned membrane surface adsorption equilibrium was assumed when f and d stabilized 3 once the organic conditioned layer was stable on the membrane surface the background electrolyte solution was refilled to remove the unattached organics 4 more silica solution was added until a new equilibrium was achieved in addition a blank group in which the silica solution was pumped into the system after the rinse step was used to measure the adhesion mass of silica on the sensor with no organics the cross flow rate in the qcm d experiments was fixed at 0 1 ml min at the end the system was rinsed with di water and a 2 sds solution for 10 min the detailed cleaning protocols of the sensor crystals are described in the supporting information the adsorbed mass of organic matter and silica on the qcm d sensor δm is correlated to the resonance frequency change δf according to the sauerbrey equation 1 δ m c δ f n where δm is the adsorbed mass of the crystal surface ng cm2 f is the measured frequency shift hz c is the mass sensitivity constant 17 7 ng cm2 hz at f 4 95 mhz and n is the overtone number n 3 in this study 2 6 itc measurements itc microcal itc200 ge usa was utilized to quantify the bonding strength between the silica and different organic molecules all solutions in the itc thermodynamic analysis were placed in a tris hcl buffer solution ph 7 0 three organic solutions 9 0 g l sa bsa lyz and an inorganic silica solution 10 0 g l silica were used for testing to obtain a robust exothermic signal before the test the titration arm was cleaned with ultrapure water and methanol for 15 min and the titration tank was flushed with ultrapure water the testing parameters are defined in the microcal itc200 software including the reaction temperature 25 the basic heat change value monitored by the instrument 5 μcal s and the rotation speed of the titration arm 750 rpm the first titrant was injected at 60 s with a volume of 0 4 μl and a duration of 1 s the following titrants were injected every 120 s with a volume of 2 μl and a duration of 4 s a total of 20 liquid injections were conducted for each test the dissociation constant k d was calculated by the software to indicate the binding strength of the two substances the thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the itc

tension properties γ l lw γ l and γ l 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of silica scaling on flux decline for different organic substances the normalized water flux of the fo membranes showed a slight decline over 24 h for the three organic substances fig s2 generally the main reason for the decrease in water flux of the baseline solution is the internal concentration polarization icp liu and mi 2012 mi and elimelech 2010 as water permeates and dilutes the draw solution at the interface between the supporting layer and active layer the driving force for water permeation and water flux is significantly reduced because of icp several previous studies revealed that icp accounts for about 80 of water flux reduction in the fo process gray et al 2006 tang et al 2010 compared to the baseline and sa solution the water flux decreased faster 10 for the bsa and lyz solutions fig s2 it can be deduced that a layer of stable organic macromolecules had formed on the membrane surface the normalized water flux decline of the fo membranes under silica scaling for the different organic substances is presented in fig 1 the membrane fouling rates differed for the different substances the normalized water flux of the lyz conditioned membrane was about 20 lower than the baseline group indicating an interaction between the silica and lyz on the membrane surface in contrast the organic conditioning by sa had a negligible impact on the scaling potential the declining trend was similar to that of the baseline group some previous studies showed that silica and sa had no obvious synergistic effect and even found that the presence of sa would reduce silica scaling higgin et al 2010 motsa et al 2015 for example higgin et al observed that the interaction between silica and sodium alginate resulted in less fouling than that observed when silica alone existed in solution higgin et al 2010 in summary the silica scaling degree of the membranes followed the order lyz bsa sa interestingly the silica scaling phenomenon on the membrane after organic conditioning was different from gypsum scaling reported in the literature indicating different mechanisms for silica scaling and gypsum scaling liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 the main mechanism is that the carboxyl groups of sa bind strongly with ca2 resulting in a complex compound on the membrane surface and promoting gypsum crystallization liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 nevertheless the results of silica scaling in this study show that the protein substances bsa and lyz changed the surface properties of the membrane and accelerated silica scaling whereas sa had no significant effect on silica scaling the interactions between silica and organic matter in the feed solution could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface fig s3 shows the water flux decline with organics and silica coexisting in feed solution it can be seen that bsa and silica caused more serious membrane fouling consistent with the previous studies coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 while in terms of the organic conditioned membranes lyz conditioned membrane had more serious silica scaling previous studies have shown that membrane fouling was more severe when silica and protein i e bsa were present in the solution than when silica and sa ha coexisted ma et al 2019 qin et al 2017 this finding indicates that silica may have a stronger interaction with protein substances therefore the difference in the silica scaling behavior depends largely on the properties of the organic molecules however the underlying mechanism must be investigated 3 2 membrane surface morphology fig 2 a d shows the sem images of the virgin membrane and the membranes preconditioned by sa bsa and lyz respectively the different organics formed different structures on the fo membranes fig 2b d fig 2e h shows the sem images of silica scaling on the virgin membrane and the other conditioned membranes the smooth spherical deposits on the membrane in fig 2e are silica particles similarly silica particles are observed in fig 2f h indicating the occurrence of silica scaling on the three organic conditioned membranes the comparison with fig 2f reveals that the unstable sa layer was washed away by the fs in the scaling experiment leaving only part of the stable sa layer after silica scaling however silica formed large aggregates on top of the bsa and lyz conditioned membranes these are partially embedded in the organic matrix these results show that the organic molecules on the membrane surface have a significant impact on silica scaling xps was used to analyze the elemental composition of the silica fouling layer fig 3 a the ratios of o c and si c indicate the abundance of organic matter sa bsa lyz and silica in the fouling layer respectively as shown in fig 3a the virgin membrane has the lowest ratios of o c 4 47 and si c 0 98 whereas the lyz conditioned membrane has the highest ratios of o c 8 4 and si c 2 05 demonstrating that the fouling layer on the lyz conditioned membrane contains the highest amount of silica the si peaks in fig s5 show that the main forms of silica are si o 103 0 ev and sio2 103 8 ev lu et al 2015 yin et al 2021 the ratios of cc co and cooh are the lowest and the ratio of si o is the highest in the silica scaling layer of the lyz conditioned membrane therefore the xps results indicate that the chemical characteristics of organic matter on the membrane surface significantly affect the silica scaling behavior and the lyz conditioned membrane exhibited more significant silica scaling fig 3b displays the surface root mean square roughness of the virgin membrane and different groups of the fouled membranes obtained by afm the surface roughness of the fouled membrane is 1 10 times higher than that of the virgin membrane 22 9 nm the influence of fouling depends on the foulants properties in general the surface roughness of the membrane fouled by organic matter and silica was greater than that fouled by either organic matter or silica li et al 2021 quay et al 2018 the reason is that the organic conditioned membrane surface was covered with an uneven silica fouling layer resulting in an increase in the peak and valley difference and the roughness the root mean square roughness after sequential fouling of lyz and silica was the largest 243 5 nm corresponding to the highest silica deposition the results of the morphology and elemental analysis of the membrane surface by sem afm and xps indicate that the silica scaling behavior is closely related to the properties of the organic matter on the membrane surface next we analyze the charge and hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 3 3 membrane surface properties fig 4 shows the zeta potential and contact angle of the virgin membrane and different groups of fouled membranes the surfaces of sa bsa and silica were negatively charged under neutral conditions whereas the surface of lyz was positively charged the isoelectric point of bsa is 4 7 4 9 and that of lyz is 10 4 nakamura and matsumoto 2006 wang and tang 2011 fig 4a shows that the negative charges were significantly higher on the surface of the sa and bsa conditioned membranes than on the virgin membrane indicating the deposition of the two substances on the membrane surface in general the zeta potential was even higher when silica was deposited on the organic conditioned membranes the sa conditioned membrane had the largest negative potential thus the negatively charged silica was subject to the most significant electrostatic repulsion and the deposition potential and fouling degree were the lowest lu and huang 2019 tong et al 2017 in contrast the negative potential of the lyz conditioned membrane was the smallest the bonding between silica and lyz was least affected by the electrostatic action hence the deposition amount and fouling degree were the largest indicating that the surface charge of the organic matter affected the degree of silica scaling fig 4b compares the contact angle of the different groups of membranes after the attachment of organic matter the membrane surface became more hydrophobic and the contact angle was 20 80 higher than for the virgin membrane however after silica scaling on the organic conditioned membranes the membrane surface became hydrophilic again with contact angles of 40 60 the difference in the contact angle between the lyz conditions membrane and the membrane under silica scaling was the highest ranging from 90 to 40 since silica is hydrophilic it can be concluded that silica was attached to the organic conditioned membrane and the amount of adhesion was the largest for the lyz conditioned membrane qin et al 2017 tong et al 2017 3 4 qcm d measurements of silica adsorption on membranes conditioned membranes by different organics the adsorption of organic matter on the membrane changes the membrane s surface properties affecting the binding effect with silica the results of qcm d measurements can offer insights into the adsorption of organic matter on the membrane and the interaction between organic matter and silica ma et al 2019 rathinam et al 2019 fig 5 shows that the adsorption of organic matter stage ii and silica stage iv on the sensor surface resulted in different deposition frequency f and dissipation d values the f remained nearly unchanged throughout the process and was the highest fig 5a implying that the silica deposition was minimal without organic conditioning fig 5b c shows that the frequency f of the organic conditioned membranes decreased to varying degrees after the silica solution was injected indicating that silica was adsorbed on the sensor surface the f of the lyz conditioned membrane had the maximum reduction followed by bsa and sa the adsorbed mass of silica and organic matter on sensors are shown in fig 5e in the absence of organic conditioning the amount of deposited silica on sensor surface was 22 4 ng cm2 when sensor surface was organic conditioned with sa bsa and lyz the adsorbed silica was increased significantly to 45 3 1037 8 and 1416 9 ng cm2 respectively the silica adsorption studies yielded similar results to the previous study in which calcium ions exhibited higher adsorption on organic adhesion layers liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore the maximum silica adsorption occurred on the surface of the lyz conditioned membrane and a strong interaction was observed between lyz and silica fig 5f compares the calculated d f at the adsorption equilibrium stage for different organic layers to analyze the structure of the adsorbed layer after organic matter adsorption sa showed a higher d f than bsa and lyz possibly because sa is more hydrophilic resulting in less adsorption of sa when silica was deposited on the organic conditioned membrane the d and f were lower especially for the lyz and bsa conditioned membranes indicating a dense and rigid adsorption layer liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 in addition f t can be used to determine the deposition rate of foulants lyz conditioned membrane showed the shortest time to reach the maximum value of f indicating that lyz conditioned membrane induced the highest silica deposition rate and could absorb more silica the binding effects of silica with organic matter followed the order lyz bsa sa the same as the ranking of the water flux decline this result confirms the strong interaction between silica and protein substances reported in the literature 3 5 itc results of the binding strength between silica and organic matter the scaling behavior of the organic molecules interacting with silica on the membrane surface was investigated at the microscopic level using by qcm d itc tests provides information on the interaction of silica with organic substances and can be used to quantify the binding strength between silica and organic matter using the heat release value from the perspective of thermodynamics the titration heat curve obtained by the itc measurements are presented in fig 6 the thermodynamic parameters for the binding between silica and sa bsa lyz can provide further details table 1 first the gibbs free energy g rt ln k of the three organic compounds combined with silica is negative indicating that the binding reaction between the organic matter and silica is feasible in thermodynamics secondly the binding enthalpy h of bsa 3 42 kj mol and lyz 2 32 kj mol with silica is negative indicating that their reactions with silica are exothermic binding processes and the complex is relatively stable however the binding enthalpy between sa and silica is positive δh 0 implying an endothermic binding and an unstable complexation since δs 0 tδs δh and δg 0 the binding reaction is proven an entropy driven process and electrostatic interaction is the main driving force loosli et al 2015 makowska et al 2016 compared with bsa lyz there is a large amount of carboxyl groups on the surface of sa which could generate electrostatic repulsion and weak binding with silica the weak electrostatic interaction between sa and silica may cause a small value of δh the result is also consistent with previous reported literature such as tio2 sa cu and peptide and amino acids interaction huang et al 2017 loosli et al 2015 makowska et al 2016 by calculating tδs via the equation of tδs δh δg the positive entropy changes in all reactions δs 98 09 63 37 96 18 j mol k suggest that the binding increases the structural disorder of the complex due to the displacement of solvating water molecules from coordination sites by inner sphere complexation alam et al 2018 huang et al 2017 the positive enthalpy and entropy values could be contributed by the dehydration reaction resulting from the release of coordinated water molecules upon binding of the sa to the silica alam et al 2018 huang et al 2017 hydrophilic sa silica is easy to combine with water and hydrogen bond is formed between silica and sa in our previous study we have reported that silica reacts with the carboxyl group of humic acid through hydrogen bonding li et al 2021 the negative enthalpy of interaction between bsa lyz and silica δh 0 and positive entropy δs 0 indicates that the process was driven more easily reactive than sa and silica based on the correlation between the thermodynamic parameters and interaction forces the reaction between lyz bsa sa and silica was dominated by the electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds ross and subramanian 1981 these results are consistent with the thermodynamic interaction between other substances such as ha ca sa tio2 and eps cu chen et al 2020 sheng et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore the reaction between lyz bsa and silica is dominated by the electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds and the binding strength is larger than the interaction between sa and silica third the binding constant k of lyz and silica 0 27 103 l mol is significantly greater than that of sa 0 07 103 l mol and bsa 0 01 103 l mol indicating that the binding strength of lyz and silica by the electrostatic force is stronger than that of sa and bsa therefore lyz and silica have a stronger thermodynamic binding effect and the electrostatic interaction is the dominant force 3 6 xdlvo results for the interaction energy between silica and the organic conditioned membranes the core of this study is to reveal the interaction between organic conditioned membrane and silica from the perspective of membrane interface therefore the organic foulants on the conditioned membrane can be used to measure the contact angle and calculate the surface energy which is close to the real condition in the membrane fouling experiment in some studies of membrane fouling using xdlvo theory the conditioned modified membrane was used to measure surface energy when analyzing the interaction between membrane interface foulants and foulants foulants tong et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 the interaction energy between the silica and the different organic conditioned membranes was calculated based on the xdlvo theory to obtain further insights into the membrane fouling mechanism chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 the contact angles of the three organic conditioned membranes were measured using water diiodomethane and formamide as testing solutions the results are shown in table s1 the surface energy of water diiodomethane and formamide are listed in table s2 they were used to calculate the surface energy of the three organic conditioned membranes using the young dupré equation eq 10 table 2 lists the surface energy and interaction energy between silica and the three organic conditioned membranes there are substantial differences in the interfacial energy between the membranes conditioned by different organics the lw component is similar for the sa and bsa conditioned membranes 23 mj m2 but is 33 mj m2 for the lyz conditioned membrane suggesting that the latter is more prone to intermolecular interaction with regard to the lewis acid base component the order of γ is lyz bsa sa while the order of γ is sa bsa lyz the values of γ and γ reflect the binding ability of the conditioned membrane surface with different acid base substances the total surface energy γ which indicates the potential of interaction between the membrane interface and other substances had an order of lyz bsa sa the same as that of the water flux decline fig 1b section 3 1 regarding to the interaction energy with silica the values of δ g h 0 ab were slightly difference for the three conditioned membranes but the absolute value of δ g h 0 lw of the lyz conditioned membrane was significantly larger than that of the sa and bsa conditioned membranes showing that the scaling potential of the lyz conditioned membrane was the highest based on the intermolecular force fig 7 displays the interaction energy between silica and the virgin or organic conditioned membranes and the distance h based on the xdlvo theory the acid base interaction and intermolecular interaction contribute the most to the total interaction energy when the distance between the silica particles and membrane surface h is small as h increases the contribution of the acid base interaction decreases and the intermolecular interaction and electrostatic interaction become the main factors affecting the total interaction energy the green line in fig 7 represents the total interaction energy between silica and the membrane the inset in fig 7 shows that the total interaction energy changes with an increase in h and an inflection point occurs in the curve the total interaction energy at the inflection point reflects the interaction ability between silica and the membrane chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the lower the inflection point value table 3 the more likely the interaction between the silica and the membrane is the result indicates that the lyz conditioned membrane has a higher propensity to interact with silica because it has the lowest electrostatic interaction energy e el 45 011 mj m2 and the lowest total interaction energy e tot 49 094 mj m2 and e max tot 2 182 mj m2 the order of intermolecular interaction energy and electrostatic interaction energy between silica and the membrane table 3 is consistent with the order of the fouling degree indicating that the interaction intensity between silica and the organic conditioned membranes mainly depends on two factors since the surface of silica is negatively charged the intermolecular interaction energy and electrostatic interaction energy of the sa conditioned membrane were the highest among the organic conditioned membranes accounting for its smaller probability to interact with silica lu and huang 2019 qin et al 2017 tong et al 2017 in summary the lyz conditioned membrane showed a higher potential to interact with silica particles due to the intermolecular and electrostatic interactions 3 7 proposed silica scaling mechanisms this study proved that organic conditioning of the membrane affected the silica scaling behavior during fo the organic conditioned membranes induced a higher water flux declines than the virgin membrane largely because of silica scaling the primary reason is the cake enhanced osmotic pressure cecp mechanism due to the prevention of back diffusion of silica species and other solutes resulting in silica accumulation on the membrane surface boo et al 2012 liu and mi 2014 mi and elimelech 2010 wang et al 2016 notably the degree of silica scaling on the organic conditioned membrane depended on the type and characteristic of foulants the lyz conditioned membrane experienced the highest scaling tendency than membranes conditioned with bsa and sa the binding strength between silica and the organic macromolecules and the membrane surface charge were the dominant factors affecting silica scaling on the organic conditioned membranes the negative charge of the lyz conditioned membrane surface was significantly lower owing to the positive charge of lyz at a neutral ph in addition due to the strong interaction between amino groups and amino groups and silicic acid it is found that positively charged peptides and proteins such as poly lysine and lysozyme contribute to the polymerization and precipitation of silica coradin et al 2003 coradin et al 2002 the electrostatic attraction between lyz and the negatively charged silica likely promoted silica precipitation which was consistent with previous studies coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 the positively charged membrane surfaces and the positively charged groups significantly accelerated silica scaling whereas a more negative membrane surface charge led to reduced scaling in ro lu and huang 2019 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 however the interaction mechanism between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter in the feed solution demonstrating that the bsa and silica scaling were attributed to the enhanced protein aggregation on the membrane surface coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 these molecular level interactions were used to explain the roles of organic conditioned membranes in affecting silica scaling lyz exhibited the highest affinity for silica binding and the binding reaction was more favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically the interfacial adhesion energy of at the membrane silica and organic macromolecule silica interface proved that the deposition of lyz enhanced the interaction energy which was also confirmed by the xdlvo model the intermolecular and electrostatic interactions were the dominant molecular interaction force thus the multiscale microanalysis indicated that silica was attracted by the less negatively charged membrane surface enhancing the molecular interaction the results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism for the impact of the membrane surface charge on silica scaling is accurate 4 conclusions the interface interaction mechanisms between silica and typical organics in organic conditioned fo membranes were revealed by molecular level analysis silica scaling following membrane preconditioning with organic matter sa bsa and lyz during fo was characterized by complex interactions between the silica membrane and the attached organic matter the results suggested that the water flux decline caused by silica scaling in the lyz conditioned membrane 20 decline was greater than that of the bsa 10 decline or sa 5 decline conditioned membrane the binding strength between silica and organic matter and the membrane surface charge were the dominant factors governing the degree of silica scaling on the organic conditioned membrane surface the degree of silica scaling was the highest on the lyz conditioned membrane because silica adsorption occurred due to electrostatic interaction the qcm d itc xdlvo microscopic results indicated that the main binding interaction between silica and the three organic compounds was intermolecular and electrostatic interactions and the order of the interaction intensity was lyz bsa sa this study provides fresh insights into how silica and organic conditioned membranes interact

15066,silica scaling is a rising concern in forward osmosis membrane based water treatment process the coexistence of ubiquitous organic macromolecules causes complex silica scaling the silica scaling mechanism on the surface of the organic conditioned membrane remains unclear an integrated multi scale thermodynamic and dynamic approach was used in this study to provide in depth insights into the

lysozyme lyz were chosen as two oppositely charged proteins the results show that the silica scaling degree of different organic conditioned membranes follows the order lyz bsa sa the binding strength

titration calorimetry itc and extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo model analyses were conducted to quantify the binding capacity of silica to the organic conditioned membrane the lyz conditioned membrane exhibits the highest affinity for silica adsorption and electrostatic interaction was the main molecular interaction force this study provides fresh insights into how silica and an organic conditioned membrane interact and induce silica scaling providing new information on potential mechanisms and control strategies to prevent membrane scaling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords forward osmosis silica scaling organic conditioning interface interaction thermodynamics mechanism data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction membrane technology has been widely used in sewage treatment seawater brackish water desalination and industrial wastewater treatment elimelech and phillip 2011 shannon et al 2008 werber et al 2016 silica is the most common inorganic constituent in reverse osmosis ro and forward osmosis fo membrane based water treatment systems mi and elimelech 2013 milne et al 2014 thompson et al 2017 fo is an emerging membrane separation technology that uses the osmotic pressure difference on both sides of the selective membrane for filtration process shaffer et al 2015 winfred rufuss et al 2022 it has attracted wide attention because it does not require external pressure and has low energy consumption without the regeneration of draw solution awad et al 2019 rufuss et al 2022 suwaileh et al 2020 wang et al 2021 fo has promising application prospect in treating wastewater with high fouling potentials such as ro concentrate with high salinity shale gas and coal gasification produced water and seawater desalination awad et al 2019 bell et al 2017 chen et al 2016 li et al 2012 however silica scaling in fo system has arouse serious concerns and a series of studies have reported the situation in the fo application in actual water treatment scenarios bell et al 2017 chen et al 2016 kim et al 2020 li et al 2012 nawaz et al 2021 for instance the authors have found that colloidal silica might cause severe scaling on the fo membrane surface treating oil and gas produced water and the silica fouling layer still existed even after physical and chemical cleaning bell et al 2017 kim et al 2020 nawaz et al 2021 therefore silica scaling has been recognized as an important problem in treating water or wastewater via fo applications of which the underlying scaling mechanism needs to be unraveled inorganic silica and organic foulants commonly coexist in the feedwaters of membrane based wastewater treatment systems for example wastewater generally contains various organic substances e g polysaccharides proteins and humic acids which the coexistence of organic foulants has a more significant impact on silica scaling and leads to more complex membrane fouling li et al 2021 liu and mi 2012 2014 lu et al 2020 quay et al 2018 wang et al 2020 however these studies on the membrane fouling between silica and organic matter coexisted in the feed solution organic fouling often occurs prior to inorganic scaling in the membrane system gorzalski and coronell 2014 lu et al 2020 thompson et al 2012 yang et al 2008 even if organics exist in the solution they are quickly adsorbed on the membrane surface changing the membrane s physical and chemical properties and transforming it into an organic conditioned membrane liu and mi 2014 lu et al 2020 wang et al 2016 because membrane fouling is a foulant foulant interaction on the membrane surface the organic conditioned membrane pose a remarkable impact on the scaling behavior liu and mi 2014 lu et al 2020 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 therefore the interactions between silica and organic matter in the feed solution could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface however there is limited information on silica organic interaction and scaling on the fo membrane after organic conditioning in the previous researches evaluating gypsum scaling it was found that the scaling behavior of gypsum when organic substances e g sodium alginate and gypsum co existed in feed solution was different from that after the membrane was conditioned by organic substances liu and mi 2012 2014 wang et al 2016 compared with the coexistence one the properties of the conditioned membrane were changed which provided a nucleation site for gypsum crystallization and aggravated gypsum scaling the organic matter conditioning changes the mechanism of gypsum scaling from homogeneous crystallization to heterogeneous crystallization liu and mi 2012 2014 similarly organics affect the silica scaling behaviors in two different ways 1 organics directly interact with silica and form complexes in feed solutions which changes the physicochemical surface properties of silica and affects silica scaling for example silica can promote the formation of a large number of bovine serum albumin bsa aggregation and controls silica particles size accelerating membrane scaling coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 in this mode silica and organic matter have interactions e g adsorption and polymerization in solution 2 organics firstly adsorb on the membrane surface changing the surface properties of membrane roughness charge hydrophobicity etc thus affecting the behavior of silica scaling in comparison with the former way silica deposits polymerizes and grows directly on the conditioned membrane surface however to the best of our knowledge an in depth interface analysis of the binding between silica and organic substances on the organic conditioned membrane during fo process at the molecular level has not been reported in the literature this paper investigates the influence of organic conditioning of an fo membrane on silica scaling and the interface mechanism of silica and typical organics membrane at the molecular level sodium alginate sa was used as the model polysaccharide bsa and lysozyme lyz were chosen as two oppositely charged proteins several silica scaling tests and fouling layer characterization of the organic matter conditioned membranes are carried out a multi scale method based on dynamics and thermodynamics is established to provide in depth insights into the underlying mechanism of silica scaling at the molecular level this study deepens the understanding of the role of physicochemical properties of the membrane interface in silica scaling and highlights the interaction between silica and organic matter at the membrane interface to guide the development of targeted control strategies for silica scaling during fo 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane and chemicals the fo membrane used in this study was a commercial polyamide thin film composite pa tfc membrane toray chemical korea inc south korea composed of a thin polyamide

sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china ludox hs 40 silica colloids 40 wt particle size 12 nm used to induce scaling were provided by sigma aldrich inc usa sa and bsa were purchased from sigma aldrich inc usa and lyz was purchased from mclean biochemical technology co ltd shanghai china three polysaccharides and proteins with opposite charges at near neutral ph were used as typical organic macromolecular substances sa hydrophilic negatively charged bsa hydrophobic negatively charged and lyz hydrophobic positively charged a stock solution 1 g l was prepared by dissolving each organic macromolecular substance into deionized water and storing it at 4 c the silica suspension was sonicated for 10 min to ensure complete dispersion before adding it to the feed solution the deionized water used in the experiment was obtained from a milli q ultrapure water purification system millipore 18 2 mω cm 2 2 experimental set up the diagram of the laboratory fo set up is shown in figure s1 which was previously used for an fo membrane fouling study zhu et al 2021 it was composed of two plexiglass plates the depressions in the middle of the plexiglass plates were the fs and draw solution ds chambers the membrane was sandwiched between the two chambers with an effective membrane area of 40 cm2 the fo membrane and plexiglass plate were separated by a silicone pad the active layer feed solution al fs mode was employed i e the active layer of the membrane was in contact with the fs while the supporting layer was in contact with the ds the fs and ds were pumped into the chambers by two peristaltic pumps in crossflow at the same volumetric flow rate of 8 5 cm s the ds stock bottle was placed on an electronic balance connected to a computer for the real time monitoring of the ds mass change to calculate the water flux 2 3 protocols of membrane fouling and scaling experiments silica 1 g l sa 0 2 g l bsa 0 2 g l and lyz 0 2 g l solutions were used as the fss all fss contained 20 mm nacl as background electrolytes to maintain the same ionic strength the concentration of silica in this study was set to be 1 g l similar to the values reported in previous studies to accelerate membrane fouling boo et al 2012 kim et al 2020 motsa et al 2015 nguyen et al 2019 a 1 m nacl solution was adopted as the ds the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 1 the experimental protocols had the following steps 1 before the fouling experiments a virgin membrane was installed and deionized water was used as the fs and ds with a rate of 17 cm s for 1 h 2 the fs and ds were replaced with the 20 mm nacl background solution and 1 m nacl solution respectively and the volumetric flow rate was adjusted to 8 5 cm s to obtain a stable initial membrane flux 3 the fs was replaced with the organic solution sa bsa lyz and the experiment with the organic conditioned membrane was conducted for 24 h 4 subsequently the fs was replaced with the silica scaling solution the ds was replaced with a new nacl solution then the silica scaling experiment was carried out for another 24 h the volumetric flow rates of the fs and ds were maintained at 8 5 cm s throughout the experiment a virgin membrane was used in each group of experiments and each set of experiments was repeated since the ds was continuously diluted during the experiments a baseline test using a background electrolyte solution as the fs was implemented following the above steps to characterize the contribution of membrane fouling to the water flux decline unless otherwise stated the organic conditioning and scaling procedures were performed with the active layer facing the fs 2 4 membrane characterization the membrane samples collected at the end of the operation were pretreated in a vacuum freeze dryer fdu 1110 eyela japan at

measurement qcm d has been widely used for kinetic analysis and microscopic mechanism analysis because it can characterize the trace interactions between different substances rathinam et al 2019 wang et al 2017 we used qcm d q sense ab gothenburg sweden to evaluate the degree of binding between the silica and the membrane coated with different organic a background electrolyte solution 20 mm nacl three organic solutions 0 2 g l sa bsa lyz with 20 mm nacl and an inorganic solution 1 g l silica with 20 mm nacl were used for qcm d measurement respectively the testing steps were as follows 1 we added the background electrolyte solution to rinse the system s pipes and establish a stable baseline of the frequency shift f hz and energy dissipation change d 2 the organic solution sa bsa lyz was added to adhere to the sensor surface to simulate an organic molecule conditioned membrane surface adsorption equilibrium was assumed when f and d stabilized 3 once the organic conditioned layer was stable on the membrane surface the background electrolyte solution was refilled to remove the unattached organics 4 more silica solution was added until a new equilibrium was achieved in addition a blank group in which the silica solution was pumped into the system after the rinse step was used to measure the adhesion mass of silica on the sensor with no organics the cross flow rate in the qcm d experiments was fixed at 0 1 ml min at the end the system was rinsed with di water and a 2 sds solution for 10 min the detailed cleaning protocols of the sensor crystals are described in the

were placed in a tris hcl buffer solution ph 7 0 three organic solutions 9 0 g l sa bsa lyz and an inorganic silica solution 10 0 g l silica were used for testing to obtain a robust exothermic signal before the test the titration arm was cleaned with ultrapure water and methanol for 15 min and the titration tank was flushed with ultrapure water the testing parameters are defined in the microcal itc200 software including the reaction temperature 25 the basic heat change value monitored by the instrument 5 μcal s and the rotation speed of the titration arm 750 rpm the first titrant was injected at 60 s with a volume of 0 4 μl and a duration of 1 s the following titrants were injected every 120 s with a volume of 2 μl and a duration of 4 s a total of 20 liquid injections were conducted for each test the dissociation constant k d was calculated by the software to indicate the binding strength of the two substances the thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the itc

slight decline over 24 h for the three organic substances fig s2 generally the main reason for the decrease in water flux of the baseline solution is the internal concentration polarization icp liu and mi 2012 mi and elimelech 2010 as water permeates and dilutes the draw solution at the interface between the supporting layer and active layer the driving force for water permeation and water flux is significantly reduced because of icp several previous studies revealed that icp accounts for about 80 of water flux reduction in the fo process gray et al 2006 tang et al 2010 compared to the baseline and sa solution the water flux decreased faster 10 for the bsa and lyz solutions fig s2 it can be deduced that a layer of stable organic macromolecules had formed on the membrane surface the normalized water flux decline of the fo membranes under silica scaling for the different organic substances is presented in fig 1 the membrane fouling rates differed for the different substances the normalized water flux of the lyz conditioned membrane was about 20 lower than the baseline group indicating an interaction between the silica and lyz on the membrane surface in contrast the organic conditioning by sa had a negligible impact on the scaling potential the declining trend was similar to that of the baseline group some previous studies showed that silica and sa had no obvious synergistic effect and even found that the presence of sa would reduce silica scaling higgin et al 2010 motsa et al 2015 for example higgin et al observed that the interaction between silica and sodium alginate resulted in less fouling than that observed when silica alone existed in solution higgin et al 2010 in summary the silica scaling degree of the membranes followed the order lyz bsa sa interestingly the silica scaling phenomenon on the membrane after organic conditioning was different from gypsum scaling reported in the literature indicating different mechanisms for silica scaling and gypsum scaling liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 the main mechanism is that the carboxyl groups of sa bind strongly with ca2 resulting in a complex compound on the membrane surface and promoting gypsum crystallization liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 nevertheless the results of silica scaling in this study show that the protein substances bsa and lyz changed the surface properties of the membrane and accelerated silica scaling whereas sa had no significant effect on silica scaling the interactions between silica and organic matter in the feed solution could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface fig s3 shows the water flux decline with organics and silica coexisting in feed solution it can be seen that bsa and silica caused more serious membrane fouling consistent with the previous studies coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 while in terms of the organic conditioned membranes lyz conditioned membrane had more serious silica scaling previous studies have shown that membrane fouling was more severe when silica and protein i e bsa were present in the solution than when silica and sa ha coexisted ma et al 2019 qin et al 2017 this finding indicates that silica may have a stronger interaction with protein substances therefore the difference in the silica scaling behavior depends largely on the properties of the organic molecules however the underlying mechanism must be investigated 3 2 membrane surface morphology fig 2 a d shows the sem images of the virgin membrane and the membranes preconditioned by sa bsa and lyz respectively the different organics formed different structures on the fo membranes fig 2b d fig 2e h shows the sem images of silica scaling on the virgin membrane and the other conditioned membranes the smooth spherical deposits on the membrane in fig 2e are silica particles similarly silica particles are observed in fig 2f h indicating the occurrence of silica scaling on the three organic conditioned membranes the comparison with fig 2f reveals that the unstable sa layer was washed away by the fs in the scaling experiment leaving only part of the stable sa layer after silica scaling however silica formed large aggregates on top of the bsa and lyz conditioned membranes these are partially embedded in the organic matrix these results show that the organic molecules on the membrane surface have a significant impact on silica scaling xps was used to analyze the elemental composition of the silica fouling layer fig 3 a the ratios of o c and si c indicate the abundance of organic matter sa bsa lyz and silica in the fouling layer respectively as shown in fig 3a the virgin membrane has the lowest ratios of o c 4 47 and si c 0 98 whereas the lyz conditioned membrane has the highest ratios of o c 8 4 and si c 2 05 demonstrating that the fouling layer on the lyz conditioned membrane contains the highest amount of silica the si peaks in fig s5 show that the main forms of silica are si o 103 0 ev and sio2 103 8 ev lu et al 2015 yin et al 2021 the ratios of cc co and cooh are the lowest and the ratio of si o is the highest in the silica scaling layer of the lyz conditioned membrane therefore the xps results indicate that the chemical characteristics of organic matter on the membrane surface significantly affect the silica scaling behavior and the lyz conditioned membrane exhibited more significant silica scaling fig 3b displays the surface root mean square roughness of the virgin membrane and different groups of the fouled membranes obtained by afm the surface roughness of the fouled membrane is 1 10 times higher than that of the virgin membrane 22 9 nm the influence of fouling depends on the foulants properties in general the surface roughness of the membrane fouled by organic matter and silica was greater than that fouled by either organic matter or silica li et al 2021 quay et al 2018 the reason is that the organic conditioned membrane surface was covered with an uneven silica fouling layer resulting in an increase in the peak and valley difference and the roughness the root mean square roughness after sequential fouling of lyz and silica was the largest 243 5 nm corresponding to the highest silica deposition the results of the morphology and elemental analysis of the membrane surface by sem afm and xps indicate that the silica scaling behavior is closely related to the properties of the organic matter on the membrane surface next we analyze the charge and hydrophobicity of the membrane surface 3 3 membrane surface properties fig 4 shows the zeta potential and contact angle of the virgin membrane and different groups of fouled membranes the surfaces of sa bsa and silica were negatively charged under neutral conditions whereas the surface of lyz was positively charged the isoelectric point of bsa is 4 7 4 9 and that of lyz is 10 4 nakamura and matsumoto 2006 wang and tang 2011 fig 4a shows that the negative charges were significantly higher on the surface of the sa and bsa conditioned membranes than on the virgin membrane indicating the deposition of the two substances on the membrane surface in general the zeta potential was even higher when silica was deposited on the organic conditioned membranes the sa conditioned membrane had the largest negative potential thus the negatively charged silica was subject to the most significant electrostatic repulsion and the deposition potential and fouling degree were the lowest lu and huang 2019 tong et al 2017 in contrast the negative potential of the lyz conditioned membrane was the smallest the bonding between silica and lyz was least affected by the electrostatic action hence the deposition amount and fouling degree were the largest indicating that the surface charge of the organic matter affected the degree of silica scaling fig 4b compares the contact angle of the different groups of membranes after the attachment of organic matter the membrane surface became more hydrophobic and the contact angle was 20 80 higher than for the virgin membrane however after silica scaling on the organic conditioned membranes the membrane surface became hydrophilic again with contact angles of 40 60 the difference in the contact angle between the lyz conditions membrane and the membrane under silica scaling was the highest ranging from 90 to 40 since silica is hydrophilic it can be concluded that silica was attached to the organic conditioned membrane and the amount of adhesion was the largest for the lyz conditioned membrane qin et al 2017 tong et al 2017 3 4 qcm d measurements of silica adsorption on membranes conditioned membranes by different organics the adsorption of organic matter on the membrane changes the membrane s surface properties affecting the binding effect with silica the results of qcm d measurements can offer insights into the adsorption of organic matter on the membrane and the interaction between organic matter and silica ma et al 2019 rathinam et al 2019 fig 5 shows that the adsorption of organic matter stage ii and silica stage iv on the sensor surface resulted in different deposition frequency f and dissipation d values the f remained nearly unchanged throughout the process and was the highest fig 5a implying that the silica deposition was minimal without organic conditioning fig 5b c shows that the frequency f of the organic conditioned membranes decreased to varying degrees after the silica solution was injected indicating that silica was adsorbed on the sensor surface the f of the lyz conditioned membrane had the maximum reduction followed by bsa and sa the adsorbed mass of silica and organic matter on sensors are shown in fig 5e in the absence of organic conditioning the amount of deposited silica on sensor surface was 22 4 ng cm2 when sensor surface was organic conditioned with sa bsa and lyz the adsorbed silica was increased significantly to 45 3 1037 8 and 1416 9 ng cm2 respectively the silica adsorption studies yielded similar results to the previous study in which calcium ions exhibited higher adsorption on organic adhesion layers liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 therefore the maximum silica adsorption occurred on the surface of the lyz conditioned membrane and a strong interaction was observed between lyz and silica fig 5f compares the calculated d f at the adsorption equilibrium stage for different organic layers to analyze the structure of the adsorbed layer after organic matter adsorption sa showed a higher d f than bsa and lyz possibly because sa is more hydrophilic resulting in less adsorption of sa when silica was deposited on the organic conditioned membrane the d and f were lower especially for the lyz and bsa conditioned membranes indicating a dense and rigid adsorption layer liu and mi 2014 wang et al 2016 in addition f t can be used to determine the deposition rate of foulants lyz conditioned membrane showed the shortest time to reach the maximum value of f indicating that lyz conditioned membrane induced the highest silica deposition rate and could absorb more silica the binding effects of silica with organic matter followed the order lyz bsa sa the same as the ranking of the water flux decline this result confirms the strong interaction between silica and protein substances reported in the literature 3 5 itc results of the binding strength between silica and organic matter the scaling behavior of the organic molecules interacting with silica on the membrane surface was investigated at the microscopic level using by qcm d itc tests provides information on the interaction of silica with organic substances and can be used to quantify the binding strength between silica and organic matter using the heat release value from the perspective of thermodynamics the titration heat curve obtained by the itc measurements are presented in fig 6 the thermodynamic parameters for the binding between silica and sa bsa lyz can provide further details table 1 first the gibbs free energy g rt ln k of the three organic compounds combined with silica is negative indicating that the binding reaction between the organic matter and silica is feasible in thermodynamics secondly the binding enthalpy h of bsa 3 42 kj mol and lyz 2 32 kj mol with silica is negative indicating that their reactions with silica are exothermic binding processes and the complex is relatively stable however the binding enthalpy between sa and silica is positive δh 0 implying an endothermic binding and an unstable complexation since δs 0 tδs δh and δg 0 the binding reaction is proven an entropy driven process and electrostatic interaction is the main driving force loosli et al 2015 makowska et al 2016 compared with bsa lyz there is a large amount of carboxyl groups on the surface of sa which could generate electrostatic repulsion and weak binding with silica the weak electrostatic interaction between sa and silica may cause a small value of δh the result is also consistent with previous reported literature such as tio2 sa cu and peptide and amino acids interaction huang et al 2017 loosli et al 2015 makowska et al 2016 by calculating tδs via the equation of tδs δh δg the positive entropy changes in all reactions δs 98 09 63 37 96 18 j mol k suggest that the binding increases the structural disorder of the complex due to the displacement of solvating water molecules from coordination sites by inner sphere complexation alam et al 2018 huang et al 2017 the positive enthalpy and entropy values could be contributed by the dehydration reaction resulting from the release of coordinated water molecules upon binding of the sa to the silica alam et al 2018 huang et al 2017 hydrophilic sa silica is easy to combine with water and hydrogen bond is formed between silica and sa in our previous study we have reported that silica reacts with the carboxyl group of humic acid through hydrogen bonding li et al 2021 the negative enthalpy of interaction between bsa lyz and silica δh 0 and positive entropy δs 0 indicates that the process was driven more easily reactive than sa and silica based on the correlation between the thermodynamic parameters and interaction forces the reaction between lyz bsa sa and silica was dominated by the electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds ross and subramanian 1981 these results are consistent with the thermodynamic interaction between other substances such as ha ca sa tio2 and eps cu chen et al 2020 sheng et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wang et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore the reaction between lyz bsa and silica is dominated by the electrostatic forces and hydrogen bonds and the binding strength is larger than the interaction between sa and silica third the binding constant k of lyz and silica 0 27 103 l mol is significantly greater than that of sa 0 07 103 l mol and bsa 0 01 103 l mol indicating that the binding strength of lyz and silica by the electrostatic force is stronger than that of sa and bsa therefore lyz and silica have a stronger thermodynamic binding effect and the electrostatic interaction is the dominant force 3 6 xdlvo results for the interaction energy between silica and the organic conditioned membranes the core of this study is to reveal the interaction between organic conditioned membrane and silica from the perspective of membrane interface therefore the organic foulants on the conditioned membrane can be used to measure the contact angle and calculate the surface energy which is close to the real condition in the membrane fouling experiment in some studies of membrane fouling using xdlvo theory the conditioned modified membrane was used to measure surface energy when analyzing the interaction between membrane interface foulants and foulants foulants tong et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 the interaction energy between the silica and the different organic conditioned membranes was calculated based on the xdlvo theory to obtain further insights into the membrane fouling mechanism chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 the contact angles of the three organic conditioned membranes were measured using water diiodomethane and formamide as testing solutions the results are shown in table s1 the surface energy of water diiodomethane and formamide are listed in table s2 they were used to calculate the surface energy of the three organic conditioned membranes using the young dupré equation eq 10 table 2 lists the surface energy and interaction energy between silica and the three organic conditioned membranes there are substantial differences in the interfacial energy between the membranes conditioned by different organics the lw component is similar for the sa and bsa conditioned membranes 23 mj m2 but is 33 mj m2 for the lyz conditioned membrane suggesting that the latter is more prone to intermolecular interaction with regard to the lewis acid base component the order of γ is lyz bsa sa while the order of γ is sa bsa lyz the values of γ and γ reflect the binding ability of the conditioned membrane surface with different acid base substances the total surface energy γ which indicates the potential of interaction between the membrane interface and other substances had an order of lyz bsa sa the same as that of the water flux decline fig 1b section 3 1 regarding to the interaction energy with silica the values of δ g h 0 ab were slightly difference for the three conditioned membranes but the absolute value of δ g h 0 lw of the lyz conditioned membrane was significantly larger than that of the sa and bsa conditioned membranes showing that the scaling potential of the lyz conditioned membrane was the highest based on the intermolecular force fig 7 displays the interaction energy between silica and the virgin or organic conditioned membranes and the distance h based on the xdlvo theory the acid base interaction and intermolecular interaction contribute the most to the total interaction energy when the distance between the silica particles and membrane surface h is small as h increases the contribution of the acid base interaction decreases and the intermolecular interaction and electrostatic interaction become the main factors affecting the total interaction energy the green line in fig 7 represents the total interaction energy between silica and the membrane the inset in fig 7 shows that the total interaction energy changes with an increase in h and an inflection point occurs in the curve the total interaction energy at the inflection point reflects the interaction ability between silica and the membrane chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 the lower the inflection point value table 3 the more likely the interaction between the silica and the membrane is the result indicates that the lyz conditioned membrane has a higher propensity to interact with silica because it has the lowest electrostatic interaction energy e el 45 011 mj m2 and the lowest total interaction energy e tot 49 094 mj m2 and e max tot 2 182 mj m2 the order of intermolecular interaction energy and electrostatic interaction energy between silica and the membrane table 3 is consistent with the order of the fouling degree indicating that the interaction intensity between silica and the organic conditioned membranes mainly depends on two factors since the surface of silica is negatively charged the intermolecular interaction energy and electrostatic interaction energy of the sa conditioned membrane were the highest among the organic conditioned membranes accounting for its smaller probability to interact with silica lu and huang 2019 qin et al 2017 tong et al 2017 in summary the lyz conditioned membrane showed a higher potential to interact with silica particles due to the intermolecular and electrostatic interactions 3 7 proposed silica scaling mechanisms this study proved that organic conditioning of the membrane affected the silica scaling behavior during fo the organic conditioned membranes induced a higher water flux declines than the virgin membrane largely because of silica scaling the primary reason is the cake enhanced osmotic pressure cecp mechanism due to the prevention of back diffusion of silica species and other solutes resulting in silica accumulation on the membrane surface boo et al 2012 liu and mi 2014 mi and elimelech 2010 wang et al 2016 notably the degree of silica scaling on the organic conditioned membrane depended on the type and characteristic of foulants the lyz conditioned membrane experienced the highest scaling tendency than membranes conditioned with bsa and sa the binding strength between silica and the organic macromolecules and the membrane surface charge were the dominant factors affecting silica scaling on the organic conditioned membranes the negative charge of the lyz conditioned membrane surface was significantly lower owing to the positive charge of lyz at a neutral ph in addition due to the strong interaction between amino groups and amino groups and silicic acid it is found that positively charged peptides and proteins such as poly lysine and lysozyme contribute to the polymerization and precipitation of silica coradin et al 2003 coradin et al 2002 the electrostatic attraction between lyz and the negatively charged silica likely promoted silica precipitation which was consistent with previous studies coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 the positively charged membrane surfaces and the positively charged groups significantly accelerated silica scaling whereas a more negative membrane surface charge led to reduced scaling in ro lu and huang 2019 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 however the interaction mechanism between silica and organic matter conditioned membrane surface could be largely different from that between silica and organic matter in the feed solution demonstrating that the bsa and silica scaling were attributed to the enhanced protein aggregation on the membrane surface coradin et al 2003 quay et al 2018 these molecular level interactions were used to explain the roles of organic conditioned membranes in affecting silica scaling lyz exhibited the highest affinity for silica binding and the binding reaction was more favorable both thermodynamically and kinetically the interfacial adhesion energy of at the membrane silica and organic macromolecule silica interface proved that the deposition of lyz enhanced the interaction energy which was also confirmed by the xdlvo model the intermolecular and electrostatic interactions were the dominant molecular interaction force thus the multiscale microanalysis indicated that silica was attracted by the less negatively charged membrane surface enhancing the molecular interaction the results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism for the impact of the membrane surface charge on silica scaling is accurate 4 conclusions the interface interaction mechanisms between silica and typical organics in organic conditioned fo membranes were revealed by molecular level analysis silica scaling following membrane preconditioning with organic matter sa bsa and lyz during fo was characterized by complex interactions between the silica membrane and the attached organic matter the results suggested that the water flux decline caused by silica scaling in the lyz conditioned membrane 20 decline was greater than that of the bsa 10 decline or sa 5 decline conditioned membrane the binding strength between silica and organic matter and the membrane surface charge were the dominant factors governing the degree of silica scaling on the organic conditioned membrane surface the degree of silica scaling was the highest on the lyz conditioned membrane because silica adsorption occurred due to electrostatic interaction the qcm d itc xdlvo microscopic results indicated that the main binding interaction between silica and the three organic compounds was intermolecular and electrostatic interactions and the order of the interaction intensity was lyz bsa sa this study provides fresh insights into how silica and organic conditioned membranes interact

15067,in order to describe spatio temporal distribution of chemicals in flowing lake systems a dynamic multimedia fate model of chemicals with spatial differentiation was constructed by coupling the level iv fugacity model with lake hydrodynamics it was successfully applied to four phthalates paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water and its accuracy was verified results show that under the long term influence of flow field the distributions of paes in both lake water and sediment have significant spatial heterogeneity of 2 5 orders of magnitude but present different distribution rules which was explained by analysis of pae transfer fluxes the spatial distribution of paes in the water column depends on hydrodynamic conditions and whether the primary source is reclaimed water or atmospheric input slow water exchange and flow speed promote the migration of paes from water to sediment causing them to always accumulate in sediments far away from the recharging inlet uncertainty and sensitivity analysis show that the pae concentrations in water phase are mainly affected by emission and physicochemical parameters while those in sediment phase are also sensitive to environmental parameters the model can provide important information and accurate data support for the scientific management of chemicals in flowing lake systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lake hydrodynamic model coupled level iv fugacity model fate and transport spatial heterogeneity phthalate ester data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes perform significant ecological functions in both natural and urban environments such as regulating and storing water developing irrigation providing habitat for animals and regulating local climate compared to river ecosystems lakes are more susceptible to be polluted due to their closure and longer hydraulic retention time dai et al 2017 a variety of micro organic pollutants can enter and accumulate in lakes via rainwater runoff wastewater discharge agricultural non point source emissions reclaimed water recharge atmosphere input and so on zheng et al 2016 yang et al 2021 ai et al 2021 once they enter lakes they could transfer between and within different environmental media thus affecting the safety and health of water ecosystem luo et al 2014 among these micro organic pollutants phthalic acid esters paes widely used as plasticizers in manufacturing and processing of plastics gao and wen 2016 zhang et al 2018 can easily migrate into the surrounding environment due to their non covalent bonding with the plastic matrix hassanzadeh et al 2014 paluselli et al 2018 at present paes have been widely detected in kinds of environments around the world such as wastewater surface water sediment air and soil kong et al 2012 ji et al 2014 net et al 2015a it has been found that the ecological reuse of wastewater is an important way for paes entering the surface water environment gao et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 ai et al 2021 once paes enter the aquatic environment they will bring serious risks to aquatic life for example neurotoxic effects on zebrafish embryos and negative effects on the growth and development of algae caused by inhibiting photosynthesis xu et al 2013 therefore it is essential to clarify the transport and fate behavior of paes in water environment for further risk assessment and accurate pollution control based on lewis fugacity theory mackay et al mackay et al 1983a mackay et al 1983b proposed a fugacity model to describe the transfer process of chemicals among atmosphere water and sediment fugacity represents the tendency of a substance to escape from surroundings medium to its adjacent medium and is used to determine whether the substance reaches thermodynamic equilibrium between environmental media mackay 1979 under ideal conditions the concentration c fugacity f and fugacity capacity z of chemicals are linearly correlated c z f mackay 1979 chen et al 2021 thus the chemical concentration is converted into its fugacity allowing the thermodynamic theory to be combined with mass balance equation to describe the transport and fate of the chemical between different environmental media the fugacity based multimedia model has been widely applied to the fate simulation of pollutants by researchers xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a du et al 2020 and proven to be a reliable tool for deriving 1 potential sources of chemicals in multi media in environment 2 distribution of chemicals released into the environment and 3 transfer flux and persistence of chemicals in the environment mackay et al 2014 kim et al 2017 wang et al 2020 traditional fugacity models for chemicals in lake systems e g qwasi and level ⅲ fugacity model are generally based on the assumption that all environmental media are completely uniform wang et al 2020 du et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however for flowing lakes especially those with uneven flow field distribution long term source discharge and hydrodynamics may influence the transport and fate of contaminants and ultimately lead to the significant spatial heterogeneity of chemical distribution in the whole lake area lindim et al 2011 wang et al 2019 which cannot be reflected by the traditional lake scale models the research of zhang et al 2019 shows that even in the point source input scenario of the microcosm system the assumption of fugacity model homogeneity can lead to differences between measured and predicted values at present fugacity models coupled with one dimensional hydrodynamic model have been developed for rivers only to describe linear heterogeneity but not applicable to lakes kilic and aral 2009 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in order to solve this problem we divided the research area into grids and coupled the level iv fugacity model with a two dimensional gridding hydrodynamic model to build a dynamic multi media model with spatial differentiation characteristics so as to simulate the real situation of chemicals in inhomogeneous flowing lakes the model was applied to simulate the spatial distributions and fates of paes in water and sediment of a lake recharged by reclaimed water and the differences of their spatial distribution characteristics were further explained based on analysis of pae transport processes our model can provide accurate data support and theoretical basis for the scientific management and control of chemicals in flowing surface water which is of great significance for the ecological security of lake systems 2 material and method 2 1 study area the study area is the jing lake latitude 117 20 118 00 e longitude 38 40 39 00 n in china singapore tianjin eco city the water surface area of the jing lake is 1 06 km2 and the average water depth is 2 00 m water and sediment samples were taken in november and december 2020 march to august 2021 and october to november 2021 according to the actual situation of the lake sampling point 1 lake inlet was set at the recharging pipe outlet to collect only reclaimed water numbered as w 1 and sampling points 2 9 were set for lake water numbered as w 2 to w 9 and sediment numbered as s 2 to s 9 among which sampling point 4 is located at the outlet of the lake as shown in fig 1 the field sampling process sample pretreatment and analysis quality control and quality assurance are detailed as section 1 3 and table s1 in supplementary materials dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp were detected in all samples which were selected for further simulation the concentrations of the four paes in reclaimed water table s2 were used as model inputs and those in lake water and sediment were used for model verification as shown in fig s1 2 2 construction of hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model of the jing lake was established by mike 21 flow model fm of danish hydraulic institute dhi which is a two dimensional 2d mathematical model based on incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations garcia oliva et al 2017 and the assumption of boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure tu et al 2021 the 2d shallow water equations were described by garcia oliva et al 2017 the contour and terrain data of the lake area were provided and generated based on a cad planning map and google map fig 1 the data attributes include the coordinate information of contour points and elevation data of lake bottom the study area map was established by mike zero software and the boundary conditions of the model were defined the lake bottom elevation 0 99 m 2 15 m as shown in fig 2 a the lake area was meshed into 1 039 non structured triangular grids 0 85 m² 2671 42 m² using mesh generator of mike zero and local encryption was automatically generated for the boundary points as shown in fig 2 b in the hydrodynamic module the eddy current parameter was set as a constant of 0 28 m2 s based on smagorinsky formula the default manning coefficient of 32 m⅓ s was adopted for the friction of the bottom bed the high order second order numerical calculation method was employed to solve the model which is characterized by high accuracy but slow speed 2 3 construction of level iv fugacity model the conceptual diagram of fugacity model in this study is shown as fig 3 which includes three bulk compartments air water and sediment the skipping of the soil phase 3 is due to the fact that the lake in this study is an artificial lake replenished with reclaimed water and its shore is mostly piled with cement and stones which is also common in other lake fugacity models mackay et al 2014 du et al 2020 the air compartment is composed of two sub compartments gaseous and particulate matter the water compartment is composed of two sub compartments water and suspended matter and the sediment compartment is also composed of two sub compartments pore water and solid sweetman et al 2002 in order to realize the coupling of fugacity model and hydrodynamic model a level iv fugacity model with time variable was employed to predict the multimedia fate of the 4 paes based on the approach developed by mackay et al sweetman et al 2002 cahill and mackay 2003 the mass balance differential equations are expressed as 1 v 1 z 1 d f 1 d t 0 2 v 2 z 2 d f 2 d t d 02 w f d 02 p f f i n d 12 r d 12 d d 12 w d 12 v f 1 d 42 t d 42 n f 4 d 20 w f d 20 p f d 21 v d 24 s d 24 t d 20 t f 2 3 v 4 z 4 d f 4 d t d 24 s d 24 t f 2 d 42 t d 42 n d 40 b d 40 t f 4 where v is volume m3 z is fugacity capacity mol m3 pa f is fugacity pa t is transfer flux g h d ijk is transfer coefficient from compartment i to compartment j 1 2 and 4 represent air water and sediment respectively and the subscript k is process category in wf pf r d w a v s t n b and t for water inflow water advective flow particle advective flow rain dissolution dry aerosol deposition wet aerosol deposition absorption volatilization sedimentation diffusion sediment resuspension sediment burial and transformation respectively it should be noted that our model sets the chemical emission sources in the water phase pae discharge via reclaimed water in the boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model rather than directly in the fugacity model so as to simulate the actual discharge scenario it is different from the traditional homogeneous level iv fugacity model paraíba et al 1999 sweetman et al 2002 in addition it is assumed that the fugacity of chemicals in the air f 1 does not to change with time in the consideration of that the concentrations of chemicals in the air phase in local small scale areas are greatly affected by atmospheric advection and always tend to their background concentrations specific calculation equations for z d and t are shown in table s3 table s4 and table s5 respectively the symbols definitions values and sources of all the 55 parameters in the level iv fugacity model are provided in table s6 including 12 physicochemical parameters of paes 23 environmental parameters and 20 advection and emission parameters the calculated values of z d and t for the four paes were provided in table s7 s9 the fourth order runge kutta method was used to solve eq 1 3 with simulation time step of one day finally the molar concentrations c mol m3 of paes in the water and sediment were obtained according to c z f mackay and paterson 1991 and then converted to mass concentrations c 2 and c 4 respectively therefore the calculation equations are as follows 4 c 2 f 2 z 2 m 10 6 5 c 4 f 4 z 43 m 10 6 ρ 43 where c 2 is the mass concentration of paes in water ng l m is molecular mass of paes g mol c 4 is the mass concentration of paes in sediment ng g and ρ 43 is the density of solids in sediment kg m3 2 4 model coupling and validation method the level iv fugacity model was constructed by the eco lab module of mike zero in order to unify the concentration units in different environmental media fugacity was calculated instead of concentration mackay 1979 and the fugacity f of the four paes in the water and sediment phase was set as state variables the concentration of paes in the air phase obtained from previous study ji et al 2014 was transformed into fugacity value f 1 and set as a constant in the fugacity model the average annual discharge concentrations of paes from reclaimed water in table s2 were also converted into corresponding fugacity values f e2 mean and set in the boundary condition as the specified discharge in the hydrodynamic module of mike 21 in addition reclaimed water inflow r 1 and lake water outflow r 2 were also set as the annual average values the specific values of f 1 f e2 mean r 1 and r 2 are shown in table s6 as well as the other parameters on this basis the hydrodynamic model and the level iv fugacity model were coupled with the same calculation step of one day and thus a dynamic fugacity model with spatial differentiation characteristics was constructed an initial simulation of 365 days was carried out to achieve the steady state of the chemical distribution in the receiving lake system which was taken as the environmental background for further monthly simulations the output of the coupled model includes two parts hydrodynamic results flow direction and speed and spatial fate and distribution of chemicals in environmental media fugacity and concentration the fugacity of chemicals paes in this study in water phase f 2 pa and sediment phase f 4 pa was obtained for each grid presenting spatial heterogeneity in a visual form as well as their concentration distribution in water phase c 2 ng l and sediment phase c 4 ng g based on the steady state of the 365th day as the environmental background continuous month to month simulation was conducted from november 2020 to november 2021 according to the monthly recharge flow of reclaimed water and the monthly discharge concentration of chemicals in reclaimed water to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of chemicals in lake water and sediment the simulations for january february and september 2021 without measured data were based on the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water in the previous month the specific values of monthly pae concentration fugacity and recharge flow are shown in table s2 table s6 and table s10 respectively model validation was performed by comparing the simulated concentrations of paes with their measured values in water and sediment at each sampling site i e the eight sampling points 2 9 in this study for each month 2 5 model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis the uncertainties of parameters were taken into account in modeling to determine their influence on the simulation results and the extent to which each parameter contributes to the overall uncertainty the output results of the coupled level iv fugacity model with spatiotemporal heterogeneity include the distribution of chemicals in the water and sediment phase in each grid which is difficult to conduct uncertainty analysis due to the characteristics of numerous grid outputs slow calculation and long time consumption therefore the model was simplified by level ⅲ fugacity model mackay et al 1983a without spatial temporal heterogeneity to conduct uncertainty analysis and monte carlo simulation was performed with 20 000 iterations using crystal ball 11 1 2 4 software parameters related to water and sediment volume were defined as constants based on measured data such as water surface area a 2 water volume v 2 and active layer depth of sediment h 4 temperature t and water inflow r 1 were defined as uniform distribution based on actual monitoring data and water outflow r 2 was defined as a function of r 1 based on water balance in addition the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water c 2 were fitted as lognormal distributions based on monthly measured data and the discharge rate of chemicals into water e 2 was defined as a function of c 2 and r 1 according to huang et al 2019 the remaining parameters were set to follow lognormal distribution the specific settings of parameters in uncertainty analysis are provided in table s11 the coefficient of variation cv of the pae simulated concentration calculated as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean was used to describe the uncertainty of the model output simultaneously the sensitivity analysis of parameters was also carried out by crystal ball software 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation in the initial simulation with f 1 f e2 mean r 1 and r 2 as annual averages the grid weighted average concentrations gwac of paes in the water and sediment phases of the whole lake over the simulation time are shown in fig s2 gwac was obtained by multiplying the concentration of the chemical in each grid by the volume of the grid and dividing by the total volume of the phase the simulated distribution of dmp dep dbp and dehp in water phase tended to be stable on the 120th 110th 162th and 120th day respectively fig s2 a while it took longer time for those in sediment phase to achieve their stable states which was on 160th 160th 190th and 191th days for dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively fig s2 b this is due to water advection which facilitates the transport of chemicals in water to reach their steady states more quickly and simultaneous air water interface transport speed up the process ao et al 2009 as can be seen from the rapid rise in fig s2 a after reaching the simulated steady state monthly simulations were conducted to verify the coupled model by comparing the monthly measured and predicted concentrations of paes in water and sediment at each sample point as shown in fig s1 the deviations between the measured and simulated results for the 4 paes are all within 1 0 order of magnitude indicating that they have a good agreement huang et al 2019 despite the complexities of chemical transport processes and lake hydrodynamics the simulation results are basically consistent with the observed overall spatiotemporal trends of pae concentrations which proves that the model can accurately reflect the influence of lake hydrodynamics on chemical distribution the differences between the measured and simulated results may be caused by the following factors 1 the uncertainty of model parameters such as h k oc half lives and monitoring data of paes in the air which were from literatures rather than actual measurement and taken as constant values throughout the simulation duration 2 the aquatic biota was ignored to simplify the model which is common in multimedia models because they rarely accumulate an appreciable fraction of the total solute mass mackay et al 1983a and 3 some uncertain disturbance factors in nature such as strong winds and storms rainwater runoff ice period activities of aquatic organisms anthropogenic activities around the lake and so on nevertheless the model meets the accuracy requirements and can achieve the objective of describing the spatial distribution characteristics of chemicals in lake water and sediment thus providing reliable guidance for the management of the chemicals as shown in fig s1 the differences between simulated and measured concentration of paes in sediment phase are generally larger than those in water phase in addition the time variation law of each pae tends to be consistent among these sampling points but the time variation trends of the four paes at the same sampling point are different therefore further two dimensional spatial analysis and transfer flux analysis are needed to determine the distribution characteristics and mechanisms of each pae in lake water and sediment 3 2 flow field analysis the hydrodynamic simulation result on the 365th day is shown as fig 4 including the flow direction and flow velocity distribution of the water body it can be seen that the flow velocity in the study area is 3 92 10 6 1 80 10 2 m s which is extremely slow and dead water corners are easy to appear at the crooked boundaries two large circulations exist in the northern and southern zones of the jing lake respectively which are mainly affected by the irregular shape of lake shoreline local topography and the only water inlet and water outlet besides there are also some smaller internal vortices at the northeast and northwest corners of the lake and between the two large circulations in this situation the lake water in the northern zone is difficult to exchange with the external water body in contrast the southern zone is located between the inlet and outlet of the lake facilitating the diffusion and exchange of water bodies 3 3 paes spatial distribution in water and sediment the two dimensional steady state simulation results of the four paes in the water of the jing lake on the 365th day are shown in fig 5 which are used to analyze their spatial distribution rules and mechanisms under the long term recharge of reclaimed water the simulated concentration ranges of dmp dep dbp and dehp in lake water are 0 83 679 42 ng l 0 11 454 86 ng l 0 44 1237 85 ng l and 2 44 292 24 ng l respectively among them dbp in the water column has the highest average concentration gwacdbp 250 56 ng l which is related to its high level mean concentration 342 17 ng l in the recharged reclaimed water obviously higher than the other three paes in addition the cvs of dmp dep dbp and dehp concentrations in water phase were calculated by the ratio of grid weighted standard deviation gwsd to gwac which were 0 30 0 37 0 35 and 0 39 respectively suggesting a great deal of spatial variability as can be seen the distribution of paes in the water column shown in fig 5 is closely related to the lake hydrodynamics shown in fig 4 the water flow field in the southern zone of the lake promotes the rapid exchange with the replenished reclaimed water from w 1 resulting in the pae concentrations in this zone close to those in the reclaimed water in contrast the large internal vortex in the northern zone makes it difficult to exchange with the southern water body which leads to the difference in the concentration of paes between the northern and southern zones in addition the small internal vortices and viscous force of water flow at the northern boundaries also cause slow water exchange resulting in large differences of pae concentrations between these boundaries and the recharging inlet at w 1 this reveals that long term flow field leads to a great deal of spatial variability of chemicals in the water column it should be noted that the concentrations of dep and dbp in the northern water body are significantly lower than those in the southern zone while the opposite trend is observed for dmp and dehp this is most likely influenced by different transports of paes between water and atmosphere since chemical concentrations in the southern zone near the recharge inlet of reclaimed water always tend to be close to their levels in reclaimed water it can be inferred that dep and dbp mainly enter the lake by reclaimed water recharge then transport by water advection along with degradation and migration into air and sediment and thus decrease in the northern zone far away from the recharge inlet in contrast reclaimed water recharge appears to have a dilution effect on dmp and dehp in lake water and the gwacs of dmp 114 76 ng l and dehp 117 41 ng l in lake water are even higher than their mean concentrations in reclaimed water 80 83 ng l and 52 01 ng l respectively suggesting that their main source in the lake is probably atmospheric input rather than reclaimed water recharge moreover although the mean concentrations of dmp 80 83 ng l in reclaimed water was higher than that of dehp 52 01 ng l their gwacs in the lake water phase are very similar however the spatial variability of dehp cv 0 39 is greater than that of dmp cv 0 30 it can be speculated that dehp in the lake water probably has more atmospheric input or less output degradation or transfer to sediment than dmp this may be due to the fact that dehp with higher molecular weight has higher air water partition coefficient k aw aerosol air partition coefficient k qa and reaction half life in water t 2 than dmp which allows dehp to transfer from air to water and accumulate more easily in the northern water body resulting in higher spatial heterogeneity cousins et al 2003 net et al 2015b these indicate that chemicals may have different spatial heterogeneity even under the same hydrodynamic conditions which depends on their physicochemical properties emission sources and environmental conditions fig 6 shows the simulated spatial distributions of the four paes in the sediment of the jing lake at steady state the concentrations of dmp dep dbp and dehp in sediments are 1 77 10 3 77 47 ng g 4 22 10 2 45 68 ng g 1 65 10 1 187 09 ng g and 6 77 10 3 353 55 ng g respectively which also show great spatial heterogeneity especially for dehp in addition the cvs of pae concentrations in the sediment dmp 0 86 dep 0 62 dbp 0 64 and dehp 0 99 are generally higher than those in the water basically due to that the non flowing characteristic of sediments increases the spatial heterogeneity of chemical distribution obviously the spatial distributions of paes in the sediment shown in fig 6 are also closely related to lake hydrodynamics but different from those in the water column shown in fig 5 the four paes in the sediment of the northern zone are all remarkably greater than those of the southern zone even though the concentrations of dep and dbp are higher in the southern water than those in the northern water indicating that the paes in the overlying water of the northern zone are easier to migrate into the sediment regardless of their spatial differences in water phase this is attributed to the longer advection residence time in the northern zone of the lake caused by the slow exchange state and low flow velocity of the overlying water body by contrast the rapid water exchange rate in the southern zone of the lake promotes paes removal by water advection output thus preventing their migration into sediments this distribution rule of chemicals in sediment has never been revealed in previous studies where lakes were usually regarded as a homogeneous system without considering spatial heterogeneity guo et al 2019 du et al 2020 wang et al 2020 cai et al 2022 on the other hand basin scale fugacity models always show that the spatial heterogeneity of pollutants tends to be consistent among various environmental components zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b dong et al 2019 chen et al 2022 which is different from those in lake systems with non uniform flow characteristics it can be inferred that this rule also applies to chemicals in other flowing lake systems therefore in the case of long term stable discharge points the areas with weak water exchange and slow flow that are far away from the discharge outlets might be the key areas for sediment pollution control in addition among the four paes in the sediment dehp has the most significant spatial heterogeneity with the highest variation coefficient of 0 99 followed by dmp 0 86 which is related to their spatial heterogeneity in water phase the physiochemical properties of these two chemicals are quite different but both of them have higher concentration levels in the northern water body than in the southern water body which is consistent with their spatial distribution characteristics in the sediment phase in contrast the spatial distribution of dep and dbp in water phase is exactly opposite to that in sediment phase which can reduce their spatial heterogeneity in sediment phase to a certain extent through the cross interface transport of water and sediment resulting in lower cv values than dmp and dehp furthermore although the gwacs of dmp and dehp in the lake water are very similar 114 76 ng l and 117 41 ng l respectively the gwac of dehp 20 17 ng g in the sediment phase is obviously higher than that of dmp 6 22 ng g indicating that dehp accumulates in sediment phase more easily than dmp probably due to its higher octanol water partition coefficient logk ow organic carbon water partition coefficient k oc and reaction half lives in sediment t 4 net et al 2015b therefore the spatial heterogeneity of chemicals in sediment phase is affected by both their physicochemical properties and spatial heterogeneity in overlying water further analysis of transfer flux is necessary to determine their sources and fates in the lake system and quantitatively identify the underlying reasons of the differences so as to provide the basis for scientific and effective environmental management 3 4 the fate and transport of paes in the lake the transfer fluxes of paes in the water sediment and lake system were calculated based on their gwacs as shown in fig 7 a c and specific data are provided in table s9 fig 7 a reveals the different dominant sources of the four paes in the water phase which could explain the difference in their spatial distribution in the lake water shown in fig 5 transfer from air to water t 12 t 12r t 12d t 12w t 12a is the dominating source of dmp and dehp in the water phase accounting for 77 42 and 90 31 of the total source t 12 e 2 respectively as a result dmp and dehp accumulate over time in the northern water body of the lake with slow water exchange and present higher concentrations than in the southern zone in contrast reclaimed water recharge e 2 is the dominating source of dep and dbp in the water phase accounting for 86 86 and 79 25 of the total source t 12 e 2 respectively this leads to the higher levels of dep and dbp in the southern water body of the lake under the influence of the flow field by reclaimed water recharge the main removal mechanism of paes from the water phase is advection outflow of lake water t 20f t 20wf t 20pf which accounts for 62 62 dmp 61 89 dep 58 83 dbp and 53 55 dehp of the total removal mechanisms t 20f t 21 t 24 t 20t respectively the proportions of pae transfer fluxes between phases are shown in fig s3 in the processes of diffusion from air to water t 12 dmp and dep with low molecular weight are predominantly transported through rain dissolution t 12r accounting for 94 01 and 84 57 of t 12 respectively while dehp with high molecular weight is mainly transported through wet aerosol deposition t 12w 64 27 and dry aerosol deposition t 12d 35 56 dbp with moderate molecular weight is transported through a combination of the four pathways t 12r 23 94 t 12d 20 10 t 12w 36 33 and t 12a 19 64 this is related to the fact that the aerosol air partition coefficient k qa of chemicals increases with increasing molecular weight which makes dehp existing in the atmosphere tend to be significantly adsorbed to aerosol particles in addition the henry constant h increase with the increase of molecular weight resulting in a higher proportion of paes with moderate or high molecular weight dbp and dehp transferring from water to air t 21 t 21v the net input fluxes of paes from air to water t 12 t 21 are 7 33 kg y dmp 0 50 kg y dep 2 17 kg y dbp and 10 34 kg y dehp respectively which suggests that air input is an important source of paes in the lake system especially for dmp and dehp as shown in the fig 7 b transfer from water to sediment t 24 is the only source of paes in sediments the proportion of sedimentation t 24s of paes increases with the increase of molecular weight while the proportion of water sediment diffusion t 24t decreases fig s3 dmp dep and dbp transfer from water to sediment mainly through t 24t accounting for 97 30 85 74 and 54 77 of t 24 respectively while dehp transfers from water to sediment mainly through t 24s 73 86 fig s3 in the northern zone weak water exchange and slow advection promote the sedimentation of particles which enhances the transfer of dehp by t 24t and leads to the accumulation of dehp in sediment phase further increasing the spatial heterogeneity of dehp in the sediment of the lake on the other hand the major output pathway of dmp dep and dbp is sediment water transfer t 42 t 42t t 42n which accounts for 92 34 66 87 and 57 49 of the total output t 42 t 40b t 40t respectively fig s3 the transfer of paes from sediment to water t 42 is dominated by sediment water diffusion t 42t accounting for more than 95 of t 42 but the amount of t 42 is negligible compared with t 24 except for dmp the net input fluxes from water to sediment t 24 t 42 are 0 39 kg y for dmp 0 37 kg y for dep 1 39 kg y for dbp and 1 23 kg y for dehp indicating that sediment is an important sink for paes especially for those with moderate or high molecular weight in addition due to the high reaction half lives in sediment transformation flux in sediment t 40t of the four paes is much less than their transformation in water t 20t which further promotes their accumulation in the sediment as shown in the fig 7 c the paes in the lake system including lake water and sediment have two sources atmospheric input t 12 and reclaimed water recharge e 2 the former t 12 is the main source of dmp and dehp in the lake system accounting for 78 04 and 90 33 of the total input flux e 2 t 12 respectively while reclaimed water recharge e 2 is the main source of dep and dbp in the lake system which respectively accounts for 87 08 and 79 31 of their total input flux on the other hand the main loss pathway of paes from the lake system is water outflow t 02f which reaches 69 29 69 18 68 57 and 67 48 of the total output fluxes t 02f t 21 t t t 40b for dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively transformation t t t 20t t 40t is also an important loss pathway for dmp dep and dbp accounting for 30 61 30 57 and 30 22 of the total output flux respectively while only 9 03 for dehp this is due to that the degradation rates of dehp in both water and sediment are much lower than the other three paes the amount of residue in the lake system e 2 t 12 t 02f t 21 t t t 40b is 5 08 kg y for dmp 0 76 kg y for dep 2 58 kg y for dbp and 7 95 kg y for dehp which is determined by the total inputs of paes in the system their physiochemical properties and the hydrodynamic flow field 3 5 uncertainty and sensitivity of parameters based on the monte carlo simulation results with 20 000 iterations most of the simulated concentrations of paes in water and sediment phases conform to lognormal distribution as shown in fig s4 the cvs of pae concentrations in water phase dmp 0 17 dep 0 15 dbp 0 08 dehp 0 15 are lower than those in sediment phase dmp 0 21 dep 0 25 dbp 0 23 dehp 0 29 indicating higher uncertainty of pae concentrations in sediment phase the sensitivity analysis results of parameters by crystal ball software include sensitivity coefficients of parameters and their variance contribution to the uncertainty of model outputs as shown in table s12 the positive and negative values respectively represent the positive and negative influence on the simulation results parameters that contribute more than 1 absolute value to the uncertainty variance of the simulation results are regarded as sensitive parameters as shown in fig s5 as can be seen three emission parameters c 1 c 2 r 1 contribute greatly to the uncertainty of pae concentrations in water phase accounting for 25 7 75 0 57 5 and 50 7 of the total uncertainty of dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively in addition dmp 25 3 and dehp 39 0 are most affected by their concentrations in air c 1 while dep 64 1 and dbp 47 2 are most affected by its concentration in reclaimed water c 2 and reclaimed water inflow r 1 respectively which is consistent with the conclusion in section 3 4 that dmp and dehp in the water phase are mainly from atmospheric input while dep and dehp are mainly from reclaimed water discharge besides physicochemical parameters also have significant influence on the concentrations of paes in water phase especially accounting for 51 3 of the total uncertainty of dmp with low molecular weight henry constant h represents the partition of chemicals between water and air phase and its sensitivity on paes in the water phase decreases with the increase of molecular weight which accounts for 25 of the total uncertainty of dmp much higher than dep 8 dbp 1 8 and dehp 0 0 this is due to the fact that the main source of dmp in the lake is rain dissolution t 12r which is decided by its low h value representing its high solubility in water phase the reaction half lives in water t 2 of paes reflect their degradation time in water which have a significant positive effect on their concentrations in water phase among the environmental parameters scavenging ratio r 7 favors the transfer of paes from air to water by wet aerosol deposition t 12w which is the main source of dehp in the water phase and accounts for 16 2 of its total uncertainty rain rate r 8 is conducive to the transfer of paes from air phase to water phase by rain dissolution t 12r and has a positive effect on the concentrations of the four paes in water phase obviously most sensitive parameters for the concentrations of paes in water phase are also sensitive parameters for those in sediment phase and influence the simulation results in the same direction positive or negative this is because the water phase is the only source of paes in sediment phase furthermore since the tendency of paes to migrate into sediments especially into solids also increases with increasing molecular weight more environmental parameters can significantly affect the concentrations of paes in sediments such as ρ 43 s 4 ρ 23 r 3 φ23 the variance contributions of environmental parameters to dmp dep dbp and dehp concentrations in sediment phase are 30 8 49 8 66 5 and 68 5 respectively this may explain the higher cv values of pae concentrations and the greater deviations between simulated and measured values in sediment phase than those in water phase among the environmental parameters the increase of density of solids in sediment ρ 43 increases the dry weight per unit volume of sediment thus reducing the pae concentrations per unit of dry weight sediment the sedimentation of particles from water phase to sediment phase reflected by ρ 23 r 3 and φ23 obviously contributes to the concentrations of dbp and dehp in sediment phase in addition among the physicochemical parameters the reaction half lives in sediment t 4 reflect the degradation time of paes in sediments and k oc affects the partition of paes between water and sediment phase thus positively influencing the concentration of paes in sediment phase in particular the concentration of dmp in sediment phase is mainly affected by physicochemical parameters 50 6 which is similar to that in water phase it should be noted that although the current study is based on best available chemical property values having assumed log normal distributions with reasonable confidence factors with reference to literatures huang et al 2019 further measurements of chemical properties may yield better defined distributions and potentially more reliable ranges of model outputs nonetheless this analysis can provide a more realistic and balanced description of the likely environmental fate of paes and more rational basis for regulatory decisions 4 conclusion in this study a novel dynamic multimedia model with spatial differentiation was successfully constructed by coupling the level iv fugacity model with lake hydrodynamic model which is particularly suitable for simulating the transport process and spatiotemporal distribution of chemicals in flowing lake systems the proposed model can provide quantitative and visual information on the dynamic fate and distribution of chemicals in water and sediment with spatial differentiation through its application on paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water it is found that the distributions of paes in water and sediment of the lake have great spatial heterogeneity but with different rules which depends on the long term influence of flow field and the chemical multimedia transport process determined by emission sources physicochemical properties and environmental conditions the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis revealed the important parameters affecting the multimedia distribution of each pae in addition our model can identify the major pollutants in each component and corresponding major contamination areas under the long term influence of hydrodynamics as well as their source fate and transport process which can also be extended to other flowing surface water systems such as rivers and estuaries accurate understanding of the fate and spatial distribution of chemicals between and within media is

15067,in order to describe spatio temporal distribution of chemicals in flowing lake systems a dynamic multimedia fate model of chemicals with spatial differentiation was constructed by coupling the level iv fugacity model with lake hydrodynamics it was successfully applied to four phthalates paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water and its accuracy was verified results show that under the long term influence of flow field the distributions of paes in both lake water and sediment have significant spatial heterogeneity of 2 5 orders of magnitude but present different distribution rules which was explained by analysis of pae transfer fluxes the spatial distribution of paes in the water column depends on hydrodynamic conditions and whether the primary source is reclaimed water or atmospheric input slow water exchange and flow speed promote the migration of paes from water to sediment causing them to always accumulate in sediments far away from the recharging inlet uncertainty and sensitivity analysis show that the pae concentrations in water phase are mainly affected by emission and physicochemical parameters while those in sediment phase are also sensitive to environmental parameters the model can provide important information and accurate data support for the scientific management of chemicals in flowing lake systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords lake hydrodynamic model coupled level iv fugacity model fate and transport spatial heterogeneity phthalate ester data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction lakes perform significant ecological functions in both natural and urban environments such as regulating and storing water developing irrigation providing habitat for animals and regulating local climate compared to river ecosystems lakes are more susceptible to be polluted due to their closure and longer hydraulic retention time dai et al 2017 a variety of micro organic pollutants can enter and accumulate in lakes via rainwater runoff wastewater discharge agricultural non point source emissions reclaimed water recharge atmosphere input and so on zheng et al 2016 yang et al 2021 ai et al 2021 once they enter lakes they could transfer between and within different environmental media thus affecting the safety and health of water ecosystem luo et al 2014 among these micro organic pollutants phthalic acid esters paes widely used as plasticizers in manufacturing and processing of plastics gao and wen 2016 zhang et al 2018 can easily migrate into the surrounding environment due to their non covalent bonding with the plastic matrix hassanzadeh et al 2014 paluselli et al 2018 at present paes have been widely detected in kinds of environments around the world such as wastewater surface water sediment air and soil kong et al 2012 ji et al 2014 net et al 2015a it has been found that the ecological reuse of wastewater is an important way for paes entering the surface water environment gao et al 2014 zheng et al 2019 ai et al 2021 once paes enter the aquatic environment they will bring serious risks to aquatic life for example neurotoxic effects on zebrafish embryos and negative effects on the growth and development of algae caused by inhibiting photosynthesis xu et al 2013 therefore it is essential to clarify the transport and fate behavior of paes in water environment for further risk assessment and accurate pollution control based on lewis fugacity theory mackay et al mackay et al 1983a mackay et al 1983b proposed a fugacity model to describe the transfer process of chemicals among atmosphere water and sediment fugacity represents the tendency of a substance to escape from surroundings medium to its adjacent medium and is used to determine whether the substance reaches thermodynamic equilibrium between environmental media mackay 1979 under ideal conditions the concentration c fugacity f and fugacity capacity z of chemicals are linearly correlated c z f mackay 1979 chen et al 2021 thus the chemical concentration is converted into its fugacity allowing the thermodynamic theory to be combined with mass balance equation to describe the transport and fate of the chemical between different environmental media the fugacity based multimedia model has been widely applied to the fate simulation of pollutants by researchers xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015a du et al 2020 and proven to be a reliable tool for deriving 1 potential sources of chemicals in multi media in environment 2 distribution of chemicals released into the environment and 3 transfer flux and persistence of chemicals in the environment mackay et al 2014 kim et al 2017 wang et al 2020 traditional fugacity models for chemicals in lake systems e g qwasi and level ⅲ fugacity model are generally based on the assumption that all environmental media are completely uniform wang et al 2020 du et al 2020 chen et al 2021 however for flowing lakes especially those with uneven flow field distribution long term source discharge and hydrodynamics may influence the transport and fate of contaminants and ultimately lead to the significant spatial heterogeneity of chemical distribution in the whole lake area lindim et al 2011 wang et al 2019 which cannot be reflected by the traditional lake scale models the research of zhang et al 2019 shows that even in the point source input scenario of the microcosm system the assumption of fugacity model homogeneity can lead to differences between measured and predicted values at present fugacity models coupled with one dimensional hydrodynamic model have been developed for rivers only to describe linear heterogeneity but not applicable to lakes kilic and aral 2009 zhang et al 2011 wang et al 2012 in order to solve this problem we divided the research area into grids and coupled the level iv fugacity model with a two dimensional gridding hydrodynamic model to build a dynamic multi media model with spatial differentiation characteristics so as to simulate the real situation of chemicals in inhomogeneous flowing lakes the model was applied to simulate the spatial distributions and fates of paes in water and sediment of a lake recharged by reclaimed water and the differences of their spatial distribution characteristics were further explained based on analysis of pae transport processes our model can provide accurate data support and theoretical basis for the scientific management and control of chemicals in flowing surface water which is of great significance for the ecological security of lake systems 2 material and method 2 1 study area the study area is the jing lake latitude 117 20 118 00 e longitude 38 40 39 00 n in china singapore tianjin eco city the water surface area of the jing lake is 1 06 km2 and the average water depth is 2 00 m water and sediment samples were taken in november and december 2020 march to august 2021 and october to november 2021 according to the actual situation of the lake sampling point 1 lake inlet was set at the recharging pipe outlet to collect only reclaimed water numbered as w 1 and sampling points 2 9 were set for lake water numbered as w 2 to w 9 and sediment numbered as s 2 to s 9 among which sampling point 4 is located at the outlet of the lake as shown in fig 1 the field sampling process sample pretreatment and analysis quality control and quality assurance are detailed as section 1 3 and table s1 in supplementary materials dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp and di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp were detected in all samples which were selected for further simulation the concentrations of the four paes in reclaimed water table s2 were used as model inputs and those in lake water and sediment were used for model verification as shown in fig s1 2 2 construction of hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamic model of the jing lake was established by mike 21 flow model fm of danish hydraulic institute dhi which is a two dimensional 2d mathematical model based on incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations garcia oliva et al 2017 and the assumption of boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure tu et al 2021 the 2d shallow water equations were described by garcia oliva et al 2017 the contour and terrain data of the lake area were provided and generated based on a cad planning map and google map fig 1 the data attributes include the coordinate information of contour points and elevation data of lake bottom the study area map was established by mike zero software and the boundary conditions of the model were defined the lake bottom elevation 0 99 m 2 15 m as shown in fig 2 a the lake area was meshed into 1 039 non structured triangular grids 0 85 m² 2671 42 m² using mesh generator of mike zero and local encryption was automatically generated for the boundary points as shown in fig 2 b in the hydrodynamic module the eddy current parameter was set as a constant of 0 28 m2 s based on smagorinsky formula the default manning coefficient of 32 m⅓ s was adopted for the friction of the bottom bed the high order second order numerical calculation method was employed to solve the model which is characterized by high accuracy but slow speed 2 3 construction of level iv fugacity model the conceptual diagram of fugacity model in this study is shown as fig 3 which includes three bulk compartments air water and sediment the skipping of the soil phase 3 is due to the fact that the lake in this study is an artificial lake replenished with reclaimed water and its shore is mostly piled with cement and stones which is also common in other lake fugacity models mackay et al 2014 du et al 2020 the air compartment is composed of two sub compartments gaseous and particulate matter the water compartment is composed of two sub compartments water and suspended matter and the sediment compartment is also composed of two sub compartments pore water and solid sweetman et al 2002 in order to realize the coupling of fugacity model and hydrodynamic model a level iv fugacity model with time variable was employed to predict the multimedia fate of the 4 paes based on the approach developed by mackay et al sweetman et al 2002 cahill and mackay 2003 the mass balance differential equations are expressed as 1 v 1 z 1 d f 1 d t 0 2 v 2 z 2 d f 2 d t d 02 w f d 02 p f f i n d 12 r d 12 d d 12 w d 12 v f 1 d 42 t d 42 n f 4 d 20 w f d 20 p f d 21 v d 24 s d 24 t d 20 t f 2 3 v 4 z 4 d f 4 d t d 24 s d 24 t f 2 d 42 t d 42 n d 40 b d 40 t f 4 where v is volume m3 z is fugacity capacity mol m3 pa f is fugacity pa t is transfer flux g h d ijk is transfer coefficient from compartment i to compartment j 1 2 and 4 represent air water and sediment respectively and the subscript k is process category in wf pf r d w a v s t n b and t for water inflow water advective flow particle advective flow rain dissolution dry aerosol deposition wet aerosol deposition absorption volatilization sedimentation diffusion sediment resuspension sediment burial and transformation respectively it should be noted that our model sets the chemical emission sources in the water phase pae discharge via reclaimed water in the boundary conditions of the hydrodynamic model rather than directly in the fugacity model so as to simulate the actual discharge scenario it is different from the traditional homogeneous level iv fugacity model paraíba et al 1999 sweetman et al 2002 in addition it is assumed that the fugacity of chemicals in the air f 1 does not to change with time in the consideration of that the concentrations of chemicals in the air phase in local small scale areas are greatly affected by atmospheric advection and always tend to their background concentrations specific calculation equations for z d and t are shown in table s3 table s4 and table s5 respectively the symbols definitions values and sources of all the 55 parameters in the level iv fugacity model are provided in table s6 including 12 physicochemical parameters of paes 23 environmental parameters and 20 advection and emission parameters the calculated values of z d and t for the four paes were provided in table s7 s9 the fourth order runge kutta method was used to solve eq 1 3 with simulation time step of one day finally the molar concentrations c mol m3 of paes in the water and sediment were obtained according to c z f mackay and paterson 1991 and then converted to mass concentrations c 2 and c 4 respectively therefore the calculation equations are as follows 4 c 2 f 2 z 2 m 10 6 5 c 4 f 4 z 43 m 10 6 ρ 43 where c 2 is the mass concentration of paes in water ng l m is molecular mass of paes g mol c 4 is the mass concentration of paes in sediment ng g and ρ 43 is the density of solids in sediment kg m3 2 4 model coupling and validation method the level iv fugacity model was constructed by the eco lab module of mike zero in order to unify the concentration units in different environmental media fugacity was calculated instead of concentration mackay 1979 and the fugacity f of the four paes in the water and sediment phase was set as state variables the concentration of paes in the air phase obtained from previous study ji et al 2014 was transformed into fugacity value f 1 and set as a constant in the fugacity model the average annual discharge concentrations of paes from reclaimed water in table s2 were also converted into corresponding fugacity values f e2 mean and set in the boundary condition as the specified discharge in the hydrodynamic module of mike 21 in addition reclaimed water inflow r 1 and lake water outflow r 2 were also set as the annual average values the specific values of f 1 f e2 mean r 1 and r 2 are shown in table s6 as well as the other parameters on this basis the hydrodynamic model and the level iv fugacity model were coupled with the same calculation step of one day and thus a dynamic fugacity model with spatial differentiation characteristics was constructed an initial simulation of 365 days was carried out to achieve the steady state of the chemical distribution in the receiving lake system which was taken as the environmental background for further monthly simulations the output of the coupled model includes two parts hydrodynamic results flow direction and speed and spatial fate and distribution of chemicals in environmental media fugacity and concentration the fugacity of chemicals paes in this study in water phase f 2 pa and sediment phase f 4 pa was obtained for each grid presenting spatial heterogeneity in a visual form as well as their concentration distribution in water phase c 2 ng l and sediment phase c 4 ng g based on the steady state of the 365th day as the environmental background continuous month to month simulation was conducted from november 2020 to november 2021 according to the monthly recharge flow of reclaimed water and the monthly discharge concentration of chemicals in reclaimed water to describe the spatiotemporal characteristics of chemicals in lake water and sediment the simulations for january february and september 2021 without measured data were based on the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water in the previous month the specific values of monthly pae concentration fugacity and recharge flow are shown in table s2 table s6 and table s10 respectively model validation was performed by comparing the simulated concentrations of paes with their measured values in water and sediment at each sampling site i e the eight sampling points 2 9 in this study for each month 2 5 model uncertainty and sensitivity analysis the uncertainties of parameters were taken into account in modeling to determine their influence on the simulation results and the extent to which each parameter contributes to the overall uncertainty the output results of the coupled level iv fugacity model with spatiotemporal heterogeneity include the distribution of chemicals in the water and sediment phase in each grid which is difficult to conduct uncertainty analysis due to the characteristics of numerous grid outputs slow calculation and long time consumption therefore the model was simplified by level ⅲ fugacity model mackay et al 1983a without spatial temporal heterogeneity to conduct uncertainty analysis and monte carlo simulation was performed with 20 000 iterations using crystal ball 11 1 2 4 software parameters related to water and sediment volume were defined as constants based on measured data such as water surface area a 2 water volume v 2 and active layer depth of sediment h 4 temperature t and water inflow r 1 were defined as uniform distribution based on actual monitoring data and water outflow r 2 was defined as a function of r 1 based on water balance in addition the concentrations of paes in reclaimed water c 2 were fitted as lognormal distributions based on monthly measured data and the discharge rate of chemicals into water e 2 was defined as a function of c 2 and r 1 according to huang et al 2019 the remaining parameters were set to follow lognormal distribution the specific settings of parameters in uncertainty analysis are provided in table s11 the coefficient of variation cv of the pae simulated concentration calculated as the ratio of standard deviation to the mean was used to describe the uncertainty of the model output simultaneously the sensitivity analysis of parameters was also carried out by crystal ball software 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation in the initial simulation with f 1 f e2 mean r 1 and r 2 as annual averages the grid weighted average concentrations gwac of paes in the water and sediment phases of the whole lake over the simulation time are shown in fig s2 gwac was obtained by multiplying the concentration of the chemical in each grid by the volume of the grid and dividing by the total volume of the phase the simulated distribution of dmp dep dbp and dehp in water phase tended to be stable on the 120th 110th 162th and 120th day respectively fig s2 a while it took longer time for those in sediment phase to achieve their stable states which was on 160th 160th 190th and 191th days for dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively fig s2 b this is due to water advection which facilitates the transport of chemicals in water to reach their steady states more quickly and simultaneous air water interface transport speed up the process ao et al 2009 as can be seen from the rapid rise in fig s2 a after reaching the simulated steady state monthly simulations were conducted to verify the coupled model by comparing the monthly measured and predicted concentrations of paes in water and sediment at each sample point as shown in fig s1 the deviations between the measured and simulated results for the 4 paes are all within 1 0 order of magnitude indicating that they have a good agreement huang et al 2019 despite the complexities of chemical transport processes and lake hydrodynamics the simulation results are basically consistent with the observed overall spatiotemporal trends of pae concentrations which proves that the model can accurately reflect the influence of lake hydrodynamics on chemical distribution the differences between the measured and simulated results may be caused by the following factors 1 the uncertainty of model parameters such as h k oc half lives and monitoring data of paes in the air which were from literatures rather than actual measurement and taken as constant values throughout the simulation duration 2 the aquatic biota was ignored to simplify the model which is common in multimedia models because they rarely accumulate an appreciable fraction of the total solute mass mackay et al 1983a and 3 some uncertain disturbance factors in nature such as strong winds and storms rainwater runoff ice period activities of aquatic organisms anthropogenic activities around the lake and so on nevertheless the model meets the accuracy requirements and can achieve the objective of describing the spatial distribution characteristics of chemicals in lake water and sediment thus providing reliable guidance for the management of the chemicals as shown in fig s1 the differences between simulated and measured concentration of paes in sediment phase are generally larger than those in water phase in addition the time variation law of each pae tends to be consistent among these sampling points but the time variation trends of the four paes at the same sampling point are different therefore further two dimensional spatial analysis and transfer flux analysis are needed to determine the distribution characteristics and mechanisms of each pae in lake water and sediment 3 2 flow field analysis the hydrodynamic simulation result on the 365th day is shown as fig 4 including the flow direction and flow velocity distribution of the water body it can be seen that the flow velocity in the study area is 3 92 10 6 1 80 10 2 m s which is extremely slow and dead water corners are easy to appear at the crooked boundaries two large circulations exist in the northern and southern zones of the jing lake respectively which are mainly affected by the irregular shape of lake shoreline local topography and the only water inlet and water outlet besides there are also some smaller internal vortices at the northeast and northwest corners of the lake and between the two large circulations in this situation the lake water in the northern zone is difficult to exchange with the external water body in contrast the southern zone is located between the inlet and outlet of the lake facilitating the diffusion and exchange of water bodies 3 3 paes spatial distribution in water and sediment the two dimensional steady state simulation results of the four paes in the water of the jing lake on the 365th day are shown in fig 5 which are used to analyze their spatial distribution rules and mechanisms under the long term recharge of reclaimed water the simulated concentration ranges of dmp dep dbp and dehp in lake water are 0 83 679 42 ng l 0 11 454 86 ng l 0 44 1237 85 ng l and 2 44 292 24 ng l respectively among them dbp in the water column has the highest average concentration gwacdbp 250 56 ng l which is related to its high level mean concentration 342 17 ng l in the recharged reclaimed water obviously higher than the other three paes in addition the cvs of dmp dep dbp and dehp concentrations in water phase were calculated by the ratio of grid weighted standard deviation gwsd to gwac which were 0 30 0 37 0 35 and 0 39 respectively suggesting a great deal of spatial variability as can be seen the distribution of paes in the water column shown in fig 5 is closely related to the lake hydrodynamics shown in fig 4 the water flow field in the southern zone of the lake promotes the rapid exchange with the replenished reclaimed water from w 1 resulting in the pae concentrations in this zone close to those in the reclaimed water in contrast the large internal vortex in the northern zone makes it difficult to exchange with the southern water body which leads to the difference in the concentration of paes between the northern and southern zones in addition the small internal vortices and viscous force of water flow at the northern boundaries also cause slow water exchange resulting in large differences of pae concentrations between these boundaries and the recharging inlet at w 1 this reveals that long term flow field leads to a great deal of spatial variability of chemicals in the water column it should be noted that the concentrations of dep and dbp in the northern water body are significantly lower than those in the southern zone while the opposite trend is observed for dmp and dehp this is most likely influenced by different transports of paes between water and atmosphere since chemical concentrations in the southern zone near the recharge inlet of reclaimed water always tend to be close to their levels in reclaimed water it can be inferred that dep and dbp mainly enter the lake by reclaimed water recharge then transport by water advection along with degradation and migration into air and sediment and thus decrease in the northern zone far away from the recharge inlet in contrast reclaimed water recharge appears to have a dilution effect on dmp and dehp in lake water and the gwacs of dmp 114 76 ng l and dehp 117 41 ng l in lake water are even higher than their mean concentrations in reclaimed water 80 83 ng l and 52 01 ng l respectively suggesting that their main source in the lake is probably atmospheric input rather than reclaimed water recharge moreover although the mean concentrations of dmp 80 83 ng l in reclaimed water was higher than that of dehp 52 01 ng l their gwacs in the lake water phase are very similar however the spatial variability of dehp cv 0 39 is greater than that of dmp cv 0 30 it can be speculated that dehp in the lake water probably has more atmospheric input or less output degradation or transfer to sediment than dmp this may be due to the fact that dehp with higher molecular weight has higher air water partition coefficient k aw aerosol air partition coefficient k qa and reaction half life in water t 2 than dmp which allows dehp to transfer from air to water and accumulate more easily in the northern water body resulting in higher spatial heterogeneity cousins et al 2003 net et al 2015b these indicate that chemicals may have different spatial heterogeneity even under the same hydrodynamic conditions which depends on their physicochemical properties emission sources and environmental conditions fig 6 shows the simulated spatial distributions of the four paes in the sediment of the jing lake at steady state the concentrations of dmp dep dbp and dehp in sediments are 1 77 10 3 77 47 ng g 4 22 10 2 45 68 ng g 1 65 10 1 187 09 ng g and 6 77 10 3 353 55 ng g respectively which also show great spatial heterogeneity especially for dehp in addition the cvs of pae concentrations in the sediment dmp 0 86 dep 0 62 dbp 0 64 and dehp 0 99 are generally higher than those in the water basically due to that the non flowing characteristic of sediments increases the spatial heterogeneity of chemical distribution obviously the spatial distributions of paes in the sediment shown in fig 6 are also closely related to lake hydrodynamics but different from those in the water column shown in fig 5 the four paes in the sediment of the northern zone are all remarkably greater than those of the southern zone even though the concentrations of dep and dbp are higher in the southern water than those in the northern water indicating that the paes in the overlying water of the northern zone are easier to migrate into the sediment regardless of their spatial differences in water phase this is attributed to the longer advection residence time in the northern zone of the lake caused by the slow exchange state and low flow velocity of the overlying water body by contrast the rapid water exchange rate in the southern zone of the lake promotes paes removal by water advection output thus preventing their migration into sediments this distribution rule of chemicals in sediment has never been revealed in previous studies where lakes were usually regarded as a homogeneous system without considering spatial heterogeneity guo et al 2019 du et al 2020 wang et al 2020 cai et al 2022 on the other hand basin scale fugacity models always show that the spatial heterogeneity of pollutants tends to be consistent among various environmental components zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b dong et al 2019 chen et al 2022 which is different from those in lake systems with non uniform flow characteristics it can be inferred that this rule also applies to chemicals in other flowing lake systems therefore in the case of long term stable discharge points the areas with weak water exchange and slow flow that are far away from the discharge outlets might be the key areas for sediment pollution control in addition among the four paes in the sediment dehp has the most significant spatial heterogeneity with the highest variation coefficient of 0 99 followed by dmp 0 86 which is related to their spatial heterogeneity in water phase the physiochemical properties of these two chemicals are quite different but both of them have higher concentration levels in the northern water body than in the southern water body which is consistent with their spatial distribution characteristics in the sediment phase in contrast the spatial distribution of dep and dbp in water phase is exactly opposite to that in sediment phase which can reduce their spatial heterogeneity in sediment phase to a certain extent through the cross interface transport of water and sediment resulting in lower cv values than dmp and dehp furthermore although the gwacs of dmp and dehp in the lake water are very similar 114 76 ng l and 117 41 ng l respectively the gwac of dehp 20 17 ng g in the sediment phase is obviously higher than that of dmp 6 22 ng g indicating that dehp accumulates in sediment phase more easily than dmp probably due to its higher octanol water partition coefficient logk ow organic carbon water partition coefficient k oc and reaction half lives in sediment t 4 net et al 2015b therefore the spatial heterogeneity of chemicals in sediment phase is affected by both their physicochemical properties and spatial heterogeneity in overlying water further analysis of transfer flux is necessary to determine their sources and fates in the lake system and quantitatively identify the underlying reasons of the differences so as to provide the basis for scientific and effective environmental management 3 4 the fate and transport of paes in the lake the transfer fluxes of paes in the water sediment and lake system were calculated based on their gwacs as shown in fig 7 a c and specific data are provided in table s9 fig 7 a reveals the different dominant sources of the four paes in the water phase which could explain the difference in their spatial distribution in the lake water shown in fig 5 transfer from air to water t 12 t 12r t 12d t 12w t 12a is the dominating source of dmp and dehp in the water phase accounting for 77 42 and 90 31 of the total source t 12 e 2 respectively as a result dmp and dehp accumulate over time in the northern water body of the lake with slow water exchange and present higher concentrations than in the southern zone in contrast reclaimed water recharge e 2 is the dominating source of dep and dbp in the water phase accounting for 86 86 and 79 25 of the total source t 12 e 2 respectively this leads to the higher levels of dep and dbp in the southern water body of the lake under the influence of the flow field by reclaimed water recharge the main removal mechanism of paes from the water phase is advection outflow of lake water t 20f t 20wf t 20pf which accounts for 62 62 dmp 61 89 dep 58 83 dbp and 53 55 dehp of the total removal mechanisms t 20f t 21 t 24 t 20t respectively the proportions of pae transfer fluxes between phases are shown in fig s3 in the processes of diffusion from air to water t 12 dmp and dep with low molecular weight are predominantly transported through rain dissolution t 12r accounting for 94 01 and 84 57 of t 12 respectively while dehp with high molecular weight is mainly transported through wet aerosol deposition t 12w 64 27 and dry aerosol deposition t 12d 35 56 dbp with moderate molecular weight is transported through a combination of the four pathways t 12r 23 94 t 12d 20 10 t 12w 36 33 and t 12a 19 64 this is related to the fact that the aerosol air partition coefficient k qa of chemicals increases with increasing molecular weight which makes dehp existing in the atmosphere tend to be significantly adsorbed to aerosol particles in addition the henry constant h increase with the increase of molecular weight resulting in a higher proportion of paes with moderate or high molecular weight dbp and dehp transferring from water to air t 21 t 21v the net input fluxes of paes from air to water t 12 t 21 are 7 33 kg y dmp 0 50 kg y dep 2 17 kg y dbp and 10 34 kg y dehp respectively which suggests that air input is an important source of paes in the lake system especially for dmp and dehp as shown in the fig 7 b transfer from water to sediment t 24 is the only source of paes in sediments the proportion of sedimentation t 24s of paes increases with the increase of molecular weight while the proportion of water sediment diffusion t 24t decreases fig s3 dmp dep and dbp transfer from water to sediment mainly through t 24t accounting for 97 30 85 74 and 54 77 of t 24 respectively while dehp transfers from water to sediment mainly through t 24s 73 86 fig s3 in the northern zone weak water exchange and slow advection promote the sedimentation of particles which enhances the transfer of dehp by t 24t and leads to the accumulation of dehp in sediment phase further increasing the spatial heterogeneity of dehp in the sediment of the lake on the other hand the major output pathway of dmp dep and dbp is sediment water transfer t 42 t 42t t 42n which accounts for 92 34 66 87 and 57 49 of the total output t 42 t 40b t 40t respectively fig s3 the transfer of paes from sediment to water t 42 is dominated by sediment water diffusion t 42t accounting for more than 95 of t 42 but the amount of t 42 is negligible compared with t 24 except for dmp the net input fluxes from water to sediment t 24 t 42 are 0 39 kg y for dmp 0 37 kg y for dep 1 39 kg y for dbp and 1 23 kg y for dehp indicating that sediment is an important sink for paes especially for those with moderate or high molecular weight in addition due to the high reaction half lives in sediment transformation flux in sediment t 40t of the four paes is much less than their transformation in water t 20t which further promotes their accumulation in the sediment as shown in the fig 7 c the paes in the lake system including lake water and sediment have two sources atmospheric input t 12 and reclaimed water recharge e 2 the former t 12 is the main source of dmp and dehp in the lake system accounting for 78 04 and 90 33 of the total input flux e 2 t 12 respectively while reclaimed water recharge e 2 is the main source of dep and dbp in the lake system which respectively accounts for 87 08 and 79 31 of their total input flux on the other hand the main loss pathway of paes from the lake system is water outflow t 02f which reaches 69 29 69 18 68 57 and 67 48 of the total output fluxes t 02f t 21 t t t 40b for dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively transformation t t t 20t t 40t is also an important loss pathway for dmp dep and dbp accounting for 30 61 30 57 and 30 22 of the total output flux respectively while only 9 03 for dehp this is due to that the degradation rates of dehp in both water and sediment are much lower than the other three paes the amount of residue in the lake system e 2 t 12 t 02f t 21 t t t 40b is 5 08 kg y for dmp 0 76 kg y for dep 2 58 kg y for dbp and 7 95 kg y for dehp which is determined by the total inputs of paes in the system their physiochemical properties and the hydrodynamic flow field 3 5 uncertainty and sensitivity of parameters based on the monte carlo simulation results with 20 000 iterations most of the simulated concentrations of paes in water and sediment phases conform to lognormal distribution as shown in fig s4 the cvs of pae concentrations in water phase dmp 0 17 dep 0 15 dbp 0 08 dehp 0 15 are lower than those in sediment phase dmp 0 21 dep 0 25 dbp 0 23 dehp 0 29 indicating higher uncertainty of pae concentrations in sediment phase the sensitivity analysis results of parameters by crystal ball software include sensitivity coefficients of parameters and their variance contribution to the uncertainty of model outputs as shown in table s12 the positive and negative values respectively represent the positive and negative influence on the simulation results parameters that contribute more than 1 absolute value to the uncertainty variance of the simulation results are regarded as sensitive parameters as shown in fig s5 as can be seen three emission parameters c 1 c 2 r 1 contribute greatly to the uncertainty of pae concentrations in water phase accounting for 25 7 75 0 57 5 and 50 7 of the total uncertainty of dmp dep dbp and dehp respectively in addition dmp 25 3 and dehp 39 0 are most affected by their concentrations in air c 1 while dep 64 1 and dbp 47 2 are most affected by its concentration in reclaimed water c 2 and reclaimed water inflow r 1 respectively which is consistent with the conclusion in section 3 4 that dmp and dehp in the water phase are mainly from atmospheric input while dep and dehp are mainly from reclaimed water discharge besides physicochemical parameters also have significant influence on the concentrations of paes in water phase especially accounting for 51 3 of the total uncertainty of dmp with low molecular weight henry constant h represents the partition of chemicals between water and air phase and its sensitivity on paes in the water phase decreases with the increase of molecular weight which accounts for 25 of the total uncertainty of dmp much higher than dep 8 dbp 1 8 and dehp 0 0 this is due to the fact that the main source of dmp in the lake is rain dissolution t 12r which is decided by its low h value representing its high solubility in water phase the reaction half lives in water t 2 of paes reflect their degradation time in water which have a significant positive effect on their concentrations in water phase among the environmental parameters scavenging ratio r 7 favors the transfer of paes from air to water by wet aerosol deposition t 12w which is the main source of dehp in the water phase and accounts for 16 2 of its total uncertainty rain rate r 8 is conducive to the transfer of paes from air phase to water phase by rain dissolution t 12r and has a positive effect on the concentrations of the four paes in water phase obviously most sensitive parameters for the concentrations of paes in water phase are also sensitive parameters for those in sediment phase and influence the simulation results in the same direction positive or negative this is because the water phase is the only source of paes in sediment phase furthermore since the tendency of paes to migrate into sediments especially into solids also increases with increasing molecular weight more environmental parameters can significantly affect the concentrations of paes in sediments such as ρ 43 s 4 ρ 23 r 3 φ23 the variance contributions of environmental parameters to dmp dep dbp and dehp concentrations in sediment phase are 30 8 49 8 66 5 and 68 5 respectively this may explain the higher cv values of pae concentrations and the greater deviations between simulated and measured values in sediment phase than those in water phase among the environmental parameters the increase of density of solids in sediment ρ 43 increases the dry weight per unit volume of sediment thus reducing the pae concentrations per unit of dry weight sediment the sedimentation of particles from water phase to sediment phase reflected by ρ 23 r 3 and φ23 obviously contributes to the concentrations of dbp and dehp in sediment phase in addition among the physicochemical parameters the reaction half lives in sediment t 4 reflect the degradation time of paes in sediments and k oc affects the partition of paes between water and sediment phase thus positively influencing the concentration of paes in sediment phase in particular the concentration of dmp in sediment phase is mainly affected by physicochemical parameters 50 6 which is similar to that in water phase it should be noted that although the current study is based on best available chemical property values having assumed log normal distributions with reasonable confidence factors with reference to literatures huang et al 2019 further measurements of chemical properties may yield better defined distributions and potentially more reliable ranges of model outputs nonetheless this analysis can provide a more realistic and balanced description of the likely environmental fate of paes and more rational basis for regulatory decisions 4 conclusion in this study a novel dynamic multimedia model with spatial differentiation was successfully constructed by coupling the level iv fugacity model with lake hydrodynamic model which is particularly suitable for simulating the transport process and spatiotemporal distribution of chemicals in flowing lake systems the proposed model can provide quantitative and visual information on the dynamic fate and distribution of chemicals in water and sediment with spatial differentiation through its application on paes in a lake recharged by reclaimed water it is found that the distributions of paes in water and sediment of the lake have great spatial heterogeneity but with different rules which depends on the long term influence of flow field and the chemical multimedia transport process determined by emission sources physicochemical properties and environmental conditions the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis revealed the important parameters affecting the multimedia distribution of each pae in addition our model can identify the major pollutants in each component and corresponding major contamination areas under the long term influence of hydrodynamics as well as their source fate and transport process which can also be extended to other flowing surface water systems such as rivers and estuaries accurate understanding of the fate and spatial distribution of chemicals between and within media is

15068,as a ubiquitous emerging pollutant microplastics can interact with algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems currently knowledge on how microplastics influence algae bacteria is mostly limited to toxicity tests using either monocultures of algae bacteria or specific algal bacterial consortium however information on the effect of microplastics on algal and bacterial communities in natural habitats is not easily available here we conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the effect of nanoplastics on algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems dominated by different submerged macrophytes the community structure of algae and bacteria suspended in the water column planktonic and attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes phyllospheric were identified respectively results showed that both planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria were more susceptible to nanoplastics and these variations driven by decreased bacterial diversity and increased abundance of microplastic degrading taxa especially in aquatic systems dominated by v natans the community composition of both algae and bacteria were influenced to varying degrees by nanoplastics and or plant types but rda results showed that only bacterial community composition was strongly correlated with environmental variables correlation network analysis showed that nanoplastics not only reduced the intensity of associations between planktonic algae and bacteria average degree reduced from 4 88 to 3 24 but also reduced proportion of positive correlations from 64 to 36 besides nanoplastics also decreased the algal bacterial connections between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats our study elucidates the potential interactions between nanoplastics and algal bacterial community in natural aquatic ecosystems these findings suggest that in aquatic ecosystems bacterial community are more vulnerable to nanoplastics and may serve as a protective barrier for algae community further research is needed to reveal the protective mechanism of bacteria against algae at the community level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phyllosphere phytoplankton microplastics algae bacteria interaction association network submerged macrophytes data availability data will be made available on request algae and bacteria numerically dominate microbial community and play essential roles in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2014 ramanan et al 2016 the coexistent relationship between algae and bacteria has been established since the early stages of evolution croft et al 2005 ramanan et al 2016 and published studies have shown that different types of interactions shape specific partnerships between algae and bacteria rana and kumar 2022 these algae bacteria interactions affect the physiology and metabolism of both partners zhou et al 2016 which have important implications for the balance of aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles kouzuma and watanabe 2015 you et al 2021 as an emerging environmental pollutant on the global scale microplastics have received increasing scientific attention due to their high ecological risks and potential adverse effects wu et al 2019 liu et al 2022 microplastics have been frequently detected throughout various aquatic ecosystems vivekanand et al 2021 which provides opportunity for them to interact with algae and bacteria rana and kumar 2022 as typical model organisms for toxicity tests you et al 2021 algae and bacteria are widely used to test the potential hazard and risk of microplastics in the aquatic environment hao et al 2022 hitchcock 2022 numerous studies have been conducted to test the toxicity of microplastics to algae and bacteria individually and a few others have tested the effects of microplastics on algal bacterial consortium huang et al 2022 rana and kumar 2022 however these published studies are mostly based on laboratory exposure experiments and use specific algal bacterial species isolated from others hitchcock 2022 which cannot realistically reveal the effects of microplastics on algae and bacteria in natural aquatic ecosystems the interactions of organisms in their natural habitats modulate species diversity and broader ecosystem properties and functions hitchcock 2022 it is therefore necessary to test algal and bacterial responses to microplastics at the community scale submerged macrophytes as one of the main primary producers of aquatic ecosystems play important roles in the construction of community structures jeppesen et al 2012 the presence of submerged plants can provide diverse habitats for algal and bacterial communities hao et al 2017 schlechter et al 2019 and even microplastics suspended in the water column yu et al 2022c this means that in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes microplastics can interact not only with planktonic algae bacteria suspended in the water column but also with phyllospheric algae bacteria attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes multiple previous studies have described the community structure and function of algae or bacteria attached to submerged macrophytes and in the surrounding water hao et al 2017 ma et al 2021 yu et al 2022c in aquatic ecosystem the presence of microplastics may affect the interaction and balance between submerged macrophytes and algae bacteria in planktonic and phytospheric habitats however to date too little attention has been paid here we conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate how nanoplastics influence algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems dominated by three submerged macrophytes vallisneria natans potamogeton maackianus and myriophyllum spicatum respectively polystyrene latex beads were selected as the representative of nanoplastics to be added to half of the aquatic ecosystems while the other half has no added nanoplastics all algae and bacteria taxa suspended in the water column planktonic and attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes phyllospheric were collected and identified for both planktonic and phyllospheric microbial communities we hypothesized that 1 algal and bacterial communities would be affected by nanoplastics and these effects may also vary among submerged macrophytes 2 nanoplastics may reduce microbial diversity there by affecting the associations between algae and bacteria communities 1 materials and methods 1 1 experimental design a mesocosm experiment consisting of 32 beakers volume 2 l was conducted from may 14 2022 to june 21 2022 in guangzhou china a factorial design consisting of four plant types and two nanoplastics scenarios was applied fig s1 three common submerged macrophytes v natans p maackianus m spicatum with different morphological structures were selected and the aquatic ecosystem without submerged macrophytes was used as a control polystyrene ps were selected as representative of nanoplastics because it is not only one of the most widely used plastic polymers but also one of the main components of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems hao et al 2022 nano ps latex beads dimeter

monocultures of algae bacteria or specific algal bacterial consortium hao et al 2022 huang et al 2022 which aims to unravel the response of natural algal and bacterial communities to high concentrations of nano ps 1 2 environmental parameters measurement after 35 days of cultivation june 21 environmental variables including water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electric

significantly influenced by the main and interactive effect of plant and nanoplastics table 1 fig 1 a in contrast planktonic bacterial diversity was significantly affected by plant types and nanoplastics table 1 nanoplastics significantly reduced the chao1 shannon and simpson indices of planktonic bacteria especially in the control and v natans groups fig 1b 2 2 2 community composition taxonomic composition of planktonic algae was significantly influenced by nanoplastics and nanoplastics plant table 2 results of post hoc pairwise tests showed that nanoplastics significantly altered

more than 90 of the total abundance of the planktonic algae the most abundant bacteria phyla were proteobacteria 48 followed by bacteroidetes 18 and cyanobacteria 12 fig s2 among the different treatments the dominant planktonic algae taxa and bacterial families are listed in table s3 2 3 phyllospheric algae and bacteria 2 3 1 abundance and diversity consistent with planktonic algae neither biomass nor alpha diversity s shannon simpson of phyllospheric algae were significantly influenced by the main and interactive effect of plant and nanoplastics table 1 fig 3 a the diversity indices chao1 shannon and simpson of phyllospheric bacteria were significantly higher in the no ps group than in the with ps group table 1 fig 3b besides bacterial shannon and simpson indices were also significantly influenced by plant nanoplastics table 1 as demonstrated by significant differences between no ps and with ps in the v natans and p maackianus groups fig 3b 2 3 2 community composition

12 fig s3 among the different treatments the dominant phyllospheric algae taxa and bacterial families are listed in table s3 2 4 algae bacteria community and environment redundancy analysis rda indicated that the taxonomic composition of planktonic phyllospheric algae was not significantly correlated with environmental parameters all p values 0 05 in contrast rda revealed that total nitrogen tn electric conductivity ec and the content of nanoplastics ps content were important factors that significantly affected planktonic bacterial composition explaining 15 of the variation adjusted r2 fig 5 a as the fig shows tn was negatively related to ps content and no ps treatments were distributed in the positive direction of tn separate from the with ps treatments fig 5a planktonic bacterial families such as microbacteriaceae ack m1 and oxalobacteraceae were positively correlated with ps content fig 5a in addition plant biomass accumulation bio accum ps content and dissolved oxygen do were important factors that significantly affected phyllospheric bacterial composition explaining 20 of the variation adjusted r2 fig 5b plant biomass accumulation was positively correlated with rda axis 1 while do and ps content were positively correlated with rda axis 2 phyllospheric bacterial families such as gloeobacteraceae pseudanabaenaceae and synechococcaceae were positively related to do and ps content fig 5b 2 5 correlation network 2 5 1 correlation between algal and bacterial communities correlation networks describe significant correlations between algal and bacterial communities in the no ps and with ps groups respectively fig 6 as can be seen from the fig 6a the associations between planktonic algae and bacteria were visually more complex in the no ps group than in the with ps group the degree and the number of nodes and edges of the network were higher in the no ps group than in the with ps group table 3 interestingly nanoplastics also reduced the proportion of positive correlations from 64 in the no ps group to 43 in the with ps group table 3 erysipelotrichaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the key nodes with the highest degree in the no ps group and acetobacteraceae was the key node with the maximum closeness centrality while chthoniobacteraceae was the key node with highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality and closeness centrality in the with ps group fig 6a nanoplastics slightly increased the associations between phyllospheric algae and bacteria but the proportion of positive correlations was similar between the no ps and with ps groups fig 6b table 3 synechococcaceae was the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality in the no ps group while rhizobiaceae was the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality in the with ps group fig 6b 2 5 2 correlation between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats in addition nanoplastics decreased the degree and the number of nodes and edges of the algal bacterial networks between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats fig s4 table s2 the proportions of positive correlations of the network were higher for algae than for bacteria but similar in the no ps and with ps group table s2 planktonic algae crucigenia apiculata and phyllospheric algae staurodesmus sp were the key nodes with the maximum betweenness centrality and closeness centrality in the no ps group and the with ps group respectively fig s4 planktonic bacteria erysipelotrichaceae and phyllospheric bacteria synechococcaceae were the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum closeness centrality in the no ps and with ps group respectively fig s4 3 discussion 3 1 algal and bacterial communities respond differently to treatments our results demonstrate that the biomass and diversity of planktonic and phyllospheric algae were less susceptible to nanoplastics in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes this contrast with published toxicity test results that microplastics especially nanoplastics can inhibit the growth of algae through blocking photosynthesis mao et al 2018 hetero agglomeration bhattacharya et al 2010 increased oxidative stress fu et al 2019 physical damage hao et al 2022 etc this difference indicates that the response mechanism of algae community to nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystems may be completely different from that of algae species grown in monoculture to date however only a handful of studies have investigated how microplastics affect algal community structures in natural habitats therefore it is essential that the response of ecological communities to microplastics is tested in addition to single species studies recently hitchcock 2022 investigated the potential risk of microplastics to natural phytoplankton community and found that high concentrations of microplastics significantly altered phytoplankton community composition consistent with hitchcock s results the community composition of planktonic algae in this study was also significantly affected by nanoplastics in scenario with nanoplastics addition planktonic algae species such as onychonema filiforme treubaria sp peridinium sp increase in abundance while eudorina trachelomonas sp pediastrum simplex experienced reductions in abundance table s3 this highlights the large variation in species specific responses of algae to nanoplastics in natural aquatic environment hitchcock 2022 which may be a potential explanation for the fact that planktonic algal biomass and diversity were not affected by nanoplastics in our study in addition the interaction between algae and other microbes such as bacteria may regulate the response mechanism of algal community to nanoplastics in natural habitats ramanan et al 2016 you et al 2021 which has rarely been studied in previous research unlike planktonic algae community the community composition of phyllospheric algae was more influenced by plant types rather than nanoplastics this supports our previous contention that host macrophytes exert a greater impact on the community structure of attached algae not only through morphological structural complexity but also through the release of nutrients and or allelochemicals hao et al 2017 the different biomass accumulation of the three submerged macrophytes in this study indicated that individual variation in plant metabolism may be a potential factor affecting phyllospheric algae composition overall by exploring the response of algal community to nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystem our study found that planktonic algal community interact more closely with nanoplastics suspended in the water column while phyllospheric algal community are more susceptible to host macrophytes it has been widely documented that microplastics exposure typically results in reduced bacterial diversity yu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 especially at high doses agathokleous et al 2021 similar results were also observed in our current study for instance nanoplastics decreased the diversity of planktonic bacteria in the control and v natans groups and the diversity of phyllospheric bacteria in the v natans and p maackianus groups but it had no influence on the diversity of planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria in the m spicatum group these results suggest that the physiological and metabolic characteristics of different submerged macrophytes may be an important factor influencing the interaction between bacteria and nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystem van weert et al 2019 in addition to bacterial diversity high concentration of microplastics has also been shown to alter bacterial community composition at the phylum level li et al 2022 yu et al 2022a and these variations were driven by the increased abundance of some bacterial taxa capable of degrading microplastics agathokleous et al 2021 steinman et al 2020 in our study the relative abundances of microplastic degrading bacteria such as actinomycetes proteobacteria and cyanobacteria increased in scenario with nanoplastics addition figs s2 and s3 the degree of increase caused by nanoplastics varied between different plant types as well as between planktonic and phyllospheric bacterial community this may be attributed to the discrepancy in the composition and abundance of bacterial otus belonging to these phyla across treatments aira et al 2015 3 2 bacterial community are more susceptible to environmental factors the rda results indicated that environmental variables significantly influenced and explained the community composition of bacteria rather than algae the content of nanoplastics ps content was shown to be a common factor affecting the community composition of both planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria denitrifying bacteria such as microbacteriaceae and oxalobacteriaceae in planktonic bacteria and rhodobacteriaceae and sphingobacteriaceae in phyllosphere bacteria were positively correlated with ps content fig 5 this supports published result that microplastics have the potential to enhance microbial denitrification he et al 2011 su et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 which helps to explain the negative correlation between tn and ps content exhibited in planktonic bacteria rda furthermore bacterial community are known to be particularly sensitive to physicochemical properties such as ec and ph cheng et al 2018 yu et al 2021 in the present study ec was significantly influenced by main and interactive interactions of plants and nanoplastics becoming another pivotal factor affecting the composition of planktonic bacterial community dissolved oxygen do can control bacterial diversity and abundance thereby shaping bacterial community composition liu et al 2021 for example spietz et al 2015 demonstrated a strong negative relationship between do concentration and bacterial richness in a seasonally hypoxic estuary in our study the rda of phyllosphere bacteria showed that do concentrations increased with the abundance of plastic degrading cyanobacteria such as gloeobacteraceae pseudanabaenaceae and synechococcaceae cyanobacteria can also generate oxygen through photosynthesis while degrading nanoplastics basuki et al 2020 which results in the positive correlation between do and ps content fig 5 furthermore plant biomass accumulation was selected as another major factor affecting the community composition of phyllospheric bacteria along the horizontal axis of rda the location of three submerged macrophytes were separately from each other and the biomass accumulation was significantly different fig s1 these results suggest difference in the growth and metabolism of submerged macrophytes is another important factor contribute to phyllospheric bacterial composition yin et al 2020 and the different physiological and metabolic characteristics of host macrophytes lead to host specific epiphytic bacteria lachnit et al 2011 yu et al 2022c in contrast to bacterial communities the community composition of both planktonic and phyllsopheric algae in our study was less sensitive to environmental variables such as ps content ec etc this may be explained by the complicated interplay between algal and bacterial communities in natural environment ramanan et al 2016 it is noteworthy that healthy algae not only have the ability to control bacterial colonization on their surfaces but also may have mechanisms to inhibit bacterial overgrowth gonçalves et al 2017 kouzuma and watanabe 2015 moreover some algae can also determine the species and activity of the symbiont heterotrophic bacteria by producing transparent exopolymeric substances van oostende et al 2013 this kind of host selection mechanism mcloughlin et al 2016 may protect algal community structure from adverse environmental conditions 3 3 nanoplastics affect interactions between algae and bacteria previous studies have indicated that pollutants such as pesticides lu et al 2019 metals liu et al 2019 pharmaceutical and personal care products lu et al 2020 and aromatic pollutants luo et al 2014 can affect algae bacteria interactions through interfering with their symbiotic relationships you et al 2021 however experimental data on the mechanisms underlying the effects of microplastics on algae bacteria interaction is still lacking network analysis has been widely used to describe the complex microbial interactions and ecological assembly rules faust and raes 2012 as well as to reveal the response mechanism of microbial interactions to environmental changes hunt and ward 2015 in the present study network analysis indicated that nanoplastics decreased the intensity of association between planktonic algae and bacteria and the intensity of microbial connection between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats microplastic particles suspended in the water column can not only provide new niches for microbes in the aquatic environment yang et al 2020 but also interact with aquatic microbe scherer et al 2018 thereby blocking and reducing the association between planktonic microbes and the microbial connection between different habitats but meanwhile nanoplastics also slightly increased the associations between phyllospheric algae and bacteria according to the results of zhao et al 2022 epiphytic microbes on eelgrass leaves increased the aggregation of microplastics on plant surfaces by forming biofilms the settlement and accumulation of microplastics on macrophytes may provide opportunities for phyllospheric microbes to meet and interact with microplastic attached microbes this helps explain the slightly increased intensity of interaction between phyllospheric algae and bacteria caused by nanoplastics in our study more interestingly network analysis in our study also found that nanoplastics reduced the proportion of positive correlations between planktonic algae and bacteria table 3 positive interactions in association network typically indicate mutual cooperation in microbial assembly while negative interactions indicate competition ju et al 2014 pan et al 2022 for planktonic algae bacteria interactions the higher proportion of positive correlations in treatments without nanoplastics addition suggests that cooperation plays an important role whereas competition plays an important role in treatments with nanoplastics addition furthermore cooperation also outweighed competition in phyllospheric algae bacteria interactions and in algal bacterial interactions between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats regardless of the presence or absence of nanoplastics table s2 pollutants affect the physiological and ecological functions of algae and bacteria by interfering with their relationships you et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to reveal the influence mechanism of pollutants on algal bacterial interactions according to the results of laboratory tests conducted by ji et al 2019 and levy et al 2009 bacteria can serve as a protective barrier to effectively reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials and metals to their symbiotic algae singh et al 2019 found that the degradation of diuron by bacteria could alleviate the survival pressure of their coexisting green algae this protective effect of bacteria on algae may also exist in our study given the fact that bacterial communities were more susceptible to nanoplastics according to the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles to algal bacteria co culture proposed by rana and kumar 2022 nanoplastics may first interact with bacteria in our study leading to the aggregation of nanoplastics inside and outside bacterial cells due to the increase size nanoplastics were unable to interact or penetrate inside the algal cells with the same intensity and toxicity on the other hand reactive oxygen species produced by bacteria may also reduce the chance of algae interacting with nanoplastics rana and kumar 2022 as a result the toxicity of nanoplastics to algae may automatically be reduced and algae community can perform their functions with less or no variation in the aquatic system however our current findings cannot reveal this protective mechanism of bacterial community on algal community and deserve further investigation 4 conclusion our study provided experimental evidence on how nanoplastics affect algal and bacterial communities in natural aquatic ecosystems dominated by different submerged macrophytes results indicate that in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes nanoplastics significantly reduced bacterial diversity and changed bacterial community composition but had little influence on algal community furthermore network analysis showed nanoplastics reduced the associations between planktonic algae and bacteria and the microbial connections between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats we speculate nanoplastics may first interact with bacterial community in aquatic ecosystems thereby serving as a protective barrier to reduce the adverse effects of nanoplastics on algal community future research should focus on this protective mechanism between algal and bacterial communities in natural habitats which is more complicated and worth of further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15068,as a ubiquitous emerging pollutant microplastics can interact with algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems currently knowledge on how microplastics influence algae bacteria is mostly limited to toxicity tests using either monocultures of algae bacteria or specific algal bacterial consortium however information on the effect of microplastics on algal and bacterial communities in natural habitats is not easily available here we conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the effect of nanoplastics on algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems dominated by different submerged macrophytes the community structure of algae and bacteria suspended in the water column planktonic and attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes phyllospheric were identified respectively results showed that both planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria were more susceptible to nanoplastics and these variations driven by decreased bacterial diversity and increased abundance of microplastic degrading taxa especially in aquatic systems dominated by v natans the community composition of both algae and bacteria were influenced to varying degrees by nanoplastics and or plant types but rda results showed that only bacterial community composition was strongly correlated with environmental variables correlation network analysis showed that nanoplastics not only reduced the intensity of associations between planktonic algae and bacteria average degree reduced from 4 88 to 3 24 but also reduced proportion of positive correlations from 64 to 36 besides nanoplastics also decreased the algal bacterial connections between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats our study elucidates the potential interactions between nanoplastics and algal bacterial community in natural aquatic ecosystems these findings suggest that in aquatic ecosystems bacterial community are more vulnerable to nanoplastics and may serve as a protective barrier for algae

microplastics algae bacteria interaction association network submerged macrophytes data availability data will be made available on request algae and bacteria numerically dominate microbial community and play essential roles in the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems liu et al 2014 ramanan et al 2016 the coexistent relationship between algae and bacteria has been established since the early stages of evolution croft et al 2005 ramanan et al 2016 and published studies have shown that different types of interactions shape specific partnerships between algae and bacteria rana and kumar 2022 these algae bacteria interactions affect the physiology and metabolism of both partners zhou et al 2016 which have important implications for the balance of aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles kouzuma and watanabe 2015 you et al 2021 as an emerging environmental pollutant on the global scale microplastics have received increasing scientific attention due to their high ecological risks and potential adverse effects wu et al 2019 liu et al 2022 microplastics have been frequently detected throughout various aquatic ecosystems vivekanand et al 2021 which provides opportunity for them to interact with algae and bacteria rana and kumar 2022 as typical model organisms for toxicity tests you et al 2021 algae and bacteria are widely used to test the potential hazard and risk of microplastics in the aquatic environment hao et al 2022 hitchcock 2022 numerous studies have been conducted to test the toxicity of microplastics to algae and bacteria individually and a few others have tested the effects of microplastics on algal bacterial consortium huang et al 2022 rana and kumar 2022 however these published studies are mostly based on laboratory exposure experiments and use specific algal bacterial species isolated from others hitchcock 2022 which cannot realistically reveal the effects of microplastics on algae and bacteria in natural aquatic ecosystems the interactions of organisms in their natural habitats modulate species diversity and broader ecosystem properties and functions hitchcock 2022 it is therefore necessary to test algal and bacterial responses to microplastics at the community scale submerged macrophytes as one of the main primary producers of aquatic ecosystems play important roles in the construction of community structures jeppesen et al 2012 the presence of submerged plants can provide diverse habitats for algal and bacterial communities hao et al 2017 schlechter et al 2019 and even microplastics suspended in the water column yu et al 2022c this means that in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes microplastics can interact not only with planktonic algae bacteria suspended in the water column but also with phyllospheric algae bacteria attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes multiple previous studies have described the community structure and function of algae or bacteria attached to submerged macrophytes and in the surrounding water hao et al 2017 ma et al 2021 yu et al 2022c in aquatic ecosystem the presence of microplastics may affect the interaction and balance between submerged macrophytes and algae bacteria in planktonic and phytospheric habitats however to date too little attention has been paid here we conducted a mesocosm experiment to investigate how nanoplastics influence algal and bacterial communities in aquatic ecosystems dominated by three submerged macrophytes vallisneria natans potamogeton maackianus and myriophyllum spicatum respectively polystyrene latex beads were selected as the representative of nanoplastics to be added to half of the aquatic ecosystems while the other half has no added nanoplastics all algae and bacteria taxa suspended in the water column planktonic and attached to the surface of submerged macrophytes phyllospheric were collected and identified for both planktonic and phyllospheric microbial communities we hypothesized that 1 algal and bacterial communities would be affected by nanoplastics and these effects may also vary among submerged macrophytes 2 nanoplastics may reduce microbial diversity there by affecting the associations between algae and bacteria communities 1 materials and methods 1 1 experimental design a mesocosm experiment consisting of 32 beakers volume 2 l was conducted from may 14 2022 to june 21 2022 in guangzhou china a factorial design consisting of four plant types and two nanoplastics scenarios was applied fig s1 three common submerged macrophytes v natans p maackianus m spicatum with different morphological structures were selected and the aquatic ecosystem without submerged macrophytes was used as a control polystyrene ps were selected as representative of nanoplastics because it is not only one of the most widely used plastic polymers but also one of the main components of plastic debris in aquatic ecosystems hao et al 2022 nano ps latex beads dimeter

solution was added in each beaker of the with ps treatments and its final concentration was set to 20 mg l the concentration setting refers to published micro nano plastics toxicology tests using monocultures of algae bacteria or specific algal bacterial consortium hao et al 2022 huang et al 2022 which aims to unravel the response of natural algal and bacterial communities to high concentrations of nano ps 1 2 environmental parameters measurement after 35 days of cultivation june 21 environmental variables including water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do and electric

sampling 100 ml surficial water in each beaker were collected and fixed with lugol s solution another 400 ml of surficial water were collected and filtered with 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filters and the membranes were stored at 80 c until dna extraction of planktonic bacteria additionally submerged macrophytes were harvested from each beaker rinsed once with deionized water and then transferred to erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of sterile phosphate buffer saline ph 7 0 next place the erlenmeyer flask in an ultrasonic cleaner 400 w sonicated for 1 min then shaken for 30 s repeat this step 5 times to extract algae and bacteria attached to the plant surface into phosphate buffer saline afterwards the plant material was weighed fresh weight fw g and biomass accumulation was calculated which was then placed in a plastic bag for digital photographs the surface area of plant was calculated using imagej software the wash off buffer was separated into two subsamples one fixed with lugol s solution for identification and enumeration of phyllospheric algae the other filtered with 0 22 µm polycarbonate membrane filters and stored at 80 c until dna extraction for phyllospheric bacteria 1 4 algae and bacteria identification samples of planktonic phyllospheric algae were identified and counted using an inverted microscope the biomass of planktonic and phyllospheric algae were expressed as the microgram per liter of water µg l and microgram per square centimeter of plant surface µg cm 2 respectively algal diversity was analyzed considering three

significantly influenced by the main and interactive effect of plant and nanoplastics table 1 fig 1 a in contrast planktonic bacterial diversity was significantly affected by plant types and

regardless of the presence or absence of nanoplastics fig 2b p 0 05 in total 75 planktonic algae taxa and 6835 planktonic bacteria otus were observed chlorophyta was the dominant phyla accounting for more than 90 of the total abundance of the planktonic algae the most abundant bacteria phyla were proteobacteria 48 followed by bacteroidetes 18 and cyanobacteria 12 fig s2 among the different treatments the dominant planktonic algae taxa and bacterial families are listed in table s3 2 3 phyllospheric algae and bacteria 2 3 1 abundance and diversity consistent with planktonic algae neither biomass nor alpha diversity s shannon simpson of phyllospheric algae were significantly influenced by the main and interactive effect of plant and nanoplastics table 1 fig 3 a the diversity indices chao1 shannon and simpson of phyllospheric bacteria were significantly higher in the no ps group than in the with ps group table 1 fig 3b besides bacterial shannon and simpson indices were also significantly influenced by plant nanoplastics table 1 as demonstrated by significant differences between no ps and with ps in the v natans and p maackianus groups fig 3b 2 3 2 community composition

12 fig s3 among the different treatments the dominant phyllospheric algae taxa and bacterial families are listed in table s3 2 4 algae bacteria community and environment redundancy analysis rda indicated that the taxonomic composition of planktonic phyllospheric algae was not significantly correlated with environmental parameters all p values 0 05 in contrast rda revealed that total nitrogen tn electric conductivity ec and the content of nanoplastics ps content were important factors that significantly affected planktonic bacterial composition explaining 15 of the variation adjusted r2 fig 5 a as the fig shows tn was negatively related to ps content and no ps treatments were distributed in the positive direction of tn separate from the with ps treatments fig 5a planktonic bacterial families such as microbacteriaceae ack m1 and oxalobacteraceae were positively correlated with ps content fig 5a in addition plant biomass accumulation bio accum ps content and dissolved oxygen do were important factors that significantly affected phyllospheric bacterial composition explaining 20 of the variation adjusted r2 fig 5b plant biomass accumulation was positively correlated with rda axis 1 while do and ps content were positively correlated with rda axis 2 phyllospheric bacterial families such as gloeobacteraceae pseudanabaenaceae and synechococcaceae were positively related to do and ps content fig 5b 2 5 correlation network 2 5 1 correlation between algal and bacterial communities correlation networks describe significant correlations between algal and bacterial communities in the no ps and with ps groups respectively fig 6 as can be seen from the fig 6a the associations between planktonic algae and bacteria were visually more complex in the no ps group than in the with ps group the degree and the number of nodes and edges of the network were higher in the no ps group than in the with ps group table 3 interestingly nanoplastics also reduced the proportion of positive correlations from 64 in the no ps group to 43 in the with ps group table 3 erysipelotrichaceae and rhodobacteraceae were the key nodes with the highest degree in the no ps group and acetobacteraceae was the key node with the maximum closeness centrality while chthoniobacteraceae was the key node with highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality and closeness centrality in the with ps group fig 6a nanoplastics slightly increased the associations between phyllospheric algae and bacteria but the proportion of positive correlations was similar between the no ps and with ps groups fig 6b table 3 synechococcaceae was the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality in the no ps group while rhizobiaceae was the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum betweenness centrality in the with ps group fig 6b 2 5 2 correlation between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats in addition nanoplastics decreased the degree and the number of nodes and edges of the algal bacterial networks between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats fig s4 table s2 the proportions of positive correlations of the network were higher for algae than for bacteria but similar in the no ps and with ps group table s2 planktonic algae crucigenia apiculata and phyllospheric algae staurodesmus sp were the key nodes with the maximum betweenness centrality and closeness centrality in the no ps group and the with ps group respectively fig s4 planktonic bacteria erysipelotrichaceae and phyllospheric bacteria synechococcaceae were the key nodes with the highest degree and the maximum closeness centrality in the no ps and with ps group respectively fig s4 3 discussion 3 1 algal and bacterial communities respond differently to treatments our results demonstrate that the biomass and diversity of planktonic and phyllospheric algae were less susceptible to nanoplastics in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes this contrast with published toxicity test results that microplastics especially nanoplastics can inhibit the growth of algae through blocking photosynthesis mao et al 2018 hetero agglomeration bhattacharya et al 2010 increased oxidative stress fu et al 2019 physical damage hao et al 2022 etc this difference indicates that the response mechanism of algae community to nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystems may be completely different from that of algae species grown in monoculture to date however only a handful of studies have investigated how microplastics affect algal community structures in natural habitats therefore it is essential that the response of ecological communities to microplastics is tested in addition to single species studies recently hitchcock 2022 investigated the potential risk of microplastics to natural phytoplankton community and found that high concentrations of microplastics significantly altered phytoplankton community composition consistent with hitchcock s results the community composition of planktonic algae in this study was also significantly affected by nanoplastics in scenario with nanoplastics addition planktonic algae species such as onychonema filiforme treubaria sp peridinium sp increase in abundance while eudorina trachelomonas sp pediastrum simplex experienced reductions in abundance table s3 this highlights the large variation in species specific responses of algae to nanoplastics in natural aquatic environment hitchcock 2022 which may be a potential explanation for the fact that planktonic algal biomass and diversity were not affected by nanoplastics in our study in addition the interaction between algae and other microbes such as bacteria may regulate the response mechanism of algal community to nanoplastics in natural habitats ramanan et al 2016 you et al 2021 which has rarely been studied in previous research unlike planktonic algae community the community composition of phyllospheric algae was more influenced by plant types rather than nanoplastics this supports our previous contention that host macrophytes exert a greater impact on the community structure of attached algae not only through morphological structural complexity but also through the release of nutrients and or allelochemicals hao et al 2017 the different biomass accumulation of the three submerged macrophytes in this study indicated that individual variation in plant metabolism may be a potential factor affecting phyllospheric algae composition overall by exploring the response of algal community to nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystem our study found that planktonic algal community interact more closely with nanoplastics suspended in the water column while phyllospheric algal community are more susceptible to host macrophytes it has been widely documented that microplastics exposure typically results in reduced bacterial diversity yu et al 2022b zhang et al 2022 especially at high doses agathokleous et al 2021 similar results were also observed in our current study for instance nanoplastics decreased the diversity of planktonic bacteria in the control and v natans groups and the diversity of phyllospheric bacteria in the v natans and p maackianus groups but it had no influence on the diversity of planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria in the m spicatum group these results suggest that the physiological and metabolic characteristics of different submerged macrophytes may be an important factor influencing the interaction between bacteria and nanoplastics in natural aquatic ecosystem van weert et al 2019 in addition to bacterial diversity high concentration of microplastics has also been shown to alter bacterial community composition at the phylum level li et al 2022 yu et al 2022a and these variations were driven by the increased abundance of some bacterial taxa capable of degrading microplastics agathokleous et al 2021 steinman et al 2020 in our study the relative abundances of microplastic degrading bacteria such as actinomycetes proteobacteria and cyanobacteria increased in scenario with nanoplastics addition figs s2 and s3 the degree of increase caused by nanoplastics varied between different plant types as well as between planktonic and phyllospheric bacterial community this may be attributed to the discrepancy in the composition and abundance of bacterial otus belonging to these phyla across treatments aira et al 2015 3 2 bacterial community are more susceptible to environmental factors the rda results indicated that environmental variables significantly influenced and explained the community composition of bacteria rather than algae the content of nanoplastics ps content was shown to be a common factor affecting the community composition of both planktonic and phyllospheric bacteria denitrifying bacteria such as microbacteriaceae and oxalobacteriaceae in planktonic bacteria and rhodobacteriaceae and sphingobacteriaceae in phyllosphere bacteria were positively correlated with ps content fig 5 this supports published result that microplastics have the potential to enhance microbial denitrification he et al 2011 su et al 2022 zheng et al 2022 which helps to explain the negative correlation between tn and ps content exhibited in planktonic bacteria rda furthermore bacterial community are known to be particularly sensitive to physicochemical properties such as ec and ph cheng et al 2018 yu et al 2021 in the present study ec was significantly influenced by main and interactive interactions of plants and nanoplastics becoming another pivotal factor affecting the composition of planktonic bacterial community dissolved oxygen do can control bacterial diversity and abundance thereby shaping bacterial community composition liu et al 2021 for example spietz et al 2015 demonstrated a strong negative relationship between do concentration and bacterial richness in a seasonally hypoxic estuary in our study the rda of phyllosphere bacteria showed that do concentrations increased with the abundance of plastic degrading cyanobacteria such as gloeobacteraceae pseudanabaenaceae and synechococcaceae cyanobacteria can also generate oxygen through photosynthesis while degrading nanoplastics basuki et al 2020 which results in the positive correlation between do and ps content fig 5 furthermore plant biomass accumulation was selected as another major factor affecting the community composition of phyllospheric bacteria along the horizontal axis of rda the location of three submerged macrophytes were separately from each other and the biomass accumulation was significantly different fig s1 these results suggest difference in the growth and metabolism of submerged macrophytes is another important factor contribute to phyllospheric bacterial composition yin et al 2020 and the different physiological and metabolic characteristics of host macrophytes lead to host specific epiphytic bacteria lachnit et al 2011 yu et al 2022c in contrast to bacterial communities the community composition of both planktonic and phyllsopheric algae in our study was less sensitive to environmental variables such as ps content ec etc this may be explained by the complicated interplay between algal and bacterial communities in natural environment ramanan et al 2016 it is noteworthy that healthy algae not only have the ability to control bacterial colonization on their surfaces but also may have mechanisms to inhibit bacterial overgrowth gonçalves et al 2017 kouzuma and watanabe 2015 moreover some algae can also determine the species and activity of the symbiont heterotrophic bacteria by producing transparent exopolymeric substances van oostende et al 2013 this kind of host selection mechanism mcloughlin et al 2016 may protect algal community structure from adverse environmental conditions 3 3 nanoplastics affect interactions between algae and bacteria previous studies have indicated that pollutants such as pesticides lu et al 2019 metals liu et al 2019 pharmaceutical and personal care products lu et al 2020 and aromatic pollutants luo et al 2014 can affect algae bacteria interactions through interfering with their symbiotic relationships you et al 2021 however experimental data on the mechanisms underlying the effects of microplastics on algae bacteria interaction is still lacking network analysis has been widely used to describe the complex microbial interactions and ecological assembly rules faust and raes 2012 as well as to reveal the response mechanism of microbial interactions to environmental changes hunt and ward 2015 in the present study network analysis indicated that nanoplastics decreased the intensity of association between planktonic algae and bacteria and the intensity of microbial connection between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats microplastic particles suspended in the water column can not only provide new niches for microbes in the aquatic environment yang et al 2020 but also interact with aquatic microbe scherer et al 2018 thereby blocking and reducing the association between planktonic microbes and the microbial connection between different habitats but meanwhile nanoplastics also slightly increased the associations between phyllospheric algae and bacteria according to the results of zhao et al 2022 epiphytic microbes on eelgrass leaves increased the aggregation of microplastics on plant surfaces by forming biofilms the settlement and accumulation of microplastics on macrophytes may provide opportunities for phyllospheric microbes to meet and interact with microplastic attached microbes this helps explain the slightly increased intensity of interaction between phyllospheric algae and bacteria caused by nanoplastics in our study more interestingly network analysis in our study also found that nanoplastics reduced the proportion of positive correlations between planktonic algae and bacteria table 3 positive interactions in association network typically indicate mutual cooperation in microbial assembly while negative interactions indicate competition ju et al 2014 pan et al 2022 for planktonic algae bacteria interactions the higher proportion of positive correlations in treatments without nanoplastics addition suggests that cooperation plays an important role whereas competition plays an important role in treatments with nanoplastics addition furthermore cooperation also outweighed competition in phyllospheric algae bacteria interactions and in algal bacterial interactions between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats regardless of the presence or absence of nanoplastics table s2 pollutants affect the physiological and ecological functions of algae and bacteria by interfering with their relationships you et al 2021 therefore it is crucial to reveal the influence mechanism of pollutants on algal bacterial interactions according to the results of laboratory tests conducted by ji et al 2019 and levy et al 2009 bacteria can serve as a protective barrier to effectively reduce the bioavailability and toxicity of engineered nanomaterials and metals to their symbiotic algae singh et al 2019 found that the degradation of diuron by bacteria could alleviate the survival pressure of their coexisting green algae this protective effect of bacteria on algae may also exist in our study given the fact that bacterial communities were more susceptible to nanoplastics according to the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles to algal bacteria co culture proposed by rana and kumar 2022 nanoplastics may first interact with bacteria in our study leading to the aggregation of nanoplastics inside and outside bacterial cells due to the increase size nanoplastics were unable to interact or penetrate inside the algal cells with the same intensity and toxicity on the other hand reactive oxygen species produced by bacteria may also reduce the chance of algae interacting with nanoplastics rana and kumar 2022 as a result the toxicity of nanoplastics to algae may automatically be reduced and algae community can perform their functions with less or no variation in the aquatic system however our current findings cannot reveal this protective mechanism of bacterial community on algal community and deserve further investigation 4 conclusion our study provided experimental evidence on how nanoplastics affect algal and bacterial communities in natural aquatic ecosystems dominated by different submerged macrophytes results indicate that in aquatic ecosystems dominated by submerged macrophytes nanoplastics significantly reduced bacterial diversity and changed bacterial community composition but had little influence on algal community furthermore network analysis showed nanoplastics reduced the associations between planktonic algae and bacteria and the microbial connections between planktonic and phyllospheric habitats we speculate nanoplastics may first interact with bacterial community in aquatic ecosystems thereby serving as a protective barrier to reduce the adverse effects of nanoplastics on algal community future research should focus on this protective mechanism between algal and bacterial communities in natural habitats which is more complicated and worth of further study declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

organic waste to methane and carbon dioxide is a common biochemical process performed by the cooperation of bacteria and methanogens in oxygen limited environments and increasingly applied as an effective and environmentally friendly technology for energy recovery from the recycling of organic waste demirel et al 2008 in anaerobic digestion ad the final methanogenic pathways are normally divided into three categories according to their substrate utilization spectrum co2 reducing hydrogenotrophic acetate splitting aceticlastic and methyl reducing methylotrophic pathway angel et al 2011 in addition two novel pathways capable of methanogenic degradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds mayumi et al 2016 and long chain alkanes zhou et al 2022 have recently been reported however these pathways are always restricted to natural and subsurface environment ammonia is a common inhibitor in ad especially in reactors treating protein rich substrates rajagopal et al 2013 and mainly inhibits the methanogenic activity calli et al 2005 duan et al 2022 excessive ammonia results in an increase in lag phase and a decrease of methanogen growth rate and methane production hansen et al 1998 yu et al 2020 in most reported cases of ad aceticlastic methanogens were observed to be much more sensitive than hydrogenotrophic methanogens under ammonia stress lue et al 2013 ruiz sánchez et al 2017 lv et al 2019 the un ionized ammonia nh3 rather than ionized ammonium is considered the more toxic species tian et al 2018a astals et al 2018 mechanisms proposed to explain ammonia inhibition of methanogens include efflux of intracellular k sprott et al 1984 1985 1986 and inhibition of genes related to methanogenic metabolism duan et al 2022 kato et al 2014 kato et al 2008 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 yan et al 2020 however these generic mechanisms cannot explain the observed variation of ammonia tolerance of diverse methanogenic pathways in the methanogenic consortia lue et al 2013 ruiz sánchez et al 2017 lv et al 2019 in order to unlock the black box of ammonia inhibition in ad it is necessary to further research the flexible response of different methanogenic pathways to

ammonia on the growth of m barkeri incubation of m barkeri with acetate methanol and h2 co2 respectively was performed under different nh4cl conditions the physiological response of m barkeri to nh4cl stress was dramatically different under three methanogenic carbon source conditions fig 1 table 1 no methane was detected in 15 40 and 30 g l nh4cl groups for the acetate methanol and h2 co2 treatment respectively fig 1 table 1 the lag period increased from 2 to 26 days for acetate treatment when the concentration of nh4cl was increased from 0 5 to 10 g l fig 1a table 1 however the delay was only 3 days and 1 day for methanol and h2 co2 treatments when nh4cl increased to 20 and 30 g l respectively fig 1a table 1 ph in three substrate treatments fluctuated within an average range of 0 3 units in the methane production period fig s1 for the total ammonia concentration remained essentially constant fig s2 the nh3 of different substrates calculated based on eq 1 calli et al 2005 varies slightly fig s2 the μmax decreased with increasing nh3 concentration under all three substrate treatments fig 2 table 1 and exhibited a negative linear correlation with nh3 concentration r2 0 96 fig 2a based on these regression equations the theoretical maximum nh3 tolerance for acetate methanol and h2 co2 utilization were calculated to 39 1 9 0 104 3 7 4 and 85 7 1 0 mg l i e the nh3 concentration where μmax 0 respectively fig 2a the maximum ammonia tolerance of m barkeri from methanogenic precursors was h2 co2 methanol acetate which indicated the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway was much more sensitive than hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenic pathways the δg values calculated during the methane accumulation stage gradually increased from 65 to 30 kj reaction for aceticlastic methanogenesis from 108 to 73 kj reaction for methylotrophic methanogenesis and from 136 to 90 kj reaction for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively fig s3a standard gibbs free energies are 80 107 and 126 kj mol for acetate methanol and h2 co2 respectively table s2 the order of the δg range of m barkeri under three methanogenic pathways was in agreement with the ammonia tolerance of m barkeri i e h2 co2 methanol acetate noteworthy a positive linear relationship between the theoretical maximum nh3 tolerance for different substrates and their δg was observed these trends remained stable under different incubation time ranged from the initial time point t0 to the half concentration of substrate consumed t50 or standard conditions r2 0 99 fig 2b 3 2 transcriptomic analysis pca analysis results showed gene expression of different samples with the same substrate and ammonia concentration at different sampling periods was clustered fig s4 indicating that the substrate and ammonia had significant impact on the gene expression of m barkeri for treatments of acetate methanol and h2 co2 there were 516 546 535 445 and 311 348 down regulated genes and 471 398 446 522 and 290 372 upregulated genes in response to high ammonia stress at the two sampling time points respectively figs s5 and s6 m barkeri were more significantly affected by ammonia when using acetate and methanol than when using h2 co2 the genes involved in individual methanogenic pathways were not specifically down regulated down regulation of genes was essentially consistent between acetate and methanol treatments including all subunits of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr heterodisulfide reductase subunit e hdre and most of the subunits of v type atp synthase atp fig 3 sodium proton antiporter nha was observed to be significantly down regulated in both h2 co2 and methanol groups fig 3 in h2 co2 treatment atp and mtr were no statistically but differentially down regulated fig 3 in general inhibition of methanogenic pathways by ammonia was general rather than selective previous studies have reported that ammonia stress causes efflux of intracellular k sprott et al 1985 1984 1986 therefore we further investigated the expression of genes involved in the k transport systems trk system k uptake protein trk and glutathione regulated k efflux system ancillary protein kefg were up regulated in the presence of high ammonia in acetate treatment fig 4 in methanol treatment the up regulated genes were k efflux system ancillary protein kefg k channel protein kch and large conductance mechanosensitive channel mscl fig 4 no significantly regulated gene responsible for k transport was observed in h2 co2 treatment fig 4 according to transcriptomic results the degree of k efflux caused by ammonia was different in different treatments 4 discussion we observed that the impact of ammonia stress on methanogenic activity was directly related to the active methanogenic pathway which could not be explained by the hypotheses previously put forward in the literature such as k flux and selective inhibition of the expression of key genes involved in methanogenesis yu et al 2020 sprott et al 1986 kato et al 2014 wang et al 2015 sprott et al 1986 proposed ammonia induced efflux of the cytoplasmic k through an ammonia k exchange reaction the higher the concentration of ammonia the larger the k loss and the more severely the cells are inhibited however the effects of the same methanogen grown under different methanogenic pathways were significantly different the differential response could not be fully explained by the hypothesis of k loss which has also been argued by hendriksen et al 1991 functional genes involved in different methanogenic pathways were possibly specifically inhibited yu et al 2020 kato et al 2014 however our transcriptomic analysis showed that ammonia repressed the expression of genes involved in different methanogenic pathways in a general rather than a specific way the relevant genes involved in only a single methanogenic pathway were not significantly down regulation under ammonia stress instead genes mtr nha and atp involved in energy metabolism of all three pathways simultaneously were significantly regulated by ammonia fig 3 others studies have found those genes down regulated in response to high ammonia stress by transcriptomic analysis yan et al 2020 xing et al 2021 kato et al 2014 a decrease in atp content was also observed as ammonia concentration increased wang et al 2022 taking the above findings into account the previous hypotheses to explain the difference in ammonia tolerance of different methanogenic pathways had some drawbacks it was reported that variable capabilities of ammonia tolerance might depend on the difference in δg of reactions with different substrates yan et al 2020 and higher energy metabolism level might be conducive to counteract ammonia stress wang et al 2022 however these findings could not exclude influence of other microorganisms because these results were obtained from complex microflora we cultivated a multitrophic methanogen with three methanogenic pathways to circumvent this effect and demonstrated more clearly that the toxicity of nh3 was related to δg of methanogenesis with corresponding precursors δg is a thermodynamic potential and the maximum amount of energy available from one chemical reaction zhang and reece 2019 which is conserved in the form of reducing power and atp in methanogens the reducing power decreased because the intracellular nh3 competed for protons with endoenzymes that catalyzed the production of reducing power yu et al 2021 the latter was consumed when the cells counteracted the presence damage of nh3 yan et al 2020 consequently less energy was produced and more was consumed causing an energy drain methanogenic processes that produce more energy will consequently be more resistant to ammonia stress on the other hand the same energy was required for cell maintenance in same cell however the energy produced by cells cultured with different substrates was different which meant that the ratio of energy flux between maintenance and production was different for each substrate the cells with a higher relative maintenance energy contribution were more sensitive to ammonia and stopped growing at a lower ammonia concentration our findings demonstrate that due to the influence of thermodynamic limitation the ranking of ammonia tolerance of the typical three methanogenic pathways of m barkeri is hydrogenotrophic methylotrophic aceticlastic similar results were found at the community level despite the variability of species and methanogenic pathways a number of studies found that the ammonia tolerance of hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogens was higher than that of aceticlastic methanogens in complex microbial community systems lue et al 2013 ruiz sánchez et al 2017 lv et al 2019 yan et al 2020 fujishima et al 2000 chen et al 2016 tian et al 2018b sun et al 2021 kato et al 2014 evaluated the inhibitory effects of ammonia on two different degradation pathways using a pure culture aceticlastic methanogen and defined co culture hydrogenotrophic methanogen and syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria the results demonstrated that aceticlastic methanogen was sensitive to ammonia stress than hydrogenotrophic methanogen although the resistance of acetate consuming methanogens to high ammonia stress has also been reported however these aceticlastic methanogens reported were methanosarcina fotidis et al 2013 hao et al 2015 which are a multitrophic methanogens indeed there are indications that methanosarcina may act as hydrogen utilizing methanogen in microbial communities under ammonia stress westerholm et al 2012 which suggests that under duress methanosarcina may shift to the thermodynamically best option the multiple methanogenic metabolisms of methanosarcina confers adaptability and contributes to its adaptation to environmental stress 5 conclusions this study revealed that the ranking highest to lowest of ammonia tolerance of methanogenic pathways is hydrogenotrophic methylotrophic aceticlastic and our results clearly showed the relationship between thermodynamic potential and ammonia tolerance revealing the ammonia tolerance of m barkeri was determined by thermodynamic restriction the study provides a theoretical basis for a relative ammonia inhibition tolerance for h2 vs acetate these findings advance understanding of how ammonia inhibits methanogens extending and refining the model of ammonia inhibition in methanogens further physiological and molecular biological experiments are needed to comprehensively understand

15069,ammonia is a ubiquitous potential inhibitor of anaerobic digestion processes mainly exhibiting inhibition towards methanogenic activity however knowledge as to how ammonia affects the methanogens is still limited in this study we cultured a multitrophic methanogen methanosarcina barkeri dsm 800 with acetate h2 co2 and methanol to evaluate the influence of ammonia on different methanogenic pathways aceticlastic methanogenesis was more sensitive to increased ammonia concentrations than hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis theoretical maximum nh3 tolerances of m

organic waste to methane and carbon dioxide is a common biochemical process performed by the cooperation of bacteria and methanogens in oxygen limited environments and increasingly applied as an effective and environmentally friendly technology for energy recovery from the recycling of organic waste demirel et al 2008 in anaerobic digestion ad the final methanogenic pathways are normally divided into three categories according to their substrate utilization spectrum co2 reducing hydrogenotrophic acetate splitting aceticlastic and methyl reducing methylotrophic pathway angel et al 2011 in addition two novel pathways capable of methanogenic degradation of methoxylated aromatic compounds mayumi et al 2016 and long chain alkanes zhou et al 2022 have recently been reported however these pathways are always restricted to natural and subsurface environment ammonia is a common inhibitor in ad especially in reactors treating protein rich substrates rajagopal et al 2013 and mainly inhibits the methanogenic activity calli et al 2005 duan et al 2022 excessive ammonia results in an increase in lag phase and a decrease of methanogen growth rate and methane production hansen et al 1998 yu et al 2020 in most reported cases of ad aceticlastic methanogens were observed to be much more sensitive than hydrogenotrophic methanogens under ammonia stress lue et al 2013 ruiz sánchez et al 2017 lv et al 2019 the un ionized ammonia nh3 rather than ionized ammonium is considered the more toxic species tian et al 2018a astals et al 2018 mechanisms proposed to explain ammonia inhibition of methanogens include efflux of intracellular k sprott et al 1984 1985 1986 and inhibition of genes related to methanogenic metabolism duan et al 2022 kato et al 2014 kato et al 2008 zhang et al 2018

ammonia on the growth of m barkeri incubation of m barkeri with acetate methanol and h2 co2 respectively was performed under different nh4cl conditions the physiological response of m barkeri to nh4cl stress was dramatically different under three methanogenic carbon source conditions fig 1 table 1 no methane was detected in 15 40 and 30 g l nh4cl groups for the acetate methanol and h2 co2 treatment respectively fig 1 table 1 the lag period increased from 2 to 26 days for acetate treatment when the concentration of nh4cl was increased from 0 5 to 10 g l fig 1a table 1 however the delay was only 3 days and 1 day for methanol and h2 co2 treatments when nh4cl increased to 20 and 30 g l respectively fig 1a table 1 ph in three substrate treatments fluctuated within an average range of 0 3 units in the methane production period fig s1 for the total ammonia concentration remained essentially constant fig s2 the nh3 of different substrates calculated based on eq 1 calli et al 2005 varies slightly fig s2 the μmax decreased with increasing nh3 concentration under all three substrate treatments fig 2 table 1 and exhibited a negative linear correlation with nh3 concentration r2 0 96 fig 2a based on these regression equations the theoretical maximum nh3 tolerance for acetate methanol and h2 co2 utilization were calculated to 39 1 9 0 104 3 7 4 and 85 7 1 0 mg l i e the nh3 concentration where μmax 0 respectively fig 2a the maximum ammonia tolerance of m barkeri from methanogenic precursors was h2 co2 methanol acetate which indicated the aceticlastic methanogenic pathway was much more sensitive than hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenic pathways the δg values calculated during the methane accumulation stage gradually increased from 65 to 30 kj reaction for aceticlastic methanogenesis from 108 to 73 kj reaction for methylotrophic methanogenesis and from 136 to 90 kj reaction for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis respectively fig s3a standard gibbs free energies are 80 107 and 126 kj mol for acetate methanol and h2 co2 respectively table s2 the order of the δg range of m barkeri under three methanogenic pathways was in agreement with the ammonia tolerance of m barkeri i e h2 co2 methanol acetate noteworthy a positive linear relationship between the theoretical maximum nh3 tolerance for different substrates and their δg was observed these trends remained stable under different incubation time ranged from the initial time point t0 to the half concentration of substrate consumed t50 or standard conditions r2 0 99 fig 2b 3 2 transcriptomic analysis pca analysis results showed gene expression of different samples with the same substrate and ammonia concentration at different sampling periods was clustered fig s4 indicating that the substrate and ammonia had significant impact on the gene expression of m barkeri for treatments of acetate methanol and h2 co2 there were 516 546 535 445 and 311 348 down regulated genes and 471 398 446 522 and 290 372 upregulated genes in response to high ammonia stress at the two sampling time points respectively figs s5 and s6 m barkeri were more significantly affected by ammonia when using acetate and methanol than when using h2 co2 the genes involved in individual methanogenic pathways were not specifically down regulated down regulation of genes was essentially consistent between acetate and methanol treatments including all subunits of tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase mtr heterodisulfide reductase subunit e hdre and most of the subunits of v type atp synthase atp fig 3 sodium proton antiporter nha was observed to be significantly down regulated in both h2 co2 and methanol groups fig 3 in h2 co2 treatment atp and mtr were no statistically but differentially down regulated fig 3 in general inhibition of methanogenic pathways by ammonia was general rather than selective previous studies have reported that ammonia stress causes efflux of intracellular k sprott et al 1985
