5950,temporal stability ts of soil water content swc is commonly used to identify representative locations for swc monitoring to recover missing monitoring data to design agronomic experiments and to validate remote sensing methods even though the factors affecting ts swc i e scale sampling methods and frequency weather conditions soil properties vegetation surface topography and surface subsurface hydrology are well known their interaction and combined effect on ts swc is poorly understood to fill this knowledge gap we monitored swc during three growing and two winter seasons at four topo hydrological positions thp summit slope dry depression and flooded depression of an agricultural field under corn soybean rotation with and without cover crop rye twenty 10 m 10 m experimental plots were located at the four thp in mason mi usa swc was monitored at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm from june 2014 through oct 2016 we used the vachaud et al 1985 approach to quantify ts swc and anova ancova and a regression tree exploratory tool to evaluate the effects of weather conditions soil properties vegetation and surface topography hydrology on ts swc our results showed that the latter factor plays an important role in ts swc patterns at the scale of an agricultural field ts swc patterns were more frequently observed in locations where the effect of local soil properties vegetation controls interfered with the non local surface and subsurface water fluxes controls of swc dynamics the presence of ts swc was clearly associated with the temporal variability of swc in individual locations suggesting that ts swc depends on representation of locations with different temporal variability of swc in the examined dataset abbreviations bd bulk density dd dry depression df flooded

stability ts of soil water content swc is the phenomenon of average swc being preserved in time at certain locations within a field plot or watershed vachaud et al 1985 the term can also be applied to defining locations that are either persistently wetter than the field average or persistently dryer than the field average as such the concept of ts swc has found many applications in hydrological monitoring in the context of soil water monitoring it is important to select monitoring sites that are representative of the monitored area as a whole whether at the plot field or watershed scale ts swc can be used to identify such representative locations for instance heathman et al 2009 used the ts swc concept to identify locations at both the field and watershed scale that adequately represented average swc for a given area in order to define the location for future monitoring stations as well as sampling protocols neves et al 2017 also applied the ts swc concept to determine appropriate sampling locations and swc measurement frequency at the field scale another area of application of ts swc is in hydrologic modeling brocca et al 2009a applied the concept of ts swc to rainfall runoff modeling where the correct estimation of swc prior to a precipitation event was critical also in the context of swc monitoring and hydrologic modeling ts swc can be used to fill in missing sensor data in the event of data loss due to malfunctioning probes pachepsky et al 2005 an additional implementation of ts swc is in the design of agronomic experiments cassel et al 2000 pointed out that systematic deviations of swc from field averaged values indicated differences of soil properties across that field and caused variability of crop yield this tremendously complicated the design of adequate treatment experiments with replicated plots as well as the statistical analysis of experimental data finally several studies have applied the concept of ts swc to the validation of remote sensed surface soil moisture measurements grayson and western 1998 jacobs et al 2004 showed that ts swc can be used to determine a single sampling location to validate remotely sensed soil moisture data collected at the field scale cosh et al 2008 examined the ts swc at the watershed scale in a semi arid environment and found that although the remotely sensed swc was representative of the watershed average this agreement disappeared at the finer scale due to localized high variation in swc cosh et al 2006 also showed that ts swc concept can be applied to identify temporally stable representative locations within a watershed that can then be used to validate remotely sensed swc data a comprehensive literature review by vanderlinden et al 2012 examined eight factors of ts swc sensor properties depth and layer thickness spatial scale and density of swc monitoring network measurement duration and frequency soil properties vegetation climate and seasonality and topography the review indicated that the studies vary in their findings and many results are controversial specifically the effect of weather seasonality on ts swc was demonstrated in a study by grayson et al 1997 who conceptually related dry and wet states of swc patters to the local dominated by vertical fluxes and nonlocal dominated by lateral water movement controls kachanoski and de jong 1988 found that ts swc observed during soil drying was only preserved for recharge events at a spatial scale 40 m based on modeling water flow in homogeneous hypothetical soil profiles with different soil texture where only local control affected swc mart√≠nez et al 2014 demonstrated that ts swc could be site specific with respect to climate and soil properties those authors emphasized the importance of sampling frequency to capture seasonal features of the specific climate then in a field study neves et al 2017 showed that ts swc patterns are affected by precipitation patterns and more frequent swc sampling is necessary during wetter years in addition jacobs et al 2004 showed that appropriate sampling frequency is dependent on swc with a higher sampling frequency needed for low 10 and high 25 soil moisture conditions than for intermediate soil moisture conditions the effect of seasonality on ts swc was examined for a hummocky landscape of the canadian prairie by biswas and si 2011 the intra seasonal ts swc was stronger as comparted to the inter seasonal in their study which was attributed to the vegetation interaction of weather patterns and vegetation was found by wang et al 2015 those authors showed a significant impact control of vegetation on ts swc particularly under drier conditions they also observed that root water uptake weakened ts swc during growing seasons similar results were obtained by gomez plaza et al 2000 for three transects across a small catchment with natural and burned vegetation and by hupet and vanclooster 2002 for an agricultural field under maize production moreover the effect of vegetation was plant specific with the strongest ts swc patterns observed under alfalfa and the weakest under millet crops jia and shao 2013 unlike the results of wang et al 2015 where soil properties did not affect ts swc a mixed site specific effect of vegetation and soil properties was observed in a semi arid steppe of china zhao et al 2010 metrics of ts swc positively correlated with soil organic carbon and clay content while negatively correlated with sand content in their study on the contrary time stable sites showed poor relationships to soil properties along a 612 m transect under wheat fallow rotation in a tallon and si 2004 study the relationship between ts swc and topography was also poor suggesting the absence of a single dominant control of swc surface topography is known to affect various soil processes either directly or indirectly and several studies have demonstrated its direct effect on ts swc kachanoski and de jong 1988 emphasized the importance of local topography for spatial scales 30 m for ts swc where the local variability of surface curvature creates highly variable overland water fluxes that alter the spatial patters of sw tomer and anderson 1995 reported that topography accounted for 51 to 77 of variation in soil water storage on a sand plain hillslope indicating the importance of topographical features in this context several other studies also mentioned that surface topography might affect soil moisture dynamics and ts swc patterns brocca et al 2009b biswas and si 2011 zhu and lin 2011 examined the effect of spatial scale in conjunction with soil properties crop type and topography on swc dynamics they found that at the scale of landform unit topography dominated over soil properties in the steep landforms 8 slope and vice versa in the flat landforms another important observation from their study was the effect of depth to bedrock on swc patterns consisting in persistently higher swc in locations with shallow depths to bedrock 0 4 0 5 m the controls of soil moisture variability were re examined by baroni et al 2013 those authors found that under wet conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture is primarily controlled by soil texture whereas under dry conditions the spatial patters of swc are affected mostly by the spatial variability of the vegetation furthermore the interaction between soil texture and vegetation is most important under intermediate soil moisture conditions finally revising the concept of local nonlocal controls vereecken et al 2014 highlighted that soil moisture variability at the field scale is determined by the complex interaction of local and nonlocal controls the soil moisture state at which a transition from local to non local controls takes place is still a matter of debate and subject of ongoing research the reviewed literature indicated that most temporal stability studies were conducted in contrasting climate conditions or conditions with clear seasonal weather patterns and native vegetation where the dominance of local and nonlocal controls of ts swc was well defined due to their temporal and spatial persistence in agricultural environments with crop rotation and soil disturbance by tillage soil properties and vegetation do not persist in space and time and it is reasonable to expect an interaction of local and nonlocal controls of ts swc this study was aimed to better understand the interactive effect of soil properties topography seasonality and crops on ts swc at the scale of agricultural field with different crop rotations the objectives of this study are 1 to study the spatial patterns of soil water content across different topo hydrological positions at the field scale 2 to test whether these patterns persist throughout seasons with different vegetation crops and weather conditions and 3 to test the association of ts swc with soil properties crops topographical positions and hydrological conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop rotation the experimental site was located in mason michigan united states at 42 37 n 84 26 w in south central michigan soils at this site consisted of four different soil series first aubbeenaubbee capac sandy loams which belong to the taxonomic class of fine loamy mixed active mesic aeric epiaqualfs second capac sandy loam which is a fine loamy mixed active mesic aquic glossudalf third colwood brookston loam a fine loamy mixed active mesic typic endoaquoll finally marlette loam which is a fine loamy mixed semiactive mesic oxyaquic glossudalf the experimental site exhibited moderate topographical variation with total elevation varying from 275 6 m to 278 7 m above sea level three distinct topographical elements were visible in the landscape specifically a summit area sloped areas with slopes varying from 1 to 11 and two discrete depression areas one of which regularly experienced flooded conditions while the other did not to distinguish between different hydrological conditions flooded vs not flooded at the same topographical element i e depression the four studied areas were referred further to as topo hydrological positions thp which included summit su slope sl dry depression dd and flooded depression df soil texture was represented by 4 textural classes at four thp table 1 michigan experiences a humid continental climate dfb according to k√∂ppen classification with average summer temperatures between 21 c and 28 c and observed average winter temperatures between 10 c and 1 c http www intellicast com local history aspx location usmi0477 annual precipitation varies between 700 mm and 900 mm climate data org twenty experimental plots five at each thp sized 10 m 10 m were established at each thp across the elevation gradient fig 1 with seasonal corn soybean rotation with or without winter cover crops table 2 each season started at the crop planting date and finished at the crop termination or harvest date these seasons are further referred to as growing 2014 winter 2015 growing 2015 winter 2016 and growing 2016 table 2 the four crop rotations included corn and soybeans with and without winter cover crops rye as shown in table 3 2 2 soil properties and water content monitoring soil bulk density total soil organic content and soil texture were measured at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm in the 20 experimental plots using the standard methods dane et al 2002 soil bulk density was measured biweekly while total soil organic carbon content was measured once at the beginning and once at the end of each growing season soil texture was measured once at the beginning of the experiment the soil hydraulic properties were estimated from measured soil properties using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 the rosetta software was developed using a large dataset 2134 soil samples for water retention and 235 soil samples for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity collected from north america and europe and represented all soil textural classes accept sc for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity we used a single pedotransfer function i e neural network to avoid uncertainty associated with the different data sources and approaches to estimating the soil hydraulic properties swc monitoring was conducted at the twenty experimental plots during the five monitoring seasons one set of decagon 10hs soil sensors was installed in each of the 20 experimental plots the sensors were installed vertically with centers located at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm and were connected to 5 channel em50 data loggers meter group inc pullman wa usa the sensors measured water content in the soil volumes of approximately 3000 cm3 at 30 minute time intervals the sensors were periodically removed from the depth of 20 cm for the field operations and reinstalled in the same locations the sensors at depths of 40 cm and 60 cm were not removed during the field operations we buried the sensor cables below the tillage depth between the seasons some malfunctioning sensors were replaced during the 3 year monitoring to assure accuracy of swc measurements the factory calibrations were corrected for all sensors including those reinstalled following the procedure similar to guber et al 2010 the correction consisted of establishing a relationship between swc calculated using the factory provided sensor calibration and water contents in samples taken from the same depth outside of the sensor installation zone biweekly during the periods of time when sensors were used for swc monitoring undisturbed 137 cm3 soil cores were taken from the depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm at a distance of 30 40 cm around the sensors using a soil core sampler model 0200cs soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca for direct measurements of volumetric swc a linear regression between the sensor measured and the directly measured volumetric swc was used for correction of the factory calibrations fig 3 1 Œ∏ c a Œ∏ f b where Œ∏c and Œ∏f are swc measured directly in the field and obtained using the factory calibration respectively cm3 cm 3 the coefficients a and b corrected the slope and bias of the factory calibration respectively an example of the linear regression i e eq 1 is shown in fig 3 the correction was done for each sensor separately using all swc measured during 5 monitoring seasons for reinstalled sensors the calibrations were corrected for each period of time when the sensors were used for monitoring the corrected water content measurements reflect the average water contents across the sampling area rather than water contents in the small zone around the sensor this was particularly important for the top 20 cm soil layer which was disturbed by the tillage and thus was rather heterogeneous since soil samples were taken beyond the sensor installation and the sampling holes were backfilled with the same soil the disturbance around the sensors was minimized to allow a long term monitoring of swc 2 3 characteristics of swc variability and temporal stability daily measured at 12 00 pm and hourly data of swc monitoring were used in ts swc analysis the daily and hourly datasets included only dates time for each depth where swc were present in all 20 monitoring locations therefore missing data in any location did not affect results of the ts analysis because of sensor malfunction the total number of data differed for each depth table 4 to characterize the absolute values and variability of swc associated with the soil properties vegetation surface topography and seasonal weather conditions measured dynamics of swc were represented by the temporal mean and the standard deviation of swc calculated separately for each depth location and season as Œ∏ i 1 n j j 1 n j Œ∏ i j 2 sdwc i 1 n j 1 j 1 n j Œ∏ i j Œ∏ i 2 where Œ∏ i j is the swc measured at location i at time j cm3 cm 3 Œ∏ i is the time averaged swc at location i cm3 cm 3 sdwci is the standard deviation of swc at location i cm3 cm 3 Œ∏ i is the number of observations in each season for notation simplicity the indexes for depths and seasons are omitted in the equations to quantify the deviation of swc from swc averaged across the field for time moments j Œ∏ j separately for each depth location and season we used the mean relative difference mrdi vachaud et al 1985 vanderlinden et al 2012 rd i j Œ∏ i j Œ∏ j Œ∏ j 3 mrd i 1 n j j 1 n j rd i j to quantify the ts swc in these locations the standard deviation sdrdi was computed for each depth and location at each season 4 sdr d i 1 n j 1 j 1 n j r d i j m r d i 2 smaller sdrd corresponded to stronger temporally stable swc patterns in the locations we also tested whether ts swc can be explained by temporal variation of swc in the individual locations therefore sdrdi values calculated for each location and season were correlated to sdwci for the same locations and seasons 2 4 experimental design and statistical analyses for the factor analysis we used anova ancova with the proc mixed and proc glimmix procedures of sas 9 4 software cary nc the topo hydrological position was the first studied factor in the data analysis the second factor was thecrop introduced in the studied crop rotation with four levels corn soybean rye and fallow the third factor was season with five levels growing 2014 winter 2015 growing 2015 winter 2016 and growing 2016 the effects of these factors were analyzed on the parameters of ts separately for each monitoring depth since the effects of season and crop were confounded the comparisons were conducted only among the marginal means of the studied factors no interactions were considered the response variables in the statistical analysis were mwc and sdwc mrd and sdrd respectively additionally the effect of topography and depth on soil properties was analyzed in a separate set of models the analyzed soil properties were sand content sand clay content clay organic carbon oc and bulk density bd a regression tree approach breiman et al 1984 was used to evaluate the relative importance of the studied factors on ts of swc in r r core and team 2018 four separate models were created all of which had thp crop season and sand to clay ratio scr as the predictors the outcome variables were mrd and sdrd the trees were created using the anova method in the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 and then visualized using rpart plot milborrow 2018 3 results 3 1 soil properties and swc monitoring soil properties varied with the depth and thp of the experimental site overall an increase in clay content with the depth fig 4 a and a decrease in oc fig 4c were observed in all thp clay content tended to decrease while sand and oc content tended to increase with decreasing elevation of experimental plots fig 4 a c however the differences were statistically significant only between groups su sl and dd df for depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm there was no clear association of bd with depth or thp except for the top 10 cm soil layer where bd consistently decreased with elevation and was the smallest in the df fig 4d the trends observed for soil properties associated with depths and thp translated into differences in soil water retention estimated using the rosetta software fig 5 for the same pressure heads soil water contents were smaller in the depressions dd and df than in su and sl these differences were more pronounced at a depth of 40 cm fig 5b than at depths of 20 cm fig 5a and 60 cm fig 5c and were caused by higher clay content and lower sand content at depth of 40 cm in the su and sl positions as compared to the depression it implies that under similar weather and vegetation conditions and in absence of overland water flow swc would be higher at the su and sl positions and lower in the dd and df overall the decagon 10hs sensors performed well over the five monitoring periods only 3 sensors installed at a depth of 60 cm in locations su 2 dd 2 and df 5 systematically malfunctioned and thus these measurements were excluded from further analysis high temporal and spatial variability was observed in swc at the four thp as illustrated in fig 6 swc highly oscillated in some thp over the whole monitoring period of time e g df at depth of 20 cm in fig 6 or during specific seasons e g su at depth of 20 cm during growing 2015 2016 seasons however the swc oscillations were moderate or even minor in sl and dd during the whole monitoring period or for specific seasons e g su at depth of 20 cm for growing 2014 and winter 2015 seasons this means that the soil at different thp responded quite differently to the same changes in weather conditions interestingly the oscillations in swc decreased with the depth however differences between swc in the four thp increased with depth and were largest between df and dd at a depth of 60 cm fig 6 indicating a dominant effect of subsurface hydrology at this locations swcs averaged over each monitoring season were different at the four thp in general the highest mwcs were observed at depths of 20 and 40 cm at two locations in the flooded depression df 1 and df 2 fig 7 a b and at a depth of 60 cm at four locations in the flooded depression df 1 df 4 the lowest mwcs were observed in the dry depression locations dd 3 dd 5 at all monitoring depths fig 7a c and part of the flooded depression at a depths of 20 and 40 cm locations df 4 and df 5 fig 7a b all other locations exhibited intermediate mwc which varied between the locations depths and seasons the differences in mwc translated to the differences in mrd which clearly demonstrated the trends associated with the thp specifically among other locations mrd were the highest in locations df 1 and df 2 of the flooded depression whereas mrd were the smallest negative in locations of the dry depression dd 3 dd 5 for all monitoring depths and in the flooded depression df 4 and df 5 for the depths of 20 cm and 40 cm fig 8 there was no consistency in the mrd among su and sl locations over the five monitoring periods at a depth of 20 cm the mrd were interchangeably positive and negative in the growing and winter seasons fig 8a interestingly the mdr were mostly positive at a depth of 40 cm fig 8b and negative at a depth of 60 cm in these locations fig 8c these trends could be attributed to the high negative and positive values of mrd in the depressions at depths of 40 and 60 cm respectively fig 8b c since the sum of mrd across all locations must be zero mrd in su and sl had an opposite sign to mrd in most dd and df locations 3 2 swc sampling interval and the ts statistics to examine the effect of sampling frequency on the statistics of ts swc we compared hourly and daily mrd and sdrd separately for the five seasons and the three depths the daily datasets included from 55 to 184 observations for the four seasons at each depth while the hourly datasets included from 2839 to 3411 swc observations table 4 despite large differences in the total number of observations the mrd and sdrd calculated for daily swc data did not differ significantly from those calculated for hourly swc fig 9 the root mean square differences rmsd between daily and hourly ts statistics ranged from 0 77 10 3 to 3 76 10 3 for mrd and from 0 90 10 3 to 3 82 10 3 for sdrd respectively for the first four monitoring seasons the rmsd were much larger for the growing 2016 season and ranged from 2 90 10 2 to 5 58 10 2 for mrd and from 2 40 10 2 to 4 52 10 2 to for sdrd these large differences were caused by the fact that approximately 50 days in the daily dataset contained missing observations at 12 00 pm to better represent swc data for all seasons only hourly measurements were used further in the ts analysis 3 3 temporal stability of swc the effects of thp season and crops the effect of topo hydrology on the deviations of swc in individual locations from the average water contents across the field mrd was not obvious the differences between mrd at the 4 thp were not significant at a depth of 20 cm at a depth of 40 cm mrd at dd was statistically smaller negative than mrd at su and df positive fig 10 a most differences in mrd were observed at a depth of 60 cm where the highest positive and lowest negative values occurred at df and dd respectively the variability of mrd expressed as the standard deviation of the set of relative differences from mwc for a given set of observations sdrd and the metric for temporal stability of swc was affected by thp overall among thp sdrd were the largest for df smallest for dd at all depths and intermediate for su and sl fig 10b however the differences in sdrd for all depths were statistically significant only between df and dd at all three depths with the exception of 20 cm where df was not significantly different from su these results mean that swc was most temporally stable in dd and less stable in df at all monitoring depths the seasons did not affect mrd at the three depths despite visual differences between mrd obtained for the five monitoring seasons these differences were not statistically significant due to high standard errors caused by high spatial variability of mrd fig 10c contrary to mrd there was an effect of season on sdrd for the 20 cm depth the highest sdrd were obtained for winter 2015 growing 2015 and growing 2016 seasons fig 10d the effect of season weakened with the depth and entirely disappeared at depth of 60 cm at a depth of 40 cm sdrd were higher for the 2015 seasons as compared with the winter 2016 fig 10d the differences between growing 2014 season and two monitoring seasons of 2016 were not statistically significant despite differences in precipitation fig 2 these results indicated overall stronger temporal stability of swc in growing 2014 and winter 2016 and weaker stability in winter 2015 and growing 2015 and 2016 seasons the mrd differed for the four crops and were positive for soybeans and rye and negative for corn and fallow at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 10e however these differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 we also did not find significant differences associated with the crops in sdrd at the tree depths fig 10f the absence of differences was likely caused by a high variation of mrd and sdrd at different thp during different seasons therefore the effect of crops was likely masked by the other two factors monitoring depth introduced an uncertainty into the interpretation of results obtained at different thp there were no clear relationships between mrd and depth at four thp for four crops during five seasons fig 10a c e however sdrd obviously decreased with the depth fig 10b d f indicating more temporarily stable swc dynamics in deeper soil layers 3 4 relationship between temporal stability and variability of swc correlation analysis showed that temporal stability was closely related to the temporal variability of swc in the monitoring locations however it appeared that ts swc strengthens sdrd decreases with increasing sdwc to a certain point and then weakens sdrd increases with further increasing sdwc fig 11 the values of sdwc with the smallest sdrd were very close to the standard deviations of the time averaged swc in individual locations Œ∏ i calculated separately for each depth and monitoring season sdmwc the pearson correlation coefficients became high and statistically significant table 4 when sdrd were correlated to the absolute differences sdwc sdmwc for all seasons fig 12 the difference sdwc sdmwc represents deviation of temporal variability in swc calculated in individual locations from the variability of Œ∏ i averaged across the field both higher and lower variability of swc in locations sdwc as compared to the field average variability sdmwc resulted in degradation of ts swc 4 discussion as expected the results of the statistical analysis showed a combined effect of multiple factors on temporal stability of swc there are four main factors influencing changes in swc they are i water influx into the soil ii soil water retention iii water losses to evaporation drainage and iv root water uptake the water influx to the soil depends on precipitation soil hydraulic properties and state of vegetation generally the influx to the soil increases with the amount of precipitation however part of the precipitation is intercepted by vegetation and does not reach the soil surface a large leaf area intercepts more water but the intercepting capacity of the leaves is limited at around 15 of precipitation at rainfall amounts of 5 mm rijtema and de vries 1994 and precipitation exceeding this capacity reaches the soil surface not all rainfall water that reaches the soil surface infiltrates into the soil depending on soil matrix pressure and hydraulic conductivity part of this water transforms into runoff and moves to depressions both soil matrix pressure and hydraulic conductivity depend on soil properties i e texture structure bulk density organic matter content etc and saturation of soil pores water content the latter is influenced by antecedent weather conditions rainfalls droughts and vegetation status root water uptake the vegetation status in turn depends on antecedent weather conditions and soil hydraulic properties soil water retention finally the amount of water that reaches the depressions depends on rainfall characteristics i e intensity and head area drained to the depression and soil properties on thp the last may vary greatly across thp biswas and si 2011 and kravchenko and bullock 2000 sophisticated interrelationships between these factors introduce great uncertainty into the interpretation of results of ts swc to better understand the interactions between the studied factors i e soil properties crops seasons and topography we used the regression tree exploratory tool 4 1 the effect of soil texture soil texture as expressed by sand to clay ratio scr was the first splitting variable for mrd at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 13 a c the ratios of 14 96 and 5 376 separated loamy sand from other soils textural classes at depths of 20 and 40 cm respectively despite the fact that this soil texture was found only in the depressions which received water from an uphill area during rainfalls and thus soil in the depressions was expected to be wetter than in the other locations low water retention and high hydraulic conductivity of loamy sand fig 5 canceled out the effect of topography i e run on therefore despite the fact that su and sl lost part of precipitation as surface runoff mwc and mrd were persistently smaller at a depth of 20 cm in dd 5 df 4 and df 5 and at a depth of 40 cm in dd 3 dd 5 and df 3 df 5 than in the same depths of su and sl figs 7a and 8a a strong effect of soil texture on mrd was also found at a depth of 60 cm the scr appeared at the second and third levels of the regression trees right after the thp fig 13e and separated the locations in the order of increasing mrd with decrease of scr in nonflooded locations this trend is consistent with the general theory of water retention for soil textural classes e g hillel 2004 and with our estimates of soil water retention from soil texture fig 5 fine soil texture retains more water and thus is wetter than a coarse texture under the same weather conditions surprisingly soil texture was not among top splitting variables in the sdrd regression trees it was not present in the sdrd tree at a depth of 40 cm fig 13d whereas soil texture appeared only in the third level sdrd trees at depths of 20 and 60 cm fig 13b f these results indicate that soil texture primarily controls relative mrd values of swc in different thp via soil hydraulic properties whereas the temporal stability sdrd of swc was controlled by the other factors the presence of soil texture as a splitting variable at a depth of 40 cm and its absence at depths of 20 and 60 cm of the sdrd regression trees were attributed to the differences of the slope on the soil water retention curves for su sl and dd df at these depths the steeper the slope Œ∏ p f the larger the changes in swc are for the same changes in the soil pressure head and thus the higher temporal variability and weaker temporal stability of swc are the differences in the slope between soils in the depressions and su sl were more pronounced at a depth of 40 cm fig 5b and less pronounced at depth of 20 and 60 cm fig 5a c there were also larger differences between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kw between the two groups i e su sl and dd df at a depth of 40 cm fig 5e which likely caused faster changes in swc at the depressions and thus increased the temporal variability in the depressions results of the regression tree analysis clearly showed that for these soils soil texture had only a minor effect on the variability and temporal stability of swc these findings are consistent with the general theory of water flow in unsaturated soils e g hillel 2004 differences in soil texture between the thp affected both soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in locations with similar soil texture su and sl and hydrological conditions precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration water content dynamics did not differ significantly due to insignificant differences in soil water fluxes therefore both mrd and sdrd were of the same order of magnitude in these locations fig 10a b in locations with dissimilar soil properties though similar topographical conditions i e dd or df contrasting soil properties i e between dd 1 dd 2 and dd 3 dd 5 or between df 1 df 2 and df 3 df 5 resulted in dissimilarity in swc dynamics and mrd respectively however these dissimilarities did not always translate into difference in sdrd this is because of the specifics of the sdrd statistic sdrd is a measure of deviation of normalized differences of swc in locations rd from rd averaged over the whole monitoring period for each location smaller sdrd indicate stronger temporal persistence even for locations where swc dynamics systematically and significantly deviated from the field averaged swc in other words temporal stability calculated using eq 4 may be interpreted as a consistency in deviation of swc in locations from the field averaged swc this is in agreement with the statistically significant correlation between sdrd and absolute difference sdwc sdmwc fig 12 table 4 and explains a reduced importance of soil texture on ts swc as compared with other factors the results of the regression tree were consistent with a general statistics for sdrd there was no particular textural group with temporally stable swc dynamics the smallest sdrd indicating the strongest ts swc were observed in locations with 4 different soil textures table 6 the results of this study are in general agreement with comparable studies performed on the factors influencing ts swc in that it appears there are several interactions at play between various factors brocca et al 2009b for instance examined the temporal stability of soil moisture in three experimental locations in the upper tiber valley of central italy the region is characterized by a mediterranean climate and receives mean annual precipitation of 900 mm which is comparable to the annual precipitation in mid michigan soils in brocca et al s experiment were typic or fluventic haplusepts with sandy loam as the dominant texture the authors found that ts swc in their experimental areas decreased as clay content decreased under conditions of limited topographical variability as topographic variability increased so did its importance in determining temporally stable locations with regards to soil moisture in other words in the presence of topographic variability the direct effect of soil properties such as texture diminishes as these two variables interact with one another in this context it is also important to note that distance between sampling points may exert an influence on these results at smaller scales sampling points 6 m apart random spatial processes may introduce spatial autocorrelation which could potentially obscure the effect of thp on swc tomer and anderson 1995 the above is in agreement with our finding that under topographically variable terrain there is no one soil texture which represents temporally stable swc dynamics zhu and lin 2011 obtained similar findings at a study site in central pennsylvania in the united states on silty clay and silt loam soils typic hapludalfs and hapludults in this study texture was also a significant predictor of variation in soil moisture but as topographic variability increased so did the relative importance of topography in contrast to soil texture grayson and western 1998 also suggested an interactive effect between thp and soil texture in identifying temporally stable locations within a study area these studies in addition to ours indicate there is a strong interactive effect between soil properties such as texture and topographic variability on ts swc 4 2 the effect of the season season did not play an important role in the mrd regression trees fig 13a c e this variable appeared only once at a depth of 20 cm for the flooded locations df 1 df 3 and separated growing 2014 and winter 2015 from all other seasons fig 13a this interesting result indicated that despite the interseasonal variation of weather conditions table 2 fig 2 the deviations of swc dynamics in the individual locations from the field averaged was nearly the same in all thp this observation was confirmed by the anova model which indicated no significant differences in mrd for the 5 monitoring seasons fig 10c unlike mrd season was present in sdrd regression trees at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm at both depths season was the second and fourth splitting variable in these trees fig 13b d the decreasing order of season in the regression tree indicated the decrease of variance in mrd with the depth associated with the buffering effect of the top soil layers on water fluxes and swc dynamics at depths of 40 and 60 cm the effect of season at a depth of 20 cm was manifested in stronger ts swc smaller sdrd in winter 2016 and or growing 2014 seasons as compared with the other monitoring seasons fig 13b the reason for that was more uniform distributions of precipitation during these two seasons fig 2 which resulted in relatively gradual changes and smaller oscillations in swc than in the other seasons fig 6 at a depth of 40 cm the effect of season was thp specific it appeared only in the su sl df branch of the tree fig 13d and separated season with relatively strong ts swc winter 2016 from those with weak ts swc winter 2015 growing 2016 the association of the season variables with the thp and depth may mean different sensitivity of soil in these locations to changes in the weather conditions soil hydraulic properties and or different water fluxes in these locations it was shown before section 4 1 that soil texture had only a minor effect on ts swc therefore it is reasonable to assume that water fluxes played a major role in the temporal stability indeed the probability of low precipitation and thus low overland and subsurface water fluxes was much higher in winter 2016 than in the four other seasons our results concur with biswas and si 2011 who observed stronger time stability between soil moisture measurements taken within the same season intra season than between measurements taken during different seasons inter season zhu and lin 2011 also observed an effect of both season and crop cover on soil water dynamics with notable contrast between fallow seasons and those with crop cover contrastingly however grayson and western 1998 identified similar temporally stable sites at their experimental location in southeastern australia which remained unchanged despite contrasting seasons this again is an indication of an interactive effect between several variables on ts swc the grayson and western experiment was not performed on agricultural land which removed any variation introduced for example by the growth and subsequent removal of crops 4 3 the effect of topography and hydrology the topo hydrological variable was present in all regression trees it was the first splitting variable in the sdrd regression trees for the three depths fig 13b d f the first variable for mrd at a depth of 60 cm fig 13e and the second variable for mrd at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 13a c overall stronger ts swc smaller sdrd was observed in all depths of dd and depths of 20 cm of sl fig 13a c e as compared with the su and df this grouping seemed controversial because similarity of soil properties were observed within whereas differences were observed between the groups su sl and dd df respectively figs 4 and 5 moreover all three thp had rather different hydrological conditions specifically su did not receive any run on water in addition to precipitation sl lost part of its precipitation to runoff dd and df received run on water from the uphill area but perched water and accumulation of surface water was observed only at df therefore both sl dd and su df groups had dissimilar soil properties and hydrological conditions within the groups this apparent contradiction in grouping of the topographical variables by the regression tree could be explained by the specifics of the sdrd statistic discussed earlier in section 4 1 swc dynamics were to a lesser extent affected by changing weather in sl due to runoff losses and a moderate slope of the soil water retention Œ¥Œ∏ Œ¥ pf fig 5a c whereas in dd the increase in overland water fluxes run on and a steeper slope of soil water retention was compensated by much faster vertical water fluxes through the soil due to high unsaturated hydraulic conductivity it should also be mentioned that sdrd were higher for all seasons except growing 2014 for sl than that for dd 3 dd 5 at a depth of 20 cm fig 13b the similarity between sl and dd was observed only for dd 1 and dd 2 which was likely associated with nearly the same elevation of these locations fig 1 the locations below this elevation dd 3 dd 5 demonstrated ts patterns which differed from sl and dd 1 dd 2 locations indicating that the effect of topography is more complicated than just slope and elevation the similarity in ts swc at su and df locations observed at a depth of 20 cm had different origins in the absence of runoff and high water retention this layer at su eventually received and retained more water than sl locations df likely received nearly the same run on water as dd however retained it longer and in larger amounts due to lower water permeability of the deep soil layers which caused formation of perched water in df therefore oscillations of swc in su due to water retention were of the same order of magnitude as those at df but caused by perched water fig 6 in both thp these oscillations decreased ts swc higher sdrd fig 13b the results of the regression tree agreed with the results of anova analysis and indicated insignificant differences within and significant differences between sl dd and su df groups for sdrd fig 10b the regression tree for sdrd at a depth of 40 cm differed from that at a depth of 20 cm the sdrd were smaller at dd as compared with the other locations for all monitoring seasons the thp variable did not play a role in the higher branches of this regression tree indicating less importance of this variable as compared to soil properties season and crops for these branches the similarity in sdrd for these thp was confirmed by the anova results fig 10 b where the differences between these locations were not statistically significant at a depth of 60 cm significantly higher mrd were observed at df as compared with the other thp fig 8c however these thp were presented differently in the regression tree for sdrd in the sdrd tree dd was split in a separate group with the strongest ts and the other thp were split further to su sl and df with the weakest ts for the latter group fig 13f the fact that two depressions demonstrated the strongest and weakest ts swc indicated the importance of the subsurface water fluxes since both locations received runoff from uphill area unfortunately this factor is difficult to take into account due to scarce data of monitoring perched water dynamics even at a field scale similarly to our study zhu and lin 2011 also found that the effect of topography is more pronounced in deeper soil layers than at the soil surface where soil properties vegetation conditions and season interact with topography and increase in importance overall the effect of topography on soil water distribution patterns becomes more important as the topography becomes more pronounced while soil properties increase in importance in areas with less topographical variability brocca et al 2009b also found that lateral flow of soil water due to topography plays a significant role in the spatial redistribution of soil water and affects where temporally stable locations within a field exist gomez plaza et al 2000 observed that although topography had a significant effect on ts swc this effect is scale dependent with soil moisture patterns remaining stable at a small catchment scale while at smaller scales patterns either become unstable or an interactive effect with vegetation cover will present in addition to the effect of topography this is in agreement with our findings in that interactive effects between soil properties topography season and crop exist on ts swc gomez plaza s study however was conducted in the semi arid environment of southeast spain which may affect the applicability of their findings across climatic regions 4 4 the effect of crops crops appeared only in the fourth level of the mrd trees indicating their importance only for specific seasons and locations for example for all seasons mrd was the smallest at 20 cm depth for corn and rye at dd 3 and dd 4 and the largest for soybeans during growing 2014 and winter 2015 seasons fig 13 a however since soybeans were not grown during winter seasons one can assume that the crop variable substituted for the seasonal variable in this branch of the regression tree this conclusion is consistent with the anova results which did not indicate significant differences between the crops fig 10f for the sdrd statistics the crop variables in most instances were grouped as fallow rye and corn soybeans with generally smaller sdrd for the former group at all depths fig 13b d f such grouping indicates a substitution of the crop variable similar to that in the mrd regression tree a possible explanation for the absence of the crop effect on ts swc is that different transpiration from corn and soybean during growing seasons and from rye and fallow during winter seasons affected the relative values of swc mrd were positive for soybeans and rye and negative for corn and fallow fig 10e however transpiration did not affect oscillations of swc therefore the differences in sdrd for the four crops were not statistically significant fig 10f and thus were not identified by the regression trees the interaction of crops with seasons was also noted by zhu and lin 2011 and biswas and si 2011 the former found this effect to be present at the plot and hillslope scale while the latter noted that during seasons when vegetation was present summer and fall stronger temporal stability was observed between these seasons while patterns in spring were distinctly different in the present study this effect may indeed have been partially obscured by the fact that soybean and corn were only grown during summer seasons while rye and fallow conditions were specific to winter seasons resulting in difficulty separating the effects of crops and seasons the combined effect of vegetation and topography on ts swc also appears to be scale dependent gomez plaza et al 2000 with lower temporal stability observed across different thp at the small catchment scale when vegetation was present and the effect of vegetation disappearing in favor of thp at the point scale 4 5 persistence of temporal stability in locations presence of ts swc patterns for different monitoring seasons is further referred to as a persistence of temporal stability in locations locations with the strongest ts swc was not persistent during the 5 monitoring seasons this was likely a result of interaction between the four factors on ts swc among other thp the strongest ts swc smallest sdrd were observed more frequently in the two depressions at a depth of 20 cm and in dd at depths of 40 and 60 cm table 6 indicating higher probability of occurrence of ts swc in this thp there also was no single location with ts swc across all three monitoring depths that could be attributed to high spatial variability of soil properties in the studied area both in vertical and lateral directions fig 4 this observation concurs with our earlier results obtained at a topographically plain field during two year monitoring of soil moisture guber et al 2008 and with results obtained by tallon and si 2004 for a gently rolling field 5 10 slope the absence of persistence may partly be attributed to the crop rotation for the growing periods ts swc at depths of 20 and 40 cm was observed twice under corn and once under soybeans and for the winter seasons at depths of 40 and 60 cm interchangeably under rye and fallow conditions table 6 this observation does not imply that the field plots must be split by crops for swc monitoring and ts analysis this is clear from sdrd statistics shown in fig 10f for the 4 crops and from regression trees for sdrd fig 13b d f and it indicates the absence of significant differences associated with crops and its minor effect as a splitting variable in the sdrd regression trees however our results do imply that crop rotation should be considered in selecting a representative location for swc monitoring the effect of crop rotation on ts swc can be explained by different root activity on the same thp during 5 monitoring seasons root activity has been shown to affect swc dynamics resulting in increasing spatial variance of swc teuling and troch 2005 and weakening its ts in shallow soil layers cassel et al 2000 the crops i e corn rye soybeans and their absence used in this study presumably had rather different vertical distributions of root densities and root water uptake respectively therefore their rotation on the same plot depending on currently planted crops and their development stage could increase or decrease spatial variance of swc and strengthen or weaken ts swc at different depths moreover these depths for the same plants can be different for at least two reasons first vertical distribution of plant root density depends on vertical distribution of soil properties i e bulk density water retention and nutrient content in profiles which directly affects root growth and location in soil layers second for the same root density distributions in a soil profile root water uptake controlled to a large extent by soil hydraulic properties can be much smaller in coarse textured layers as compared to fine textured layers this occurs due to generally smaller water holding capacity of coarse soils which causes the appearance of plant water stress much earlier in these soils as compared to the coarse textured soils our findings are supported by results of spatial soil moisture variance analysis conducted in well drained silty loam under maize production teuling and troch 2005 these authors demonstrated that depending on hydrological conditions water uptake by vegetation may or may not create additional variance in swc dynamics the persistence of ts swc was partly affected by the weather conditions but this effect decreased with the depth for a depth of 20 cm su was a more temporally stable location table 5 during the season with highly variable precipitation fig 2 whereas dd and df thp were more persistent with minor variability in precipitation the 5 seasons were obviously too short to collect data for in depth statistical analysis of weather effect on persistence of ts swc in locations and thus this question was beyond objectives of this study yet our observations could be valuable for further researches in this direction 4 6 insights into the origin of ts swc analysis of the relationship between temporal stability and variability of swc conducted in the section 3 4 revealed that ts swc is not a reciprocal of temporal variability of swc the strongest ts swc occurred in those locations where the temporal variability of swc was close to the spatially averaged variability of temporal mean swc in locations sdmwc fig 11 all studied factors i e soil texture crops weather topo hydrology affected the variability of swc in individual locations to a certain extent furthermore spatial variability of soil properties at thp and crop rotations commonly present on farmlands creates a variety of scenarios which could be realized or not under specific weather conditions for example during extended droughts swc variability is likely to be associated with different soil properties i e soil water retention and vegetation type and development stage whereas during wet seasons the impact of overland and subsurface fluxes on variability of swc is likely to be much stronger grayson et al 1997 constantly changing scenarios causes changes in the spatial organization of swc demonstrated for example by western et al 1999 and sdmwc accordingly it can be seen in fig 11 that sdmwc were rather different for the five seasons this explains the absence of a single location with ts swc patterns within the whole monitoring time table 6 moreover there is no clear association of sdmwc with depth the order of sdmwc at the three monitoring depths changed almost randomly between the five seasons this explains the absence of a single soil profile where ts swc was the strongest at all depths table 6 for any of the five seasons these findings raise an important question of representativeness of locations with different variability of swc for assessment of ts and implementation of ts analysis in practice since swc itself controls its ts vanderlinden et al 2012 different representation of locations with high and low temporal variability of swc within a studied area may produce controversial conclusions about the effects of examined factors on the ts swc this is aligned with mart√≠nez et al 2014 who concluded that the large site to site differences in ts swc demonstrated in existing literature are the result of site specific combinations of soil climate season and sampling frequency 5 conclusions the results of this study clearly showed that surface topography and hydrology play an important role in ts swc patterns at the scale of an agricultural field at this scale ts swc was controlled by the interaction of all studied factors i e soil properties weather conditions vegetation and surface topography with a dominant influence of topography and hydrology over the other factors at the three studied depths among other locations the ts swc patterns were more frequently observed in depressions where swc was controlled by soil properties local control and surface and subsurface hydrological conditions non local control the ts swc patterns were less frequently observed in summits and slopes where the local control was dominated over the non local ts swc locations were not persistent during the monitoring period of time there was not a single location with ts swc in the whole soil profile even within a single monitoring season and locations with the highest ts swc at each depth changed over the 5 monitoring seasons this was caused by high spatial and temporal variability of local and non local controls of swc within the same and between different thps the latter may complicate designs of swc monitoring networks and agronomic experiments with replicated plots when plots located at the same thp are not true replicates due to different controls of swc ts swc expressed as sdrd weakened with the deviation of the temporal variability of swc in individual locations from the spatially averaged variability of temporal mean swc in locations sdmwc in this study therefore presence of ts swc in locations is clearly associated with the temporal variability of swc at this point presence or absence of ts swc ultimately depends on representation of locations with different temporal variability of swc in the examined dataset our results are relevant to the field scale and specific soil properties weather conditions and crop management practices used in this study we did not intend to extend our results to large scales or different soils weather and topographical conditions the goal of this study was to provide better

5950,temporal stability ts of soil water content swc is commonly used to identify representative locations for swc monitoring to recover missing monitoring data to design agronomic experiments and to validate remote sensing methods even though the factors affecting ts swc i e scale sampling methods and frequency weather conditions soil properties vegetation surface topography and surface subsurface hydrology are well known their interaction and combined effect on ts swc is poorly understood to fill this knowledge gap we monitored swc during three growing and two winter seasons at four topo hydrological positions thp summit slope dry depression and flooded depression of an agricultural field under corn soybean rotation with and without cover crop rye twenty 10 m 10 m experimental plots were located at the four thp in mason mi usa swc was monitored at depths of 20 40 and 60 cm from june 2014 through oct 2016 we used the vachaud et al 1985 approach to quantify ts swc and anova ancova and a regression tree exploratory tool to evaluate the effects of weather conditions soil properties vegetation and surface topography hydrology on ts swc our results showed that the latter factor plays an important role in ts swc patterns at the scale of an agricultural field ts swc patterns were more frequently observed in locations where the effect of local soil properties vegetation controls interfered with the non local surface and subsurface water fluxes controls of swc dynamics the presence of ts swc was clearly associated with the temporal variability of swc in individual locations suggesting that ts swc depends on representation of locations with different temporal variability of swc in the examined dataset abbreviations bd bulk density dd dry depression df flooded

stability ts of soil water content swc is the phenomenon of average swc being preserved in time at certain locations within a field plot or watershed vachaud et al 1985 the term can also be applied to defining locations that are either persistently wetter than the field average or persistently dryer than the field average as such the concept of ts swc has found many applications in hydrological monitoring in the context of soil water monitoring it is important to select monitoring sites that are representative of the monitored area as a whole whether at the plot field or watershed scale ts swc can be used to identify such representative locations for instance heathman et al 2009 used the ts swc concept to identify locations at both the field and watershed scale that adequately represented average swc for a given area in order to define the location for future monitoring stations as well as sampling protocols neves et al 2017 also applied the ts swc concept to determine appropriate sampling locations and swc measurement frequency at the field scale another area of application of ts swc is in hydrologic modeling brocca et al 2009a applied the concept of ts swc to rainfall runoff modeling where the correct estimation of swc prior to a precipitation event was critical also in the context of swc monitoring and hydrologic modeling ts swc can be used to fill in missing sensor data in the event of data loss due to malfunctioning probes pachepsky et al 2005 an additional implementation of ts swc is in the design of agronomic experiments cassel et al 2000 pointed out that systematic deviations of swc from field averaged values indicated differences of soil properties across that field and caused variability of crop yield this tremendously complicated the design of adequate treatment experiments with replicated plots as well as the statistical analysis of experimental data finally several studies have applied the concept of ts swc to the validation of remote sensed surface soil moisture measurements grayson and western 1998 jacobs et al 2004 showed that ts swc can be used to determine a single sampling location to validate remotely sensed soil moisture data collected at the field scale cosh et al 2008 examined the ts swc at the watershed scale in a semi arid environment and found that although the remotely sensed swc was representative of the watershed average this agreement disappeared at the finer scale due to localized high variation in swc cosh et al 2006 also showed that ts swc concept can be applied to identify temporally stable representative locations within a watershed that can then be used to validate remotely sensed swc data a comprehensive literature review by vanderlinden et al 2012 examined eight factors of ts swc sensor properties depth and layer thickness spatial scale and density of swc monitoring network measurement duration and frequency soil properties vegetation climate and seasonality and topography the review indicated that the studies vary in their findings and many results are controversial specifically the effect of weather seasonality on ts swc was demonstrated in a study by grayson et al 1997 who conceptually related dry and wet states of swc patters to the local dominated by vertical fluxes and nonlocal dominated by lateral water movement controls kachanoski and de jong 1988 found that ts swc observed during soil drying was only preserved for recharge events at a spatial scale 40 m based on modeling water flow in homogeneous hypothetical soil profiles with different soil texture where only local control affected swc mart√≠nez et al 2014 demonstrated that ts swc could be site specific with respect to climate and soil properties those authors emphasized the importance of sampling frequency to capture seasonal features of the specific climate then in a field study neves et al 2017 showed that ts swc patterns are affected by precipitation patterns and more frequent swc sampling is necessary during wetter years in addition jacobs et al 2004 showed that appropriate sampling frequency is dependent on swc with a higher sampling frequency needed for low 10 and high 25 soil moisture conditions than for intermediate soil moisture conditions the effect of seasonality on ts swc was examined for a hummocky landscape of the canadian prairie by biswas and si 2011 the intra seasonal ts swc was stronger as comparted to the inter seasonal in their study which was attributed to the vegetation interaction of weather patterns and vegetation was found by wang et al 2015 those authors showed a significant impact control of vegetation on ts swc particularly under drier conditions they also observed that root water uptake weakened ts swc during growing seasons similar results were obtained by gomez plaza et al 2000 for three transects across a small catchment with natural and burned vegetation and by hupet and vanclooster 2002 for an agricultural field under maize production moreover the effect of vegetation was plant specific with the strongest ts swc patterns observed under alfalfa and the weakest under millet crops jia and shao 2013 unlike the results of wang et al 2015 where soil properties did not affect ts swc a mixed site specific effect of vegetation and soil properties was observed in a semi arid steppe of china zhao et al 2010 metrics of ts swc positively correlated with soil organic carbon and clay content while negatively correlated with sand content in their study on the contrary time stable sites showed poor relationships to soil properties along a 612 m transect under wheat fallow rotation in a tallon and si 2004 study the relationship between ts swc and topography was also poor suggesting the absence of a single dominant control of swc surface topography is known to affect various soil processes either directly or indirectly and several studies have demonstrated its direct effect on ts swc kachanoski and de jong 1988 emphasized the importance of local topography for spatial scales 30 m for ts swc where the local variability of surface curvature creates highly variable overland water fluxes that alter the spatial patters of sw tomer and anderson 1995 reported that topography accounted for 51 to 77 of variation in soil water storage on a sand plain hillslope indicating the importance of topographical features in this context several other studies also mentioned that surface topography might affect soil moisture dynamics and ts swc patterns brocca et al 2009b biswas and si 2011 zhu and lin 2011 examined the effect of spatial scale in conjunction with soil properties crop type and topography on swc dynamics they found that at the scale of landform unit topography dominated over soil properties in the steep landforms 8 slope and vice versa in the flat landforms another important observation from their study was the effect of depth to bedrock on swc patterns consisting in persistently higher swc in locations with shallow depths to bedrock 0 4 0 5 m the controls of soil moisture variability were re examined by baroni et al 2013 those authors found that under wet conditions the spatial distribution of soil moisture is primarily controlled by soil texture whereas under dry conditions the spatial patters of swc are affected mostly by the spatial variability of the vegetation furthermore the interaction between soil texture and vegetation is most important under intermediate soil moisture conditions finally revising the concept of local nonlocal controls vereecken et al 2014 highlighted that soil moisture variability at the field scale is determined by the complex interaction of local and nonlocal controls the soil moisture state at which a transition from local to non local controls takes place is still a matter of debate and subject of ongoing research the reviewed literature indicated that most temporal stability studies were conducted in contrasting climate conditions or conditions with clear seasonal weather patterns and native vegetation where the dominance of local and nonlocal controls of ts swc was well defined due to their temporal and spatial persistence in agricultural environments with crop rotation and soil disturbance by tillage soil properties and vegetation do not persist in space and time and it is reasonable to expect an interaction of local and nonlocal controls of ts swc this study was aimed to better understand the interactive effect of soil properties topography seasonality and crops on ts swc at the scale of agricultural field with different crop rotations the objectives of this study are 1 to study the spatial patterns of soil water content across different topo hydrological positions at the field scale 2 to test whether these patterns persist throughout seasons with different vegetation crops and weather conditions and 3 to test the association of ts swc with soil properties crops topographical positions and hydrological conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and crop rotation the experimental site was located in mason michigan united states at 42 37 n 84 26 w in south central michigan soils at this site consisted of four different soil series first aubbeenaubbee capac sandy loams which belong to the taxonomic class of fine loamy mixed active mesic aeric epiaqualfs second capac sandy loam which is a fine loamy mixed active mesic aquic glossudalf third colwood brookston loam a fine loamy mixed active mesic typic endoaquoll finally marlette loam which is a fine loamy mixed semiactive mesic oxyaquic glossudalf the experimental site exhibited moderate topographical variation with total elevation varying from 275 6 m to 278 7 m above sea level three distinct topographical elements were visible in the landscape specifically a summit area sloped areas with slopes varying from 1 to 11 and two discrete depression areas one of which regularly experienced flooded conditions while the other did not to distinguish between different hydrological conditions flooded vs not flooded at the same topographical element i e depression the four studied areas were referred further to as topo hydrological positions thp which included summit su slope sl dry depression dd and flooded depression df soil texture was represented by 4 textural classes at four thp

corn and soybeans with and without winter cover crops rye as shown in table 3 2 2 soil properties and water content monitoring soil bulk density total soil organic content and soil texture were measured at depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm in the 20 experimental plots using the standard methods dane et al 2002 soil bulk density was measured biweekly while total soil organic carbon content was measured once at the beginning and once at the end of each growing season soil texture was measured once at the beginning of the experiment the soil hydraulic properties were estimated from measured soil properties using the rosetta software schaap et al 2001 the rosetta software was developed using a large dataset 2134 soil samples for water retention and 235 soil samples for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity collected from north america and europe and represented all soil textural classes accept sc for the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity we used a single pedotransfer function i e neural network to avoid uncertainty associated with the different data sources and approaches to estimating the soil hydraulic properties swc monitoring was conducted at the twenty experimental plots during the five monitoring seasons one set of decagon 10hs soil sensors was installed in each of the 20 experimental plots the sensors were installed vertically with centers located at depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm and were connected to 5 channel em50 data loggers meter group inc pullman wa usa the sensors measured water content in the soil volumes of approximately 3000 cm3 at 30 minute time intervals the sensors were periodically removed from the depth of 20 cm for the field operations and reinstalled in the same locations the sensors at depths of 40 cm and 60 cm were not removed during the field operations we buried the sensor cables below the tillage depth between the seasons some malfunctioning sensors were replaced during the 3 year monitoring to assure accuracy of swc measurements the factory calibrations were corrected for all sensors including those reinstalled following the procedure similar to guber et al 2010 the correction consisted of establishing a relationship between swc calculated using the factory provided sensor calibration and water contents in samples taken from the same depth outside of the sensor installation zone biweekly during the periods of time when sensors were used for swc monitoring undisturbed 137 cm3 soil cores were taken from the depths of 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm at a distance of 30 40 cm around the sensors using a soil core sampler model 0200cs soilmoisture equipment corp santa barbara ca for direct measurements of volumetric swc a linear regression between the sensor measured and the directly measured volumetric swc was used for correction of the factory calibrations fig 3 1 Œ∏ c a Œ∏ f b where Œ∏c and Œ∏f are swc measured directly in the field and obtained using the factory calibration respectively cm3 cm 3 the coefficients a and b corrected the slope and bias of the factory calibration respectively an example of the linear regression i e eq 1 is shown in fig 3 the correction was done for each sensor separately using all swc measured during 5 monitoring seasons for reinstalled sensors the calibrations were corrected for each period of time when the sensors were used for monitoring the corrected water content measurements reflect the average water contents across the sampling area rather than water contents in the small zone around the sensor this was particularly important for the top 20 cm soil layer which was disturbed by the tillage and thus was rather heterogeneous since soil samples were taken beyond the sensor installation and the sampling holes were backfilled with the same soil the disturbance around the sensors was minimized to allow a long term monitoring of swc 2 3 characteristics of swc variability and temporal stability daily measured at 12 00 pm and hourly data of swc monitoring were used in ts swc analysis the daily and hourly datasets included only dates time for each depth where swc were present in all 20 monitoring locations therefore missing data in any location did not affect results of the ts analysis because of sensor malfunction the total number of data differed for each depth table 4 to characterize the absolute values and variability of swc associated with the soil properties vegetation surface topography and seasonal weather conditions measured dynamics of swc were represented by the temporal mean and the standard deviation of swc calculated separately for each depth location and season as Œ∏ i 1 n j j 1 n j Œ∏ i j 2 sdwc i 1 n j 1 j 1 n j Œ∏ i j Œ∏ i 2 where Œ∏ i j is the swc measured at location i at time j cm3 cm 3 Œ∏ i is the time averaged swc at location i cm3 cm 3 sdwci is the standard deviation of swc at location i cm3 cm 3 Œ∏ i is the number of observations in each season for notation simplicity the indexes for depths and seasons are omitted in the equations to quantify the deviation of swc from swc averaged across the field for time moments j Œ∏ j separately for each depth location and season we used the mean relative difference mrdi vachaud et al 1985 vanderlinden et al 2012 rd i j Œ∏ i j Œ∏ j Œ∏ j 3 mrd i 1 n j j 1 n j rd i j to quantify the ts swc in these locations the standard deviation sdrdi was computed for each depth and location at each season 4 sdr d i 1 n j 1 j 1 n j r d i j m r d i 2 smaller sdrd corresponded to stronger temporally stable swc patterns in the locations we also tested whether ts swc can be explained by temporal variation of swc in the individual locations therefore sdrdi values calculated for each location and season were correlated to sdwci for the same locations and seasons 2 4 experimental design and statistical analyses for the factor analysis we used anova ancova with the proc mixed and proc glimmix procedures of sas 9 4 software cary nc the topo hydrological position was the first studied factor in the data analysis the second factor was thecrop introduced in the studied crop rotation with four levels corn soybean rye and fallow the third factor was season with five levels growing 2014 winter 2015 growing 2015 winter 2016 and growing 2016 the effects of these factors were analyzed on the parameters of ts separately for each monitoring depth since the effects of season and crop were confounded the comparisons were conducted only among the marginal means of the studied factors no interactions were considered the response variables in the statistical analysis were mwc and sdwc mrd and sdrd respectively additionally the effect of topography and depth on soil properties was analyzed in a separate set of models the analyzed soil properties were sand content sand clay content clay organic carbon oc and bulk density bd a regression tree approach breiman et al 1984 was used to evaluate the relative importance of the studied factors on ts of swc in r r core and team 2018 four separate models were created all of which had thp crop season and sand to clay ratio scr as the predictors the outcome variables were mrd and sdrd the trees were created using the anova method in the r package rpart therneau and atkinson 2019 and then visualized using rpart plot milborrow 2018 3 results 3 1 soil properties and swc monitoring soil properties varied with the depth and thp of the experimental site overall an increase in clay content with the depth fig 4 a and a decrease in oc fig 4c were observed in all thp clay content tended to decrease while sand and oc content tended to increase with decreasing elevation of experimental plots fig 4 a c however the differences were statistically significant only between groups su sl and dd df for depths 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm there was no clear association of bd with depth or thp except for the top 10 cm soil layer where bd consistently decreased with elevation and was the smallest in the df fig 4d the trends observed for soil properties associated with depths and thp translated into differences in soil water retention estimated using the rosetta software fig 5 for the same pressure heads soil water contents were smaller in the depressions dd and df than in su and sl these differences were more pronounced at a depth of 40 cm fig 5b than at depths of 20 cm fig 5a and 60 cm fig 5c and were caused by higher clay content and lower sand content at depth of 40 cm in the su and sl positions as compared to the depression it implies that under similar weather and vegetation conditions and in absence of overland water flow swc would be higher at the su and sl positions and lower in the dd and df overall the decagon 10hs sensors performed well over the five monitoring periods only 3 sensors installed at a depth of 60 cm in locations su 2 dd 2 and df 5 systematically malfunctioned and thus these measurements were excluded from further analysis high temporal and spatial variability was observed in swc at the four thp as illustrated in fig 6 swc highly oscillated in some thp over the whole monitoring period of time e g df at depth of 20 cm in fig 6 or during specific seasons e g su at depth of 20 cm during growing 2015 2016 seasons however the swc oscillations were moderate or even minor in sl and dd during the whole monitoring period or for specific seasons e g su at depth of 20 cm for growing 2014 and winter 2015 seasons this means that the soil at different thp responded quite differently to the same changes in weather conditions interestingly the oscillations in swc decreased with the depth however differences between swc in the four thp increased with depth and were largest between df and dd at a depth of 60 cm fig 6 indicating a dominant effect of subsurface hydrology at this locations swcs averaged over each monitoring season were different at the four thp in general the highest mwcs were observed at depths of 20 and 40 cm at two locations in the flooded depression df 1 and df 2 fig 7 a b and at a depth of 60 cm at four locations in the flooded depression df 1 df 4 the lowest mwcs were observed in the dry depression locations dd 3 dd 5 at all monitoring depths fig 7a c and part of the flooded depression at a depths of 20 and 40 cm locations df 4 and df 5 fig 7a b all other locations exhibited intermediate mwc which varied between the locations depths and seasons the differences in mwc translated to the differences in mrd which clearly demonstrated the trends associated with the thp specifically among other locations mrd were the highest in locations df 1 and df 2 of the flooded depression whereas mrd were the smallest negative in locations of the dry depression dd 3 dd 5 for all monitoring depths and in the flooded depression df 4 and df 5 for the depths of 20 cm and 40 cm fig 8 there was no consistency in the mrd among su and sl locations over the five monitoring periods at a depth of 20 cm the mrd were interchangeably positive and negative in the growing and winter seasons fig 8a interestingly the mdr were mostly positive at a depth of 40 cm fig 8b and negative at a depth of 60 cm in these locations fig 8c these trends could be attributed to the high negative and positive values of mrd in the depressions at depths of 40 and 60 cm respectively fig 8b c since the sum of mrd across all locations must be zero mrd in su and sl had an opposite sign to mrd in most dd and df locations 3 2 swc sampling interval and the ts statistics to examine the effect of sampling frequency on the statistics of ts swc we compared hourly and daily mrd and sdrd separately for the five seasons and the three depths the daily datasets included from 55 to 184 observations for the four seasons at each depth while the hourly datasets included from 2839 to 3411 swc observations table 4 despite large differences in the total number of observations the mrd and sdrd calculated for daily swc data did not differ significantly from those calculated for hourly swc fig 9 the root mean square differences rmsd between daily and hourly ts statistics ranged from 0 77 10 3 to 3 76 10 3 for mrd and from 0 90 10 3 to 3 82 10 3 for sdrd respectively for the first four monitoring seasons the rmsd were much larger for the growing 2016 season and ranged from 2 90 10 2 to 5 58 10 2 for mrd and from 2 40 10 2 to 4 52 10 2 to for sdrd these large differences were caused by the fact that approximately 50 days in the daily dataset contained missing observations at 12 00 pm to better represent swc data for all seasons only hourly measurements were used further in the ts analysis 3 3 temporal stability of swc the effects of thp season and crops the effect of topo hydrology on the deviations of swc in individual locations from the average water contents across the field mrd was not obvious the differences between mrd at the 4 thp were not significant at a depth of 20 cm at a depth of 40 cm mrd at dd was statistically smaller negative than mrd at su and df positive fig 10 a most differences in mrd were observed at a depth of 60 cm where the highest positive and lowest negative values occurred at df and dd respectively the variability of mrd expressed as the standard deviation of the set of relative differences from mwc for a given set of observations sdrd and the metric for temporal stability of swc was affected by thp overall among thp sdrd were the largest for df smallest for dd at all depths and intermediate for su and sl fig 10b however the differences in sdrd for all depths were statistically significant only between df and dd at all three depths with the exception of 20 cm where df was not significantly different from su these results mean that swc was most temporally stable in dd and less stable in df at all monitoring depths the seasons did not affect mrd at the three depths despite visual differences between mrd obtained for the five monitoring seasons these differences were not statistically significant due to high standard errors caused by high spatial variability of mrd fig 10c contrary to mrd there was an effect of season on sdrd for the 20 cm depth the highest sdrd were obtained for winter 2015 growing 2015 and growing 2016 seasons fig 10d the effect of season weakened with the depth and entirely disappeared at depth of 60 cm at a depth of 40 cm sdrd were higher for the 2015 seasons as compared with the winter 2016 fig 10d the differences between growing 2014 season and two monitoring seasons of 2016 were not statistically significant despite differences in precipitation fig 2 these results indicated overall stronger temporal stability of swc in growing 2014 and winter 2016 and weaker stability in winter 2015 and growing 2015 and 2016 seasons the mrd differed for the four crops and were positive for soybeans and rye and negative for corn and fallow at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 10e however these differences were not statistically significant p 0 05 we also did not find significant differences associated with the crops in sdrd at the tree depths fig 10f the absence of differences was likely caused by a high variation of mrd and sdrd at different thp during different seasons therefore the effect of crops was likely masked by the other two factors monitoring depth introduced an uncertainty into the interpretation of results obtained at different thp there were no clear relationships between mrd and depth at four thp for four crops during five seasons fig 10a c e however sdrd obviously decreased with the depth fig 10b d f indicating more temporarily stable swc dynamics in deeper soil layers 3 4 relationship between temporal stability and variability of swc correlation analysis showed that temporal stability was closely related to the temporal variability of swc in the monitoring locations however it appeared that ts swc strengthens sdrd decreases with increasing sdwc to a certain point and then weakens sdrd increases with further increasing sdwc fig 11 the values of sdwc with the smallest sdrd were very close to the standard deviations of the time averaged swc in individual locations Œ∏ i calculated separately for each depth and monitoring season sdmwc the pearson correlation coefficients became high and statistically significant table 4 when sdrd were correlated to the absolute differences sdwc sdmwc for all seasons fig 12 the difference sdwc sdmwc represents deviation of temporal variability in swc calculated in individual locations from the variability of Œ∏ i averaged across the field both higher and lower variability of swc in locations sdwc as compared to the field average variability sdmwc resulted in degradation of ts swc 4 discussion as expected the results of the statistical analysis showed a combined effect of multiple factors on temporal stability of swc there are four main factors influencing changes in swc they are i water influx into the soil ii soil water retention iii water losses to evaporation drainage and iv root water uptake the water influx to the soil depends on precipitation soil hydraulic properties and state of vegetation generally the influx to the soil increases with the amount of precipitation however part of the precipitation is intercepted by vegetation and does not reach the soil surface a large leaf area intercepts more water but the intercepting capacity of the leaves is limited at around 15 of precipitation at rainfall amounts of 5 mm rijtema and de vries 1994 and precipitation exceeding this capacity reaches the soil surface not all rainfall water that reaches the soil surface infiltrates into the soil depending on soil matrix pressure and hydraulic conductivity part of this water transforms into runoff and moves to depressions both soil matrix pressure and hydraulic conductivity depend on soil properties i e texture structure bulk density organic matter content etc and saturation of soil pores water content the latter is influenced by antecedent weather conditions rainfalls droughts and vegetation status root water uptake the vegetation status in turn depends on antecedent weather conditions and soil hydraulic properties soil water retention finally the amount of water that reaches the depressions depends on rainfall characteristics i e intensity and head area drained to the depression and soil properties on thp the last may vary greatly across thp biswas and si 2011 and kravchenko and bullock 2000 sophisticated interrelationships between these factors introduce great uncertainty into the interpretation of results of ts swc to better understand the interactions between the studied factors i e soil properties crops seasons and topography we used the regression tree exploratory tool 4 1 the effect of soil texture soil texture as expressed by sand to clay ratio scr was the first splitting variable for mrd at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 13 a c the ratios of 14 96 and 5 376 separated loamy sand from other soils textural classes at depths of 20 and 40 cm respectively despite the fact that this soil texture was found only in the depressions which received water from an uphill area during rainfalls and thus soil in the depressions was expected to be wetter than in the other locations low water retention and high hydraulic conductivity of loamy sand fig 5 canceled out the effect of topography i e run on therefore despite the fact that su and sl lost part of precipitation as surface runoff mwc and mrd were persistently smaller at a depth of 20 cm in dd 5 df 4 and df 5 and at a depth of 40 cm in dd 3 dd 5 and df 3 df 5 than in the same depths of su and sl figs 7a and 8a a strong effect of soil texture on mrd was also found at a depth of 60 cm the scr appeared at the second and third levels of the regression trees right after the thp fig 13e and separated the locations in the order of increasing mrd with decrease of scr in nonflooded locations this trend is consistent with the general theory of water retention for soil textural classes e g hillel 2004 and with our estimates of soil water retention from soil texture fig 5 fine soil texture retains more water and thus is wetter than a coarse texture under the same weather conditions surprisingly soil texture was not among top splitting variables in the sdrd regression trees it was not present in the sdrd tree at a depth of 40 cm fig 13d whereas soil texture appeared only in the third level sdrd trees at depths of 20 and 60 cm fig 13b f these results indicate that soil texture primarily controls relative mrd values of swc in different thp via soil hydraulic properties whereas the temporal stability sdrd of swc was controlled by the other factors the presence of soil texture as a splitting variable at a depth of 40 cm and its absence at depths of 20 and 60 cm of the sdrd regression trees were attributed to the differences of the slope on the soil water retention curves for su sl and dd df at these depths the steeper the slope Œ∏ p f the larger the changes in swc are for the same changes in the soil pressure head and thus the higher temporal variability and weaker temporal stability of swc are the differences in the slope between soils in the depressions and su sl were more pronounced at a depth of 40 cm fig 5b and less pronounced at depth of 20 and 60 cm fig 5a c there were also larger differences between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kw between the two groups i e su sl and dd df at a depth of 40 cm fig 5e which likely caused faster changes in swc at the depressions and thus increased the temporal variability in the depressions results of the regression tree analysis clearly showed that for these soils soil texture had only a minor effect on the variability and temporal stability of swc these findings are consistent with the general theory of water flow in unsaturated soils e g hillel 2004 differences in soil texture between the thp affected both soil water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity in locations with similar soil texture su and sl and hydrological conditions precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration water content dynamics did not differ significantly due to insignificant differences in soil water fluxes therefore both mrd and sdrd were of the same order of magnitude in these locations fig 10a b in locations with dissimilar soil properties though similar topographical conditions i e dd or df contrasting soil properties i e between dd 1 dd 2 and dd 3 dd 5 or between df 1 df 2 and df 3 df 5 resulted in dissimilarity in swc dynamics and mrd respectively however these dissimilarities did not always translate into difference in sdrd this is because of the specifics of the sdrd statistic sdrd is a measure of deviation of normalized differences of swc in locations rd from rd averaged over the whole monitoring period for each location smaller sdrd indicate stronger temporal persistence even for locations where swc dynamics systematically and significantly deviated from the field averaged swc in other words temporal stability calculated using eq 4 may be interpreted as a consistency in deviation of swc in locations from the field averaged swc this is in agreement with the statistically significant correlation between sdrd and absolute difference sdwc sdmwc fig 12 table 4 and explains a reduced importance of soil texture on ts swc as compared with other factors the results of the regression tree were consistent with a general statistics for sdrd there was no particular textural group with temporally stable swc dynamics the smallest sdrd indicating the strongest ts swc were observed in locations with 4 different soil textures table 6 the results of this study are in general agreement with comparable studies performed on the factors influencing ts swc in that it appears there are several interactions at play between various factors brocca et al 2009b for instance examined the temporal stability of soil moisture in three experimental locations in the upper tiber valley of central italy the region is characterized by a mediterranean climate and receives mean annual precipitation of 900 mm which is comparable to the annual precipitation in mid michigan soils in brocca et al s experiment were typic or fluventic haplusepts with sandy loam as the dominant texture the authors found that ts swc in their experimental areas decreased as clay content decreased under conditions of limited topographical variability as topographic variability increased so did its importance in determining temporally stable locations with regards to soil moisture in other words in the presence of topographic variability the direct effect of soil properties such as texture diminishes as these two variables interact with one another in this context it is also important to note that distance between sampling points may exert an influence on these results at smaller scales sampling points 6 m apart random spatial processes may introduce spatial autocorrelation which could potentially obscure the effect of thp on swc tomer and anderson 1995 the above is in agreement with our finding that under topographically variable terrain there is no one soil texture which represents temporally stable swc dynamics zhu and lin 2011 obtained similar findings at a study site in central pennsylvania in the united states on silty clay and silt loam soils typic hapludalfs and hapludults in this study texture was also a significant predictor of variation in soil moisture but as topographic variability increased so did the relative importance of topography in contrast to soil texture grayson and western 1998 also suggested an interactive effect between thp and soil texture in identifying temporally stable locations within a study area these studies in addition to ours indicate there is a strong interactive effect between soil properties such as texture and topographic variability on ts swc 4 2 the effect of the season season did not play an important role in the mrd regression trees fig 13a c e this variable appeared only once at a depth of 20 cm for the flooded locations df 1 df 3 and separated growing 2014 and winter 2015 from all other seasons fig 13a this interesting result indicated that despite the interseasonal variation of weather conditions table 2 fig 2 the deviations of swc dynamics in the individual locations from the field averaged was nearly the same in all thp this observation was confirmed by the anova model which indicated no significant differences in mrd for the 5 monitoring seasons fig 10c unlike mrd season was present in sdrd regression trees at depths of 20 cm and 40 cm at both depths season was the second and fourth splitting variable in these trees fig 13b d the decreasing order of season in the regression tree indicated the decrease of variance in mrd with the depth associated with the buffering effect of the top soil layers on water fluxes and swc dynamics at depths of 40 and 60 cm the effect of season at a depth of 20 cm was manifested in stronger ts swc smaller sdrd in winter 2016 and or growing 2014 seasons as compared with the other monitoring seasons fig 13b the reason for that was more uniform distributions of precipitation during these two seasons fig 2 which resulted in relatively gradual changes and smaller oscillations in swc than in the other seasons fig 6 at a depth of 40 cm the effect of season was thp specific it appeared only in the su sl df branch of the tree fig 13d and separated season with relatively strong ts swc winter 2016 from those with weak ts swc winter 2015 growing 2016 the association of the season variables with the thp and depth may mean different sensitivity of soil in these locations to changes in the weather conditions soil hydraulic properties and or different water fluxes in these locations it was shown before section 4 1 that soil texture had only a minor effect on ts swc therefore it is reasonable to assume that water fluxes played a major role in the temporal stability indeed the probability of low precipitation and thus low overland and subsurface water fluxes was much higher in winter 2016 than in the four other seasons our results concur with biswas and si 2011 who observed stronger time stability between soil moisture measurements taken within the same season intra season than between measurements taken during different seasons inter season zhu and lin 2011 also observed an effect of both season and crop cover on soil water dynamics with notable contrast between fallow seasons and those with crop cover contrastingly however grayson and western 1998 identified similar temporally stable sites at their experimental location in southeastern australia which remained unchanged despite contrasting seasons this again is an indication of an interactive effect between several variables on ts swc the grayson and western experiment was not performed on agricultural land which removed any variation introduced for example by the growth and subsequent removal of crops 4 3 the effect of topography and hydrology the topo hydrological variable was present in all regression trees it was the first splitting variable in the sdrd regression trees for the three depths fig 13b d f the first variable for mrd at a depth of 60 cm fig 13e and the second variable for mrd at depths of 20 and 40 cm fig 13a c overall stronger ts swc smaller sdrd was observed in all depths of dd and depths of 20 cm of sl fig 13a c e as compared with the su and df this grouping seemed controversial because similarity of soil properties were observed within whereas differences were observed between the groups su sl and dd df respectively figs 4 and 5 moreover all three thp had rather different hydrological conditions specifically su did not receive any run on water in addition to precipitation sl lost part of its precipitation to runoff dd and df received run on water from the uphill area but perched water and accumulation of surface water was observed only at df therefore both sl dd and su df groups had dissimilar soil properties and hydrological conditions within the groups this apparent contradiction in grouping of the topographical variables by the regression tree could be explained by the specifics of the sdrd statistic discussed earlier in section 4 1 swc dynamics were to a lesser extent affected by changing weather in sl due to runoff losses and a moderate slope of the soil water retention Œ¥Œ∏ Œ¥ pf fig 5a c whereas in dd the increase in overland water fluxes run on and a steeper slope of soil water retention was compensated by much faster vertical water fluxes through the soil due to high unsaturated hydraulic conductivity it should also be mentioned that sdrd were higher for all seasons except growing 2014 for sl than that for dd 3 dd 5 at a depth of 20 cm fig 13b the similarity between sl and dd was observed only for dd 1 and dd 2 which was likely associated with nearly the same elevation of these locations fig 1 the locations below this elevation dd 3 dd 5 demonstrated ts patterns which differed from sl and dd 1 dd 2 locations indicating that the effect of topography is more complicated than just slope and elevation the similarity in ts swc at su and df locations observed at a depth of 20 cm had different origins in the absence of runoff and high water retention this layer at su eventually received and retained more water than sl locations df likely received nearly the same run on water as dd however retained it longer and in larger amounts due to lower water permeability of the deep soil layers which caused formation of perched water in df therefore oscillations of swc in su due to water retention were of the same order of magnitude as those at df but caused by perched water fig 6 in both thp these oscillations decreased ts swc higher sdrd fig 13b the results of the regression tree agreed with the results of anova analysis and indicated insignificant differences within and significant differences between sl dd and su df groups for sdrd fig 10b the regression tree for sdrd at a depth of 40 cm differed from that at a depth of 20 cm the sdrd were smaller at dd as compared with the other locations for all monitoring seasons the thp variable did not play a role in the higher branches of this regression tree indicating less importance of this variable as compared to soil properties season and crops for these branches the similarity in sdrd for these thp was confirmed by the anova results fig 10 b where the differences between these locations were not statistically significant at a depth of 60 cm significantly higher mrd were observed at df as compared with the other thp fig 8c however these thp were presented differently in the regression tree for sdrd in the sdrd tree dd was split in a separate group with the strongest ts and the other thp were split further to su sl and df with the weakest ts for the latter group fig 13f the fact that two depressions demonstrated the strongest and weakest ts swc indicated the importance of the subsurface water fluxes since both locations received runoff from uphill area unfortunately this factor is difficult to take into account due to scarce data of monitoring perched water dynamics even at a field scale similarly to our study zhu and lin 2011 also found that the effect of topography is more pronounced in deeper soil layers than at the soil surface where soil properties vegetation conditions and season interact with topography and increase in importance overall the effect of topography on soil water distribution patterns becomes more important as the topography becomes more pronounced while soil properties increase in importance in areas with less topographical variability brocca et al 2009b also found that lateral flow of soil water due to topography plays a significant role in the spatial redistribution of soil water and affects where temporally stable locations within a field exist gomez plaza et al 2000 observed that although topography had a significant effect on ts swc this effect is scale dependent with soil moisture patterns remaining stable at a small catchment scale while at smaller scales patterns either become unstable or an interactive effect with vegetation cover will present in addition to the effect of topography this is in agreement with our findings in that interactive effects between soil properties topography season and crop exist on ts swc gomez plaza s study however was conducted in the semi arid environment of southeast spain which may affect the applicability of their findings across climatic regions 4 4 the effect of crops crops appeared only in the fourth level of the mrd trees indicating their importance only for specific seasons and locations for example for all seasons mrd was the smallest at 20 cm depth for corn and rye at dd 3 and dd 4 and the largest for soybeans during growing 2014 and winter 2015 seasons fig 13 a however since soybeans were not grown during winter seasons one can assume that the crop variable substituted for the seasonal variable in this branch of the regression tree this conclusion is consistent with the anova results which did not indicate significant differences between the crops fig 10f for the sdrd statistics the crop variables in most instances were grouped as fallow rye and corn soybeans with generally smaller sdrd for the former group at all depths fig 13b d f such grouping indicates a substitution of the crop variable similar to that in the mrd regression tree a possible explanation for the absence of the crop effect on ts swc is that different transpiration from corn and soybean during growing seasons and from rye and fallow during winter seasons affected the relative values of swc mrd were positive for soybeans and rye and negative for corn and fallow fig 10e however transpiration did not affect oscillations of swc therefore the differences in sdrd for the four crops were not statistically significant fig 10f and thus were not identified by the regression trees the interaction of crops with seasons was also noted by zhu and lin 2011 and biswas and si 2011 the former found this effect to be present at the plot and hillslope scale while the latter noted that during seasons when vegetation was present summer and fall stronger temporal stability was observed between these seasons while patterns in spring were distinctly different in the present study this effect may indeed have been partially obscured by the fact that soybean and corn were only grown during summer seasons while rye and fallow conditions were specific to winter seasons resulting in difficulty separating the effects of crops and seasons the combined effect of vegetation and topography on ts swc also appears to be scale dependent gomez plaza et al 2000 with lower temporal stability observed across different thp at the small catchment scale when vegetation was present and the effect of vegetation disappearing in favor of thp at the point scale 4 5 persistence of temporal stability in locations presence of ts swc patterns for different monitoring seasons is further referred to as a persistence of temporal stability in locations locations with the strongest ts swc was not persistent during the 5 monitoring seasons this was likely a result of interaction between the four factors on ts swc among other thp the strongest ts swc smallest sdrd were observed more frequently in the two depressions at a depth of 20 cm and in dd at depths of 40 and 60 cm table 6 indicating higher probability of occurrence of ts swc in this thp there also was no single location with ts swc across all three monitoring depths that could be attributed to high spatial variability of soil properties in the studied area both in vertical and lateral directions fig 4 this observation concurs with our earlier results obtained at a topographically plain field during two year monitoring of soil moisture guber et al 2008 and with results obtained by tallon and si 2004 for a gently rolling field 5 10 slope the absence of persistence may partly be attributed to the crop rotation for the growing periods ts swc at depths of 20 and 40 cm was observed twice under corn and once under soybeans and for the winter seasons at depths of 40 and 60 cm interchangeably under rye and fallow conditions table 6 this observation does not imply that the field plots must be split by crops for swc monitoring and ts analysis this is clear from sdrd statistics shown in fig 10f for the 4 crops and from regression trees for sdrd fig 13b d f and it indicates the absence of significant differences associated with crops and its minor effect as a splitting variable in the sdrd regression trees however our results do imply that crop rotation should be considered in selecting a representative location for swc monitoring the effect of crop rotation on ts swc can be explained by different root activity on the same thp during 5 monitoring seasons root activity has been shown to affect swc dynamics resulting in increasing spatial variance of swc teuling and troch 2005 and weakening its ts in shallow soil layers cassel et al 2000 the crops i e corn rye soybeans and their absence used in this study presumably had rather different vertical distributions of root densities and root water uptake respectively therefore their rotation on the same plot depending on currently planted crops and their development stage could increase or decrease spatial variance of swc and strengthen or weaken ts swc at different depths moreover these depths for the same plants can be different for at least two reasons first vertical distribution of plant root density depends on vertical distribution of soil properties i e bulk density water retention and nutrient content in profiles which directly affects root growth and location in soil layers second for the same root density distributions in a soil profile root water uptake controlled to a large extent by soil hydraulic properties can be much smaller in coarse textured layers as compared to fine textured layers this occurs due to generally smaller water holding capacity of coarse soils which causes the appearance of plant water stress much earlier in these soils as compared to the coarse textured soils our findings are supported by results of spatial soil moisture variance analysis conducted in well drained silty loam under maize production teuling and troch 2005 these authors demonstrated that depending on hydrological conditions water uptake by vegetation may or may not create additional variance in swc dynamics the persistence of ts swc was partly affected by the weather conditions but this effect decreased with the depth for a depth of 20 cm su was a more temporally stable location table 5 during the season with highly variable precipitation fig 2 whereas dd and df thp were more persistent with minor variability in precipitation the 5 seasons were obviously too short to collect data for in depth statistical analysis of weather effect on persistence of ts swc in locations and thus this question was beyond objectives of this study yet our observations could be valuable for further researches in this direction 4 6 insights into the origin of ts swc analysis of the relationship between temporal stability and variability of swc conducted in the section 3 4 revealed that ts swc is not a reciprocal of temporal variability of swc the strongest ts swc occurred in those locations where the temporal variability of swc was close to the spatially averaged variability of temporal mean swc in locations sdmwc fig 11 all studied factors i e soil texture crops weather topo hydrology affected the variability of swc in individual locations to a certain extent furthermore spatial variability of soil properties at thp and crop rotations commonly present on farmlands creates a variety of scenarios which could be realized or not under specific weather conditions for example during extended droughts swc variability is likely to be associated with different soil properties i e soil water retention and vegetation type and development stage whereas during wet seasons the impact of overland and subsurface fluxes on variability of swc is likely to be much stronger grayson et al 1997 constantly changing scenarios causes changes in the spatial organization of swc demonstrated for example by western et al 1999 and sdmwc accordingly it can be seen in fig 11 that sdmwc were rather different for the five seasons this explains the absence of a single location with ts swc patterns within the whole monitoring time table 6 moreover there is no clear association of sdmwc with depth the order of sdmwc at the three monitoring depths changed almost randomly between the five seasons this explains the absence of a single soil profile where ts swc was the strongest at all depths table 6 for any of the five seasons these findings raise an important question of representativeness of locations with different variability of swc for assessment of ts and implementation of ts analysis in practice since swc itself controls its ts vanderlinden et al 2012 different representation of locations with high and low temporal variability of swc within a studied area may produce controversial conclusions about the effects of examined factors on the ts swc this is aligned with mart√≠nez et al 2014 who concluded that the large site to site differences in ts swc demonstrated in existing literature are the result of site specific combinations of soil climate season and sampling frequency 5 conclusions the results of this study clearly showed that surface topography and hydrology play an important role in ts swc patterns at the scale of an agricultural field at this scale ts swc was controlled by the interaction of all studied factors i e soil properties weather conditions vegetation and surface topography with a dominant influence of topography and hydrology over the other factors at the three studied depths among other locations the ts swc patterns were more frequently observed in depressions where swc was controlled by soil properties local control and surface and subsurface hydrological conditions non local control the ts swc patterns were less frequently observed in summits and slopes where the local control was dominated over the non local ts swc locations were not persistent during the monitoring period of time there was not a single location with ts swc in the whole soil profile even within a single monitoring season and locations with the highest ts swc at each depth changed over the 5 monitoring seasons this was caused by high spatial and temporal variability of local and non local controls of swc within the same and between different thps the latter may complicate designs of swc monitoring networks and agronomic experiments with replicated plots when plots located at the same thp are not true replicates due to different controls of swc ts swc expressed as sdrd weakened with the deviation of the temporal variability of swc in individual locations from the spatially averaged variability of temporal mean swc in locations sdmwc in this study therefore presence of ts swc in locations is clearly associated with the temporal variability of swc at this point presence or absence of ts swc ultimately depends on representation of locations with different temporal variability of swc in the examined dataset our results are relevant to the field scale and specific soil properties weather conditions and crop management practices used in this study we did not intend to extend our results to large scales or different soils weather and topographical conditions the goal of this study was to provide better

5951,knowing the location where groundwater denitrification occurs or by proxy the groundwater redox status oxic mixed and anoxic is valuable information for assessing and managing potential agricultural land use impacts on freshwater quality we compare the efficacy of supervised linear discriminant analysis lda boosted regression trees brt and random forest rf and unsupervised modified self organizing map msom learning based methods to predict groundwater redox status in the agriculturally dominated tasman waikato and wellington regions of new zealand thresholds applied to regional groundwater quality samples provide redox status variables and learn heuristics constrained by these variables and applied to spatial factors climate elevation geologic hydrology soils and well depth identify optimal sets of regional predictor variables a split sample approach is used to train and test the learning methods ability to predict redox status using the optimal predictor variables overall the supervised methods demonstrate a prediction bias toward oxic conditions and inability to perform statistically well when using independent regional data for example consider kappa statistics for brt tasman 0 42 waikato 0 38 wellington 0 17 rf tasman 0 42 waikato 0 47 wellington 0 17 and lda tasman 0 46 waikato 0 32 wellington 0 17 by contrast the unsupervised method performs statistically well when predicting oxic mixed and anoxic conditions and corresponding depths when using independent regional data for example consider msom kappa statistics for tasman 0 78 waikato 0 80 wellington 0 76 the unsupervised learning method provides the added benefits of being 1 able to combine predictions into 3d regional anoxic probability plots for interpreting the spatial influence of paleosols and groundwater flowpaths on redox status and 2 readily extended to map 3d redox status across new zealand and other countries despite data bias and sparsity keywords boosted regression trees linear discriminant analysis modified self organizing map random forest redox status new zealand 1 introduction the sustainability of new zealand s freshwater resource is facing increasing pressure from agricultural nitrate leaching ministry for the environment 2007 irrigation demand and current and future climate change effects robertson et al 2016 the integrity of groundwater quality is of increasing concern because about 40 of the population depends on groundwater for drinking water supply ministry for the environment 2007 and nutrient rich baseflow contributions are impacting the health of lowland streams ministry for the environment 2007 to address the deterioration of freshwater quality regulators are required to establish nitrate leaching and water quality limits by 2025 ministry for the environment 2007 to sustain agricultural production these limits need to account for attenuation that occurs along groundwater flow paths knowing the location where groundwater denitrification occurs or by proxy the groundwater redox status thus forms an important link between agricultural leaching sources and water quality objectives the best tools currently available for mapping the redox status for groundwater denitrification are predictive models koch et al 2019 as the complexity of real world groundwater systems increase from catchment to regional or national scales it becomes difficult and often impractical to make spatial predictions based on process based models learning based modeling is an alternative approach to predict the distribution of groundwater redox status based solely on the analysis of available measurements this approach is possible because learning based models build relationships between state variables input internal and output variables using a limited number of assumptions about the physical behaviour of the system solomatine et al 2009 that said the development of a learning based model is often challenging because failure can occur at any one of several model building steps choice of response variables choice of predictor variables choice of model architecture choice of model structure and complexity choice of model parameters model training testing and validation prediction and uncertainty quantification ultimately the model performance using this approach is limited by the quality of available data learning based groundwater quality models are grouped based on the type of problem being solved such as regression or classification solomatine et al 2009 regression problems typically involve predicting a single response variable such as nitrate concentration based on learning a function that maps inputs to outputs classification is a special form of learning based modeling in which the problem involves identifying the sub population to which a new observation belongs such as redox status oxic mixed or anoxic early groundwater studies mainly used linear models such as logistic regression to generate probabilistic maps of diffuse nitrate contamination nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 and depths to the oxic suboxic interface tesoriero et al 2015 spatial predictions of groundwater redox status using linear discriminant analysis lda have previously been made by lee et al 2008 close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 these methods tacitly assume that redox status can be modelled as a linear combination of characteristics whose class samples are continuous not missing and normally distributed martinez and kak 2001 these considerations pose limitations when attempting to build models for predicting 3d regional redox conditions with data that are biased type frequency and spatial sampling disparate different physics and sparse missing samples although linear learning based modeling is used to study various aspects of groundwater systems the linkages and interactions among climate hydrological and biogeochemical cycles across spatiotemporal scales more appropriately favour nonlinear learning based modeling nonlinear learning based modeling includes supervised unsupervised and hybrid machine learning ml algorithms green et al 2016 the methods associated with these algorithms are known to fit nonlinear relationships while accommodating missing data and interactions among the different predictor variables supervised ml algorithms analyze training data and produce an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples unsupervised ml algorithms build models by deducing structures present in the input data this process may be used to extract general rules reduce redundancy or organize data by similarity recent applications of supervised ml algorithms involve testing efficacy of the random forest regression method koch et al 2019 to model depth of the redox interface across denmark and the artificial neural network ann bayesian network bn and boosted regression trees brt methods to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater of the central valley california nolan et al 2015 in former and later studies the cross validation results gave respective r2 for independent validation tests of 0 48 and 0 25 the cross validation results for these methods suggest that the models did not generalize well to independent data possibly due to overfitting given the relatively large number of predictor variables also noteworthy in the earlier study is that generalizing the models to holdout independent data resulted in a bias with the model overpredicting low concentrations and underpredicting high concentrations this phenomenon reveals one of the potential challenges when using learning based models in the presence of sample frequency bias another potential reason for poor predictive performance of learning based models is attributed to the high degree of model correlation among pairs of predictor variables guyon and elisseeff 2003 in the case of perfectly correlated predictor variables the increases in one variable offset corresponding decreases in the second variable with no effect on the training response but with increases in associated prediction uncertainty low et al 2013 these findings underscore the need for identifying an optimal set of predictor variables through some quantitative feature selection process singh et al 2014 feature selection algorithms fall into two categories the filter model or the wrapper model das 2001 kohavi and john 1997 the filter model relies on general characteristics of the training data to select some features without involving any learning algorithm for example povak et al 2014 selectively removed one variable of each paired linear predictor variables characterized by strong pearson coefficients œÅ 0 77 by reducing the number of collinear predictor variables from 50 to 33 the cross validation statistics for both brt and random forest rf models increased r2 0 85 suggesting the subsequent model generalized well to independent data other investigators applied a form of backward stepwise regression to brt and rf models that begins with a full model and at each step eliminates variables to find a reduced model that best explains the data ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 the removal of unimportant variables is necessary for building robust models that generalize to independent data but this stepwise process is not likely to be reliable when considering relative importance reported by the brt and rf methods the reason is that the relative importance is reported as normalized values for models characterized by strong correlations among predictor variables these variables will split importance thereby reducing their apparent influence in the prediction process and giving the false impression of their true ranked importance the wrapper model requires one predetermined learning algorithm in feature selection and uses its performance to evaluate and determine which features are selected yu and liu 2003 calvet et al 2017 the benefits of nonlinear feature selection in groundwater quality modeling using learn heuristics metaheuristics in machine learning was demonstrated by friedel and buscema 2016 and using evaluated filters embedded and wrapper methods was demonstrated by rodriguez galiano et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that the overfitting of predictor variables can be reduced when identifying an optimal number of predictor variables in accordance with the principle of occam s razor unnecessarily complex models should not be preferred to simpler ones encyclopaedia britannica 2010 the aim of this study is to predict groundwater redox status across selected agricultural regions of new zealand we hypothesize that the redox status classified from groundwater chemistry sampled across regional monitoring networks can be combined with well depths and nationally available climate geology hydrology soils and topography coverages to provide mutual information measure of entropy describing mutual dependence among random variables suitable for learning based model building and redox class prediction to test this hypothesis we evaluate supervised lda brt and rf and unsupervised modified self organizing map msom learning based methods the objectives are to compare the performance of these methods for predicting the probability of groundwater redox status oxic mixed anoxic and associated depths in groundwater systems of the tasman waikato and wellington regions this study extends the work of close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 who because of the single dependent model response variable restriction when using lda developed separate models for classifying redox status over shallow and deep zones in addition to evaluating supervised learning based methods we develop an innovative unsupervised learning based workflow to simultaneously predict four response functions oxic mixed anoxic and depth in this approach the relative benefit of mutual information content in the predictor variables can be evaluated by comparing the probability of predicted redox conditions in information theory this concept reflects the mutual pairwise dependence among random variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of water quality data the tasman waikato and wellington regions of new zealand were selected to test and compare learning based methods for predicting groundwater redox status fig 1 groundwater resources are considered nationally significant with many water quality monitoring well data that are collected by the regional councils tasman district is in the northern part of the south island and covers an area of 9650 km2 the main groundwater resources in the district lie within the alluvial terraces and coastal plains associated with the waimea motueka riwaka takaka and aorere rivers waikato region is in the central north island and covers an area of 25 000 km2 this region contains much of the taupo volcanic zone with geology dominated by volcanic rocks and sediments that have been reworked by fluvial processes the highest elevations are in the south around the central volcanic plateau and water flows northward initially through sub catchment groundwater systems and then via the waikato river and its tributaries the wellington region is located at the lower end of the north island and covers an area of 8130 km2 there are significant groundwater resources in the hutt and wairarapa valleys associated with river floodplains and coastal plains along the kapiti coast morgan and hughes 2001 tidswell et al 2012 the aquifers of the lower hutt valley comprise thick accumulations of gravel deposited by the hutt river the primary valley aquifer associated with the waiwhetu gravels is separated into an upper and lower aquifer recharged by the hutt river there is a complex system of aquifers in the wairarapa valley that may be classified into three broad categories alluvial fan deposits reworked river gravels and stratified lower valley deposits the kapiti coast groundwater system has three broad types of aquifers associated with different deposits recent river gravels glacial and interglacial deposits and post glacial beach and dune sand deposits tidswell et al 2012 more information on these aquifers is provided by morgan and hughes 2001 2 2 response variables the response variable model output used in building and comparing predictive models is groundwater redox class groundwater sample data are obtained from each of the three regional councils for redox assignment there are 568 wells in the waikato with data suitable no3 do and mn see next section for development of lda redox zone models by close et al 2016 for the tasman and wellington regions iron fe and sulphate so4 are used to assist with redox assignments at sites with missing no3 do and mn data there are 757 wells with data suitable for redox assignment in the tasman region and 656 wells in the wellington region the redox class is determined based on aqueous chemistry sampled in regional wells and assumes that a series of microbially mediated redox reactions naturally occurs in groundwater systems mcmahon and chapelle 2008 these reactions successively use o2 no3 mn iv fe iii so4 and co2 as electron acceptors reflecting a decrease in energy available to the microbes from each successive electron acceptor given the national focus on reducing freshwater no3 concentrations this study considered the first three parameters o2 no3 and mn to assign the redox status of each groundwater sample for reducing conditions to exist the relative concentrations of o2 and no3 will be low and mn will be high in cases where the fe and so4 data are used to supplement the other data the so4 could be high but if mn and dissolved oxygen do indicated reduced conditions the groundwater status is assigned as being reduced with respect to no3 because the so4 reaction is further along the redox gradient mcmahon and chapelle 2008 developed a system for the assignment of redox status based on analysis of aqueous chemistry measured as part of groundwater field studies in their system thresholds are derived for each parameter based on concentrations typically found for redox environments observed in various studies with thresholds designed to be broadly applicable over a range of different hydrologic conditions at the regional scale the thresholds used in this study are 1 0 mg l for o2 0 5 mg l for no3 n 0 05 mg l for mn 0 1 mg l for fe and 0 5 mg l for so4 mean concentrations for these redox sensitive parameters are calculated for each site and then classified as having oxidized mixed or reduced groundwater the mixed class is assigned when the no3 mn and o2 parameters provided an ambiguous indication of redox status in situations where the no3 n levels are low 0 5 mg l and do mn and fe values indicated oxic conditions then the well is assigned as being oxic this water is considered likely to be oxic but old groundwater associated with low land use intensity that would have low nitrate concentrations in other cases well samples with ambiguous redox indicators are assigned to the mixed class some potential reasons for ambiguity include 1 the groundwater environment is not in redox equilibrium 2 the well screen draws water from two redox environments and 3 the aqueous concentrations are close to threshold values the reader is referred to close et al 2016 for a more comprehensive discussion on redox ambiguity in building a predictive learning based redox model the supervised methods such as lda brt and rf only can accommodate a single response variable comprising the three classes e g oxic mixed anoxic the unsupervised msom has the advantage that a model can be developed to predict one or more response functions in the latter case separate binary response functions are created to reflect each condition in this case each response condition is denoted as present or absent the advantage in using this approach is that the relative quality in underlying measurement information content becomes obvious with the probable prediction across redox classes that sum to one for example those wells with unambiguous information content for classification will be estimated as 1 others 0 the more ambiguous the information and initial redox classification the further from 1 will be the predictions with residual fractions appearing in one or two additional classes given the flexible variable assignment the msom is further used to predict the depth associated with each redox status prediction this depth prediction is based on the well depth of each groundwater sample in the response variable training data set redox state often varies with depth and previous lda models developed for the canterbury and waikato regions by close et al 2016 and the southland region by wilson et al 2018 involved developing separate models for shallow medium and deep zones in each region the depth thresholds used in developing models were subjectively assigned to qualitatively account for different hydrogeological environments one challenge with this approach is the imposed depth sample frequency and redox status biases as a generalization shallow models have more samples that tend to be oxic whereas the deepest models have fewest number of samples that tend to be anoxic in the present study a single model is developed for each region using a random split sample that is drawn from all well data 2 3 predictor variables the choice of predictor variables independent model input used in building and comparing learning based models is based initially on domain knowledge of field parameters likely to influence the regional redox status at the scale of interest this approach requires using the geographical information system gis to create spatial attributes layers with complete or nearly complete coverage across each region an initial dataset of 22 spatial attributes are developed from climate geology hydrology land use soil and topography databases a summary of these variables and their sources is provided in table 1 subsurface flow data are generally unavailable for our study regions so we use annual specific discharge characteristics of the stream or river associated with the lowest strahler order in the sub catchment order 2 in which the well is positioned specific discharge data include mean flow mean low flow mean flow in february and the number of events exceeding three times the long term median flow booker 2013 2015 elevation slope geological age climate and hydrological parameters are continuous variables the distribution of values associated with these datasets tends to be asymmetrically skewed and therefore are log transformed to approximate a gaussian distribution the log transformed values are then assigned into ranges bins analogous to a histogram for compatibility with the vector based gis model development binning thresholds are identified using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1963 which provides better resolution of the flatter slopes lower elevations and younger geological ages for those parameters ten groups or bins are created for each of the parameters and thresholds given in table 1 the bin numbers provided variable values for the predictive models other categorical variables require numerical reassignment following the approach of close et al 2016 the assignments for geological rock type and soil order are carried out by giving a low score to categories that tend to be inert or retain oxidising conditions and giving a higher score to categories that are more reactive with respect to oxygen and nitrate and thus likely to promote reducing conditions the scale for these variables ranged between 1 and 5 for example geological units such as gravels are given a score of 1 whereas peats are given a score of 5 the land use classification variable provides an approximate measure of potential nitrate inputs with high nitrate inputs associated with cropland and high productivity grassland given scores of 1 and 2 respectively low nitrate inputs associated with forest and wetlands are given scores of 4 and 5 respectively the values of predictor variables at each well location are obtained by conducting a spatial query using the gis the gis layers for each of the predictor variables across a region are prepared the raster topography parameters are converted to vectors and intersected with the other parameter layers mountainous terrain i e land with a land use capability class of 8 or class 7 land with a slope 19 degrees is excluded from the models and maps a composite layer containing all model variables is collated and the results of predictive models implemented in the gis framework to extrapolate results throughout each region 2 4 model architecture structure complexity the selection of supervised and unsupervised learning based algorithms usually is purpose based in many cases more than one method associated with an algorithm may be suitable for developing a predictive model of some response thereby providing a means for comparing results by contrast individual methods associated to an algorithm differ fundamentally in their architecture structure and complexity this study evaluates the efficacy of using supervised lda brt and rf and unsupervised msom methods to predict redox status these methods are briefly described next 2 4 1 supervised learning based predictions the architecture of lda involves data that are divided into two classes using the one versus all paradigm one class represents the selected data whereas the other class represents all the other data these two classes are divided using a hyperplane linear which is a discriminant of the two classes the process is iterated over all the data to find the class with the maximum distance minimum prediction error bias variance from the hyperplane the extension of this method to multiple discriminant analysis follows five steps rao 1948 compute the d dimensional mean vectors for the different classes from the dataset compute the scatter matrices in between class and within class scatter matrix compute the eigenvectors e 1 e 2 e d and corresponding eigenvalues Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª d for the scatter matrices sort the eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues and choose k eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues to form a d k dimensional matrix w where every column represents an eigenvector use this d k eigenvector matrix to transform the samples onto the new subspace this can be summarized by the matrix multiplication y x w where x is a n d dimensional matrix representing the n samples and y are the transformed n k dimensional samples in the new subspace in contrast to lda ensemble methods dietterich 2000 such as brt and rf learn relationships among response and predictor variables without relying on statistical assumptions about the data elith et al 2008 the architecture of these methods is based on the surface built by a regression tree the tree is piece wise constant surface where there is a region rm in input space for each terminal node that is the hyper rectangles induced by tree cuts the constant associated with each region which represents the estimated prediction y c m that the tree is making at each terminal node formally the m terminal node tree model is expressed by 1 y t x m 1 m c m i r m x where i r m 1 if r m and 0 otherwise the difference among these two ensemble methods is related to how they minimize the predictive error bias plus variance the brt method minimizes the predictive error using the boosting procedure de ath 2007 to combine a set of weak learners high bias low variance whereas rf uses the bagging procedure breiman 2001 to combine decision trees low bias high variance in terms of decision trees the weak learners used in brt are shallow trees sometimes even as small as decision stumps trees with two leaves boosting reduces error mainly by reducing bias by aggregating the output from many models as an additive model defined as hastie et al 2009 2 f x m 1 m Œ≤ m b x Œª m where Œ≤ m m 1 2 m are the expansion coefficients corresponding to the m trees x is the set of predictor variables Œª m parameterizes splitting variables at internal nodes and predictions at terminal noes and b x Œª m is a basis function that represents a single tree we use stagewise gradient boosting to estimate Œ≤ m and Œª m sequentially from m 1 to m with each new tree fitted to the residuals of the previous tree after an initial tree is trained subsequent trees are fitted to the residuals of the previous tree rather than to the data directly we apply stochastic gradient boosting and steepest descent minimization to estimate Œ≤ m to minimize the loss given by 3 l y f x y f x 2 where y is the observed value of the response variable which is a redox parameter the rf method breiman 2001 uses bagging plus a perturbation procedure subset splitting to fit the base learners the essential idea is to average many noisy but approximately unbiased tree models and hence reduce the variance this variance reduction is achieved in the tree growing process through random selection of the input variables the collection of different classifiers overfit the data in different ways and through voting e g using the mean median mode or other statistical criteria those differences are smoothed out breiman 2001 the extension of bagging to rf follows two steps hastie et al 2009 1 for b 1 to b a draw a bootstrap sample z of size n from the training data b grow a random forest tree tb to the bootstrapped data by recursively repeating the following steps for each terminal node of the tree until the minimum node size nmin is reached i select m variables at random from the p variables ii pick the best variable split point among the m iii split the node into two daughter nodes 2 output the ensemble of trees t b 1 b to make a prediction at a new point x 4 regression f rf b x 1 b b 1 b t b x classification let c b x be the class prediction of the bth random forest tree then 5 c b rf b x m a j o r i t y v o t e c b x 1 b 2 4 2 unsupervised learning based predictions the msom procedure involves the sequential application of competitive learning self organizing map and estimation minimization of objective function by competitive learning the architecture of msom involves an input layer signals from the environment and an output layer competitive feedback to the environment the input layer comprises a set of nodes neurons that are connected one to another through a rectangular topology the connections between inputs data vectors and nodes have weights so a set of weights corresponds to each node in implementing the msom procedure kohonen 2001 competitive learning iteratively modifies weights during the training phase so that the self organized output pattern becomes consistent meaning that the input pattern will produce the same self organized output pattern in doing so the som iteratively maps each data sample as a vector each variable is characterized as a cloud of data vectors across a hypersurface on which data vectors closer to each other are more related self similar than data vectors farther away the learning algorithm may be summarized as follows kohonen 2001 1 generate initial values including weights radius learning parameter values 2 select input vector from data set 3 identify winning node which is the closest node to the input vector using the euclidean distance d metric 6 d i 0 n v i w i 2 where v is the input vector and w is the weight vector 4 identify the neighborhood with the given radius using a gaussian function 7 œÉ œÉ 0 e x p 1 Œª t 1 2 3 where œÉ0 is the radius at t0 Œª is a time constant and t is iteration 5 update the weights for the winning node and all the nodes in the same neighborhood w t 1 w t l t v t w t 8 9 l t l 0 e x p 1 Œª t 1 2 3 where w t 1 is weight for t 1 l t is the learning rate at time t v is the input vector when updating the weight values the exponential decay function is also used to decrease the learning rate learning rate value is decreased over time the closer a node is to the winning node the more its weights get altered according to the same gaussian function specifically the learning rate is scaled by 10 Œ∏ t e x p dist 2 2 œÉ 2 t t 1 2 3 where the weights are adjusted using Œ∏ t 6 repeat steps 2 6 until the weight vectors reach a converged state the equations and issues regarding data gathering normalization and training are documented in kohonen 2001 7 the estimation of missing values sometimes referred to as imputation is done simultaneously for all variables across the hypersurface kalteh et al 2008 2 5 feature selection and learn heuristics according to rallo et al 2002 one of the elements necessary for accurate learning based prediction is model diversity model diversity reflects the incorporation of training information response and predictor variables characterizing mutually informative relations across different spatial and temporal sampling gradients feature selection is used to maximize information content while reducing dimensionality to avoid model overfitting the condition where a model begins to describe random error in data rather than relationships among variables feature selection can minimize this problem by identifying an optimal subset of predictor variables that minimize model nonuniqueness and associated uncertainty nonuniqueness is common to all learning based and process based models due to their inexact solutions that require some form of training fitting or calibration in this context the notion of an optimal set of predictor variables reflects the fact that there are many alternate combinations of variables that will satisfy the redox constraints in this study feature selection is undertaken using the nonlinear wrapper approach based on learn heuristics the wrapper model requires one predetermined learning algorithm in feature selection and uses its performance to evaluate and determine which features are selected yu and liu 2003 in this regard the learn heuristics buscema 2004 buscema et al 2013 reflect the ml algorithm that is introduced into the metaheuristics mlm algorithm the ml algorithm is generalized for which multiple learning algorithms are evaluated for example backpropagation knn and na√Øve bayes inside of a genetic algorithm ga metaheuristic given that the ga converges to a global minimum surface not a single vector the process is randomly re initiated and run until the subset of optimal features can be identified based on their mode values 2 6 training testing validation uncertainty training and testing of the learning based algorithms are carried out using a stratified split sample validation approach in this approach the minimum number of records regional response and predictor variables among the different redox classes is identified the remaining records for each of the other two classes are randomized and total number reduced to the identified minimum number of records from this balanced set same number of records in each redox class of groundwater redox data the records are randomized and split 75 training and 25 testing both split sets include randomly selected records associated with response oxic mixed anoxic depth and optimal set of regional predictor variables optimal set based on feature selection the testing records are assigned as holdout data to which the model is validated for generalizability to independent field data the metrics used to evaluate model performance cohen 1960 are accuracy predictive success and cohen s kappa comparison between the observed accuracy and the agreement expected due to chance cohen 1960 suggested the kappa result be interpreted as follows values 0 as indicating no agreement and 0 01 0 20 as none to slight 0 21 0 40 as fair 0 41 0 60 as moderate 0 61 0 80 as substantial and 0 81 1 00 as almost perfect agreement the kappa statistics are performed on binary threshold values for estimated redox status oxic mixed and anoxic and correlation of known and estimated depths and cross validation on and correlation among observed and estimated redox status oxic mixed and anoxic to quantify the prediction uncertainty a leave one out cross validation strategy is used efron 1993 in this strategy there is one test value and training data set that consists of all but that one test value training and testing are carried out n times in a round robin manner where n is the number of values associated with the variable and each representing a new model this strategy guarantees a minimum bias of the estimated prediction error hastie et al 2009 and enables nonlinear statistics and range of uncertainty to be computed for the trained models 3 results and discussion 3 1 response variables regional groundwater sampling data are inherently biased for both the response variable redox status and associated predictor variables spatial attributes for example most samples in the groundwater dataset are oxic table 2 this bias in redox status is attributed to the increased frequency of sampling in areas where greater water demand is concomitant with oxic conditions and or the increased frequency of shallow sampling across the new zealand landscape dominated by oxic groundwater fig 2 the distribution of samples within the spatial attributes is biased by the prevalence of groundwater usage in areas of productive land which tends to be gently sloping with freely draining soil a summary of sampled redox classes by depth and all regions is presented in fig 3 the two types of study bias that could adversely influence learning based model performance and their subsequent interpretation are variable importance and sample selection strobl et al 2007 the variable importance bias is associated with differences in the scale or number of predictor variables this bias can lead to suboptimal attributes being favoured by the model simply because they have a larger number of records variable importance bias is identified herein by simulating a null case test whereby the response variables are permuted to break the association with their predictor variables if there is no bias in these variables the result would be equally uninformative in the null case whereas biased variables can be identified by the presence of a falsely elevated importance or a model predictive accuracy which reflects the proportion of the dominant sample 3 2 predictor variables of the original predictor variables n 22 the learn heuristic based feature selection process identified an optimal global set of variables n 14 suitable for predicting redox status across the tasman waikato and wellington regions table 3 these variables are used in the initial building of the supervised and unsupervised learning based models important predictors that appear common to all three regions include eight variables gwdepth mainrock geolage soilorder pet rainfall flowmalf and elevation the optimal 14 variable predictor set is further refined for each region and used in building unsupervised learning based models the number of important predictor variables differs among regions table 3 the application of principal component analysis pca to median component plane values reveal relations among the first two component axes fig 4 first the distinct separation of redox status components colored vectors suggests that there is enough mutual information in the associated variables to build predictive models second there are different groups of predictor variables more associated to each redox state closer variables indicate stronger relative relation these associations to oxic condition redox 1 are in blue circle mixed condition redox 3 is in green and anoxic condition redox 5 is in red in these circles those predictor variables closest to the redox condition may be interpreted as more related with reason to consider their possible redox causation effect these positively correlated clustered variables suggests the likelihood for enhanced nonuniqueness and prediction uncertainty based on feature selection of predictor variables using records from all three regional data sets this finding further suggests that there may be a potential future benefit using learn heuristics to select optimal features sets from individual regional data sets in the tasman region oxic conditions appear to be most closely associated with pet mixed conditions are most closely related to nleach and anoxic conditions are most closely related to mainrock and welldepth in the wellington region oxic conditions are prevalent with increasing elevation mixed conditions with rainfall and anoxic conditions with soil order in the waikato region oxic conditions are most closely associated with geolage mixed conditions are most closely related to mainrock and anoxic conditions are most closely related to pet in addition to correlation versus causation considerations these interpretations are somewhat more complicated given that variables with more samples will appear farther from the origin in the pca plot statistically significant predictor variables with positive correlations are for redox 1 gwdepth geolage and rainfall redox 3 mainrock flowmalf and elevation redox 5 welldepth soilorder and pet 3 3 supervised learning based modeling 3 3 1 model training and testing the training and testing phase statistics for the supervised learning based methods are presented in table 4 in general the regional training cross validation statistics suggest that the two ensemble methods brt and rf outperformed the statistical method lda for all three regional catchments however brt was found to be so sensitive to the number of estimators used that it was not possible to establish confidence in making predictions with this method the training cross validation performance best to worst metrics given by kappa statistics are brt tasman 0 92 waikato 0 80 wellington 0 91 rf tasman 0 71 waikato 0 72 wellington 0 80 and lda tasman 0 56 waikato 0 40 wellington 0 40 a null case test performed on the permutated data retains high model accuracies revealing the high impact of sample selection bias on the models the accuracies reflect the proportion of oxic samples in each region accordingly the performance metrics for all these methods are significantly reduced following the testing phase specifically all methods performed similarly with kappa results for brt tasman 0 42 waikato 0 38 wellington 0 17 rf tasman 0 42 waikato 0 47 wellington 0 17 and lda tasman 0 46 waikato 0 32 wellington 0 17 revealing that they did not generalize well to the independent data whereas the holdout cross validation statistics for the tasman and waikato regions resemble results published by ransom et al 2017 none of the supervised methods produced statistics indicating their suitability for predicting redox status across the wellington region the performance of these models for the null case test revels their inability to overcome sample selection bias resulting in poor predictability given the poor performance of the supervised learning based models as regional redox predictors using independent data the spatial mapping is skipped and efficacy of the unsupervised learning based method in regional predictions evaluated next 3 4 unsupervised learning based modeling 3 4 1 model training and testing prior to training the response and predictor variables input data are normalized by their data variance and randomly assigned presenting the input vectors to the map sequentially using a randomly sorted database as an initial set of map weight vectors application of the msom network to training data is done using a single fixed number of neurons also called nodes and topological relations the selected grid shape is a toroid that wraps from top to bottom and side to side with hexagonal neurons whose initial number of map units total neurons m is determined using the heuristic formula vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 m 5 sqrt n where n is the total number of data samples this formula based the ratio between the two eigenvectors with greatest eigenvalues computed from the training data is used to establish the initial side lengths of the respective self organized map grids of 14 8 14 10 and 12 8 for tasman waikato and wellington respectively table 5 training of the map is conducted in sequential phases first rough and second fine a summary of the number of rough and fine training iterations and gaussian neighborhood radii along with learning rates are presented in table 6 the initial and final learning rates of 0 5 and 0 05 decay linearly down to 10 5 and the gaussian neighborhood function decreases exponentially decay rate of 10 3 iteration 1 providing reasonable convergence for this study the testing phase statistics accuracy and kappa values reveal the model inability to adequately replicate training data when assigning network size based on the heuristic network formula for this reason the network dimensions are increased and testing repeated until there is satisfactory statistical correspondence between observed and predicted training variables the correspondence between observations and predicted training variables is further revealed by decreased quantization and topological errors reflecting improvements through data separation on the hypersurface this finding has previously not been discussed in the literature the ability to improve predictions with increasing network size is attributed to increased separation and resolution of data vectors projected onto the self organized hypersurface the results of this testing process are presented along with a random set of records to ensure minimum prediction bias in table 7 inspection of this table reveals the respective optimum network sizes for tasman waikato and wellington are 46 24 50 36 and 54 32 summary statistics are presented for unsupervised training self organized map approach applied to regional redox and predictor variables with different network sizes table 7 the largest regional network reflects the size where kappa values stabilized 3 4 2 model validation ability of the trained regional models to simultaneously predict redox status and depth from independent data are evaluated by application of cross validation to the regional holdout data sets this process is repeated using 30 monte carlo mc trials to account for nonuniqueness in the combination of initial predictor values during the msom estimation process with the respective number of rough and fine training phase iterations of about 260 and 5200 for the tasman region each replacement prediction takes about 4 mins and about 150 mins per monte carlo trial computing the statistics for 30 mc trials therefore requires more than a 4440 min period 74 hrs this time period is the minimum ideal time because each mc trial requires manual intervention to restart the prediction process thereby extending the actual time period given these computational time challenges for tasman other regions are similar the statistical evaluation of cross validated predictions for the models is restricted to a single reduced network size 20 10 to avoid introducing a redox prediction bias through imposed thresholds for kappa statistics the univariate statistics are computed on stochastic predictions using the independent holdout samples for each region the comparison of groundwater redox and well depth statistics based on predictions using the suboptimal learning networks are summarized and presented along with observations statistics in tables 8 and 9 despite the suboptimal network size the observed versus predicted redox status and depth statistics provide reasonable correspondence particularly for the average median and standard deviation inspection of the minimum and maximum prediction values however reveal a tendency for the msom to overpredict minimum values and underpredict maximum values this bias tendency is common to supervised and unsupervised learning based methods having previously been noted by friedel et al 2017 the divergence of average and median prediction values is attributed in part to an underlying nonlinear process and an insufficient number of mc trials even so the statistics for the unsupervised learning based models reflect prediction quality that exceeds that of the supervised learning based models in decreasing order of model quality the r squared redox results are tasman oxic 0 91 mixed 0 84 anoxic 0 92 waikato oxic 0 75 mixed 0 79 anoxic 0 84 and wellington oxic 0 75 mixed 0 84 anoxic 0 90 the quality of depth predictions is less robust than redox status this finding may be attributed to the greater range over which predictions are made and fewer number of extreme data values as compared to the redox status it is noteworthy that median values of predicted and observed well depth table 9 are of the same order but the predicted median values appear greater than the observed median values these results highlight the fact that a single regional model prediction realization will not likely reflect the true regional redox status and corresponding depth thereby favoring median predictions from a stochastic set as more representative regional predictions using independent data sets these validation results demonstrate the net benefit of using the unsupervised models to predict regional redox status and depth from independent data sets despite their suboptimal networks this finding underscores the usefulness of limited and balanced sampling campaign 200 n 100 sites to train and predict across representative regional catchment areas 8130 km2 catchment area 25 000 km2 in new zealand cross validation statistics are computed using the median values 30 realizations predicted at independent locations after applying a binary threshold where median predictions 0 5 1 and 0 5 0 0 for this case the regional kappa statistics best to worst are waikato 0 80 tasman 0 78 and wellington 0 76 table 10 in contrast to previous studies using supervised learning methods ransom et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 and those undertaken herein table 7 these results suggest that the unsupervised msom models generalize well with substantial to almost perfect agreement to independent redox data 3 4 3 model prediction of groundwater redox and depths the simultaneous prediction of redox status and their associated depths is undertaken by applying the trained optimal network models to the corresponding set of independent predictor variables at varying number of regional locations this study extends the work of close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 who because of the single dependent model response variable restriction when using lda developed separate models for classifying redox status over shallow and deep zones the number of independent locations used for mapping variables across the tasman waikato and wellington regions are 134105 130714 and 183720 respectively these numbers represent the practical limit ad hoc determination of unique combinations of intersecting predictor variable values that arcmap is capable to process the various related products presented include threshold redox assignment 0 5 redox and depth maps figs 5 7 anoxic probability maps of redox status 0 pr 1 and depths fig 8 and 3d distributions of anoxic probability 0 pr 1 including top down bottom up and side to side views figs 9 11 the application of threshold assignments to model predictions provide information to produce redox and depth maps for tasman fig 5 waikato fig 6 and wellington fig 7 regions the threshold redox and depth maps represent a step change from the traditional classification of redox associated with a prescribed depth range this innovation treats the redox status as a regression problem with the simultaneous prediction of fractional redox status oxic mixed anoxic fractions 1 and corresponding depth to compare these results to the traditional lda classification approach requires assigning predictions according to a binary threshold criterion status 0 5 in doing so each regional map displays oxic mixed and anoxic redox status along with a supporting map of corresponding depths both map types represent an interpolation of 3d information to 2d plane in which hot colours indicate anoxic status and greatest depths and cool colours indicate oxic status and shallow depths the observations of redox at well locations are superimposed on localized redox inset maps for comparing the visual prediction quality all regions display a continuum of oxic to anoxic conditions with respective depths that range from 0 to 240 m 3 to 318 m 0 to 177 m below ground level for tasman waikato and wellington the zero depth refers to measurements at surface water sites in the tasman region there is general correspondence among anoxic areas and deeper depths these same regions indicate the presence of a significant 15 mixed redox status inspecting the inset map reveals discrepancies 10 among observed well and predicted redox status mostly with oxic appearing in regions associated with mixed conditions in the waikato region there are shallow anoxic environments in the area of the hauraki plains and adjacent area east of hamilton both in the waikato region the area surrounding lake taupo represents a more heterogeneous distribution of redox status and depth conditions however the area to the west appears mostly of mixed status whereas the area to the east appears mostly reduced there appears to be good correspondence among observed nd predicted redox status in the corresponding inset maps in the wellington region the hutt river valley to the north of wellington harbour is mostly characterized as mixed conditions with minor random occurrences of anoxic and oxic conditions throughout in the areas of kapiti coast and kapiti island the primary redox status appears to be anoxic with some mixed conditions notable exceptions include oxic conditions that exist westward in the areas adjacent to the sea the area surrounding lake wairarapa appears to be intensely reduced anoxic with some mixed conditions however oxic conditions appear at higher elevations and around the town of martinborough the inset map reveals reasonably good visual correspondence with minor discrepancies associated with mixed conditions being misclassified as oxic condition the prediction of separate redox fractions provides a way to present regional redox probability maps for example a single anoxic probability map is produced for the tasman fig 8a waikato fig 8b and wellington fig 8c regions where pr 1 anoxic pr 0 5 mixed and pr 0 oxic redox status variations from pure status members reflect insufficient information for their resolution possibly due to incorrect redox assignment temporal transitions among redox status and or issues with the learning parameters in those cases redox measurements may be generalized to more likely anoxic 1 0 67 more likely mixed 0 66 0 33 and more likely oxic 0 32 0 this presentation format reduces the prominence of mixed contributions appearing in the threshold maps figs 5 7 in favour having the likelihood of being either mixed or reduced but more likely reduced outcomes of this sort imply that there may not be enough mutual information in the observations to definitively discern the redox status as mixed or anoxic in any case the general trends of anoxic and oxic conditions appear to be similar as those revealed in the threshold maps one advantage in combining anoxic probability distributions with corresponding depths is the resulting integrated transdisciplinary data product perhaps the most innovative and more spatially informative presentation formats are those based on the simultaneous redox and depth predictions at the unstructured set of coordinates associated with the independent predictor variables for example consider the 3d predictions of probable anoxic redox status oxic 0 0 mixed 0 5 and anoxic 1 0 presented 50x vertical exaggeration for the tasman region 134 105 locations waikato region 130 714 locations and wellington 183 720 locations regions in figs 9 11 the most notable regional scale feature is the vertical tendency for oxic conditions to overlay anoxic conditions this observation is most obvious when inspecting the side views figs 9 11c and d for example in these figures there are pronounced groupings of mixed yellow redox conditions at the central eastern cost of tasman fig 9 a d in the waikato and wellington regions the mixed redox conditions appear more dispersed and associated with the anoxic regions in the waikato region there appear to be mixed areas with a greater likelihood of the redox status being oxic green and other areas with a greater likelihood for redox being anoxic orange those areas tending toward oxic conditions appear mostly at the coast such as the north and east of the haruaki area and the region east of lake taupo fig 10 in the wellington region there is a heterogeneous distribution of mixed redox conditions best viewed from the bottom looking upward fig 11b and d to most hydrologists these redox generalizations may seem obvious particularly where there is vertical recharge and relevant distribution of electron donors present by contrast there are other interesting redox transitions revealed at more localized scales for example by zooming into hydro geologically interesting features in the waikato and wellington regions another level of redox complexity can be identified in the waikato region the zoom features include areas around and adjacent to lake taupo fig 10e and hauraki plains fig 10f inspecting these figures reveals the traditional vertical groundwater recharge depth redox sequence of oxic mixed anoxic waters whereas areas in the hill country east and west of the firth of thames depict inverted redox sequences characterized by anoxic mixed oxic waters adjacent to areas of more pronounced oxic or anoxic waters one explanation for these different redox sequences may be attributed to sets of heterogeneous vertical sub horizontal and horizontal flowpaths of different redox status that mix as they converge and discharge at or near the lake a second explanation may be ascribed to successive volcanic eruptions and burial of top soils rich in carbon that provide drivers for the redox reduction process in this situation the normal depth relationship for redox status is modified this redox phenomenon has been observed in other studies such as the reporoa area between lake tarawera and lake taupo r stenger personal communication february 2019 in this case the electron donor distribution near the water table in the reporoa basin can induce reduced conditions at the water table while oxic groundwater recharge on the slopes around the basin can result in oxic conditions at greater depth due to lateral pathways in the lake taupo catchment groundwater at the water table is often oxic but becomes reduced with depth due to the occurrence of paleosols and organic debris in other instances only deep groundwater is reduced resulting from gradual consumption of low levels of recharging electron donors given that the heterogeneous distribution of these redox sequence features appear in all three regions may provide the foundation for future hypotheses when conceptualizing flow and transport at the present time however the complex redox patterns near groundwater discharge areas require additional study 3 4 4 model application of groundwater redox and depth predictions one immediate application for the redox status and corresponding depth predictions learning outputs is their incorporation into groundwater flow and transport models this process requires the interpolation of these predictions from the existing unstructured to structured set of grid cell or element nodal coordinates while it is possible to interpolate these data using linear and scripting methods a preferred approach is to introduce coordinates of the structured grid cells or element nodal coordinates into the existing nonlinear msom workflow and directly predict the redox status at those locations based on relations among the self organized hypersurface further these learning results could also be combined with gradients of geophysical and hydrogeologic measurements reflecting different support volumes into a multi modal transfer learning deep learning to estimate voxels of hydrogeophysical information to inform groundwater flow and transport models 4 conclusions results from the unsupervised learning based method msom are statistically superior to the three commonly used supervised learning based methods lda brt and rf the msom can simultaneously predict oxic mixed and anoxic redox status and their associated depths four response functions at unstructured grid locations associated with the predictor variables the statistical robustness of redox predictions is attributed to using learn heuristics for identifying optimal sets of regional predictor variables the unsupervised learning method provides the ability to evaluate the 3d occurrence of probable anoxic conditions from which redox status may contribute to understanding local and regional flowpaths the results presented herein provide impetus for future studies to verify the complexity of flow paths in and around regionally important hydrogeologic features such as lake taupo and hauraki plains in the waikato region and hutt river valley and lake wairarapa in the wellington region another line of inquiry may include extending the

5951,knowing the location where groundwater denitrification occurs or by proxy the groundwater redox status oxic mixed and anoxic is valuable information for assessing and managing potential

identify optimal sets of regional predictor variables a split sample approach is used to train and test the learning methods ability to predict redox status using the optimal predictor variables overall the supervised methods demonstrate a prediction bias toward oxic conditions and inability to perform statistically well when using independent regional data for example consider kappa statistics for brt tasman 0 42 waikato 0 38 wellington 0 17 rf tasman 0 42 waikato 0 47 wellington 0 17 and lda tasman 0 46 waikato 0 32 wellington 0 17 by contrast the unsupervised method performs

pressure from agricultural nitrate leaching ministry for the environment 2007 irrigation demand and current and future climate change effects robertson et al 2016 the integrity of groundwater quality is of increasing concern because about 40 of the population depends on groundwater for drinking water supply ministry for the environment 2007 and nutrient rich baseflow contributions are impacting the health of lowland streams ministry for the environment 2007 to address the deterioration of freshwater quality regulators are required to establish nitrate leaching and water quality limits by 2025 ministry for the environment 2007 to sustain agricultural production these limits need to account for attenuation that occurs along groundwater flow paths knowing the location where groundwater denitrification occurs or by proxy the groundwater redox status thus forms an important link between agricultural leaching sources and water quality objectives the best tools currently available for mapping the redox status for groundwater denitrification are predictive models koch et al 2019 as the complexity of real world groundwater systems increase from catchment to regional or national scales it becomes difficult and often impractical to make spatial predictions based on process based models learning based modeling is an alternative approach to predict the distribution of groundwater redox status based solely on the analysis of available measurements this approach is possible because learning based models build relationships between state variables input internal and output variables using a limited number of assumptions about the physical behaviour of the system solomatine et al 2009 that said the development of a learning based model is often challenging because failure can occur at any one of several model building steps choice of response variables choice of predictor variables choice of model architecture choice of model structure and complexity choice of model parameters model training testing and validation prediction and uncertainty quantification ultimately the model performance using this approach is limited by the quality of available data learning based groundwater quality models are grouped based on the type of problem being solved such as regression or classification solomatine et al 2009 regression problems typically involve predicting a single response variable such as nitrate concentration based on learning a function that maps inputs to outputs classification is a special form of learning based modeling in which the problem involves identifying the sub population to which a new observation belongs such as redox status oxic mixed or anoxic early groundwater studies mainly used linear models such as logistic regression to generate probabilistic maps of diffuse nitrate contamination nolan et al 2002 gurdak and qi 2012 and depths to the oxic suboxic interface tesoriero et al 2015 spatial predictions of groundwater redox status using linear discriminant analysis lda have previously been made by lee et al 2008 close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 these methods tacitly assume that redox status can be modelled as a linear combination of characteristics whose class samples are continuous not missing and normally distributed martinez and kak 2001 these considerations pose limitations when attempting to build models for predicting 3d regional redox conditions with data that are biased type frequency and spatial sampling disparate different physics and sparse missing samples although linear learning based modeling is used to study various aspects of groundwater systems the linkages and interactions among climate hydrological and biogeochemical cycles across spatiotemporal scales more appropriately favour nonlinear learning based modeling nonlinear learning based modeling includes supervised unsupervised and hybrid machine learning ml algorithms green et al 2016 the methods associated with these algorithms are known to fit nonlinear relationships while accommodating missing data and interactions among the different predictor variables supervised ml algorithms analyze training data and produce an inferred function which can be used for mapping new examples unsupervised ml algorithms build models by deducing structures present in the input data this process may be used to extract general rules reduce redundancy or organize data by similarity recent applications of supervised ml algorithms involve testing efficacy of the random forest regression method koch et al 2019 to model depth of the redox interface across denmark and the artificial neural network ann bayesian network bn and boosted regression trees brt methods to predict nitrate concentrations in groundwater of the central valley california nolan et al 2015 in former and later studies the cross validation results gave respective r2 for independent validation tests of 0 48 and 0 25 the cross validation results for these methods suggest that the models did not generalize well to independent data possibly due to overfitting given the relatively large number of predictor variables also noteworthy in the earlier study is that generalizing the models to holdout independent data resulted in a bias with the model overpredicting low concentrations and underpredicting high concentrations this phenomenon reveals one of the potential challenges when using learning based models in the presence of sample frequency bias another potential reason for poor predictive performance of learning based models is attributed to the high degree of model correlation among pairs of predictor variables guyon and elisseeff 2003 in the case of perfectly correlated predictor variables the increases in one variable offset corresponding decreases in the second variable with no effect on the training response but with increases in associated prediction uncertainty low et al 2013 these findings underscore the need for identifying an optimal set of predictor variables through some quantitative feature selection process singh et al 2014 feature selection algorithms fall into two categories the filter model or the wrapper model das 2001 kohavi and john 1997 the filter model relies on general characteristics of the training data to select some features without involving any learning algorithm for example povak et al 2014 selectively removed one variable of each paired linear predictor variables characterized by strong pearson coefficients œÅ 0 77 by reducing the number of collinear predictor variables from 50 to 33 the cross validation statistics for both brt and random forest rf models increased r2 0 85 suggesting the subsequent model generalized well to independent data other investigators applied a form of backward stepwise regression to brt and rf models that begins with a full model and at each step eliminates variables to find a reduced model that best explains the data ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 the removal of unimportant variables is necessary for building robust models that generalize to independent data but this stepwise process is not likely to be reliable when considering relative importance reported by the brt and rf methods the reason is that the relative importance is reported as normalized values for models characterized by strong correlations among predictor variables these variables will split importance thereby reducing their apparent influence in the prediction process and giving the false impression of their true ranked importance the wrapper model requires one predetermined learning algorithm in feature selection and uses its performance to evaluate and determine which features are selected yu and liu 2003 calvet et al 2017 the benefits of nonlinear feature selection in groundwater quality modeling using learn heuristics metaheuristics in machine learning was demonstrated by friedel and buscema 2016 and using evaluated filters embedded and wrapper methods was demonstrated by rodriguez galiano et al 2018 these studies demonstrated that the overfitting of predictor variables can be reduced when identifying an optimal number of predictor variables in accordance with the principle of occam s razor unnecessarily complex models should not be preferred to simpler ones encyclopaedia britannica 2010 the aim of this study is to predict groundwater redox status across selected agricultural regions of new zealand we hypothesize that the redox status classified from groundwater chemistry sampled across regional monitoring networks can be combined with well depths and nationally available climate geology hydrology soils and topography coverages to provide mutual information measure of entropy describing mutual dependence among random variables suitable for learning based model building and redox class prediction to test this hypothesis we evaluate supervised lda brt and rf and unsupervised modified self organizing map msom learning based methods the objectives are to compare the performance of these methods for predicting the probability of groundwater redox status oxic mixed anoxic and associated depths in groundwater systems of the tasman waikato and wellington regions this study extends the work of close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 who because of the single dependent model response variable restriction when using lda developed separate models for classifying redox status over shallow and deep zones in addition to evaluating supervised learning based methods we develop an innovative unsupervised learning based workflow to simultaneously predict four response functions oxic mixed anoxic and depth in this approach the relative benefit of mutual information content in the predictor variables can be evaluated by comparing the probability of predicted redox conditions in information theory this concept reflects the mutual pairwise dependence among random variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of water quality data the tasman waikato and wellington regions of new zealand were selected to test and compare learning based methods for predicting groundwater redox status fig 1 groundwater resources are considered nationally significant with many water quality monitoring well data that are collected by the regional councils tasman district is in the northern part of the south island and covers an area of 9650 km2 the main groundwater resources in the district lie within the alluvial terraces and coastal plains associated with the waimea motueka riwaka takaka and aorere rivers waikato region is in the central north island and covers an area of 25 000 km2 this region contains much of the taupo volcanic zone with geology dominated by volcanic rocks and sediments that have been reworked by fluvial processes the highest elevations are in the south around the central volcanic plateau and water flows northward initially through sub catchment groundwater systems and then via the waikato river and its tributaries the wellington region is located at the lower end of the north island and covers an area of 8130 km2 there are significant groundwater resources in the hutt and wairarapa valleys associated with river floodplains and coastal plains along the kapiti coast morgan and hughes 2001 tidswell et al 2012 the aquifers of the lower hutt valley comprise thick accumulations of gravel deposited by the hutt river the primary valley aquifer associated with the waiwhetu gravels is separated into an upper and lower aquifer recharged by the hutt river there is a complex system of aquifers in the wairarapa valley that may be classified into three broad categories alluvial fan deposits reworked river gravels and stratified lower valley deposits the kapiti coast groundwater system has three broad types of aquifers associated with different deposits recent river gravels glacial and interglacial deposits and post glacial beach and dune sand deposits tidswell et al 2012 more information on these aquifers is provided by morgan and hughes 2001 2 2 response variables the response variable model output used in building and comparing predictive models is groundwater redox class groundwater sample data are obtained from each of the three regional councils for redox assignment there are 568 wells in the waikato with data suitable no3 do and mn see next section for development of lda redox zone models by close et al 2016 for the tasman and wellington regions iron fe and sulphate so4 are used to assist with redox assignments at sites with missing no3 do and mn data there are 757 wells with data suitable for redox assignment in the tasman region and 656 wells in the wellington region the redox class is determined based on aqueous chemistry sampled in regional wells and assumes that a series of microbially mediated redox reactions naturally occurs in groundwater systems mcmahon and chapelle 2008 these reactions successively use o2 no3 mn iv fe iii so4 and co2 as electron acceptors reflecting a decrease in energy available to the microbes from each successive electron acceptor given the national focus on reducing freshwater no3 concentrations this study considered the first three parameters o2 no3 and mn to assign the redox status of each groundwater sample for reducing conditions to exist the relative concentrations of o2 and no3 will be low and mn will be high in cases where the fe and so4 data are used to supplement the other data the so4 could be high but if mn and dissolved oxygen do indicated reduced conditions the groundwater status is assigned as being reduced with respect to no3 because the so4 reaction is further along the redox gradient mcmahon and chapelle 2008 developed a system for the assignment of redox status based on analysis of aqueous chemistry measured as part of groundwater field studies in their system thresholds are derived for each parameter based on concentrations typically found for redox environments observed in various studies with thresholds designed to be broadly applicable over a range of different hydrologic conditions at the regional scale the thresholds used in this study are 1 0 mg l for o2 0 5 mg l for no3 n 0 05 mg l for mn 0 1 mg l for fe and 0 5 mg l for so4 mean concentrations for these redox sensitive parameters are calculated for each site and then classified as having oxidized mixed or reduced groundwater the mixed class is assigned when the no3 mn and o2 parameters provided an ambiguous indication of redox status in situations where the no3 n levels are low 0 5 mg l and do mn and fe values indicated oxic conditions then the well is assigned as being oxic this water is considered likely to be oxic but old groundwater associated with low land use intensity that would have low nitrate concentrations in other cases well samples with ambiguous redox indicators are assigned to the mixed class some potential reasons for ambiguity include 1 the groundwater environment is not in redox equilibrium 2 the well screen draws water from two redox environments and 3 the aqueous concentrations are close to threshold values the reader is referred to close et al 2016 for a more comprehensive discussion on redox ambiguity in building a predictive learning based redox model the supervised methods such as lda brt and rf only can accommodate a single response variable comprising the three classes e g oxic mixed anoxic the unsupervised msom has the advantage that a model can be developed to predict one or more response functions in the latter case separate binary response functions are created to reflect each condition in this case each response condition is denoted as present or absent the advantage in using this approach is that the relative quality in underlying measurement information content becomes obvious with the probable prediction across redox classes that sum to one for example those wells with unambiguous information content for classification will be estimated as 1 others 0 the more ambiguous the information and initial redox classification the further from 1 will be the predictions with residual fractions appearing in one or two additional classes given the flexible variable assignment the msom is further used to predict the depth associated with each redox status prediction this depth prediction is based on the well depth of each groundwater sample in the response variable training data set redox state often varies with depth and previous lda models developed for the canterbury and waikato regions by close et al 2016 and the southland region by wilson et al 2018 involved developing separate models for shallow medium and deep zones in each region the depth thresholds used in developing models were subjectively assigned to qualitatively account for different hydrogeological environments one challenge with this approach is the imposed depth sample frequency and redox status biases as a generalization shallow models have more samples that tend to be oxic whereas the deepest models have fewest number of samples that tend to be anoxic in the present study a single model is developed for each region using a random split sample that is drawn from all well data 2 3 predictor variables the choice of predictor variables independent model input used in building and comparing learning based models is based initially on domain knowledge of field parameters likely to influence the regional redox status at the scale of interest this approach requires using the geographical information system gis to create spatial attributes layers with complete or nearly complete coverage across each region an initial dataset of 22 spatial attributes are developed from climate geology hydrology land use soil and topography databases a summary of these variables and their sources is provided in table 1 subsurface flow data are generally unavailable for our study regions so we use annual specific discharge characteristics of the stream or river associated with the lowest strahler order in the sub catchment order 2 in which the well is positioned specific discharge data include mean flow mean low flow mean flow in february and the number of events exceeding three times the long term median flow booker 2013 2015 elevation slope geological age climate and hydrological parameters are continuous variables the distribution of values associated with these datasets tends to be asymmetrically skewed and therefore are log transformed to approximate a gaussian distribution the log transformed values are then assigned into ranges bins analogous to a histogram for compatibility with the vector based gis model development binning thresholds are identified using the jenks natural breaks method jenks 1963 which provides better resolution of the flatter slopes lower elevations and younger geological ages for those parameters ten groups or bins are created for each of the parameters and thresholds given in table 1 the bin numbers provided variable values for the predictive models other categorical variables require numerical reassignment following the approach of close et al 2016 the assignments for geological rock type and soil order are carried out by giving a low score to categories that tend to be inert or retain oxidising conditions and giving a higher score to categories that are more reactive with respect to oxygen and nitrate and thus likely to promote reducing conditions the scale for these variables ranged between 1 and 5 for example geological units such as gravels are given a score of 1 whereas peats are given a score of 5 the land use classification variable provides an approximate measure of potential nitrate inputs with high nitrate inputs associated with cropland and high productivity grassland given scores of 1 and 2 respectively low nitrate inputs associated with forest and wetlands are given scores of 4 and 5 respectively the values of predictor variables at each well location are obtained by conducting a spatial query using the gis the gis layers for each of the predictor variables across a region are prepared the raster topography parameters are converted to vectors and intersected with the other parameter layers mountainous terrain i e land with a land use capability class of 8 or class 7 land with a slope 19 degrees is excluded from the models and maps a composite layer containing all model variables is collated and the results of predictive models implemented in the gis framework to extrapolate results throughout each region 2 4 model architecture structure complexity the selection of supervised and unsupervised learning based algorithms usually is purpose based in many cases more than one method associated with an algorithm may be suitable for developing a predictive model of some response thereby providing a means for comparing results by contrast individual methods associated to an algorithm differ fundamentally in their architecture structure and complexity this study evaluates the efficacy of using supervised lda brt and rf and unsupervised msom methods to predict redox status these methods are briefly described next 2 4 1 supervised learning based predictions the architecture of lda involves data that are divided into two classes using the one versus all paradigm one class represents the selected data whereas the other class represents all the other data these two classes are divided using a hyperplane linear which is a discriminant of the two classes the process is iterated over all the data to find the class with the maximum distance minimum prediction error bias variance from the hyperplane the extension of this method to multiple discriminant analysis follows five steps rao 1948 compute the d dimensional mean vectors for the different classes from the dataset compute the scatter matrices in between class and within class scatter matrix compute the eigenvectors e 1 e 2 e d and corresponding eigenvalues Œª 1 Œª 2 Œª d for the scatter matrices sort the eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues and choose k eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues to form a d k dimensional matrix w where every column represents an eigenvector use this d k eigenvector matrix to transform the samples onto the new subspace this can be summarized by the matrix multiplication y x w where x is a n d dimensional matrix representing the n samples and y are the transformed n k dimensional samples in the new subspace in contrast to lda ensemble methods dietterich 2000 such as brt and rf learn relationships among response and predictor variables without relying on statistical assumptions about the data elith et al 2008 the architecture of these methods is based on the surface built by a regression tree the tree is piece wise constant surface where there is a region rm in input space for each terminal node that is the hyper rectangles induced by tree cuts the constant associated with each region which represents the estimated prediction y c m that the tree is making at each terminal node formally the m terminal node tree model is expressed by 1 y t x m 1 m c m i r m x where i r m 1 if r m and 0 otherwise the difference among these two ensemble methods is related to how they minimize the predictive error bias plus variance the brt method minimizes the predictive error using the boosting procedure de ath 2007 to combine a set of weak learners high bias low variance whereas rf uses the bagging procedure breiman 2001 to combine decision trees low bias high variance in terms of decision trees the weak learners used in brt are shallow trees sometimes even as small as decision stumps trees with two leaves boosting reduces error mainly by reducing bias by aggregating the output from many models as an additive model defined as hastie et al 2009 2 f x m 1 m Œ≤ m b x Œª m where Œ≤ m m 1 2 m are the expansion coefficients corresponding to the m trees x is the set of predictor variables Œª m parameterizes splitting variables at internal nodes and predictions at terminal noes and b x Œª m is a basis function that represents a single tree we use stagewise gradient boosting to estimate Œ≤ m and Œª m sequentially from m 1 to m with each new tree fitted to the residuals of the previous tree after an initial tree is trained subsequent trees are fitted to the residuals of the previous tree rather than to the data directly we apply stochastic gradient boosting and steepest descent minimization to estimate Œ≤ m to minimize the loss given by 3 l y f x y f x 2 where y is the observed value of the response variable which is a redox parameter the rf method breiman 2001 uses bagging plus a perturbation procedure subset splitting to fit the base learners the essential idea is to average many noisy but approximately unbiased tree models and hence reduce the variance this variance reduction is achieved in the tree growing process through random selection of the input variables the collection of different classifiers overfit the data in different ways and through voting e g using the mean median mode or other statistical criteria those differences are smoothed out breiman 2001 the extension of bagging to rf follows two steps hastie et al 2009 1 for b 1 to b a draw a bootstrap sample z of size n from the training data b grow a random forest tree tb to the bootstrapped data by recursively repeating the following steps for each terminal node of the tree until the minimum node size nmin is reached i select m variables at random from the p variables ii pick the best variable split point among the m iii split the node into two daughter nodes 2 output the ensemble of trees t b 1 b to make a prediction at a new point x 4 regression f rf b x 1 b b 1 b t b x classification let c b x be the class prediction of the bth random forest tree then 5 c b rf b x m a j o r i t y v o t e c b x 1 b 2 4 2 unsupervised learning based predictions the msom procedure involves the sequential application of competitive learning self organizing map and estimation minimization of objective function by competitive learning the architecture of msom involves an input layer signals from the environment and an output layer competitive feedback to the environment the input layer comprises a set of nodes neurons that are connected one to another through a rectangular topology the connections between inputs data vectors and nodes have weights so a set of weights corresponds to each node in implementing the msom procedure kohonen 2001 competitive learning iteratively modifies weights during the training phase so that the self organized output pattern becomes consistent meaning that the input pattern will produce the same self organized output pattern in doing so the som iteratively maps each data sample as a vector each variable is characterized as a cloud of data vectors across a hypersurface on which data vectors closer to each other are more related self similar than data vectors farther away the learning algorithm may be summarized as follows kohonen 2001 1 generate initial values including weights radius learning parameter values 2 select input vector from data set 3 identify winning node which is the closest node to the input vector using the euclidean distance d metric 6 d i 0 n v i w i 2 where v is the input vector and w is the weight vector 4 identify the neighborhood with the given radius using a gaussian function 7 œÉ œÉ 0 e x p 1 Œª t 1 2 3 where œÉ0 is the radius at t0 Œª is a time constant and t is iteration 5 update the weights for the winning node and all the nodes in the same neighborhood w t 1 w t l t v t w t 8 9 l t l 0 e x p 1 Œª t 1 2 3 where w t 1 is weight for t 1 l t is the learning rate at time t v is the input vector when updating the weight values the exponential decay function is also used to decrease the learning rate learning rate value is decreased over time the closer a node is to the winning node the more its weights get altered according to the same gaussian function specifically the learning rate is scaled by 10 Œ∏ t e x p dist 2 2 œÉ 2 t t 1 2 3 where the weights are adjusted using Œ∏ t 6 repeat steps 2 6 until the weight vectors reach a converged state the equations and issues regarding data gathering normalization and training are documented in kohonen 2001 7 the estimation of missing values sometimes referred to as imputation is done simultaneously for all variables across the hypersurface kalteh et al 2008 2 5 feature selection and learn heuristics according to rallo et al 2002 one of the elements necessary for accurate learning based prediction is model diversity model diversity reflects the incorporation of training information response and predictor variables characterizing mutually informative relations across different spatial and temporal sampling gradients feature selection is used to maximize information content while reducing dimensionality to avoid model overfitting the condition where a model begins to describe random error in data rather than relationships among variables feature selection can minimize this problem by identifying an optimal subset of predictor variables that minimize model nonuniqueness and associated uncertainty nonuniqueness is common to all learning based and process based models due to their inexact solutions that require some form of training fitting or calibration in this context the notion of an optimal set of predictor variables reflects the fact that there are many alternate combinations of variables that will satisfy the redox constraints in this study feature selection is undertaken using the nonlinear wrapper approach based on learn heuristics the wrapper model requires one predetermined learning algorithm in feature selection and uses its performance to evaluate and determine which features are selected yu and liu 2003 in this regard the learn heuristics buscema 2004 buscema et al 2013 reflect the ml algorithm that is introduced into the metaheuristics mlm algorithm the ml algorithm is generalized for which multiple learning algorithms are evaluated for example backpropagation knn and na√Øve bayes inside of a genetic algorithm ga metaheuristic given that the ga converges to a global minimum surface not a single vector the process is randomly re initiated and run until the subset of optimal features can be identified based on their mode values 2 6 training testing validation uncertainty training and testing of the learning based algorithms are carried out using a stratified split sample validation approach in this approach the minimum number of records regional response and predictor variables among the different redox classes is identified the remaining records for each of the other two classes are randomized and total number reduced to the identified minimum number of records from this balanced set same number of records in each redox class of groundwater redox data the records are randomized and split 75 training and 25 testing both split sets include randomly selected records associated with response oxic mixed anoxic depth and optimal set of regional predictor variables optimal set based on feature selection the testing records are assigned as holdout data to which the model is validated for generalizability to independent field data the metrics used to evaluate model performance cohen 1960 are accuracy predictive success and cohen s kappa comparison between the observed accuracy and the agreement expected due to chance cohen 1960 suggested the kappa result be interpreted as follows values 0 as indicating no agreement and 0 01 0 20 as none to slight 0 21 0 40 as fair 0 41 0 60 as moderate 0 61 0 80 as substantial and 0 81 1 00 as almost perfect agreement the kappa statistics are performed on binary threshold values for estimated redox status oxic mixed and anoxic and correlation of known and estimated depths and cross validation on and correlation among observed and estimated redox status oxic mixed and anoxic to quantify the prediction uncertainty a leave one out cross validation strategy is used efron 1993 in this strategy there is one test value and training data set that consists of all but that one test value training and testing are carried out n times in a round robin manner where n is the number of values associated with the variable and each representing a new model this strategy guarantees a minimum bias of the estimated prediction error hastie et al 2009 and enables nonlinear statistics and range of uncertainty to be computed for the trained models 3 results and discussion 3 1 response variables regional groundwater sampling data are inherently biased for both the response variable redox status and associated predictor variables spatial attributes for example most samples in the groundwater dataset are oxic table 2 this bias in redox status is attributed to the increased frequency of sampling in areas where greater water demand is concomitant with oxic conditions and or the increased frequency of shallow sampling across the new zealand landscape dominated by oxic groundwater fig 2 the distribution of samples within the spatial attributes is biased by the prevalence of groundwater usage in areas of productive land which tends to be gently sloping with freely draining soil a summary of sampled redox classes by depth and all regions is presented in fig 3 the two types of study bias that could adversely influence learning based model performance and their subsequent interpretation are variable importance and sample selection strobl et al 2007 the variable importance bias is associated with differences in the scale or number of predictor variables this bias can lead to suboptimal attributes being favoured by the model simply because they have a larger number of records variable importance bias is identified herein by simulating a null case test whereby the response variables are permuted to break the association with their predictor variables if there is no bias in these variables the result would be equally uninformative in the null case whereas biased variables can be identified by the presence of a falsely elevated importance or a model predictive accuracy which reflects the proportion of the dominant sample 3 2 predictor variables of the original predictor variables n 22 the learn heuristic based feature selection process identified an optimal global set of variables n 14 suitable for predicting redox status across the tasman waikato and wellington regions table 3 these variables are used in the initial building of the supervised and unsupervised learning based models important predictors that appear common to all three regions include eight variables gwdepth mainrock geolage soilorder pet rainfall flowmalf and elevation the optimal 14 variable predictor set is further refined for each region and used in building unsupervised learning based models the number of important predictor variables differs among regions table 3 the application of principal component analysis pca to median component plane values reveal relations among the first two component axes fig 4 first the distinct separation of redox status components colored vectors suggests that there is enough mutual information in the associated variables to build predictive models second there are different groups of predictor variables more associated to each redox state closer variables indicate stronger relative relation these associations to oxic condition redox 1 are in blue circle mixed condition redox 3 is in green and anoxic condition redox 5 is in red in these circles those predictor variables closest to the redox condition may be interpreted as more related with reason to consider their possible redox causation effect these positively correlated clustered variables suggests the likelihood for enhanced nonuniqueness and prediction uncertainty based on feature selection of predictor variables using records from all three regional data sets this finding further suggests that there may be a potential future benefit using learn heuristics to select optimal features sets from individual regional data sets in the tasman region oxic conditions appear to be most closely associated with pet mixed conditions are most closely related to nleach and anoxic conditions are most closely related to mainrock and welldepth in the wellington region oxic conditions are prevalent with increasing elevation mixed conditions with rainfall and anoxic conditions with soil order in the waikato region oxic conditions are most closely associated with geolage mixed conditions are most closely related to mainrock and anoxic conditions are most closely related to pet in addition to correlation versus causation considerations these interpretations are somewhat more complicated given that variables with more samples will appear farther from the origin in the pca plot statistically significant predictor variables with positive correlations are for redox 1 gwdepth geolage and rainfall redox 3 mainrock flowmalf and elevation redox 5 welldepth soilorder and pet 3 3 supervised learning based modeling 3 3 1 model training and testing the training and testing phase statistics for the supervised learning based methods are presented in table 4 in general the regional training cross validation statistics suggest that the two ensemble methods brt and rf outperformed the statistical method lda for all three regional catchments however brt was found to be so sensitive to the number of estimators used that it was not possible to establish confidence in making predictions with this method the training cross validation performance best to worst metrics given by kappa statistics are brt tasman 0 92 waikato 0 80 wellington 0 91 rf tasman 0 71 waikato 0 72 wellington 0 80 and lda tasman 0 56 waikato 0 40 wellington 0 40 a null case test performed on the permutated data retains high model accuracies revealing the high impact of sample selection bias on the models the accuracies reflect the proportion of oxic samples in each region accordingly the performance metrics for all these methods are significantly reduced following the testing phase specifically all methods performed similarly with kappa results for brt tasman 0 42 waikato 0 38 wellington 0 17 rf tasman 0 42 waikato 0 47 wellington 0 17 and lda tasman 0 46 waikato 0 32 wellington 0 17 revealing that they did not generalize well to the independent data whereas the holdout cross validation statistics for the tasman and waikato regions resemble results published by ransom et al 2017 none of the supervised methods produced statistics indicating their suitability for predicting redox status across the wellington region the performance of these models for the null case test revels their inability to overcome sample selection bias resulting in poor predictability given the poor performance of the supervised learning based models as regional redox predictors using independent data the spatial mapping is skipped and efficacy of the unsupervised learning based method in regional predictions evaluated next 3 4 unsupervised learning based modeling 3 4 1 model training and testing prior to training the response and predictor variables input data are normalized by their data variance and randomly assigned presenting the input vectors to the map sequentially using a randomly sorted database as an initial set of map weight vectors application of the msom network to training data is done using a single fixed number of neurons also called nodes and topological relations the selected grid shape is a toroid that wraps from top to bottom and side to side with hexagonal neurons whose initial number of map units total neurons m is determined using the heuristic formula vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 m 5 sqrt n where n is the total number of data samples this formula based the ratio between the two eigenvectors with greatest eigenvalues computed from the training data is used to establish the initial side lengths of the respective self organized map grids of 14 8 14 10 and 12 8 for tasman waikato and wellington respectively table 5 training of the map is conducted in sequential phases first rough and second fine a summary of the number of rough and fine training iterations and gaussian neighborhood radii along with learning rates are presented in table 6 the initial and final learning rates of 0 5 and 0 05 decay linearly down to 10 5 and the gaussian neighborhood function decreases exponentially decay rate of 10 3 iteration 1 providing reasonable convergence for this study the testing phase statistics accuracy and kappa values reveal the model inability to adequately replicate training data when assigning network size based on the heuristic network formula for this reason the network dimensions are increased and testing repeated until there is satisfactory statistical correspondence between observed and predicted training variables the correspondence between observations and predicted training variables is further revealed by decreased quantization and topological errors reflecting improvements through data separation on the hypersurface this finding has previously not been discussed in the literature the ability to improve predictions with increasing network size is attributed to increased separation and resolution of data vectors projected onto the self organized hypersurface the results of this testing process are presented along with a random set of records to ensure minimum prediction bias in table 7 inspection of this table reveals the respective optimum network sizes for tasman waikato and wellington are 46 24 50 36 and 54 32 summary statistics are presented for unsupervised training self organized map approach applied to regional redox and predictor variables with different network sizes table 7 the largest regional network reflects the size where kappa values stabilized 3 4 2 model validation ability of the trained regional models to simultaneously predict redox status and depth from independent data are evaluated by application of cross validation to the regional holdout data sets this process is repeated using 30 monte carlo mc trials to account for nonuniqueness in the combination of initial predictor values during the msom estimation process with the respective number of rough and fine training phase iterations of about 260 and 5200 for the tasman region each replacement prediction takes about 4 mins and about 150 mins per monte carlo trial computing the statistics for 30 mc trials therefore requires more than a 4440 min period 74 hrs this time period is the minimum ideal time because each mc trial requires manual intervention to restart the prediction process thereby extending the actual time period given these computational time challenges for tasman other regions are similar the statistical evaluation of cross validated predictions for the models is restricted to a single reduced network size 20 10 to avoid introducing a redox prediction bias through imposed thresholds for kappa statistics the univariate statistics are computed on stochastic predictions using the independent holdout samples for each region the comparison of groundwater redox and well depth statistics based on predictions using the suboptimal learning networks are summarized and presented along with observations statistics in tables 8 and 9 despite the suboptimal network size the observed versus predicted redox status and depth statistics provide reasonable correspondence particularly for the average median and standard deviation inspection of the minimum and maximum prediction values however reveal a tendency for the msom to overpredict minimum values and underpredict maximum values this bias tendency is common to supervised and unsupervised learning based methods having previously been noted by friedel et al 2017 the divergence of average and median prediction values is attributed in part to an underlying nonlinear process and an insufficient number of mc trials even so the statistics for the unsupervised learning based models reflect prediction quality that exceeds that of the supervised learning based models in decreasing order of model quality the r squared redox results are tasman oxic 0 91 mixed 0 84 anoxic 0 92 waikato oxic 0 75 mixed 0 79 anoxic 0 84 and wellington oxic 0 75 mixed 0 84 anoxic 0 90 the quality of depth predictions is less robust than redox status this finding may be attributed to the greater range over which predictions are made and fewer number of extreme data values as compared to the redox status it is noteworthy that median values of predicted and observed well depth table 9 are of the same order but the predicted median values appear greater than the observed median values these results highlight the fact that a single regional model prediction realization will not likely reflect the true regional redox status and corresponding depth thereby favoring median predictions from a stochastic set as more representative regional predictions using independent data sets these validation results demonstrate the net benefit of using the unsupervised models to predict regional redox status and depth from independent data sets despite their suboptimal networks this finding underscores the usefulness of limited and balanced sampling campaign 200 n 100 sites to train and predict across representative regional catchment areas 8130 km2 catchment area 25 000 km2 in new zealand cross validation statistics are computed using the median values 30 realizations predicted at independent locations after applying a binary threshold where median predictions 0 5 1 and 0 5 0 0 for this case the regional kappa statistics best to worst are waikato 0 80 tasman 0 78 and wellington 0 76 table 10 in contrast to previous studies using supervised learning methods ransom et al 2017 ransom et al 2017 nolan et al 2018 and those undertaken herein table 7 these results suggest that the unsupervised msom models generalize well with substantial to almost perfect agreement to independent redox data 3 4 3 model prediction of groundwater redox and depths the simultaneous prediction of redox status and their associated depths is undertaken by applying the trained optimal network models to the corresponding set of independent predictor variables at varying number of regional locations this study extends the work of close et al 2016 and wilson et al 2018 who because of the single dependent model response variable restriction when using lda developed separate models for classifying redox status over shallow and deep zones the number of independent locations used for mapping variables across the tasman waikato and wellington regions are 134105 130714 and 183720 respectively these numbers represent the practical limit ad hoc determination of unique combinations of intersecting predictor variable values that arcmap is capable to process the various related products presented include threshold redox assignment 0 5 redox and depth maps figs 5 7 anoxic probability maps of redox status 0 pr 1 and depths fig 8 and 3d distributions of anoxic probability 0 pr 1 including top down bottom up and side to side views figs 9 11 the application of threshold assignments to model predictions provide information to produce redox and depth maps for tasman fig 5 waikato fig 6 and wellington fig 7 regions the threshold redox and depth maps represent a step change from the traditional classification of redox associated with a prescribed depth range this innovation treats the redox status as a regression problem with the simultaneous prediction of fractional redox status oxic mixed anoxic fractions 1 and corresponding depth to compare these results to the traditional lda classification approach requires assigning predictions according to a binary threshold criterion status 0 5 in doing so each regional map displays oxic mixed and anoxic redox status along with a supporting map of corresponding depths both map types represent an interpolation of 3d information to 2d plane in which hot colours indicate anoxic status and greatest depths and cool colours indicate oxic status and shallow depths the observations of redox at well locations are superimposed on localized redox inset maps for comparing the visual prediction quality all regions display a continuum of oxic to anoxic conditions with respective depths that range from 0 to 240 m 3 to 318 m 0 to 177 m below ground level for tasman waikato and wellington the zero depth refers to measurements at surface water sites in the tasman region there is general correspondence among anoxic areas and deeper depths these same regions indicate the presence of a significant 15 mixed redox status inspecting the inset map reveals discrepancies 10 among observed well and predicted redox status mostly with oxic appearing in regions associated with mixed conditions in the waikato region there are shallow anoxic environments in the area of the hauraki plains and adjacent area east of hamilton both in the waikato region the area surrounding lake taupo represents a more heterogeneous distribution of redox status and depth conditions however the area to the west appears mostly of mixed status whereas the area to the east appears mostly reduced there appears to be good correspondence among observed nd predicted redox status in the corresponding inset maps in the wellington region the hutt river valley to the north of wellington harbour is mostly characterized as mixed conditions with minor random occurrences of anoxic and oxic conditions throughout in the areas of kapiti coast and kapiti island the primary redox status appears to be anoxic with some mixed conditions notable exceptions include oxic conditions that exist westward in the areas adjacent to the sea the area surrounding lake wairarapa appears to be intensely reduced anoxic with some mixed conditions however oxic conditions appear at higher elevations and around the town of martinborough the inset map reveals reasonably good visual correspondence with minor discrepancies associated with mixed conditions being misclassified as oxic condition the prediction of separate redox fractions provides a way to present regional redox probability maps for example a single anoxic probability map is produced for the tasman fig 8a waikato fig 8b and wellington fig 8c regions where pr 1 anoxic pr 0 5 mixed and pr 0 oxic redox status variations from pure status members reflect insufficient information for their resolution possibly due to incorrect redox assignment temporal transitions among redox status and or issues with the learning parameters in those cases redox measurements may be generalized to more likely anoxic 1 0 67 more likely mixed 0 66 0 33 and more likely oxic 0 32 0 this presentation format reduces the prominence of mixed contributions appearing in the threshold maps figs 5 7 in favour having the likelihood of being either mixed or reduced but more likely reduced outcomes of this sort imply that there may not be enough mutual information in the observations to definitively discern the redox status as mixed or anoxic in any case the general trends of anoxic and oxic conditions appear to be similar as those revealed in the threshold maps one advantage in combining anoxic probability distributions with corresponding depths is the resulting integrated transdisciplinary data product perhaps the most innovative and more spatially informative presentation formats are those based on the simultaneous redox and depth predictions at the unstructured set of coordinates associated with the independent predictor variables for example consider the 3d predictions of probable anoxic redox status oxic 0 0 mixed 0 5 and anoxic 1 0 presented 50x vertical exaggeration for the tasman region 134 105 locations waikato region 130 714 locations and wellington 183 720 locations regions in figs 9 11 the most notable regional scale feature is the vertical tendency for oxic conditions to overlay anoxic conditions this observation is most obvious when inspecting the side views figs 9 11c and d for example in these figures there are pronounced groupings of mixed yellow redox conditions at the central eastern cost of tasman fig 9 a d in the waikato and wellington regions the mixed redox conditions appear more dispersed and associated with the anoxic regions in the waikato region there appear to be mixed areas with a greater likelihood of the redox status being oxic green and other areas with a greater likelihood for redox being anoxic orange those areas tending toward oxic conditions appear mostly at the coast such as the north and east of the haruaki area and the region east of lake taupo fig 10 in the wellington region there is a heterogeneous distribution of mixed redox conditions best viewed from the bottom looking upward fig 11b and d to most hydrologists these redox generalizations may seem obvious particularly where there is vertical recharge and relevant distribution of electron donors present by contrast there are other interesting redox transitions revealed at more localized scales for example by zooming into hydro geologically interesting features in the waikato and wellington regions another level of redox complexity can be identified in the waikato region the zoom features include areas around and adjacent to lake taupo fig 10e and hauraki plains fig 10f inspecting these figures reveals the traditional vertical groundwater recharge depth redox sequence of oxic mixed anoxic waters whereas areas in the hill country east and west of the firth of thames depict inverted redox sequences characterized by anoxic mixed oxic waters adjacent to areas of more pronounced oxic or anoxic waters one explanation for these different redox sequences may be attributed to sets of heterogeneous vertical sub horizontal and horizontal flowpaths of different redox status that mix as they converge and discharge at or near the lake a second explanation may be ascribed to successive volcanic eruptions and burial of top soils rich in carbon that provide drivers for the redox reduction process in this situation the normal depth relationship for redox status is modified this redox phenomenon has been observed in other studies such as the reporoa area between lake tarawera and lake taupo r stenger personal communication february 2019 in this case the electron donor distribution near the water table in the reporoa basin can induce reduced conditions at the water table while oxic groundwater recharge on the slopes around the basin can result in oxic conditions at greater depth due to lateral pathways in the lake taupo catchment groundwater at the water table is often oxic but becomes reduced with depth due to the occurrence of paleosols and organic debris in other instances only deep groundwater is reduced resulting from gradual consumption of low levels of recharging electron donors given that the heterogeneous distribution of these redox sequence features appear in all three regions may provide the foundation for future hypotheses when conceptualizing flow and transport at the present time however the complex redox patterns near groundwater discharge areas require additional study 3 4 4 model application of groundwater redox and depth predictions one immediate application for the redox status and corresponding depth predictions learning outputs is their incorporation into groundwater flow and transport models this process requires the interpolation of these predictions from the existing unstructured to structured set of grid cell or element nodal coordinates while it is possible to interpolate these data using linear and scripting methods a preferred approach is to introduce coordinates of the structured grid cells or element nodal coordinates into the existing nonlinear msom workflow and directly predict the redox status at those locations based on relations among the self organized hypersurface further these learning results could also be combined with gradients of geophysical and hydrogeologic measurements reflecting different support volumes into a multi modal transfer learning deep learning to estimate voxels of hydrogeophysical information to inform groundwater flow and transport models 4 conclusions results from the unsupervised learning based method msom are statistically superior to the three commonly used supervised learning based methods lda brt and rf the msom can simultaneously predict oxic mixed and anoxic redox status and their associated depths four response functions at unstructured grid locations associated with the predictor variables the statistical robustness of redox predictions is attributed to using learn heuristics for identifying optimal sets of regional predictor variables the unsupervised learning method provides the ability to evaluate the 3d occurrence of probable anoxic conditions from which redox status may contribute to understanding local and regional flowpaths the results presented herein provide impetus for future studies to verify the complexity of flow paths in and around regionally important hydrogeologic features such as lake taupo and hauraki plains in the waikato region and hutt river valley and lake wairarapa in the wellington region another line of inquiry may include extending the msom method to predict the redox status across new zealand despite data biases and sparsity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

5952,current flood mapping practices in the united states model both storm surge and riverine flooding in coastal regions in regions where the hazards overlap independence and non concurrence are generally assumed although recent literature has noted several cases of tropical cyclones tcs where storm surge and rainfall runoff interacted nonlinearly violating this assumption in order to evaluate the effects of the nonlinear interactions on flood risk statistics using traditional methods i e by using simulation suites of physically based flood hazard models with varied tc characteristics it is necessary to couple the rainfall runoff and storm surge components into a single simulation framework in order to accomplish this efficiently use of a parametric tc rainfall model is proposed four such models were obtained by the authors r cliper rainfall climatology and persistence ipet interagency performance evaluation task force rainfall analysis phram parametric hurricane rainfall model and p cliper pdf precipitation climatology and persistence the objective of the current study is to compare precipitation fields produced by four existing parametric tc rainfall models and then to select the most appropriate model for inclusion in future combined flooding studies meteorological skill metrics were used to evaluate rainfall models for 67 atlantic tcs affecting the united states from 2004 through 2017 of the four models evaluated the highly simplified ipet rainfall model demonstrated the most skill at reproducing storm total precipitation for thresholds above 75 mm 3 in however the skill metrics obtained indicate that none of the models is suitable for direct use in combined flooding studies at this time keywords tropical cyclones rainfall flood risk joint flooding 1 introduction while us coastal watershed counties account for less than 20 of the land area 52 of the us population resides in these counties crossett et al 2013 tropical cyclones tcs are a major contributor to the flood threat in coastal watershed counties through a variety of mechanisms 1 rainfall runoff flooding from tc rainfall 2 coastal flooding including effects of storm surge wave setup breaking waves and tides or 3 interactions between rainfall runoff and coastal effects mechanism 1 was largely to blame for inundation of harris county and houston texas during 2017 hurricane harvey as the storm produced over 1524 mm 60 in of rainfall within a 5 day period blake and zelinsky 2018 mechanism 2 was the main driver in flooding experienced in coastal areas of mississippi and louisiana during 2005 hurricane katrina when a record 8 5 meter 27 8 foot storm surge inundated pass christian mississippi knabb et al 2005 cangialosi et al 2018 note potential mechanism 3 flooding during 2017 hurricane irma when downtown miami experienced significant flooding due to the combined effects of heavy rainfall 305 mm 12 in in 48 h and inadequate drainage of urban runoff due to storm surge elevated water levels 1 2 to 1 8 m 4 to 6 feet above normal in the bay flooding by mechanism 3 has been noted in an increasing number of studies since 2010 when bunya et al 2010 and dietrich et al 2010 included riverine forcing although steady in that study in their hindcast simulations of 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita potential impacts of under prediction of water levels due to lack of rainfall runoff forcing were noted by bunya et al 2010 studies have also found interactions between rainfall runoff and coastal flooding affecting large cities such as new york houston galveston and jacksonville florida orton et al 2012 recorded negative bias in predicted water levels when neglecting freshwater inputs for 2011 hurricane irene in the new york city metropolitan area additional studies in the hudson river orton et al 2015 orton et al 2018 continue to elucidate the importance of mechanism 3 flooding particularly in more upstream regions along a tidal river for houston galveston ray et al 2011 compared the effects of steady versus unsteady hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system models forced with storm surge boundary conditions and found important effects of timing of the peak storm surge and peak runoff in 2008 hurricane ike torres et al 2015 investigated tc forcing of storm surge and rainfall runoff specifically for the houston ship channel under 2008 hurricane ike 2012 hurricane isaac and 2005 hurricane katrina conditions using shifted landfall locations when utilizing a coupled hydrology hydrodynamic framework for their analysis a typically small lag time less than 24 h between peak storm surge and peak rainfall runoff was observed indicating the potential for peak on peak flooding to occur under slightly shifted tc conditions torres et al 2015 also determined that the location and angle of approach of tcs played an important role in the spatial distribution of precipitation and the associated runoff processes near jacksonville florida bacopoulos et al 2017 remarked that watershed runoff added 0 5 m to storm tide elevation in the lower st johns river and increased the inundated area by nearly 50 during 2008 tropical storm fay the wide geographic distribution of the collection of studies presented above demonstrates the potential importance of mechanism 3 flooding across the atlantic and gulf coasts in each study where interactions between tc rainfall runoff and storm surge were simulated the effectiveness of modeling the interactions relied on the accuracy of the rainfall runoff hydrographs generated both in magnitude and in timing while varied methods were used for routing runoff downstream each method required accurate precipitation inputs as a prerequisite for adequately reproducing the observed runoff hydrographs when hindcasting these events modelers have the benefit of observed data for precipitation in many forms from rain gage data to radar reflectivity from these data rainfall hyetographs can be synthesized to provide appropriate boundary conditions to hydrologic and hydraulic models allowing reasonably accurate recreation of flooding from both rainfall runoff and storm surge contributions during past tc events however in typical coastal flood risk study methodologies use of only historical data from particular past tcs as in the empirical simulation technique est scheffner et al 1999 can fail to predict water levels generated by different tc parameters than observed such as a different storm size angle of approach or intensity by the use of historical data alone an insufficient sample size can introduce too large of a sample error to adequately reproduce flood risk toro et al 2010 divoky and resio 2007 as an alternative to the est s use of historical storm parameters the joint probability method jpm myers 1975 develops a joint probability distribution of surge from the probability distributions of individual storm parameters typically intensity size angle of approach forward speed and landfall location a large number of hydrodynamic simulations is computed using the various combinations of parameters to approximate the multiple integral of the joint probability density function and establish a relationship between the parameters and the expected storm surge toro et al 2010 the large number of simulations required to integrate numerically by brute force is the main limitation of the jpm method to reduce the amount of expensive computation necessary to solve the jpm problem by brute force with high fidelity hydrodynamic models e g adcirc the advanced circulation model by luettich and westerink 2004 optimum sampling os methods were developed by resio 2007 and further elucidated in toro et al 2010 these os methods use either bayesian quadrature or response surface methods to approximate the jpm integral and the methods substantially reduce the amount of computation required to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy in the test of os methods in toro et al 2010 surge results from 156 runs necessary for using os response surface and 158 runs for using os bayesian quadrature were each compared with 2967 runs needed to solve the jpm integral by brute force a savings of 95 and mean differences in surge were found near zero with standard deviations of about 0 15 m 0 5 ft the authors of that study also note that additional refinement of models and an increase in parameter dimensionality will be needed to further reduce uncertainty in surge modeling further increasing computational burdens due to the curse of dimensionality although the addition of rainfall runoff processes will incrementally increase the computational cost of each run of coupled runoff surge models compared with surge only models it is important to avoid exponential increases in computational cost of total runs required to solve the jpm integral that would be caused by increasing the number of simulation parameters inducing the curse of dimensionality an ideal situation would be gaining the ability to include rainfall runoff processes without requiring any additional parameters at all fortunately several parametric models exist for the spatial and temporal distribution of rain in tcs some of which use only parameters that are already used in the jpm integral to date many one to one comparisons of parametric models have been carried out in some cases against more dynamical than statistical models see tuleya et al 2007 marchok et al 2007 henceforth m7 but a single study has not aggregated all four of them to the authors knowledge therefore the objective of the current study is to compare precipitation fields produced by four existing parametric tc rainfall models and then to select the most appropriate model for inclusion in future combined flooding studies in order to accomplish this objective selected parametric tc rainfall models are used to simulate rainfall for atlantic tcs from 2004 to 2017 and skill metrics are calculated for each model based on the resulting storm total rainfall per m7 the models are then compared using each of the seven skill indices which relate to the three key rainfall model characteristics established in m7 rainfall location pattern matching mean rainfall and rain flux distributions and extreme rain amounts 2 methodology a total of six existing parametric models for tc rainfall were identified for consideration from the literature listed below in chronological order 1 rain climatology and persistence henceforth r cliper see marks and demaria 2003 tuleya et al 2007 2 interagency performance evaluation task force ipet volume viii technical appendix 8 henceforth ipet see ipet 2006 3 parametric hurricane rainfall model henceforth phram see lonfat

model rms see grieser and jewson 2012 6 pdf precipitation climatology and persistence henceforth p cliper see geoghegan et al 2018 of the six models a criterion for inclusion in this study was either that model code be readily available for use ideally open source or could readily be reproduced from the literature the authors were unable to locate existing code for any model and the msr and rms models were not able to be reproduced from literature given the proprietary nature of the msr and rms models designed for commercial use this is not surprising therefore four models were used in this study r cliper ipet a modified version of phram and p cliper a brief description of each model is presented for the full descriptions the interested reader is referred to the original publications units for the rainfall models are shown in formulae as they appeared in the publications from which they were taken where rain rate conversions to the standard for this study millimeters per hour took place they are noted in the text where wind speeds appear units of knots abbreviated kts 1 kt 0 5144 m s are used since the wind speeds are recorded in knots in both nhc s hurdat2 best track database and colorado state university s ebtrk demuth et al 2006 2 1 r cliper the model was based on the work of lonfat et al 2004 and marks and demaria 2003 and a tc climatology from the tropical rain measurement mission trmm satellite lonfat et al 2004 microwave imagery from trmm was used to fit a curve from 482 tcs occurring globally between january 1 1998 and december 31 2002 the trmm profiles for rain rates trr were represented with several functions 1 t r r r v t 0 t m t 0 r r m r r m t m e r r m r e r r m with trr as the rain rate in inches per day necessitating a unit conversion in the current model r as the radius from the center of the tc to the point of interest v as the maximum wind speed t 0 as the rain rate at the tc center r 0 km and t m as the maximum rain rate at r r m where r m is the radius from the center at which the maximum rain rate occurs another curve fit parameter was utilized r e to specify the end behavior of the rainfall rate curves a least squares fit of the trmm radial profiles found that the parameters could be represented as linear functions of the normalized maximum wind u 2 t 0 a 1 b 1 u 3 t m a 2 b 2 u 4 r m a 3 b 3 u 5 r e a 4 b 4 u where u 1 v m 35 33 and v m is the maximum wind speed in knots the unit used historically and operationally by the national hurricane center nhc the nhc operational version of r cliper from marks and demaria 2003 used the values in table 1 for the constants the input for this model is the storm track including storm position as latitude and longitude and the maximum wind speed v max through time this corresponds to jpm os parameters of storm landfall location intensity angle of approach and forward speed total of four parameters in jpm os style it should be noted that r cliper does not have an explicit size parameter such as radius of maximum winds r max which could be used in jpm os type studies rather the size of rainfall distribution is governed solely by the storm intensity 2 2 ipet the ipet model was based on the work of lonfat et al 2004 and chen et al 2006 the model computes mean rainfall intensity m1 r Œ≤ with distance r in kilometers from the hurricane center to the point of interest and azimuth Œ≤ in degrees relative to the direction of motion two components are considered the symmetric component i e the azimuthally averaged component m i r and the asymmetric component by including a factor the symmetric component is estimated by assuming linear dependence of mean rainfall intensity at r max on the central pressure deficit Œ¥ p and fitting an exponential decay function with distance 6 m i r 1 14 0 12 Œ¥ p r r max 1 14 0 12 Œ¥ p e 0 3 r r max r max r r max with m i in millimeters per hour and Œ¥ p in millibars the asymmetric component is estimated by multiplying the symmetric mean rainfall values by 1 5 for storms passing to the left of the sub basin centroid i e the rain is 50 more intense on the right hand side of the storm appropriate for the northern hemisphere only the inputs for this model are the storm position as latitude and longitude the time the radius of maximum winds r max and the central pressure deficit Œ¥ p all parameters can therefore be derived from the nhc storm track the parameters correspond to the typical five jpm os parameters of landfall location intensity angle of approach storm size and forward speed this model is more flexible in its ability to represent storms of varying size by including r max this capability comes at the cost of a fifth parameter storm size however storm size is typically used in current jpm os studies already ipet 2006 2 3 phram this model uses the rain rate estimates from r cliper as a base and in its original formulation adds two components to account for asymmetry based on vertical wind shear and orographic effects 7 r phram r r c l i p e r r shear mod r topography based on lonfat et al 2007 the shear modification had an insignificant improving effect on equitable threat score ets for 2004 atlantic landfalling storms while incorporating both the topography and shear components resulted in significant ets improvements across all rainfall thresholds given the additive nature of this model it would seem that at least for the 2004 atlantic landfalling storms ignoring the shear component altogether might not have significant impact on rainfall estimates grieser and jewson 2012 came to a similar conclusion and favored using orographic effects while parameterizing asymmetric rainfall re distribution using storm motion rather than shear fields therefore the rain rates were calculated in this study by the following formula 8 r phram r r c l i p e r r topography this modified version of the original phram methodology is still referred to as phram through the remainder of the text in order to include the topography component it was necessary to calculate the elevation gradient vector which points in the steepest downslope direction for each location in the simulation domain once in pre processing and also to calculate vector components of wind at each station for each timestep the elevation gradients were calculated using the slope and aspect tools in esri arcgis based on a raster dataset of elevation the slope tool was used to generate the magnitude of the slope in percent rise which was divided by 100 to achieve a dimensionless slope the aspect tool was used to determine the direction of the steepest downhill slope relative to north as 0 degrees and increasing clockwise the original development of phram used 10 km resolution elevation information due to the large geographic areas covered so the same resolution of 10 km digital elevation models dem was used for this study furthermore a vector wind was also needed to estimate the orographic lifting component of rainfall 9 r topography c v s h s c w c v s h s cos Œ∏ where c proportionality constant v s 10 m vector wind field m s h s gradient of elevation dimensionless w orography induced updraft and Œ∏ angle between downslope direction and wind direction found in calculations as wind direction angle minus the downslope direction angle in degrees according to grieser and jewson 2012 c varies whether the wind is propagating upslope or downslope such that the orographic component r topography is as follows 10 r topography l i f t m 100 m r r c l i p e r 1 s l o p e cos Œ∏ r r c l i p e r upslope v s h s is negative i e Œ∏ 90 l i f t m 20 m r r c l i p e r 0 2 s l o p e r r c l i p e r cos Œ∏ downslope v s h s is positive i e Œ∏ 90 where lift is defined as the elevation of the location in question minus the elevation of the steepest downslope point in meters and slope is the dimensionless change in elevation per distance as calculated in arcgis by taking one hundredth of the percent grade between two points this would correspond to a tenfold increase in rain for a lift of 900 m when including the original rainfall additively the reason given by lonfat et al 2007 for the different upslope and downslope coefficients is to avoid negative rainfall solutions in the downslope regions and this limitation is recognized in the case distinction a further limitation is that c was calculated based on an elevation resolution of 10 km and c would therefore need to be recalculated if a different resolution for elevation data were selected inputs for the modified phram model are the same as in r cliper except that a storm size parameter r max is also required this storm parameter is not used directly for simulating rainfall but it is instead used to simulate the vector components of wind throughout the storm in a parametric wind model similar to that used in adcirc with their nws parameter set as 8 holland 1980 fleming et al 2008 the component of wind being forced up or down slope was used to compute orographic adjustments to rainfall to account for topography a dem for the study area was necessary to calculate slope and aspect but the dem is not a parameter per se for jpm os studies in the sense that it does not vary according to a defined probability distribution implying that it would not change from scenario to scenario therefore tc rainfall can be simulated using the modified no shear phram with the same five jpm os parameters as ipet 2 4 p cliper microwave imagery from trmm was used to fit curves from 482 storms occurring globally between january 1 1998 and december 31 2002 for three intensity classifications tropical storms 34 63 kts category 1 2 intensity 64 95 kts and category 3 5 intensity 95 kts since r cliper lonfat et al 2004 marks and demaria 2003 was built to generate mean rainfall intensities only p cliper was based around modifying the curve fits from r cliper with exponential functions to reflect potential deviations from mean rainfall intensities by using a frequency f as an integer between 90 and 90 to scale the results the equations are tropical storm ts intensity 11 r r f a e bf

10 1 r 14 25059433 e bf r 30 k m a 10 943440 b 0 018433 according to one of the authors of the p cliper model in their original manuscript the value 14 25059433 in the cat345 curve fit was incorrectly transcribed as 1 425059433 and should be substituted where appropriate kevin geoghegan personal communication 2018 the a values represent the rainfall rates at the center of the storm r 0 km from the curve fits in marks and demaria 2003 while b values were derived for geoghegan et al 2018 the derivation was not shown in their publication it is important to note that a conversion from inches per day in marks and demaria to millimeters per hour in geoghegan et al has taken place all rain rates calculated in this study are reported in units of millimeters per hour since over the history of a storm the intensity was allowed to change the model as implemented selects the appropriate equation to use at each timestep based on the current storm intensity in order to ensure uniformity of comparisons when the intensity fluctuates and to avoid spurious rainfall when a storm transitions rapidly between intensity classifications but not necessarily size a uniform cutoff value of r 370 km was used because this was the smallest cutoff of the three equations for r 370 km the rainfall rate was considered zero c f geoghegan et al 2018 which used a cutoff of 350 km the inputs for this model are the storm position as latitude and longitude the time the maximum wind speed v max and the departure from the average rainfall intensity frequency f this adds an additional parameter for frequency but since there is no explicit size parameter in p cliper there are still only five parameters needed for rainfall simulations the same as the number of standard five jpm os parameters 2 5 development of code and comparison of model inputs each of the four models was coded into a python script for simulation of tc rain given various storm tracks storm track files and a comma separated list of latitude longitude pairs at which to develop rainfall hyetographs station files the resulting python script is available from the authors of this study upon request a table of the inputs required is shown in table 2 a uniform timestep of 15 min was used for all calculations in this study since it was the greatest common factor between typical timesteps used in the constituent tc rainfall parametric models each rainfall model simulates the rainfall rate at a given point in space at a particular time step during any one time step the rainfall rates are simulated at every point in the computational grid and a time history of the resulting rainfall rates is written for each grid point output produced therefore includes time varying hyetographs at grid locations as comma separated value files and as graphical representations produced using the matplotlib python module for simulations run using the modified phram model wind time history files are also written as output 2 6 grid development to set the computational grid extents the storm tracks from 1988 to 2017 were imported from the colorado state university extended best track database demuth et al 2006 henceforth ebtrk into arcgis based on the validity extents of the models proposed above these tracks were first transformed from discrete points to continuous lines which were then buffered outwards 500 km the region defined by this buffer truncated on the east by the 60 w meridian was used for setting all grid extents and is shown in fig 1 the grid resolution was set as 0 1 degrees in both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions as a first step a total of 222 327 points were needed to cover the domain in fig 1 at 0 1 degree spacing the generalized bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2015 elevation raster which incorporates shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 meter data over land was used for elevation calculations prior to calculating the aspect and slope of the elevation grid points the elevation raster was resampled to a 10 km spacing per lonfat et al 2007 the slope and aspect values are used in the phram calculation to determine orographic effects from topography the spine of the appalachian mountains and the mountainous regions of mexico can cause substantial orographic effects due to their relatively higher slope values though only represented as 12 18 at 10 km resolution 2 7 storm track preparation in order to evaluate and compare the four rainfall models a library of the 221 tc tracks affecting the atlantic basin from 2004 to 2017 was retrieved from the ebtrk database demuth et al 2006 the ebtrk database improves upon the standard hurdat2 format by including information on radius to maximum winds which is necessary for the methodology proposed herein the rainfall models require position forward speed approach angle given as latitude longitude pairs through time at 6 hour intervals intensity either as central pressure deficit Œ¥ p or maximum winds v max and storm size given as radius of maximum winds r max the 6 hourly positions were spline interpolated to 15 minute intervals the central pressure deficit was defined as 14 Œ¥ p p o c i m s l p while the majority of the pressure information from ebtrk was readily converted to central pressure deficits using the adcirc convention of far field pressure as 1013 mbar mb some recorded central pressures were greater than 1013 mb 103 records 27 unique storms and were defined as 1013 mb to be consistent with climatological means for the atlantic missing central pressure deficit records were persisted from the closest timestep for which data was available while the majority of the r max information was provided in the database some gaps existed but needed to be filled prior to modeling the rainfall with either ipet or phram if no r max information had been recorded for the storm before after a given timestep the r max at the first last available timestep was persisted backwards forwards to fill the gaps when data was available both prior to and following a missing data point linear interpolation in time was used the r max gap filling methodology is potentially flawed if a storm undergoes extratropical transition and dramatically changes shape e g 2012 hurricane sandy since 83 of the original 221 storms undergo extratropical transition at some point during their track further study is necessary to determine the impacts on precipitation of the 221 atlantic tcs from 2004 to 2017 only 67 produced rainfall over the continental united states conus while the storms best tracks were recorded by nhc this approach neglected storms not producing rainfall over conus and it also removed the influence of eastern pacific tcs affecting conus it is also the reason that two 2015 atlantic tcs were excluded while ts erika 2015 and ts grace 2015 both have rainfall attributed to conus from their remnants the nhc tracks do not extend into the time period during which the rain fell so these storms were removed from consideration by the current methodology to consider storms where the nhc track ended before the rainfall record the storm tracks were truncated to ensure that only the inclusive time where both rain and nhc track were defined was simulated for rainfall comparisons these truncations are unlikely to affect landfall statistics except when a storm s nhc track ends before the system comes ashore but they may have substantial impacts on the total rainfall statistics later in the storms lifetimes after landfall of the 67 storms affecting conus with rainfall while having a defined nhc track 20 30 have both modelled and observed rain which potentially occurred but has been truncated from the analysis since the rain occurred prior to nhc defining a track for the storm similarly 54 of the 67 storms affecting conus with rainfall have some rainfall truncated from the end of both the modelled and observed scenarios due to the storm persisting and continuing to produce rainfall after nhc tracking responsibility ceased the controlling data availability for each of the simulated storms is shown in table 3 2 8 observed data in order to compare the models capability of reproducing observed rainfall patterns the national stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates qpe files for conus were downloaded from the university corporation for atmospheric research ucar ucar maintains the stage iv qpe for the period of record from 2002 through the present in standard gridded binary grib1 and grib2 format at 1 hour 6 hour and 24 hour intervals lin 2011 6 hourly grib files covering the appropriate dates from 2004 to 2017 were downloaded and converted to the grib2 format if necessary although these observations are originally on the polar stereographic hydrologic rainfall analysis projection hrap reed and maidment 1999 grid they were interpolated to 0 1 degree resolution on a regularly spaced latitude longitude grid to roughly match the resolution used by lonfat et al 2007 and by m7 this was accomplished using the wgrib tools by wesley ebisuzaki available from http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley wgrib html a budget interpolation scheme was used to preserve the integral of rain flux when changing grid resolutions as opposed to a bilinear interpolation of point maximum values after careful analysis of overlap of storm track and rainfall affecting conus the appropriate 6 hourly files to sum for each storm were aggregated into storm total observed precipitation datasets 2 9 model runs after the storm track and grid inputs had been prepared along with the observed data 10 runs of each storm were computed for a total of 670 runs 1 for each storm using r cliper 1 for each storm using ipet 1 for each storm using phram 7 for each storm using p cliper varying f over 90 60 30 0 30 60 and 90 the variation of f was intended to explore the full range of possibilities for the p cliper model no calibration of f or any other parameter is undertaken in this study instead the models are used with the parameters originally published by their respective authors as optimized during their respective model developments 2 10 statistical measures of model skill using the storm total rainfall for grid points within 10 km of land thereby ignoring rain over open ocean metrics of model skill were calculated for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs in table 3 per m7 these metrics and the attribute of the precipitation field measured are summarized in table 4 adapted from m7 each metric is defined in detail in m7 in order to calculate equitable threat score ets contingency tables were calculated for the number of hits misses false alarms and correct rejections that each model made regarding storm total rainfall above a certain threshold definitions for each term are shown in the mock contingency table table 5 3 results model skill scores based on the metrics in table 4 are presented for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs producing rainfall over conus remarks about the ability of each model to capture the rainfall produced by a tc like 2017 hurricane harvey are also presented 3 1 2004 2017 atlantic tcs affecting conus 3 1 1 pattern matching the ability of each model to match locations of storm total rainfall was evaluated using the equitable threat score and correlation between rain patterns to estimate effects of grid resolution on results in a hydrologic fashion the storm total rainfall values were budget interpolated from the original 0 1 degree resolution to hydrologic unit code huc 10 areas near the coastline shown in fig 2 the average huc 10 area covered approximately 550 square kilometers while the original resolution covered about 105 square kilometers per cell area plots of ets for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs producing rain over conus at grid points within 500 km of each storm track are shown in fig 3 which is divided into two panels representing the two grid resolutions regularly spaced 0 1 degree resolution and irregularly spaced huc 10 units near the coastline the rainfall thresholds for the ets plots in fig 3 and all subsequent figures were as specified in m7 using the decibel rain rate dbr in inches 15 dbr 10 log 10 r where r is the value of the rain flux threshold and dbr takes values over 30 10 9 8 7 13 14 15 these thresholds were converted to millimeters for this study with regards to large scale ets the ipet model outperforms any other model as storm total rainfall threshold increases above 76 2 mm 3 in on both high and low resolutions the phram results are very similar to r cliper this indicates that the additional computational expense incurred by using phram may not yield substantially better results for the 2004 2017 climatology on average there is considerable increase in ets when relaxing the location dependency by interpolating data to the coarser huc10 grid for example at a rainfall threshold of 127 3 mm 5 in the ets for ipet is 0 16 in panel a of fig 3 the high resolution portion while the ets for ipet improves to 0 27 in panel b of fig 3 the low resolution huc 10 evaluation based on frequency bias average of 1 25 over all rain thresholds compared with 0 48 for r cliper plot not shown ipet appears to consistently over predict the rates of occurrence of rain above given thresholds of storm total rainfall p cliper with f 30 60 and 90 are the only models in this study producing storm total amounts in excess of 506 7 mm 20 in the location based correlations between modeled and observed storm total rain were also calculated plots of the absolute value of the individual storm total pearson correlations with the observed totals are shown in fig 4 ipet produces mixed results when correlating observed data with simulated it has the highest correlation of all models for 46 of cases 31 of 67 but also the lowest correlation of all models for 39 of cases 26 of 67 it should be noted that only 67 cases are presented here 2010 hurricane igor which produced 238 mm rainfall over 48 h in st lawrence newfoundland was present in the wpc analyses but was outside the coverage of the stage iv observed product when considering all storms together the correlation coefficients are presented in fig 5 in the overall case the ipet model produces results that are significantly more correlated with observed data than any other model based upon non overlap of the 99 confidence intervals for pearson correlation there is no significant difference in correlation among p cliper variants of f 0 30 60 and 90 while p cliper with f 30 and r cliper are correlated similarly to each other phram and p cliper with f 60 tie for fourth place while p cliper with the low value of f 90 is the least correlated to the observed data 3 1 2 mean rainfall and rain flux distributions in order to compare each model s ability to produce heavy medium and light rainfall amounts at varying radii the mean storm total rainfall was plotted as a function of radius from the track of the tc center in fig 6 in the inner core region p cliper with f 90 produces values approximately ten times greater than observed indicating the severity of the maximum rainfall p cliper can produce for radii less than 250 km the observed values fall between the p cliper curves f 0 and f 30 indicating that the single f value providing the best fit to the observed mean storm total rainfall profile for 2004 2017 would be represented by a positive f value in that range however as radii increases beyond 370 km p cliper was not configured to produce rainfall while the observed profile continues to produce 15 20 mm similar to earlier observations based on frequency bias the ipet model tends to over predict storm total rainfall at radii less than 425 km beyond 425 km ipet also under predicts storm total rainfall r cliper and phram have a pronounced low bias in mean storm total rainfall at all radii the mean rainfall distribution of each model was used to calculate the mean rainfall error index mrei over each 20 km band out to 400 km as in m7 since this study focuses on ability to simulate tc rainfall runoff flooding processes the total rain volume produced in each storm was calculated and plotted in fig 7 p cliper variants were not plotted due to their large range of volumes attainable by tuning f sufficiently large or small using p cliper the lowest non zero value of volume for a given storm was 0 02 cubic kilometers in 2009 ts bill with f 90 and the highest volume produced was up to 158 63 cubic kilometers in 2008 ts fay with f 90 it should also be noted that in this study ts fay was simulated for 258 h which is in the 94th percentile of simulation lengths for storms in this study equaled or surpassed only by simulating 2004 hurricane ivan for 258 h 2005 hurricane dennis for 258 h and 2005 hurricane ophelia for 270 h the length of simulation may play an outsized role in storm total rainfall when using p cliper in addition to by storm volumes the average case including all storms was also computed to elucidate any consistent biases in rain volume and is shown in table 6 overall the ipet model and p cliper models with f 30 produce too much rainfall volume on average from as little as 18 high bias to producing almost six times the observed volume the other models including phram and r cliper produce far too little rainfall volume in the average case with typical low bias for phram and r cliper indicating a failure to predict nearly half the rainfall volume for engineering purposes it is preferable to use a model which is biased slightly higher rather than lower when forced to choose between two models in order to ensure conservative results so the ipet model would be selected based on the rainfall volume basis alternatively since p cliper can be tuned to nearly any desired volume as shown by the wide range of bias 95 to 483 of observed in table 6 the p cliper model could be selected for its ability to match historical observations and development of an appropriate site specific distribution of f would be necessary it is also important to note that while the total volume may be predicted fairly well by some models in certain storms e g ipet in 2017 harvey fig 7 the placement of this rain volume is also paramount to accurate flood predictions so the previous location based metrics of ets and pattern correlation should also be considered in order to compare the relative occurrences of storm total rainfall above each threshold the probability distribution functions pdf and cumulative distribution functions cdfs of storm total rainfall are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively compared with the observed pdf ipet generally predicts slightly more frequent amounts of rainfall at each threshold p cliper variants with f greater than or equal to 30 also predict higher frequencies at thresholds above 20 2 mm 0 8 in r cliper and phram predict too much light rain below 10 mm and not enough heavier rain these trends are also evident in fig 9 the values for 50th percentile median of rain flux from the cdfs were compared from each model and the observed data the stage iv data within 500 km produced a median value at 4 5 mm and the median values for ipet and p cliper f 30 60 90 were higher than observed by up to a factor of 10 indicating a potential for producing too much rainfall at higher thresholds similarly r cliper phram and p cliper variants with f values of zero or less had median values lower than observed by as much as a factor of 10 indicating that the models produce too little rainfall in the higher thresholds the median values were used to calculate the large scale and track relative cdf median value indices as detailed in m7 the pdf and cdf of storm total rainfall were also plotted for 100 km bands ranging from 0 km to 500 km away from the storm track e g 0 100 km 300 400 km per m7 the 0 100 km band would mostly capture rain in the eyewall or its remnants with larger radii bands typically representing contributions from outer rainbands and stratiform rain the 0 100 km band pdf and cdf are shown in figs 10 and 11 in the inner core 0 100 km region the track relative cdf distributions are extremely similar to the large scale versions except that median values are generally at higher rainfall thresholds typical increase of 164 from large scale the phram r cliper models slightly over predict the low rainfall amounts below 10 mm and gradually return to under predicting the higher rainfall amounts 3 1 3 extreme rain amounts for analysis of tc rainfall runoff flooding it is also important to quantify how well each model predicts extreme rain amounts defined herein as those values in the top 5 percent of the observed cdf the deviation of the model cdf curves from the observed cdf was quantified based on the large scale cdf curves the entire portion of the domain within 500 km of each storm track and on the track relative cdfs over 100 km bands a large scale cdf curve depicting the 95th percentile storm total rainfall of each model is shown in fig 12 for the storms in this study the observed 95th percentile occurred at 75 7 mm 3 in each of the p cliper variants with f 30 did not produce any storm total rainfall above 75 7 mm 3 in which is unsurprising since geoghegan et al 2018 found best fit f values ranging from 19 to 50 for 12 tcs from 2002 through 2008 conversely for f 60 a much larger percentage of the model rainfall was above the observed 95th percentile the maximum parameter value tested of f 90 led to only 34 9 of model rainfall being less than or equal to 75 7 mm meaning that 65 1 of p cliper simulated values were above the 95th percentile of the observed data phram and r cliper in general under predicted storm total rainfall since the 75 7 mm threshold corresponded to 98 9 and 99 0 values on the cdf respectively the ipet model predicted 92 4 of storm total values at or less than the 95th percentile of the observed the closest fit by any model evaluated while still over predicting the higher rainfall amounts these cdf percentages over both large scale and track relative were translated into index values using the formulae set forth in m7 it is important to note that if a cdf did not contain the 95th percentile of the observed data at all the skill for that band was set to zero 3 1 4 combined indices a summary table of the various indices from each component of the analysis is presented in table 7 while large scale ets values were fairly poor for all models on the 0 1 degree resolution grid ipet and p cliper with f 30 performed the best these ets values improve substantially when interpolated to the huc10 units as noted above for the mean rainfall error index ipet phram r cliper and p cliper f 0 are roughly tied ipet appears to be superior when measured by each of the cdf indices whether median or 95th percentile implying that ipet produces the most similar cdf curve of the models evaluated a combined index was calculated for each of the components evaluated in this study pattern matching mean median volume measures and extreme rain amounts the index for pattern matching was found by taking the arithmetic average of the mean correlation over all storms and the rain flux weighted ets the mean median volume measures were combined into a single index by taking the arithmetic average of the mean rainfall error index the large scale cdf median value index and the track relative cdf median value index the index for extreme rain amounts was found by averaging the large scale cdf maximum index with the track relative cdf maximum index the combined indices are presented in table 8 ipet outperforms phram and r cliper on all combined metrics and ipet outperforms all variants of p cliper tested in this study on all metrics except pattern matching 3 2 2017 hurricane harvey following the devastation in harris county texas and surrounding areas due to the massive rainfall during 2017 hurricane harvey a common question is whether proposed models will be sufficient to predict events such as harvey prior to their occurrence as done for the other simulated storms simulations of tc rainfall were completed for the time period from 1200 utc aug 25 2017 through 1200 utc sep 02 2017 for reference harvey made its first texas landfall at its maximum strength of 115 kts at 0300 utc aug 26 2017 per blake and zelinsky 2018 even with the meandering track harvey followed the maximum values of rainfall produced in each model were significantly less than observed in most cases for instance compared with the observed maximum value of 1539 mm over 5 days ipet produced only as much as 479 mm and phram produced even less with a maximum of 441 mm while p cliper with f 60 was able to match the observed amount well 1459 mm about 95 of observed it places the maximum rainfall over corpus christi some 320 km southwest of the observed peak near houston on the other hand while p cliper with f 90 the maximum possible is capable of producing almost exactly the right amount of precipitation over houston 1550 mm compared with 1539 mm an insignificant error at amounts that high and therefore uncertain the scenario of f 90 dramatically oversaturates the rest of the eastern texas coast the new value of the maximum rainfall is still over corpus christi with f 90 since the placement of rain does not change with a change in f value but the value becomes 3071 mm nearly double the observed peak over houston this indicates that while p cliper is capable of producing the raw point maxima of rainfall occurring in harvey and much more it may have issues placing it in the correct location likely due to lack of physics that influenced harvey s stall and therefore its rain structure this should serve to indicate some of the potential failings of using climatological means even if modified by various factors since the governing physics is largely left out of calculations 4 conclusions and future work overall when evaluated over the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs the ipet model currently demonstrates the highest skill for reproducing tc rainfall patterns based on the combination of the measures described herein particularly because it conservatively over predicts storm total rainfall in most cases i e those with less than 508 mm 20 in storm total rainfall however it is important to realize that all statistical models presented in this study do not perform as well as the dynamical models in m7 nor even the statistical r cliper used in m7 the lack of skill in using the statistical models in this study for 2004 2017 is to be expected since the statistical phram p cliper r cliper and ipet models were all derived based on climatological mean rain rates from trmm data measured in lonfat et al 2004 spanning tcs from only 1998 2002 therefore these statistical models were expected to demonstrate higher predictive skill for the time period used in m7 which includes their training data 1998 2004 than for the completely unseen time period used in this study 2004 2017 this effect would be enhanced further under climate change considerations which increase storm total rainfall overall based mainly on projected increases in rainfall intensity at large radii in landfalling storms further increasing flood risk in large watersheds wright et al 2015 as a result the statistical models presented in this study need to be updated using more recent rainfall rate data with longer periods of record which are now available as well as take into account uncertainty due to climate change effects in their current state none of the models is recommended for direct use in coastal flood studies once the statistical models or other types of models such as those derived using artificial neural networks or other supervised machine learning techniques e g bass and bedient 2018 are updated or created based on the most recent tc rainfall data an engineering analysis of rainfall rates resulting from tcs can be undertaken the weakness of the current statistical models is underscored by the fact that for tcs producing massive amounts of precipitation such as 2017 hurricane harvey only p cliper with a substantially above average frequency f value is capable of reproducing the large storm total precipitation amounts regardless care must be taken not to overfit f values since tuning f large enough to reproduce one large peak observation may dramatically increase the total rain flux over a small or large area seriously overestimating the expected flooding from rainfall runoff improvements from using the modified no shear phram over r cliper are marginal at best for the 2004 2017 tc climatology as a whole while this study attempted to consider statistical models which used only the five parameters typically used in jpm os the addition of wind shear plays an important role in phram s skill for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs and future studies using the phram model should include wind shear as an additional parameter in their jpm integral furthermore updated ets statistics will be calculated as data become available from the 2018 tc season 2018 hurricanes florence and michael will be of particular interest a similar methodology to the study presented herein is also proposed for evaluation of tc rainfall in puerto rico given its unique exposure and aggravating factor of mountainous slopes in comparatively smaller watersheds than present in conus the model selection

5952,current flood mapping practices in the united states model both storm surge and riverine flooding in coastal regions in regions where the hazards overlap independence and non concurrence are generally assumed although recent literature has noted several cases of tropical cyclones tcs where storm surge and rainfall runoff interacted nonlinearly violating this assumption in order to evaluate the effects of the nonlinear interactions on flood risk statistics using traditional methods i e by using simulation suites of physically based flood hazard models with varied tc characteristics it is necessary to couple the rainfall runoff and storm surge components into a single simulation framework in order to accomplish this efficiently use of a parametric tc rainfall model is proposed four such models were obtained by the authors r cliper rainfall climatology and persistence ipet interagency performance evaluation task force rainfall analysis phram parametric hurricane rainfall model and p cliper pdf precipitation climatology and persistence the objective of the current study is to compare precipitation fields produced by four existing parametric tc rainfall models and then to select the most appropriate model for inclusion in future combined flooding studies meteorological skill metrics were used to evaluate rainfall models for 67 atlantic tcs affecting the united states from 2004 through 2017 of the four models evaluated the highly simplified ipet rainfall model demonstrated the most skill at reproducing storm total precipitation for thresholds above 75 mm 3 in however the skill metrics obtained indicate that none of the models is suitable for direct use in combined flooding studies at this time keywords tropical cyclones rainfall flood risk joint flooding 1 introduction while us coastal watershed counties account for less than 20 of the land area 52 of the us population resides in these counties crossett et al 2013 tropical cyclones tcs are a major contributor to the flood threat in coastal watershed counties through a variety of mechanisms 1 rainfall runoff flooding from tc rainfall 2 coastal flooding including effects of storm surge wave setup breaking waves and tides or 3 interactions between rainfall runoff and coastal effects mechanism 1 was largely to blame for inundation of harris county and houston texas during 2017 hurricane harvey as the storm produced over 1524 mm 60 in of rainfall within a 5 day period blake and zelinsky 2018 mechanism 2 was the main driver in flooding experienced in coastal areas of mississippi and louisiana during 2005 hurricane katrina when a record 8 5 meter 27 8 foot storm surge inundated pass christian mississippi knabb et al 2005 cangialosi et al 2018 note potential mechanism 3 flooding during 2017 hurricane irma when downtown miami experienced significant flooding due to the combined effects of heavy rainfall 305 mm 12 in in 48 h and inadequate drainage of urban runoff due to storm surge elevated water levels 1 2 to 1 8 m 4 to 6 feet above normal in the bay flooding by mechanism 3 has been noted in an increasing number of studies since 2010 when bunya et al 2010 and dietrich et al 2010 included riverine forcing although steady in that study in their hindcast simulations of 2005 hurricanes katrina and rita potential impacts of under prediction of water levels due to lack of rainfall runoff forcing were noted by bunya et al 2010 studies have also found interactions between rainfall runoff and coastal flooding affecting large cities such as new york houston galveston and jacksonville florida orton et al 2012 recorded negative bias in predicted water levels when neglecting freshwater inputs for 2011 hurricane irene in the new york city metropolitan area additional studies in the hudson river orton et al 2015 orton et al 2018 continue to elucidate the importance of mechanism 3 flooding particularly in more upstream regions along a tidal river for houston galveston ray et al 2011 compared the effects of steady versus unsteady hec ras hydrologic engineering center river analysis system models forced with storm surge boundary conditions and found important effects of timing of the peak storm surge and peak runoff in 2008 hurricane ike torres et al 2015 investigated tc forcing of storm surge and rainfall runoff specifically for the houston ship channel under 2008 hurricane ike 2012 hurricane isaac and 2005 hurricane katrina conditions using shifted landfall locations when utilizing a coupled hydrology hydrodynamic framework for their analysis a typically small lag time less than 24 h between peak storm surge and peak rainfall runoff was observed indicating the potential for peak on peak flooding to occur under slightly shifted tc conditions torres et al 2015 also determined that the location and angle of approach of tcs played an important role in the spatial distribution of precipitation and the associated runoff processes near jacksonville florida bacopoulos et al 2017 remarked that watershed runoff added 0 5 m to storm tide elevation in the lower st johns river and increased the inundated area by nearly 50 during 2008 tropical storm fay the wide geographic distribution of the collection of studies presented above demonstrates the potential importance of mechanism 3 flooding across the atlantic and gulf coasts in each study where interactions between tc rainfall runoff and storm surge were simulated the effectiveness of modeling the interactions relied on the accuracy of the rainfall runoff hydrographs generated both in magnitude and in timing while varied methods were used for routing runoff downstream each method required accurate precipitation inputs as a prerequisite for adequately reproducing the observed runoff hydrographs when hindcasting these events modelers have the benefit of observed data for precipitation in many forms from rain gage data to radar reflectivity from these data rainfall hyetographs can be synthesized to provide appropriate boundary conditions to hydrologic and hydraulic models allowing reasonably accurate recreation of flooding from both rainfall runoff and storm surge contributions during past tc events however in typical coastal flood risk study methodologies use of only historical data from particular past tcs as in the empirical simulation technique est scheffner et al 1999 can fail to predict water levels generated by different tc parameters than observed such as a different storm size angle of approach or intensity by the use of historical data alone an insufficient sample size can introduce too large of a sample error to adequately reproduce flood risk toro et al 2010 divoky and resio 2007 as an alternative to the est s use of historical storm parameters the joint probability method jpm myers 1975 develops a joint probability distribution of surge from the probability distributions of individual storm parameters typically intensity size angle of approach forward speed and landfall location a large number of hydrodynamic simulations is computed using the various combinations of parameters to approximate the multiple integral of the joint probability density function and establish a relationship between the parameters and the expected storm surge toro et al 2010 the large number of simulations required to integrate numerically by brute force is the main limitation of the jpm method to reduce the amount of expensive computation necessary to solve the jpm problem by brute force with high fidelity hydrodynamic models e g adcirc the advanced circulation model by luettich and westerink 2004 optimum sampling os methods were developed by resio 2007 and further elucidated in toro et al 2010 these os methods use either bayesian quadrature or response surface methods to approximate the jpm integral and the methods substantially reduce the amount of computation required to achieve acceptable levels of accuracy in the test of os methods in toro et al 2010 surge results from 156 runs necessary for using os response surface and 158 runs for using os bayesian quadrature were each compared with 2967 runs needed to solve the jpm integral by brute force a savings of 95 and mean differences in surge were found near zero with standard deviations of about 0 15 m 0 5 ft the authors of that study also note that additional refinement of models and an increase in parameter dimensionality will be needed to further reduce uncertainty in surge modeling further increasing computational burdens due to the curse of dimensionality although the addition of rainfall runoff processes will incrementally increase the computational cost of each run of coupled runoff surge models compared with surge only models it is important to avoid exponential increases in computational cost of total runs required to solve the jpm integral that would be caused by increasing the number of simulation parameters inducing the curse of dimensionality an ideal situation would be gaining the ability to include rainfall runoff processes without requiring any additional parameters at all fortunately several parametric models exist for the spatial and temporal distribution of rain in tcs some of which use only parameters that are already used in the jpm integral to date many one to one comparisons of parametric models have been carried out in some cases against more dynamical than statistical models see tuleya et al 2007 marchok et al 2007 henceforth m7 but a single study has not aggregated all four of them to the authors knowledge therefore the objective of the current study is to compare precipitation fields produced by four existing parametric tc rainfall models and then to select the most appropriate model for inclusion in future combined flooding studies in order to accomplish this objective selected parametric tc rainfall models are used to simulate rainfall for atlantic tcs from 2004 to 2017 and skill metrics are calculated for each model based on the resulting storm total rainfall per m7 the models are then compared using each of the seven skill indices which relate to the three key rainfall model characteristics established in m7 rainfall location pattern matching mean rainfall and rain flux distributions and extreme rain amounts 2 methodology a total of six existing parametric models for tc rainfall were identified for consideration from the literature listed below in chronological order 1 rain climatology and persistence henceforth r cliper see marks and demaria 2003 tuleya et al 2007 2 interagency performance evaluation task force ipet volume viii technical appendix 8 henceforth ipet see ipet 2006 3 parametric hurricane rainfall model henceforth phram see lonfat et al 2007 this model was modified by jtb to not include shear but only topographic effects 4 modified smith for rainfall msr see langousis and veneziano 2009 5 risk management solutions ltd tc rain model rms see grieser and jewson 2012 6 pdf precipitation climatology and persistence henceforth p cliper see geoghegan et al 2018 of the six models a criterion for inclusion in this study was either that model code be readily available for use ideally open source or could readily be reproduced from the literature the authors were unable to locate existing code for any model and the msr and rms models were not able to be reproduced from literature given the proprietary nature of the msr and rms models designed for commercial use this is not surprising therefore four models were used in this study r cliper ipet a modified version of phram and p cliper a brief description of each model is presented for the full descriptions the interested reader is referred to the original publications units for the rainfall models are shown in formulae as they appeared in the publications from which they were taken where rain rate conversions to the standard for this study millimeters per hour took place they are noted in the text where wind speeds appear units of knots abbreviated kts 1 kt 0 5144 m s are used since the wind speeds are recorded in knots in both nhc s hurdat2 best track database and colorado state university s ebtrk demuth et al 2006 2 1 r cliper the model was based on the work of lonfat et al 2004 and marks and demaria 2003 and a tc climatology from the tropical rain measurement mission trmm satellite lonfat et al 2004 microwave imagery from trmm was used to fit a curve from 482 tcs occurring globally between january 1 1998 and december 31 2002 the trmm profiles for rain rates trr were represented with several functions 1 t r r r v t 0 t m t 0 r r m r r m t m e r r m r e r r m with trr as the rain rate in inches per day necessitating a unit conversion in the current model r as the radius from the center of the tc to the point of interest v as the maximum wind speed t 0 as the rain rate at the tc center r 0 km and t m as the maximum rain rate at r r m where r m is the radius from the center at which the maximum rain rate occurs another curve fit parameter was utilized r e to specify the end behavior of the rainfall rate curves a least squares fit of the trmm radial profiles found that the parameters could be represented as linear functions of the normalized maximum wind u 2 t 0 a 1 b 1 u 3 t m a 2 b 2 u 4 r m a 3 b 3 u 5 r e a 4 b 4 u where u 1 v m 35 33 and v m is the maximum wind speed in knots the unit used historically and operationally by the national hurricane center nhc the nhc operational version of r cliper from marks and demaria 2003 used the values in table 1 for the constants the input for this model is the storm track including storm position as latitude and longitude and the maximum wind speed v max through time this corresponds to jpm os parameters of storm landfall location intensity angle of approach and forward speed total of four parameters in jpm os style it should be noted that r cliper does not have an explicit size parameter such as radius of maximum winds r max which could be used in jpm os type studies rather the size of rainfall distribution is governed solely by the storm intensity 2 2 ipet the ipet model was based on the work of lonfat et al 2004 and chen et al 2006 the model computes mean rainfall intensity m1 r Œ≤ with distance r in kilometers from the hurricane center to the point of interest and azimuth Œ≤ in degrees relative to the direction of motion two components are considered the symmetric component i e the azimuthally averaged component m i r and the asymmetric component by including a factor the symmetric component is estimated by assuming linear dependence of mean rainfall intensity at r max on the central pressure deficit Œ¥ p and fitting an exponential decay function with distance 6 m i r 1 14 0 12 Œ¥ p r r max 1 14 0 12 Œ¥ p e 0 3 r r max r max r r max with m i in millimeters per hour and Œ¥ p in millibars the asymmetric component is estimated by multiplying the symmetric mean rainfall values by 1 5 for storms passing to the left of the sub basin centroid i e the rain is 50 more intense on the right hand side of the storm appropriate for the northern hemisphere only the inputs for this model are the storm position as latitude and longitude the time the radius of maximum winds r max and the central pressure deficit Œ¥ p all parameters can therefore be derived from the nhc storm track the parameters correspond to the typical five jpm os parameters of landfall location intensity angle of approach storm size and forward speed this model is more flexible in its ability to represent storms of varying size by including r max this capability comes at the cost of a fifth parameter storm size however storm size is typically used in current jpm os studies already ipet 2006 2 3 phram this model uses the rain rate estimates from r cliper as a base and in its original formulation adds two components to account for asymmetry based on vertical wind shear and orographic effects 7 r phram r r c l i p e r r shear mod r topography based on lonfat et al 2007 the shear modification had an insignificant improving effect on equitable threat score ets for 2004 atlantic landfalling storms while incorporating both the topography and shear components resulted in significant ets improvements across all rainfall thresholds given the additive nature of this model it would seem that at least for the 2004 atlantic landfalling storms ignoring the shear component altogether might not have significant impact on rainfall estimates grieser and jewson 2012 came to a similar conclusion and favored using orographic effects while parameterizing asymmetric rainfall re distribution using storm motion rather than shear fields therefore the rain rates were calculated in this study by the following formula 8 r phram r r c l i p e r r topography this modified version of the original phram methodology is still referred to as phram through the remainder of the text in order to include the topography component it was necessary to calculate the elevation gradient vector which points in the steepest downslope direction for each location in the simulation domain once in pre processing and also to calculate vector components of wind at each station for each timestep the elevation gradients were calculated using the slope and aspect tools in esri arcgis based on a raster dataset of elevation the slope tool was used to generate the magnitude of the slope in percent rise which was divided by 100 to achieve a dimensionless slope the aspect tool was used to determine the direction of the steepest downhill slope relative to north as 0 degrees and increasing clockwise the original development of phram used 10 km resolution elevation information due to the large geographic areas covered so the same resolution of 10 km digital elevation models dem was used for this study furthermore a vector wind was also needed to estimate the orographic lifting component of rainfall 9 r topography c v s h s c w c v s h s cos Œ∏ where c proportionality constant v s 10 m vector wind field m s h s gradient of elevation dimensionless w orography induced updraft and Œ∏ angle between downslope direction and wind direction found in calculations as wind direction angle minus the downslope direction angle in degrees according to grieser and jewson 2012 c varies whether the wind is propagating upslope or downslope such that the orographic component r topography is as follows 10 r topography l i f t m 100 m r r c l i p e r 1 s l o p e cos Œ∏ r r c l i p e r upslope v s h s is negative i e Œ∏ 90 l i f t m 20 m r r c l i p e r 0 2 s l o p e r r c l i p e r cos Œ∏ downslope v s h s is positive i e Œ∏ 90 where lift is defined as the elevation of the location in question minus the elevation of the steepest downslope point in meters and slope is the dimensionless change in elevation per distance as calculated in arcgis by taking one hundredth of the percent grade between two points this would correspond to a tenfold increase in rain for a lift of 900 m when including the original rainfall additively the reason given by lonfat et al 2007 for the different upslope and downslope coefficients is to avoid negative rainfall solutions in the downslope regions and this limitation is recognized in the case distinction a further limitation is that c was calculated based on an elevation resolution of 10 km and c would therefore need to be recalculated if a different resolution for elevation data were selected inputs for the modified phram model are the same as in r cliper except that a storm size parameter r max is also required this storm parameter is not used directly for simulating rainfall but it is instead used to simulate the vector components of wind throughout the storm in a parametric wind model similar to that used in adcirc with their nws parameter set as 8 holland 1980 fleming et al 2008 the component of wind being forced up or down slope was used to compute orographic adjustments to rainfall to account for topography a dem for the study area was necessary to calculate slope and aspect but the dem is not a parameter per se for jpm os studies in the sense that it does not vary according to a defined probability distribution implying that it would not change from scenario to scenario therefore tc rainfall can be simulated using the modified no shear phram with the same five jpm os parameters as ipet 2 4 p cliper microwave imagery from trmm was used to fit curves from 482 storms occurring globally between january 1 1998 and december 31 2002 for three intensity classifications tropical storms 34 63 kts category 1 2 intensity 64 95 kts and category 3 5 intensity 95 kts since r cliper lonfat et al 2004 marks and demaria 2003 was built to generate mean rainfall intensities only p cliper was based around modifying the curve fits from r cliper with exponential functions to reflect potential deviations from mean rainfall intensities by using a frequency f as an integer between 90 and 90 to scale the results the equations are tropical storm ts intensity 11 r r f a e bf

10 1 r 14 25059433 e bf r 30 k m a 10 943440 b 0 018433 according to one of the authors of the p cliper model in their original manuscript the value 14 25059433 in the cat345 curve fit was incorrectly transcribed as 1 425059433 and should be substituted where appropriate kevin geoghegan personal communication 2018 the a values represent the rainfall rates at the center of the storm r 0 km from the curve fits in marks and demaria 2003 while b values were derived for geoghegan et al 2018 the derivation was not shown in their publication it is important to note that a conversion from inches per day in marks and demaria to millimeters per hour in geoghegan et al has taken place all rain rates calculated in this study are reported in units of millimeters per hour since over the history of a storm the intensity was allowed to change the model as implemented selects the appropriate equation to use at each timestep based on the current storm intensity in order to ensure uniformity of comparisons when the intensity fluctuates and to avoid spurious rainfall when a storm transitions rapidly between intensity classifications but not necessarily size a uniform cutoff value of r 370 km was used because this was the smallest cutoff of the three equations for r 370 km the rainfall rate was considered zero c f geoghegan et al 2018 which used a cutoff of 350 km the inputs for this model are the storm position as latitude and longitude the time the maximum wind speed v max and the departure from the average rainfall intensity frequency f this adds an additional parameter for frequency but since there is no explicit size parameter in p cliper there are still only five parameters needed for rainfall simulations the same as the number of standard five jpm os parameters 2 5 development of code and comparison of model inputs each of the four models was coded into a python script for simulation of tc rain given various storm tracks storm track files and a comma separated list of latitude longitude pairs at which to develop rainfall hyetographs station files the resulting python script is available from the authors of this study upon request a table of the inputs required is shown in table 2 a uniform timestep of 15 min was used for all calculations in this study since it was the greatest common factor between typical timesteps used in the constituent tc rainfall parametric models each rainfall model simulates the rainfall rate at a given point in space at a particular time step during any one time step the rainfall rates are simulated at every point in the computational grid and a time history of the resulting rainfall rates is written for each grid point output produced therefore includes time varying hyetographs at grid locations as comma separated value files and as graphical representations produced using the matplotlib python module for simulations run using the modified phram model wind time history files are also written as output 2 6 grid development to set the computational grid extents the storm tracks from 1988 to 2017 were imported from the colorado state university extended best track database demuth et al 2006 henceforth ebtrk into arcgis based on the validity extents of the models proposed above these tracks were first transformed from discrete points to continuous lines which were then buffered outwards 500 km the region defined by this buffer truncated on the east by the 60 w meridian was used for setting all grid extents and is shown in fig 1 the grid resolution was set as 0 1 degrees in both the longitudinal and latitudinal directions as a first step a total of 222 327 points were needed to cover the domain in fig 1 at 0 1 degree spacing the generalized bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco 2015 elevation raster which incorporates shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 meter data over land was used for elevation calculations prior to calculating the aspect and slope of the elevation grid points the elevation raster was resampled to a 10 km spacing per lonfat et al 2007 the slope and aspect values are used in the phram calculation to determine orographic effects from topography the spine of the appalachian mountains and the mountainous regions of mexico can cause substantial orographic effects due to their relatively higher slope values though only represented as 12 18 at 10 km resolution 2 7 storm track preparation in order to evaluate and compare the four rainfall models a library of the 221 tc tracks affecting the atlantic basin from 2004 to 2017 was retrieved from the ebtrk database demuth et al 2006 the ebtrk database improves upon the standard hurdat2 format by including information on radius to maximum winds which is necessary for the methodology proposed herein the rainfall models require position forward speed approach angle given as latitude longitude pairs through time at 6 hour intervals intensity either as central pressure deficit Œ¥ p or maximum winds v max and storm size given as radius of maximum winds r max the 6 hourly positions were spline interpolated to 15 minute intervals the central pressure deficit was defined as 14 Œ¥ p p o c i m s l p while the majority of the pressure information from ebtrk was readily converted to central pressure deficits using the adcirc convention of far field pressure as 1013 mbar mb some recorded central pressures were greater than 1013 mb 103 records 27 unique storms and were defined as 1013 mb to be consistent with climatological means for the atlantic missing central pressure deficit records were persisted from the closest timestep for which data was available while the majority of the r max information was provided in the database some gaps existed but needed to be filled prior to modeling the rainfall with either ipet or phram if no r max information had been recorded for the storm before after a given timestep the r max at the first last available timestep was persisted backwards forwards to fill the gaps when data was available both prior to and following a missing data point linear interpolation in time was used the r max gap filling methodology is potentially flawed if a storm undergoes extratropical transition and dramatically changes shape e g 2012 hurricane sandy since 83 of the original 221 storms undergo extratropical transition at some point during their track further study is necessary to determine the impacts on precipitation of the 221 atlantic tcs from 2004 to 2017 only 67 produced rainfall over the continental united states conus while the storms best tracks were recorded by nhc this approach neglected storms not producing rainfall over conus and it also removed the influence of eastern pacific tcs affecting conus it is also the reason that two 2015 atlantic tcs were excluded while ts erika 2015 and ts grace 2015 both have rainfall attributed to conus from their remnants the nhc tracks do not extend into the time period during which the rain fell so these storms were removed from consideration by the current methodology to consider storms where the nhc track ended before the rainfall record the storm tracks were truncated to ensure that only the inclusive time where both rain and nhc track were defined was simulated for rainfall comparisons these truncations are unlikely to affect landfall statistics except when a storm s nhc track ends before the system comes ashore but they may have substantial impacts on the total rainfall statistics later in the storms lifetimes after landfall of the 67 storms affecting conus with rainfall while having a defined nhc track 20 30 have both modelled and observed rain which potentially occurred but has been truncated from the analysis since the rain occurred prior to nhc defining a track for the storm similarly 54 of the 67 storms affecting conus with rainfall have some rainfall truncated from the end of both the modelled and observed scenarios due to the storm persisting and continuing to produce rainfall after nhc tracking responsibility ceased the controlling data availability for each of the simulated storms is shown in table 3 2 8 observed data in order to compare the models capability of reproducing observed rainfall patterns the national stage iv quantitative precipitation estimates qpe files for conus were downloaded from the university corporation for atmospheric research ucar ucar maintains the stage iv qpe for the period of record from 2002 through the present in standard gridded binary grib1 and grib2 format at 1 hour 6 hour and 24 hour intervals lin 2011 6 hourly grib files covering the appropriate dates from 2004 to 2017 were downloaded and converted to the grib2 format if necessary although these observations are originally on the polar stereographic hydrologic rainfall analysis projection hrap reed and maidment 1999 grid they were interpolated to 0 1 degree resolution on a regularly spaced latitude longitude grid to roughly match the resolution used by lonfat et al 2007 and by m7 this was accomplished using the wgrib tools by wesley ebisuzaki available from http www cpc ncep noaa gov products wesley wgrib html a budget interpolation scheme was used to preserve the integral of rain flux when changing grid resolutions as opposed to a bilinear interpolation of point maximum values after careful analysis of overlap of storm track and rainfall affecting conus the appropriate 6 hourly files to sum for each storm were aggregated into storm total observed precipitation datasets 2 9 model runs after the storm track and grid inputs had been prepared along with the observed data 10 runs of each storm were computed for a total of 670 runs 1 for each storm using r cliper 1 for each storm using ipet 1 for each storm using phram 7 for each storm using p cliper varying f over 90 60 30 0 30 60 and 90 the variation of f was intended to explore the full range of possibilities for the p cliper model no calibration of f or any other parameter is undertaken in this study instead the models are used with the parameters originally published by their respective authors as optimized during their respective model developments 2 10 statistical measures of model skill using the storm total rainfall for grid points within 10 km of land thereby ignoring rain over open ocean metrics of model skill were calculated for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs in table 3 per m7 these metrics and the attribute of the precipitation field measured are summarized in table 4 adapted from m7 each metric is defined in detail in m7 in order to calculate equitable threat score ets contingency tables were calculated for the number of hits misses false alarms and correct rejections that each model made regarding storm total rainfall above a certain threshold definitions for each term are shown in the mock contingency table table 5 3 results model skill scores based on the metrics in table 4 are presented for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs producing rainfall over conus remarks about the ability of each model to capture the rainfall produced by a tc like 2017 hurricane harvey are also presented 3 1 2004 2017 atlantic tcs affecting conus 3 1 1 pattern matching the ability of each model to match locations of storm total rainfall was evaluated using the equitable threat score and correlation between rain patterns to estimate effects of grid resolution on results in a hydrologic fashion the storm total rainfall values were budget interpolated from the original 0 1 degree resolution to hydrologic unit code huc 10 areas near the coastline shown in fig 2 the average huc 10 area covered approximately 550 square kilometers while the original resolution covered about 105 square kilometers per cell area plots of ets for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs producing rain over conus at grid points within 500 km of each storm track are shown in fig 3 which is divided into two panels representing the two grid resolutions regularly spaced 0 1 degree resolution and irregularly spaced huc 10 units near the coastline the rainfall thresholds for the ets plots in fig 3 and all subsequent figures were as specified in m7 using the decibel rain rate dbr in inches 15 dbr 10 log 10 r where r is the value of the rain flux threshold and dbr takes values over 30 10 9 8 7 13 14 15 these thresholds were converted to millimeters for this study with regards to large scale ets the ipet model outperforms any other model as storm total rainfall threshold increases above 76 2 mm 3 in on both high and low resolutions the phram results are very similar to r cliper this indicates that the additional computational expense incurred by using phram may not yield substantially better results for the 2004 2017 climatology on average there is considerable increase in ets when relaxing the location dependency by interpolating data to the coarser huc10 grid for example at a rainfall threshold of 127 3 mm 5 in the ets for ipet is 0 16 in panel a of fig 3 the high resolution portion while the ets for ipet improves to 0 27 in panel b of fig 3 the low resolution huc 10 evaluation based on frequency bias average of 1 25 over all rain thresholds compared with 0 48 for r cliper plot not shown ipet appears to consistently over predict the rates of occurrence of rain above given thresholds of storm total rainfall p cliper with f 30 60 and 90 are the only models in this study producing storm total amounts in excess of 506 7 mm 20 in the location based correlations between modeled and observed storm total rain were also calculated plots of the absolute value of the individual storm total pearson correlations with the observed totals are shown in fig 4 ipet produces mixed results when correlating observed data with simulated it has the highest correlation of all models for 46 of cases 31 of 67 but also the lowest correlation of all models for 39 of cases 26 of 67 it should be noted that only 67 cases are presented here 2010 hurricane igor which produced 238 mm rainfall over 48 h in st lawrence newfoundland was present in the wpc analyses but was outside the coverage of the stage iv observed product when considering all storms together the correlation coefficients are presented in fig 5 in the overall case the ipet model produces results that are significantly more correlated with observed data than any other model based upon non overlap of the 99 confidence intervals for pearson correlation there is no significant difference in correlation among p cliper variants of f 0 30 60 and 90 while p cliper with f 30 and r cliper are correlated similarly to each other phram and p cliper with f 60 tie for fourth place while p cliper with the low value of f 90 is the least correlated to the observed data 3 1 2 mean rainfall and rain flux distributions in order to compare each model s ability to produce heavy medium and light rainfall amounts at varying radii the mean storm total rainfall was plotted as a function of radius from the track of the tc center in fig 6 in the inner core region p cliper with f 90 produces values approximately ten times greater than observed indicating the severity of the maximum rainfall p cliper can produce for radii less than 250 km the observed values fall between the p cliper curves f 0 and f 30 indicating that the single f value providing the best fit to the observed mean storm total rainfall profile for 2004 2017 would be represented by a positive f value in that range however as radii increases beyond 370 km p cliper was not configured to produce rainfall while the observed profile continues to produce 15 20 mm similar to earlier observations based on frequency bias the ipet model tends to over predict storm total rainfall at radii less than 425 km beyond 425 km ipet also under predicts storm total rainfall r cliper and phram have a pronounced low bias in mean storm total rainfall at all radii the mean rainfall distribution of each model was used to calculate the mean rainfall error index mrei over each 20 km band out to 400 km as in m7 since this study focuses on ability to simulate tc rainfall runoff flooding processes the total rain volume produced in each storm was calculated and plotted in fig 7 p cliper variants were not plotted due to their large range of volumes attainable by tuning f sufficiently large or small using p cliper the lowest non zero value of volume for a given storm was 0 02 cubic kilometers in 2009 ts bill with f 90 and the highest volume produced was up to 158 63 cubic kilometers in 2008 ts fay with f 90 it should also be noted that in this study ts fay was simulated for 258 h which is in the 94th percentile of simulation lengths for storms in this study equaled or surpassed only by simulating 2004 hurricane ivan for 258 h 2005 hurricane dennis for 258 h and 2005 hurricane ophelia for 270 h the length of simulation may play an outsized role in storm total rainfall when using p cliper in addition to by storm volumes the average case including all storms was also computed to elucidate any consistent biases in rain volume and is shown in table 6 overall the ipet model and p cliper models with f 30 produce too much rainfall volume on average from as little as 18 high bias to producing almost six times the observed volume the other models including phram and r cliper produce far too little rainfall volume in the average case with typical low bias for phram and r cliper indicating a failure to predict nearly half the rainfall volume for engineering purposes it is preferable to use a model which is biased slightly higher rather than lower when forced to choose between two models in order to ensure conservative results so the ipet model would be selected based on the rainfall volume basis alternatively since p cliper can be tuned to nearly any desired volume as shown by the wide range of bias 95 to 483 of observed in table 6 the p cliper model could be selected for its ability to match historical observations and development of an appropriate site specific distribution of f would be necessary it is also important to note that while the total volume may be predicted fairly well by some models in certain storms e g ipet in 2017 harvey fig 7 the placement of this rain volume is also paramount to accurate flood predictions so the previous location based metrics of ets and pattern correlation should also be considered in order to compare the relative occurrences of storm total rainfall above each threshold the probability distribution functions pdf and cumulative distribution functions cdfs of storm total rainfall are plotted in figs 8 and 9 respectively compared with the observed pdf ipet generally predicts slightly more frequent amounts of rainfall at each threshold p cliper variants with f greater than or equal to 30 also predict higher frequencies at thresholds above 20 2 mm 0 8 in r cliper and phram predict too much light rain below 10 mm and not enough heavier rain these trends are also evident in fig 9 the values for 50th percentile median of rain flux from the cdfs were compared from each model and the observed data the stage iv data within 500 km produced a median value at 4 5 mm and the median values for ipet and p cliper f 30 60 90 were higher than observed by up to a factor of 10 indicating a potential for producing too much rainfall at higher thresholds similarly r cliper phram and p cliper variants with f values of zero or less had median values lower than observed by as much as a factor of 10 indicating that the models produce too little rainfall in the higher thresholds the median values were used to calculate the large scale and track relative cdf median value indices as detailed in m7 the pdf and cdf of storm total rainfall were also plotted for 100 km bands ranging from 0 km to 500 km away from the storm track e g 0 100 km 300 400 km per m7 the 0 100 km band would mostly capture rain in the eyewall or its remnants with larger radii bands typically representing contributions from outer rainbands and stratiform rain the 0 100 km band pdf and cdf are shown in figs 10 and 11 in the inner core 0 100 km region the track relative cdf distributions are extremely similar to the large scale versions except that median values are generally at higher rainfall thresholds typical increase of 164 from large scale the phram r cliper models slightly over predict the low rainfall amounts below 10 mm and gradually return to under predicting the higher rainfall amounts 3 1 3 extreme rain amounts for analysis of tc rainfall runoff flooding it is also important to quantify how well each model predicts extreme rain amounts defined herein as those values in the top 5 percent of the observed cdf the deviation of the model cdf curves from the observed cdf was quantified based on the large scale cdf curves the entire portion of the domain within 500 km of each storm track and on the track relative cdfs over 100 km bands a large scale cdf curve depicting the 95th percentile storm total rainfall of each model is shown in fig 12 for the storms in this study the observed 95th percentile occurred at 75 7 mm 3 in each of the p cliper variants with f 30 did not produce any storm total rainfall above 75 7 mm 3 in which is unsurprising since geoghegan et al 2018 found best fit f values ranging from 19 to 50 for 12 tcs from 2002 through 2008 conversely for f 60 a much larger percentage of the model rainfall was above the observed 95th percentile the maximum parameter value tested of f 90 led to only 34 9 of model rainfall being less than or equal to 75 7 mm meaning that 65 1 of p cliper simulated values were above the 95th percentile of the observed data phram and r cliper in general under predicted storm total rainfall since the 75 7 mm threshold corresponded to 98 9 and 99 0 values on the cdf respectively the ipet model predicted 92 4 of storm total values at or less than the 95th percentile of the observed the closest fit by any model evaluated while still over predicting the higher rainfall amounts these cdf percentages over both large scale and track relative were translated into index values using the formulae set forth in m7 it is important to note that if a cdf did not contain the 95th percentile of the observed data at all the skill for that band was set to zero 3 1 4 combined indices a summary table of the various indices from each component of the analysis is presented in table 7 while large scale ets values were fairly poor for all models on the 0 1 degree resolution grid ipet and p cliper with f 30 performed the best these ets values improve substantially when interpolated to the huc10 units as noted above for the mean rainfall error index ipet phram r cliper and p cliper f 0 are roughly tied ipet appears to be superior when measured by each of the cdf indices whether median or 95th percentile implying that ipet produces the most similar cdf curve of the models evaluated a combined index was calculated for each of the components evaluated in this study pattern matching mean median volume measures and extreme rain amounts the index for pattern matching was found by taking the arithmetic average of the mean correlation over all storms and the rain flux weighted ets the mean median volume measures were combined into a single index by taking the arithmetic average of the mean rainfall error index the large scale cdf median value index and the track relative cdf median value index the index for extreme rain amounts was found by averaging the large scale cdf maximum index with the track relative cdf maximum index the combined indices are presented in table 8 ipet outperforms phram and r cliper on all combined metrics and ipet outperforms all variants of p cliper tested in this study on all metrics except pattern matching 3 2 2017 hurricane harvey following the devastation in harris county texas and surrounding areas due to the massive rainfall during 2017 hurricane harvey a common question is whether proposed models will be sufficient to predict events such as harvey prior to their occurrence as done for the other simulated storms simulations of tc rainfall were completed for the time period from 1200 utc aug 25 2017 through 1200 utc sep 02 2017 for reference harvey made its first texas landfall at its maximum strength of 115 kts at 0300 utc aug 26 2017 per blake and zelinsky 2018 even with the meandering track harvey followed the maximum values of rainfall produced in each model were significantly less than observed in most cases for instance compared with the observed maximum value of 1539 mm over 5 days ipet produced only as much as 479 mm and phram produced even less with a maximum of 441 mm while p cliper with f 60 was able to match the observed amount well 1459 mm about 95 of observed it places the maximum rainfall over corpus christi some 320 km southwest of the observed peak near houston on the other hand while p cliper with f 90 the maximum possible is capable of producing almost exactly the right amount of precipitation over houston 1550 mm compared with 1539 mm an insignificant error at amounts that high and therefore uncertain the scenario of f 90 dramatically oversaturates the rest of the eastern texas coast the new value of the maximum rainfall is still over corpus christi with f 90 since the placement of rain does not change with a change in f value but the value becomes 3071 mm nearly double the observed peak over houston this indicates that while p cliper is capable of producing the raw point maxima of rainfall occurring in harvey and much more it may have issues placing it in the correct location likely due to lack of physics that influenced harvey s stall and therefore its rain structure this should serve to indicate some of the potential failings of using climatological means even if modified by various factors since the governing physics is largely left out of calculations 4 conclusions and future work overall when evaluated over the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs the ipet model currently demonstrates the highest skill for reproducing tc rainfall patterns based on the combination of the measures described herein particularly because it conservatively over predicts storm total rainfall in most cases i e those with less than 508 mm 20 in storm total rainfall however it is important to realize that all statistical models presented in this study do not perform as well as the dynamical models in m7 nor even the statistical r cliper used in m7 the lack of skill in using the statistical models in this study for 2004 2017 is to be expected since the statistical phram p cliper r cliper and ipet models were all derived based on climatological mean rain rates from trmm data measured in lonfat et al 2004 spanning tcs from only 1998 2002 therefore these statistical models were expected to demonstrate higher predictive skill for the time period used in m7 which includes their training data 1998 2004 than for the completely unseen time period used in this study 2004 2017 this effect would be enhanced further under climate change considerations which increase storm total rainfall overall based mainly on projected increases in rainfall intensity at large radii in landfalling storms further increasing flood risk in large watersheds wright et al 2015 as a result the statistical models presented in this study need to be updated using more recent rainfall rate data with longer periods of record which are now available as well as take into account uncertainty due to climate change effects in their current state none of the models is recommended for direct use in coastal flood studies once the statistical models or other types of models such as those derived using artificial neural networks or other supervised machine learning techniques e g bass and bedient 2018 are updated or created based on the most recent tc rainfall data an engineering analysis of rainfall rates resulting from tcs can be undertaken the weakness of the current statistical models is underscored by the fact that for tcs producing massive amounts of precipitation such as 2017 hurricane harvey only p cliper with a substantially above average frequency f value is capable of reproducing the large storm total precipitation amounts regardless care must be taken not to overfit f values since tuning f large enough to reproduce one large peak observation may dramatically increase the total rain flux over a small or large area seriously overestimating the expected flooding from rainfall runoff improvements from using the modified no shear phram over r cliper are marginal at best for the 2004 2017 tc climatology as a whole while this study attempted to consider statistical models which used only the five parameters typically used in jpm os the addition of wind shear plays an important role in phram s skill for the 2004 2017 atlantic tcs and future studies using the phram model should include wind shear as an additional parameter in their jpm integral furthermore updated ets statistics will be calculated as data become available from the 2018 tc season 2018 hurricanes florence and michael will be of particular interest a similar methodology to the study presented herein is also proposed for evaluation of tc rainfall in puerto rico given its unique exposure and aggravating factor of mountainous slopes in comparatively smaller watersheds than present in conus the model selection

5953,understanding the nature of water conflicts is a prerequisite to developing sustainable management of common water resources therefore the main idea of this research was to understand the internal process of farmers water conflicts an extended theory of planned behavior tpb was used as the theoretical research framework by incorporating multiple intentions an expectation of conflict with industry organization and farmer and four conflict types within group in similar settlement within group out of the same settlement between farmers and industry and between farmers and water state organization the data were collected by survey method with a structured questionnaire from 215 farmers using random sampling and analyzed with the help of structural equation modeling sem the findings indicated that all significant conflict types are influenced by their intentions some conflict behaviors such as industry and water state organization conflicts were influenced not only by their own intentions but also by their counterpart behaviors intentions furthermore inclusion of additional constructs improved the predictive utility of the proposed model at the end implications of the study are discussed keywords interpersonal conflict multi intention tpb model water conflict 1 introduction serious water shortage is now becoming common in many arid and semi arid regions throughout the world high risk areas such as iran are facing the threat of water bankruptcy as a result of the current state of water affairs according to the estimations in iran as a semi arid region the total annual renewable freshwater and the total annual returned water from consumption are 130 and 29 bcm respectively the renewable water per capita is also estimated to be less than 1700 m3 annually this is well below the global level 7000 m3 madani 2014 indeed demand for water caused by excessive withdrawal of water significantly exceeds the water supply so the ability of water resources to be recharged and replenished in these regions has been threatened this issue together with frequent droughts results in over abstraction of surface and groundwater madani et al 2016 and contributes to the water conflict and competition among different stakeholders it seems that water conflict and water shortage are two sides of the same coin though water conflict may not be a determinant trigger of water crisis it exacerbates other underlying factors and could act as a catalyst to incite the crisis additionally water shortage plays a decisive role in conflict escalation among different stakeholders due to the lack of water usage and allocations bijani and hayati 2015 ghorbani et al 2014 therefore the use of water resources in any shared social space is susceptible to conflict buckles 1999 because of this susceptibility conflicts are widespread around the world at different scales between different stakeholders e g local people communities organizations and states plusquellec 2002 in this regard reported cases show that local water related conflicts are likely growing in number and intensity gleick and heberger 2014 kreamer 2012 moreover in iran as well as in other arid and semi arid areas there has been an increase in reported cases of water conflicts in recent years bijani and hayati 2011 the upstream and downstream conflicts between farmers the department of water supply dws and water user agencies within zayandeh rud river basin isfahan province ganji et al 2007 the conflicts between farmers and dws within doroodzan dam irrigation network in fars province bijani and hayati 2015 and the conflicts between farmers industry sector and dws within shazand plain in markazi province are illustrative examples of conflicts over water in different parts of iran among which the latter appears to be a hotspot since water conflict is a salient threat in this region sustainable water conflict management depends considerably on understanding and analyzing the pattern of water conflicts in terms of the scale dimensions factors and determinants this suggests a better understanding of social factors that disturb the status quo and lead to individual conflict behaviors accordingly this paper aims at systematically investigating and understanding various facets of water conflict behaviors and its internal process in the shazand plain iran using an extended theory of planned behavior the paper proceeds as follows in the next section an in depth review of the related literature is presented the subsequent section provides a description of the methodology involving research method variables and measurement study site data collection process sample profiles and tools for data analysis next the study results are reported lastly discussion and conclusion for future work are provided 2 literature review 2 1 water and conflict the widely heard warning that the next war will be a water war or the next war in the middle east will be over water reveals that the issue of water conflict is expected to be the major threat to human life furthermore there has been an increase in reported cases of water related conflicts and violence although the major part of this increase seems to be the return to improvements in reporting such as new internet tools it is also undoubtedly due to increased tensions and disputes over scarce water resources another important point is the shift in the nature of conflicts from national water disputes to sub national and local violence over water access this may be caused by the conflicts over equitable access to water strategies for sharing during shortages and water contamination gleick and heberger 2014 water as a highly precious natural resource is offered to different types of stakeholders the multi purpose stakeholders are the major stumbling blocks for most of the unmitigated water conflicts therefore a wide spectrum of water conflicts appears throughout the local level where inter group conflicts over water have been introduced as serious threats therefore a better understanding of types of inter group conflicts needs to be identified and the beneficiaries need to be indicated generally they include various public policy maker centers such as government officials departments of agriculture departments of water management downstream and upstream river sections potable water and irrigation supply systems farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture and factory owners bijani and hayati 2011 brouwer et al 2003 chanya et al 2014 foster and gardu√±o 2004 tarigan et al 2014 in iran it is apparent that the main water conflict is shared between all water affected stakeholders and the government for example in the agricultural sector specifically the water conflict between farmers and the government is more acute therefore this study sets out to measure a variety of different types of water conflict in water sharing and partnerships with other water users including within households persons and groups per village between other villages villagers and water organizations and villagers and industry sectors and identify the conflict behavior determinants 2 2 the theory of planned behavior the tpb is one of the most influential and commonly used psychological theories for explaining behaviors botetzagias et al 2015 it was proposed by ajzen in the early 1990s and since then it has been used as a strong conceptual framework of deliberate behavior ajzen 1991 in the tpb as in the original theory of reasoned action a central factor is the individual s intention indeed the main assumption is that behavior is directly determined by the intention to perform behavior according to the theory a person behaves because s he has the intention to do so in turn this intention is influenced by the person s attitude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control pbc ajzen 1991 attitudes are the sum of behavioral beliefs that measure the favorability or un favorability of alternative behaviors kl√∂ckner 2013 subjective norms are introduced as beliefs about social pressures to perform a behavior and referents expectations finally perceived behavioral control depending on its accuracy determines the strength of the opportunity and ability to perform a certain behavioral alternative sheeran et al 2003 perceived behavioral control is defined as perceived ease or difficulty of performing a behavior and the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of the behavior in other words it consists of beliefs concerning the presence or absence of resources to behavioral performance and the perceived power or impact of each resource to facilitate or inhibit the behavior pawlak et al 2009 tpb is considered to be applied in predicting general behavior and investigating the attitude action gap beedell and rehman 2000 webb and sheeran 2006 it has been applied to different behavioral studies and its proposed structure has been confirmed by past analyses gleick and heberger 2014 harland et al 1999 kreamer 2012 tonglet et al 2004 in this way much of the literature used tpb as the theoretical foundation for analyzing water related behaviors such as water conservation clark and finley 2007 lam 1999 trumbo and o keefe 2005 yazdanpanah et al 2014 intention to save water gilg and barr 2006 lam 2006 and alters irrigation behavior of farmers durst 2016 a considerable number of researches have been conducted to explain the formation of farmers water conflict behaviors using this theory bijani 2013 ghorbani et al 2014 bijani 2013 confirmed the relationship between environmental values beliefs and norms toward agricultural water conflict behaviors accordingly farmers conflict behaviors are best predicted by norms generally norms are defined as expectations about behavior and description of concepts rooted in reference group attitude and cultures de grahl 2012 all these efforts provide insight offer the potential for the successful exploration of behavioral constructs and open up new possibilities in the evaluation of behavior hence this research tries to put flesh on the bones of the tpb model and build different perspectives on the relationship between variables and deliberate water conflict behavior in this regard several researchers have confirmed the usefulness of extending tpb by adding the variables in different boards and improving the model s explanatory power cheung and to 2017 gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 singh et al 2017 accordingly this study tries to improve the tpb model by additional variables capable of influencing water conflict behavior it also expresses the synergistic effect of intentions on a conflict behavior when simultaneous occurrence of different layers of conflict behavior takes place 2 3 inclusion of additional constructs in the tpb although the tpb often receives strong empirical support it has been criticized for its lack of comprehensiveness in addressing affective influences upon multiple intentions and behaviors kl√∂ckner and bl√∂baum 2010 in contrast to the wealth of literature on tpb model empirical studies including the interactions between major constructs thought to underlie behavior are rare consequently using multi faceted intentions approach the present study will fill the gap in the literature by employing the modified tpb model and explaining local water conflict behavior the present model is believed to significantly improve the theory especially when behavior is triggered by multi intention cues furthermore the tpb has been criticized for neglecting mental space e g shared environmental values postulated religious attitude sense of loss and belief in ambiguity reader is referred to manstead 2000 kaiser et al 2005 therefore this research acknowledges the theoretical gap and adds mental space to the tpb which will be described in detail in the following the mental space means a temporary knowledge structure created for the purpose of local understanding fauconnier 1994 expressive mental space is stimulated by cues associated with the individual values senses and local knowledge katz 1960 the concept has also been extended to epistemic distance which allows exploring the attitude to a given mental space as hypothetical dancygier 2002 the cognitive mental space refers to senses and values hines et al 1986 moreover the reasons for holding or changing attitudes are found in the functions of mental space katz 1960 accordingly consistent with the environment behavior theory s assumption environmental values have a direct impact on attitude stern 2000 expressive attitudes are aroused by cues associated with the mental space katz 1960 to understand how to manage water conflict behavior one must identify at least some of the factors that can influence such intention and attitude newhouse 1990 clearly attitude cannot be represented in physical space and instead must be treated as existing in mental space howard and cambria 2013 in this regard this research represents an attempt to add mental space asan essential component into attitude by examining how the concept of mental space might expand our current understanding of water shortage attitude based on the discussion and standard tpb assumptions the following hypotheses can be proposed h1 mental space of farmers significantly influences their attitude toward water conflict behavior h2 multiple intentions of conflict significantly influence the farmers actual conflict behavior h3 subjective norms significantly influence the farmers intention of conflict on water resources h4 pbc significantly influences the farmers intention of water resources conflict 3 methodology a cross sectional survey approach was implemented to understand farmers water conflicts as multifunctional nature and an attempt was made to identify the key determinants of farmers conflict behaviors in an internal social context schematic representation of the theoretical framework of the study is illustrated in fig 1 3 1 variables and measurements the definitions and measurements of the variables in the study are further defined as follows environmental values a tripartite classification of environmental values was outlined by stern 2000 which argued that beliefs could be activated throughout altruistic egoistic and biospheric values measures of the values were based on an adapted version of schwartz s value scale 1992 which was used by stern and colleagues in their study stern et al 1999 the scale consists of 13 items containing five items to measure the egoistic four items for the altruistic and four items to measure the biospheric value this variable was measured using a likert type scale ranging from 1 disagree to 3 agree spiritual values spiritual values have been considered in emotional terms often referring to the subjective experience of a sacred dimension so that they have been defined as beliefs in a supernatural realm schuurmans stekhoven 2014 spiritual value refers to the concepts such as integrity justice respect and responsibility that give purpose and meaning to the path of life jurkiewicz and giacalone 2004 this variable was measured with 12 items each item was rated in a 3 point likert scale to appraise farmers agreement with a series of spiritual and religious beliefs water shortage attitude three aspects of farmers perceptions of water crisis have been measured perceptions of water shortage and influencing factors perceptions of different aspects of water crises potential explanatory factors and finally perceptions of the factors behind local water crisis and the consequences of different factors on villagers perceptions yu et al 2013 these dimensions were assessed in a 3 point likert type scale sense of loss in this study the sense of loss of water resources was viewed as a lack of expected water resource gain which results in psychological stress it is interesting to note it was a more profound sense of loss coupled with strong positive emotional bonds in this questionnaire 6 items were rated on a 3 point likert type scale ranging from 1 disagree to 3 agree belief in ambiguity introduced as a subjective role of ambiguity that was defined as the existence of a lack of transparency in decision making for water management this ambiguity can be a root of conflict among different stakeholders especially farmers and the government respondents belief in ambiguity was measured by a 5 item scale with a 3 point response likert scale including beliefs in ambiguity in water allocation or distribution water reality and dual and contradictory behavior of government agents social capital the questionnaire survey method can be effective in measuring social capital levels in rural areas yamaoka et al 2008 the social capital construct was measured by using eight items regarding trust membership and participation on a 3 point likert scale to indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with the statements culture of conflict the conflict culture or shared norms specifies how conflict should be organized in a social setting dimensions have been considered in four distinct conflict cultures dominating conflict cultures collaborative conflict cultures avoidant conflict cultures and passive aggressive conflict cultures gelfand et al 2008 conflict culture dimensions included a 10 item survey instrument using a 3 point likert scale rating conflict expectation this construct portrays the future of conflict bilgrami 2004 to understand conflict expectations there is a spectrum of possible expectations among different stakeholders individuals and groups government organizations and industry sectors responses were offered on a 3 point likert scale this variable included three expectations the farmer s expectations of conflict between industry and agriculture sectors 3 items the farmer s expectations of conflict between government water organizations and farmers 3 items and the farmer s expectations of conflict among farmers 3 items water conflict behavior this variable is defined as the farmer s reaction to the perception that his own and another party s current aspirations over the water resources cannot be achieved simultaneously due to incompatible interests this construct was measured along four conflict types these include within group in similar settlement e g farmer s neighbors in their villages within group out of the same settlement e g farmers reside in their village settlementswith farmers of other villages between farmers and industry and between farmers and state water organization in this research modified barli s scale is used to understand and analyze the conflict types barli et al 2006 3 2 tools for analysis data was processed using ibm s spss 21 and amos 20 software the combination of this software as suggested by recent studies yazdanpanah et al 2014a yazdanpanah et al 2015 keshavarz and karami 2016 besides the user friendliness has allowed the ease of visual illustration of the conceptual models yazdanpanah et al 2014b the data processing in this study followed a two step approach e g measurement model and structural model as recommended by anderson and gerbing 1988 first to determine whether or not the items loaded on their respective scales the confirmatory factor analysis cfa was used after achieving a satisfactory fit the structural modeling was used to find the best fitting model and test the variables casual relationship so the second stage involved testing the structural model and the hypotheses by providing path coefficients standardized regression coefficients for each hypothesized relationship bagozzi and yi 1988 sem technique is most widely used for complex model testing and has been suggested especiallywhen a large number of linking constructs need to be analyzed such as in this present study hair et al 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2015 model comparisons between existing model and proposed model in this study have been provided to develop a robust model in explaining water conflict among different stakeholders 4 results 4 1 shazand plain as a study site the markazi province iran is the study area of this research the province is a two fold region where agriculture and industrial poles interact accordingly there is a huge competition for water consumption from industrial and agricultural sectors in the region among these shazand plain as a main agricultural based region of the province was considered sharp growth and high water consumption industry in this region accountforalarge agricultural land fraction consequently farmers who are well owners are inevitably opposed to the interests of dominant sector the shazand alluvial aquifer latitude 33 43 to 34 10 longitude 49 17 to 49 51 topography with elevation 1840 to 3322 m above mean sea level is located 35 km from arak city the provincial capital of markazi iran the basin area is 1021 8 km2 which is classified as a part of qareh chai basin fig 2 approximately 50 percent of the basin area includes highlands and hard formations and 44 85 percent contain sub mount structure and alluvial fans pooyandab 2009 therefore shazand plain is topographically expressed as a mountainous region annual minimum temperature has been recorded in january 34 5 c and its maximum was observed in july 38 c the thickest part 110 m is situated in the south eastern plain and its section with 10 to 20 m is located at the marginal and central regions the mean annual precipitation received over the basin area is 430 mm so the region is classified as arid climate shazand plain was well known as a fertile region due to outflow from groundwater reservoir in this plain therefore most of the inhabitants relied on farming unfortunately excessive depletion affects this region estimates show that there are at least 203 689 million cubic meters of water extracted by 1245 deep and semi deep wells and 49 82 million cubic meters by 129 springs and qanats 1 1 a qanat system comprises a series of well like vertical access shafts connected through a gently sloping hand dug underground channel that is used to extract and transport groundwater in arid areas madani et al 2016 pooyandab 2009 also over the past few years extension of irrigated farming and orchard fields in the area has been affected by the development of cities and industries in this period rapid growth of large and powerful national level factories and industries decreased agricultural activities and induced sweeping changes in agricultural sectors davudirad et al 2016 this plain contains 58 villages since both agricultural and industry sites were involved in water conflict in the first step 25 villages have been highlighted and half of the target villages were randomly selected in the second step according to krejcie and morgan 1970 sample size table the samples were randomly drawn from 215 out of 540 agricultural well owners farmers within 12 selected villages the study was designed as a cross sectional survey with the help of structured questionnaire all data were gathered based on face to face interviews with farmers who were well owners in the winter of 2017 the questionnaire covered the variables emphasized in the study model before the final version of the questionnaire was finalized a panel of experts confirmed the validity of the questionnaire items considering their comments minor adjustments were made to the wording and phrasing of the constructs prior to the survey the questionnaire was pre tested using a sample of 16 farmers in a village outside the study area and was revised based on the pilot study results the typical respondents of the survey were between 18 and 85 years of age with an average age of 51 29 years sd 17 56 the sample had a mean education level of 6 52 years min 0 and max 18 respondents were also asked to indicate the number of family members who are qualified to be employed in agricultural or industry sectors considering this the number of employed persons in agricultural and industry sector per household was an average of 2 and 1 respectively accordingly over 76 1 percent of the sample was primarily dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and the average cultivated land was 9 2 ha per farmer moreover 25 4 64 9 and 9 7 percent of farmers had deep wells semi deep or both deep and semi deep wells respectively 4 2 summary statistics of the measured variables in order to give a clear picture of the measured constructs in the study a brief description of status of the variables employed is presented the mean and standard deviation of all the measured constructs are given in table 1 the main variable of the study was the conflict types between farmers and other different water stakeholders in this regard conflict between different stakeholders can be categorized into four broad types as shown in table 1 farmers to farmers within a village i farmers to farmers in different villages ii farmers to industry iii and farmers to water responsible organizations iv based on table 1 conflict type iii x 2 73 is almost 1 65 times higher than that of conflict type i x 1 65 this means that conflict between farmers and industry is the most prevalent conflict type found in the study site in contrast the conflict within farmers to farmers is minimal the next conflict is the conflict type iv x 2 63 according to these findings it can be concluded that the conflict between farmers and industry and farmers with water responsible organizations are the prominent conflict types in the region in addition the culture of conflict was considered as perceived behavioral control in this research the low average value of this variable x 2 17 suggests poor cooperation between farmers which might lead to dysfunctionality these results revealed that the distributions of the environmental values were negatively skewed see table 1 meanwhile the mean score showed that farmers with an altruistic value x 2 65 had the highest level of adherence to environmental values followed by those with biospheric value orientation x 2 49 the lowest level is for the egoistics x 1 58 altruistic value orientated farmers gain pleasure from helping others and try to do their best to achieve the utmost result and serve the interests of their society van der mandele and van witteloostuijn 2015 it seems that they are not apathetic to their environment government decisions concerning water distribution allocation and use must include the right of farmers to use water surely the ambiguity and lack of enlightenment in water management policies besides a sense of loss of right to use water are expected to lead to intensified conflicts results indicated that farmers believed strongly in ambiguity of behavioural patterns of water responsible organisations table 1 as it is shown in table 1 in this study social norms contain a wide variety of variables the table shows that the mean score of social capital is 2 41 findings also showed that in spite of the higher organization conflict expectation x 2 76 farmer conflict expectation is lower x 1 93 than that of the industry s conflict expectation 4 3 measurement model analysis according to the two stage approach of anderson and gerbing 1988 in the first stage confirmatory factor analysis cfa was applied to the new theoretical framework with the aim of obtaining the information about validity scales from the initial cfa findings the fit indices represented adequate model fit œá2 1291 992 df 1211 p 0 052 œá2 df 1 067 cfi 0 983 tli 0 982 ifi 0 983 gfi 0 815 agfi 0 797 rmsea 0 018 but seven six and three items with factor loadings less than 0 5 were removed from the religious culture and social capital scale respectively again cfa was applied on the modified theoretical framework the value represented a better model fit cfi 0 963 tli 0 961 ifi 0 964 rmsea 0 025 the œá2 test of the model fit was significant œá2 df 1 146 œá2 1531 451 df 1355 p 0 001 as recommended by hair et al 2014 the cfi value above 0 9 could be acceptable for a sample size of 215 with 81 measurement items therefore the cfa results in the new proposed theoretical framework met the criteria of reliability and validity since each construct contained multiple measurements items the internal consistency among items and the construct reliability were measured by cronbach s alpha and composite reliability cr tests respectively cronbach s alpha values ranged from 0 600 to 0 886 it was reported in table 1 as argued by hair et al 1998 a value above 0 50 is acceptable in social psychological research the composite reliability cr values 0 755 0 948 show that all values exceed the recommended level of 0 60 and higher bagozzi and yi 1988 further this study examined the convergent validity using factor loading average variance extracted and discriminant validity the value of factor loadings of all items was above the recommended level of 0 50 ranges from 0 505 to 0 917 as suggested by chin et al 1997 the average variance extracted ave values were at least equal to 0 50 and higher which provide evidence of discriminant validity fornell and larcker 1981 table 1 presents the values 4 4 structural model goodness of fit statistic the second stage of anderson and gerbing s 1988 two stage approach entails testing the proposed structural model hence in order to confirm the structural model the maximum likelihood estimate method was used once the best fitted model was identified it was tested for goodness of fit statistics using structural analysis the fit indices suggested that the extended tpb model had an improved explanatory capacity œá2 64 142 df 62 p 0 401 œá2 df 1 035 gfi 0 956 agfi 0 936 cfi 0 987 tli 0 984 ifi 0 988 rmsea 0 013 covering 13 3 of the variance of water conflict behavior 19 2 of variance of industry water conflict expectation and 33 3 of the variance of water shortage attitude however compared to the original model œá2 10 939 df 5 p 0 053 œá2 df 2 58 gfi 0 980 agfi 0 941 cfi 0 881 tli 0 762 ifi 0 892 rmsea 0 075 some goodness of fit indices in the extended model were all within acceptable limits and showed good model fit the original tpb model explained 10 3 of the variance in industry water conflict behavior and 9 9 of the variance in average industry conflict expectation scores 4 5 hypothesis testing the results of linear regression are reported in table 2 the variables postulated in the framework were included in a series of linear regressions the theoretical model hypothesized that mental space variables belief in ambiguity sense of loss spiritual values and environmental values biospheric egoistic values and altruistic values should influence the water shortage attitude for the first multiple linear regression analysis in which attitude was considered as dependent variable the most relevant mental space variables were regarded as independent factors based on the adjusted squared r at this stage of the analysis which reveals the percentage of the variance shared by mental space variables see table 3 the model has a moderate predictive power to provide relatively robust water shortage attitude prediction in other words the independent variables explained 33 2 of the variance in the water shortage attitude meanwhile religious values p 0 01 Œ≤ 0 251 and belief in ambiguity p 0 01 Œ≤ 0 221 were stronger and biospheric values p 0 05 Œ≤ 0 109 and egoistic values p 0 05 Œ≤ 0 130 were weaker predictors respectively the positive signs of biospheric and altruistic values indicate that an increase in these variables would result in an increase in water shortage attitude but for the negative sign of the remaining variables any increase would result in decrease in dependent variable among these the biospheric value was the only variable that could not play a significant role in predicting water shortage attitude following the theoretical model the second regression analysis was made in a similar way the dependent variable in this multiple regression model was the intention of conflict the multi intention variable included an expectation of conflict with industry organization and at farmer levels based on the regression f test result and the probability of significance for the model formulated in this study f 0 778 p 0 507 it seems that the expectation of conflict in organization could not be explained by these variables also regression analysis was not significant for the farmer expectation of conflict as a predictor of intention f 2 61 p 0 052 one more explanation for this regression is that the farmer conflict expectation explained 3 6 of the variance of the intention behavior while the water shortage attitude and social conflict were not significant the culture of conflict as perceived behavioral control component Œ≤ 0 152 p 0 028 was associated with farmer conflict expectation the industry conflict expectation explained 11 70 of the variance in the intention behavior in this step water shortage attitude perceived behavioral control and social capital as subjective norms were included as independent variables among the predictor variables perceived behavioral control p 0 001 Œ≤ 0 219 water shortage attitude p 0 038 Œ≤ 0 137 and social capital p 0 009 Œ≤ 0 171 were significantly related to the industry conflict intention furthermore with respect to the beta coefficients it can be argued that the industry conflict expectation is maximized with increasing water shortage attitude while this is reverse for the social capital and conflict of culture factors in the last regression the four water conflict types considered in this study were regressed against the independent variables the expectation of conflict was regarded as the intention variable to test the overall significance of the regression and the hypothesis tests anova and two tailed t tests were applied according to the results since the p values were higher than the chosen Œ± level of 0 05 or 95 confidence this variable is excluded from the model for the conflict type i f 1 240 p 0 293 in contrast results revealed that conflict type iii has the most explanatory power r2 0 183 as it is shown in table 3 all the independent variables were significant p 0 05 the culture of conflicts Œ≤ 0 262 expectation of industry conflict Œ≤ 0 283 expectation of farmer s conflict Œ≤ 0 163 and expectation of organization conflict Œ≤ 0 144 were the most important variables to predict dependent variables separately the rationale behind the linear regression is that the rural participants of shazand county have highlighted the importance of expectation of industry conflict Œ≤ 0 283 in predicting the industry conflict behavior in this step all variables were positive and directly related to the conflict type iii in the fourth type of the conflict according to the beta coefficients the expectation of organization conflict and expectation of industry conflict are the two most important variables this is while the expectation of farmer s conflict did not have significant influence on the change of the dependent variable in this regard multiple regression analysis was conducted in this study to analyze the relative importance of each expectation of water conflict expectations of farmer conflict organization conflict and industry conflict to the estimated water conflict behavior the regression result indicated that conflict type i should be excluded from further analysis conflict type ii and conflict iv were not predicted by the expectation levels the independent variables including culture of conflict farmer conflict expectation organization conflict expectation and industry conflict expectation explained about 18 3 of variability in conflict type iii r2 0 183 in this step all independent variables were positive and directly related to the conflict iii it seems that this variable could modify the relationships between independent and dependent variables bao et al 2011 examination of the correlation matrix provides some information on the multicollinearity problem in the model high correlation between expectation variables implies multicollinearity for removing multicollinearity instead of the removal of redundant variable the whole expectation the dependent conflict variable was subjected to regression analysis by certain levels of expectation farmer conflict organization conflict and industry conflict furthermore path analysis was used to identify causal relation between the constructs of the extended tpb model fig 3 the table 3 showed the standard path coefficient between variables these coefficients revealed that the culture of conflict as perceived behavioral control had the greatest direct positive effect on conflict behavior 0 261 followed by industry conflict expectation intention 0 208 organization conflict expectation had a greater total positive effect on the industry conflict expectation 0 315 compared to the culture of conflict 0 208 and farmer conflict expectation 0 159 consequently industry conflict expectation significantly affected behavior with a path coefficient of 0 216 the variables such as biospheric Œ≤ 0 139 p 0 013 and altruistic values Œ≤ 0 367 p 0 01 were significantly and positively related to changes in water shortage attitudes which supported hypothesis 1 and 3 in other words egoistic values Œ≤ 0 112 p 0 045 spiritual values Œ≤ 0 235 p 0 01 sense of loss Œ≤ 0 266 p 0 01 and belief in ambiguity Œ≤ 0 202 p 0 01 were significantly and negatively related to water shortage attitudes which supported the hypotheses 2 4 5 and 6 5 discussion whether the sources of water conflict are individuals or not most water conflicts tend to spring from the disputes associated with perceived violation of one s comfort zone cowan 2003 planners need better understanding of these conflicts to make optimal decisions on allocations and manage conflict successfully to promote deep understanding two fundamental issues should be explained first a robust model for prediction of water conflict behavior this leads to the second issue which is the immanent effort to refine and adjust the proposed model it seems that structural model of extended tpb has the potential to build a framework upon which to predict the water conflict behavior and manage its associated context the findings showed that the proposed model had good explanatory power and confirmed its robustness in predicting the conflict behaviors likewise this model applied a common approach of categorizing complex entities into a limited number of types as proposed by von der dunk et al 2011 although the overwhelming majority of studies on conflict have treated it as a unidimensional variable ruble and thomas 1976 in this research interpersonal agricultural water conflicts were measured in four types of within group in similar settlement within group out of the same settlement between farmers and industry and between farmers and state water organization one of the strengths of this view is that it considered conflict behavior as a process oriented approach in this study intention and behavior were seen as multidimensional subjects accordingly the conflict behaviors are influenced by multi expectation of conflicts as intention variables the results shed light on the relevant and resonant organization and industry conflict mechanism that enhance the conflict behaviors among each other this means that the organization conflict expectation coupled with the industry conflict expectation intensified the organization behaviors also the industry conflict expectation coupled with the organization conflict expectation intensified the industry conflict behaviors as it is shown all significant conflict behavior models are influenced by their intentions some conflict behaviors such as industry and organization conflict behaviors are influenced not only by their own intentions but also by their counterpart behaviors intentions this coordination improved the power of the statistical test for predicting conflict behaviors in this proposed model it was expected that the organization conflict expectation would be derived from the large portion of the constructs in the proposed model but in practice the land owning factor was more important rather than the psychological factors so this model is a good predictor of industry conflict behaviors surveying dimensions of conflict behavior can be acknowledged when the conflicts are perceived to be multi faceted and hence need to be addressed in a different manner this can help authorities to better understand the conflict behavior context to manage water conflicts the conflict discourses should be narrowed and reduced down to a single narrative identity that insists upon a connection between stakeholders since less attention has been paid to the ways in which farmers deal with agricultural water crises and their conflict narratives this study attempts to reduce this gap the proposed model indicated that understanding what is truly happening during conflict is a key sticking point to valid identification of water conflict context cowan 2003 it assumes that individual mental space contributes towards the water shortage attitudes an integrated system of mental and spiritual values senses concepts and beliefs constructs the individual mental space boychenko et al 2008 zhuge 2010 for this purpose environmental values biospheric egoistic and altruistic religious values sense of loss and belief in ambiguity were identified as individual s mental space dimensions which are described in detail below in providing sound answers to the water crisis religions by providing sound principles for attaining a certain ethical moral behavior have been recognized as one of the important determinants of environmental consciousness chuvieco 2012 emari et al 2017 hope and jones 2014 therefore farmers with strong religious values are expected to have a pro environmental worldview such as water shortage attitudes however religious values were not congruent with water shortage attitudes in this study one reason for this latter finding could be that some religious doctrines falsely assert that god will provide the help to reach water resources for example misinterpretation of this verse of the holy quran we sent down water from the sky in due measure and lodged it in the earth and we are able to take it all away almumenoon verse 18 may decrease concern about water shortage however the competitive claims of multiple stakeholders on water resources the sense of loss and concern about water shortage in rural and agriculturally dependent communities are inevitable sol√≠s 2005 in contrast to rational thought it appears that the sense of loss is associated with the decline of water shortage attitudes one reason for this unexpected finding could be that low water shortage attitude is not a problem in itself but the real problem stems from no control over water used for industry purposes in the same way it has been attempted to measure the importance of each of the three considered environmental value orientations biospheric egoistic and altruistic as determinants of water conflict behaviors among the three values postulated to the model the biospheric and altruistic values were linked to water shortage attitude and changed it positively while the egoistic values negatively affected the attitude the results indicated that the organization conflict expectation dimension of intention was excluded from the regression analysis although it was expected that this dimension of expectation would be contributed to the water conflict behavior no significantrelation was found between these variables perhaps the explanation for this finding can be that owning the land is more important than the psychological factors the endowment organization sazeman e auqaf the charity organization which has been established by law auqaf 2002 was put under the supervision of the ministry of culture the conflict expectation was made in villages covered by auqaf organization this organization is the owner of land and water catchment is performed by extracting water from wells located in these villages the findings confirmed that with respect to farmers expectation of conflict water shortage attitude was not a salient variable this result is related to the fact that farmers did not perceive water shortage as a problem in this region according to the findings the industry conflict expectation was improved under the water shortage attitude and reference group norms the farmers believed that water scarcity was rooted in illegal water wells and the expansion of the industry in this area in addition the industry sectors were in contact with social leaders of the target farmers in the region who frame issues and develop understanding of their settlements these findings have been confirmed by several research scholars please see karjaluoto et al 2002 siegel and siegel 1957 yu et al 2007 in contrast it seems that the industry conflict expectation declined with social capital and culture of conflict dimensions these finding were not congruent with other evidence from different fields li√±√°n and santos 2007 these results suggested that the level of culture of conflict is the key determinant of industry conflicts thus this finding confirmed the importance of developing farmers empowerment programs in water conflict management 6 conclusions stakeholder participation especially local people is of great interest in managing scarce water resources however water scarcity has led to local conflicts in many arid and semi arid regions therefore identifying causes and antecedents of conflict can be helpful in understanding and thus trying to resolve the conflict consequently this study aims at providing insight into understanding why internal processes either do or do not give rise to farmers water conflicts the tpb has been a particularly useful applied framework to predict a wide range of behavior in diverse contexts including conflict behavior however this study is one of the initial attempts that tries to explain determinants of farmers water conflicts in the iranian context as a semi arid region using modified tpb the empirical findings have proved the applicability of our proposed modified cognitive psychological model tpb in determining the conflict of farmers with other water users in the context of a semi arid region iran further the modified tpb developed here is of practical significance since the inclusion of additional constructs farmers multiple intentions has improved predictive utility for the proposed model from 10 3 to 13 3 when compared to the tpb model just described in the paper multiple intentions allow for thick descriptions of farmer industry sector and farmer state water organization conflict grounded not only in their own intentions but also in their counterpart behaviors intentions therefore having successful negotiation thread requires perceiving identifying diverse intentions and motivations of different stakeholders in sum this study suggests to water policymakers and water responsible authorities in arid and semi arid regions that promoting the sustainable water management should emphasize the conflict management of different water users the results suggest that social capital and water shortage attitude are the main drivers of intention or expectation of conflict in addition to culture of conflict therefore empowering farmers through agricultural associations would involve them as full and equal partners in crop appraisal and policy setting improving social learning and negotiation skills are also highly acknowledged among farmers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5953,understanding the nature of water conflicts is a prerequisite to developing sustainable management of common water resources therefore the main idea of this research was to understand the internal process of farmers water conflicts an extended theory of planned behavior tpb was used as the theoretical research framework by incorporating multiple intentions an expectation of conflict with industry organization and farmer and four conflict types within group in similar settlement within group out of the same settlement between farmers and industry and between farmers and water state organization the data were collected by survey method with a structured questionnaire from 215 farmers using random sampling and analyzed with the help of structural equation modeling sem the findings indicated that all significant conflict types are influenced by their intentions some conflict behaviors such as industry and water state organization conflicts were influenced not only by their own intentions but also by their counterpart behaviors intentions furthermore inclusion of additional constructs improved the predictive utility of the proposed model at the end implications of the study are discussed keywords interpersonal conflict multi intention tpb model water conflict 1 introduction serious water shortage is now becoming common in many arid and semi arid regions throughout the world high risk areas such as iran are facing the threat of water bankruptcy as a result of the current state of water affairs according to the estimations in iran as a semi arid region the total annual renewable freshwater and the total annual returned water from consumption are 130 and 29 bcm respectively the renewable water per capita is also estimated to be less than 1700 m3 annually this is well below the global level 7000 m3 madani 2014 indeed demand for water caused by excessive withdrawal of water significantly exceeds the water supply so the ability of water resources to be recharged and replenished in these regions has been threatened this issue together with frequent droughts results in over abstraction of surface and groundwater madani et al 2016 and contributes to the water conflict and competition among different stakeholders it seems that water conflict and water shortage are two sides of the same coin though water conflict may not be a determinant trigger of water crisis it exacerbates other underlying factors and could act as a catalyst to incite the crisis additionally water shortage plays a decisive role in conflict escalation among different stakeholders due to the lack of water usage and allocations bijani and hayati 2015 ghorbani et al 2014 therefore the use of water resources in any shared social space is susceptible to conflict buckles 1999 because of this susceptibility conflicts are widespread around the world at different scales between different stakeholders e g local people communities organizations and states plusquellec 2002 in this regard reported cases show that local water related conflicts are likely growing in number and intensity gleick and heberger 2014 kreamer 2012 moreover in iran as well as in other arid and semi arid areas there has been an increase in reported cases of water conflicts in recent years bijani and hayati 2011 the upstream and downstream conflicts between farmers the department of water supply dws and water user agencies within zayandeh rud river basin isfahan province ganji et al 2007 the conflicts between farmers and dws within doroodzan dam irrigation network in fars province bijani and hayati 2015 and the conflicts between farmers industry sector and dws within shazand plain in markazi province are illustrative examples of conflicts over water in different parts of iran among which the latter appears to be a hotspot since water conflict is a salient threat in this region sustainable water conflict management depends considerably on understanding and analyzing the pattern of water conflicts in terms of the scale dimensions factors and determinants this suggests a better understanding of social factors that disturb the status quo and lead to individual conflict behaviors accordingly this paper aims at systematically investigating and understanding various facets of water conflict behaviors and its internal process in the shazand plain iran using an extended theory of planned behavior the paper proceeds as follows in the next section an in depth review of the related literature is presented the subsequent section provides a description of the methodology involving research method variables and measurement study site data collection process sample profiles and tools for data analysis next the study results are reported lastly discussion and conclusion for future work are provided 2 literature review 2 1 water and conflict the widely heard warning that the next war will be a water war or the next war in the middle east will be over water reveals that the issue of water conflict is expected to be the major threat to human life furthermore there has been an increase in reported cases of water related conflicts and violence although the major part of this increase seems to be the return to improvements in reporting such as new internet tools it is also undoubtedly due to increased tensions and disputes over scarce water resources another important point is the shift in the nature of conflicts from national water disputes to sub national and local violence over water access this may be caused by the conflicts over equitable access to water strategies for sharing during shortages and water contamination gleick and heberger 2014 water as a highly precious natural resource is offered to different types of stakeholders the multi purpose stakeholders are the major stumbling blocks for most of the unmitigated water conflicts therefore a wide spectrum of water conflicts appears throughout the local level where inter group conflicts over water have been introduced as serious threats therefore a better understanding of types of inter group conflicts needs to be identified and the beneficiaries need to be indicated generally they include various public policy maker centers such as government officials departments of agriculture departments of water management downstream and upstream river sections potable water and irrigation supply systems farmers and other stakeholders in agriculture and factory owners bijani and hayati 2011 brouwer et al 2003 chanya et al 2014 foster and gardu√±o 2004 tarigan et al 2014 in iran it is apparent that the main water conflict is shared between all water affected stakeholders and the government for example in the agricultural sector specifically the water conflict between farmers and the government is more acute therefore this study sets out to measure a variety of different types of water conflict in water sharing and partnerships with other water users including within households persons and groups per village between other villages villagers and water organizations and villagers and industry sectors and identify the conflict behavior determinants 2 2 the theory of planned behavior the tpb is one of the most influential and commonly used psychological theories for explaining behaviors botetzagias et al 2015 it was proposed by ajzen in the early 1990s and since then it has been used as a strong conceptual framework of deliberate behavior ajzen 1991 in the tpb as in the original theory of reasoned action a central factor is the individual s intention indeed the main assumption is that behavior is directly determined by the intention to perform behavior according to the theory a person behaves because s he has the intention to do so in turn this intention is influenced by the person s attitude subjective norms and perceived behavioral control pbc ajzen 1991 attitudes are the sum of behavioral beliefs that measure the favorability or un favorability of alternative behaviors kl√∂ckner 2013 subjective norms are introduced as beliefs about social pressures to perform a behavior and referents expectations finally perceived behavioral control depending on its accuracy determines the strength of the opportunity and ability to perform a certain behavioral alternative sheeran et al 2003 perceived behavioral control is defined as perceived ease or difficulty of performing a behavior and the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede performance of the behavior in other words it consists of beliefs concerning the presence or absence of resources to behavioral performance and the perceived power or impact of each resource to facilitate or inhibit the behavior pawlak et al 2009 tpb is considered to be applied in predicting general behavior and investigating the attitude action gap beedell and rehman 2000 webb and sheeran 2006 it has been applied to different behavioral studies and its proposed structure has been confirmed by past analyses gleick and heberger 2014 harland et al 1999 kreamer 2012 tonglet et al 2004 in this way much of the literature used tpb as the theoretical foundation for analyzing water related behaviors such as water conservation clark and finley 2007 lam 1999 trumbo and o keefe 2005 yazdanpanah et al 2014 intention to save water gilg and barr 2006 lam 2006 and alters irrigation behavior of farmers durst 2016 a considerable number of researches have been conducted to explain the formation of farmers water conflict behaviors using this theory bijani 2013 ghorbani et al 2014 bijani 2013 confirmed the relationship between environmental values beliefs and norms toward agricultural water conflict behaviors accordingly farmers conflict behaviors are best predicted by norms generally norms are defined as expectations about behavior and description of concepts rooted in reference group attitude and cultures de grahl 2012 all these efforts provide insight offer the potential for the successful exploration of behavioral constructs and open up new possibilities in the evaluation of behavior hence this research tries to put flesh on the bones of the tpb model and build different perspectives on the relationship between variables and deliberate water conflict behavior in this regard several researchers have confirmed the usefulness of extending tpb by adding the variables in different boards and improving the model s explanatory power cheung and to 2017 gao et al 2017 li et al 2018 singh et al 2017 accordingly this study tries to improve the tpb model by additional variables capable of influencing water conflict behavior it also expresses the synergistic effect of intentions on a conflict behavior when simultaneous occurrence of different layers of conflict behavior takes place 2 3 inclusion of additional constructs in the tpb although the tpb often receives strong empirical support it has been criticized for its lack of comprehensiveness in addressing affective influences upon multiple intentions and behaviors kl√∂ckner and bl√∂baum 2010 in contrast to the wealth of literature on tpb model empirical studies including the interactions between major constructs thought to underlie behavior are rare consequently using multi faceted intentions approach the present study will fill the gap in the literature by employing the modified tpb model and explaining local water conflict behavior the present model is believed to significantly improve the theory especially when behavior is triggered by multi intention cues furthermore the tpb has been criticized for neglecting mental space e g shared environmental values postulated religious attitude sense of loss and belief in ambiguity reader is referred to manstead 2000 kaiser et al 2005 therefore this research acknowledges the theoretical gap and adds mental space to the tpb which will be described in detail in the following the mental space means a temporary knowledge structure created for the purpose of local understanding fauconnier 1994 expressive mental space is stimulated by cues associated with the individual values senses and local knowledge katz 1960 the concept has also been extended to epistemic distance which allows exploring the attitude to a given mental space as hypothetical dancygier 2002 the cognitive mental space refers to senses and values hines et al 1986 moreover the reasons for holding or changing attitudes are found in the functions of mental space katz 1960 accordingly consistent with the environment behavior theory s assumption environmental values have a direct impact on attitude stern 2000 expressive attitudes are aroused by cues associated with the mental space katz 1960 to understand how to manage water conflict behavior one must identify at least some of the factors that can influence such intention and attitude newhouse 1990 clearly attitude cannot be represented in physical space and instead must be treated as existing in mental space howard and cambria 2013 in this regard this research represents an attempt to add mental space asan essential component into attitude by examining how the concept of mental space might expand our current understanding of water shortage attitude based on the discussion and standard tpb assumptions the following hypotheses can be proposed h1 mental space of farmers significantly influences their attitude toward water conflict behavior h2 multiple intentions of conflict significantly influence the farmers actual conflict behavior h3 subjective norms significantly influence the farmers intention of conflict on water resources h4 pbc significantly influences the farmers intention of water resources conflict 3 methodology a cross sectional survey approach was implemented to understand farmers water conflicts as multifunctional nature and an attempt was made to identify the key determinants of farmers conflict behaviors in an internal social context schematic representation of the theoretical framework of the study is illustrated in fig 1 3 1 variables and measurements the definitions and measurements of the variables in the study are further defined as follows environmental values a tripartite classification of environmental values was outlined by stern 2000 which argued that beliefs could be activated throughout altruistic egoistic and biospheric values measures of the values were based on an adapted version of schwartz s value scale 1992 which was used by stern and colleagues in their study stern et al 1999 the scale consists of 13 items containing five items to measure the egoistic four items for the altruistic and four items to measure the biospheric value this variable was measured using a likert type scale ranging from 1 disagree to 3 agree spiritual values spiritual values have been considered in emotional terms often referring to the subjective experience of a sacred dimension so that they have been defined as beliefs in a supernatural realm schuurmans stekhoven 2014 spiritual value refers to the concepts such as integrity justice respect and responsibility that give purpose and meaning to the path of life jurkiewicz and giacalone 2004 this variable was measured with 12 items each item was rated in a 3 point likert scale to appraise farmers agreement with a series of spiritual and religious beliefs water shortage attitude three aspects of farmers perceptions of water crisis have been measured perceptions of water shortage and influencing factors perceptions of different aspects of water crises potential explanatory factors and finally perceptions of the factors behind local water crisis and the consequences of different factors on villagers perceptions yu et al 2013 these dimensions were assessed in a 3 point likert type scale sense of loss in this study the sense of loss of water resources was viewed as a lack of expected water resource gain which results in psychological stress it is interesting to note it was a more profound sense of loss coupled with strong positive emotional bonds in this questionnaire 6 items were rated on a 3 point likert type scale ranging from 1 disagree to 3 agree belief in ambiguity introduced as a subjective role of ambiguity that was defined as the existence of a lack of transparency in decision making for water management this ambiguity can be a root of conflict among different stakeholders especially farmers and the government respondents belief in ambiguity was measured by a 5 item scale with a 3 point response likert scale including beliefs in ambiguity in water allocation or distribution water reality and dual and contradictory behavior of government agents social capital the questionnaire survey method can be effective in measuring social capital levels in rural areas yamaoka et al 2008 the social capital construct was measured by using eight items regarding trust membership and participation on a 3 point likert scale to indicate the degree to which they agree or disagree with the statements culture of conflict the conflict culture or shared norms specifies how conflict should be organized in a social setting dimensions have been considered in four distinct conflict cultures dominating conflict cultures collaborative conflict cultures avoidant conflict cultures and passive aggressive conflict cultures gelfand et al 2008 conflict culture dimensions included a 10 item survey instrument using a 3 point likert scale rating conflict expectation this construct portrays the future of conflict bilgrami 2004 to understand conflict expectations there is a spectrum of possible expectations among different stakeholders individuals and groups government organizations and industry sectors responses were offered on a 3 point likert scale this variable included three expectations the farmer s expectations of conflict between industry and agriculture sectors 3 items the farmer s expectations of conflict between government water organizations and farmers 3 items and the farmer s expectations of conflict among farmers 3 items water conflict behavior this variable is defined as the farmer s reaction to the perception that his own and another party s current aspirations over the water resources cannot be achieved simultaneously due to incompatible interests this construct was measured along four conflict types these include within group in similar settlement e g farmer s neighbors in their villages within group out of the same settlement e g farmers reside in their village settlementswith farmers of other villages between farmers and industry and between farmers and state water organization in this research modified barli s scale is used to understand and analyze the conflict types barli et al 2006 3 2 tools for analysis data was processed using ibm s spss 21 and amos 20 software the combination of this software as suggested by recent studies yazdanpanah et al 2014a yazdanpanah et al 2015 keshavarz and karami 2016 besides the user friendliness has allowed the ease of visual illustration of the conceptual models yazdanpanah et al 2014b the data processing in this study followed a two step approach e g measurement model and structural model as recommended by anderson and gerbing 1988 first to determine whether or not the items loaded on their respective scales the confirmatory factor analysis cfa was used after achieving a satisfactory fit the structural modeling was used to find the best fitting model and test the variables casual relationship so the second stage involved testing the structural model and the hypotheses by providing path coefficients standardized regression coefficients for each hypothesized relationship bagozzi and yi 1988 sem technique is most widely used for complex model testing and has been suggested especiallywhen a large number of linking constructs need to be analyzed such as in this present study hair et al 2014 yazdanpanah et al 2015 model comparisons between existing model and proposed model in this study have been provided to develop a robust model in explaining water conflict among different stakeholders 4 results 4 1 shazand plain as a study site the markazi province iran is the study area of this research the province is a two fold region where agriculture and industrial poles interact accordingly there is a huge competition for water consumption from industrial and agricultural sectors in the region among these shazand plain as a main agricultural based region of the province was considered sharp growth and high water consumption industry in this region accountforalarge agricultural land fraction consequently farmers who are well owners are inevitably opposed to the interests of dominant sector the shazand alluvial aquifer latitude 33 43 to 34 10 longitude 49 17 to 49 51 topography with elevation 1840 to 3322 m above mean sea level is located 35 km from arak city the provincial capital of markazi iran the basin area is 1021 8 km2 which is classified as a part of qareh chai basin fig 2 approximately 50 percent of the basin area includes highlands and hard formations and 44 85 percent contain sub mount structure and alluvial fans pooyandab 2009 therefore shazand plain is topographically expressed as a mountainous region annual minimum temperature has been recorded in january 34 5 c and its maximum was observed in july 38 c the thickest part 110 m is situated in the south eastern plain and its section with 10 to 20 m is located at the marginal and central regions the mean annual precipitation received over the basin area is 430 mm so the region is classified as arid climate shazand plain was well known as a fertile region due to outflow from groundwater reservoir in this plain therefore most of the inhabitants relied on farming unfortunately excessive depletion affects this region estimates show that there are at least 203 689 million cubic meters of water extracted by 1245 deep and semi deep wells and 49 82 million cubic meters by 129 springs and qanats 1 1 a qanat system comprises a series of well like vertical access shafts connected through a gently sloping hand dug underground channel that is used to extract and transport groundwater in arid areas madani et al 2016 pooyandab 2009 also over the past few years extension of irrigated farming and orchard fields in the area has been affected by the development of cities and industries in this period rapid growth of large and powerful national level factories and industries decreased agricultural activities and induced sweeping changes in agricultural sectors davudirad et al 2016 this plain contains 58 villages since both agricultural and industry sites were involved in water conflict in the first step 25 villages have been highlighted and half of the target villages were randomly selected in the second step according to krejcie and morgan 1970 sample size table the samples were randomly drawn from 215 out of 540 agricultural well owners farmers within 12 selected villages the study was designed as a cross sectional survey with the help of structured questionnaire all data were gathered based on face to face interviews with farmers who were well owners in the winter of 2017 the questionnaire covered the variables emphasized in the study model before the final version of the questionnaire was finalized a panel of experts confirmed the validity of the questionnaire items considering their comments minor adjustments were made to the wording and phrasing of the constructs prior to the survey the questionnaire was pre tested using a sample of 16 farmers in a village outside the study area and was revised based on the pilot study results the typical respondents of the survey were between 18 and 85 years of age with an average age of 51 29 years sd 17 56 the sample had a mean education level of 6 52 years min 0 and max 18 respondents were also asked to indicate the number of family members who are qualified to be employed in agricultural or industry sectors considering this the number of employed persons in agricultural and industry sector per household was an average of 2 and 1 respectively accordingly over 76 1 percent of the sample was primarily dependent on agriculture for their livelihood and the average cultivated land was 9 2 ha per farmer moreover 25 4 64 9 and 9 7 percent of farmers had deep wells semi deep or both deep and semi deep wells respectively 4 2 summary statistics of the measured variables in order to give a clear picture of the measured constructs in the study a brief description of status of the variables employed is presented the mean and standard deviation of all the measured constructs are given in table 1 the main variable of the study was the conflict types between farmers and other different water stakeholders in this regard conflict between different stakeholders can be categorized into four broad types as shown in table 1 farmers to farmers within a village i farmers to farmers in different villages ii farmers to industry iii and farmers to water responsible organizations iv based on table 1 conflict type iii x 2 73 is almost 1 65 times higher than that of conflict type i x 1 65 this means that conflict between farmers and industry is the most prevalent conflict type found in the study site in contrast the conflict within farmers to farmers is minimal the next conflict is the conflict type iv x 2 63 according to these findings it can be concluded that the conflict between farmers and industry and farmers with water responsible organizations are the prominent conflict types in the region in addition the culture of conflict was considered as perceived behavioral control in this research the low average value of this variable x 2 17 suggests poor cooperation between farmers which might lead to dysfunctionality these results revealed that the distributions of the environmental values were negatively skewed see table 1 meanwhile the mean score showed that farmers with an altruistic value x 2 65 had the highest level of adherence to environmental values followed by those with biospheric value orientation x 2 49 the lowest level is for the egoistics x 1 58 altruistic value orientated farmers gain pleasure from helping others and try to do their best to achieve the utmost result and serve the interests of their society van der mandele and van witteloostuijn 2015 it seems that they are not apathetic to their environment government decisions concerning water distribution allocation and use must include the right of farmers to use water surely the ambiguity and lack of enlightenment in water management policies besides a sense of loss of right to use water are expected to lead to intensified conflicts results indicated that farmers believed strongly in ambiguity of behavioural patterns of water responsible organisations table 1 as it is shown in table 1 in this study social norms contain a wide variety of variables the table shows that the mean score of social capital is 2 41 findings also showed that in spite of the higher organization conflict expectation x 2 76 farmer conflict expectation is lower x 1 93 than that of the industry s conflict expectation 4 3 measurement model analysis according to the two stage approach of anderson and gerbing 1988 in the first stage confirmatory factor analysis cfa was applied to the new theoretical framework with the aim of obtaining the information about validity scales from the initial cfa findings the fit indices represented adequate model fit œá2 1291 992 df 1211 p 0 052 œá2 df 1 067 cfi 0 983 tli 0 982 ifi 0 983 gfi 0 815 agfi 0 797 rmsea 0 018 but seven six and three items with factor loadings less than 0 5 were removed from the religious culture and social capital scale respectively again cfa was applied on the modified theoretical framework the value represented a better model fit cfi 0 963 tli 0 961 ifi 0 964 rmsea 0 025 the œá2 test of the model fit was significant œá2 df 1 146 œá2 1531 451 df 1355 p 0 001 as recommended by hair et al 2014 the cfi value above 0 9 could be acceptable for a sample size of 215 with 81 measurement items therefore the cfa results in the new proposed theoretical framework met the criteria of reliability and validity since each construct contained multiple measurements items the internal consistency among items and the construct reliability were measured by cronbach s alpha and composite reliability cr tests respectively cronbach s alpha values ranged from 0 600 to 0 886 it was reported in table 1 as argued by hair et al 1998 a value above 0 50 is acceptable in social psychological research the composite reliability cr values 0 755 0 948 show that all values exceed the recommended level of 0 60 and higher bagozzi and yi 1988 further this study examined the convergent validity using factor loading average variance extracted and discriminant validity the value of factor loadings of all items was above the recommended level of 0 50 ranges from 0 505 to 0 917 as suggested by chin et al 1997 the average variance extracted ave values were at least equal to 0 50 and higher which provide evidence of discriminant validity fornell and larcker 1981 table 1 presents the values 4 4 structural model goodness of fit statistic the second stage of anderson and gerbing s 1988 two stage approach entails testing the proposed structural model hence in order to confirm the structural model the maximum likelihood estimate method was used once the best fitted model was identified it was tested for goodness of fit statistics using structural analysis the fit indices suggested that the extended tpb model had an improved explanatory capacity œá2 64 142 df 62 p 0 401 œá2 df 1 035 gfi 0 956 agfi 0 936 cfi 0 987 tli 0 984 ifi 0 988 rmsea 0 013 covering 13 3 of the variance of water conflict behavior 19 2 of variance of industry water conflict expectation and 33 3 of the variance of water shortage attitude however compared to the original model œá2 10 939 df 5 p 0 053 œá2 df 2 58 gfi 0 980 agfi 0 941 cfi 0 881 tli 0 762 ifi 0 892 rmsea 0 075 some goodness of fit indices in the extended model were all within acceptable limits and showed good model fit the original tpb model explained 10 3 of the variance in industry water conflict behavior and 9 9 of the variance in average industry conflict expectation scores 4 5 hypothesis testing the results of linear regression are reported in table 2 the variables postulated in the framework were included in a series of linear regressions the theoretical model hypothesized that mental space variables belief in ambiguity sense of loss spiritual values and environmental values biospheric egoistic values and altruistic values should influence the water shortage attitude for the first multiple linear regression analysis in which attitude was considered as dependent variable the most relevant mental space variables were regarded as independent factors based on the adjusted squared r at this stage of the analysis which reveals the percentage of the variance shared by mental space variables see table 3 the model has a moderate predictive power to provide relatively robust water shortage attitude prediction in other words the independent variables explained 33 2 of the variance in the water shortage attitude meanwhile religious values p 0 01 Œ≤ 0 251 and belief in ambiguity p 0 01 Œ≤ 0 221 were stronger and biospheric values p 0 05 Œ≤ 0 109 and egoistic values p 0 05 Œ≤ 0 130 were weaker predictors respectively the positive signs of biospheric and altruistic values indicate that an increase in these variables would result in an increase in water shortage attitude but for the negative sign of the remaining variables any increase would result in decrease in dependent variable among these the biospheric value was the only variable that could not play a significant role in predicting water shortage attitude following the theoretical model the second regression analysis was made in a similar way the dependent variable in this multiple regression model was the intention of conflict the multi intention variable included an expectation of conflict with industry organization and at farmer levels based on the regression f test result and the probability of significance for the model formulated in this study f 0 778 p 0 507 it seems that the expectation of conflict in organization could not be explained by these variables also regression analysis was not significant for the farmer expectation of conflict as a predictor of intention f 2 61 p 0 052 one more explanation for this regression is that the farmer conflict expectation explained 3 6 of the variance of the intention behavior while the water shortage attitude and social conflict were not significant the culture of conflict as perceived behavioral control component Œ≤ 0 152 p 0 028 was associated with farmer conflict expectation the industry conflict expectation explained 11 70 of the variance in the intention behavior in this step water shortage attitude perceived behavioral control and social capital as subjective norms were included as independent variables among the predictor variables perceived behavioral control p 0 001 Œ≤ 0 219 water shortage attitude p 0 038 Œ≤ 0 137 and social capital p 0 009 Œ≤ 0 171 were significantly related to the industry conflict intention furthermore with respect to the beta coefficients it can be argued that the industry conflict expectation is maximized with increasing water shortage attitude while this is reverse for the social capital and conflict of culture factors in the last regression the four water conflict types considered in this study were regressed against the independent variables the expectation of conflict was regarded as the intention variable to test the overall significance of the regression and the hypothesis tests anova and two tailed t tests were applied according to the results since the p values were higher than the chosen Œ± level of 0 05 or 95 confidence this variable is excluded from the model for the conflict type i f 1 240 p 0 293 in contrast results revealed that conflict type iii has the most explanatory power r2 0 183 as it is shown in table 3 all the independent variables were significant p 0 05 the culture of conflicts Œ≤ 0 262 expectation of industry conflict Œ≤ 0 283 expectation of farmer s conflict Œ≤ 0 163 and expectation of organization conflict Œ≤ 0 144 were the most important variables to predict dependent variables separately the rationale behind the linear regression is that the rural participants of shazand county have highlighted the importance of expectation of industry conflict Œ≤ 0 283 in predicting the industry conflict behavior in this step all variables were positive and directly related to the conflict type iii in the fourth type of the conflict according to the beta coefficients the expectation of organization conflict and expectation of industry conflict are the two most important variables this is while the expectation of farmer s conflict did not have significant influence on the change of the dependent variable in this regard multiple regression analysis was conducted in this study to analyze the relative importance of each expectation of water conflict expectations of farmer conflict organization conflict and industry conflict to the estimated water conflict behavior the regression result indicated that conflict type i should be excluded from further analysis conflict type ii and conflict iv were not predicted by the expectation levels the independent variables including culture of conflict farmer conflict expectation organization conflict expectation and industry conflict expectation explained about 18 3 of variability in conflict type iii r2 0 183 in this step all independent variables were positive and directly related to the conflict iii it seems that this variable could modify the relationships between independent and dependent variables bao et al 2011 examination of the correlation matrix provides some information on the multicollinearity problem in the model high correlation between expectation variables implies multicollinearity for removing multicollinearity instead of the removal of redundant variable the whole expectation the dependent conflict variable was subjected to regression analysis by certain levels of expectation farmer conflict organization conflict and industry conflict furthermore path analysis was used to identify causal relation between the constructs of the extended tpb model fig 3 the table 3 showed the standard path coefficient between variables these coefficients revealed that the culture of conflict as perceived behavioral control had the greatest direct positive effect on conflict behavior 0 261 followed by industry conflict expectation intention 0 208 organization conflict expectation had a greater total positive effect on the industry conflict expectation 0 315 compared to the culture of conflict 0 208 and farmer conflict expectation 0 159 consequently industry conflict expectation significantly affected behavior with a path coefficient of 0 216 the variables such as biospheric Œ≤ 0 139 p 0 013 and altruistic values Œ≤ 0 367 p 0 01 were significantly and positively related to changes in water shortage attitudes which supported hypothesis 1 and 3 in other words egoistic values Œ≤ 0 112 p 0 045 spiritual values Œ≤ 0 235 p 0 01 sense of loss Œ≤ 0 266 p 0 01 and belief in ambiguity Œ≤ 0 202 p 0 01 were significantly and negatively related to water shortage attitudes which supported the hypotheses 2 4 5 and 6 5 discussion whether the sources of water conflict are individuals or not most water conflicts tend to spring from the disputes associated with perceived violation of one s comfort zone cowan 2003 planners need better understanding of these conflicts to make optimal decisions on allocations and manage conflict successfully to promote deep understanding two fundamental issues should be explained first a robust model for prediction of water conflict behavior this leads to the second issue which is the immanent effort to refine and adjust the proposed model it seems that structural model of extended tpb has the potential to build a framework upon which to predict the water conflict behavior and manage its associated context the findings showed that the proposed model had good explanatory power and confirmed its robustness in predicting the conflict behaviors likewise this model applied a common approach of categorizing complex entities into a limited number of types as proposed by von der dunk et al 2011 although the overwhelming majority of studies on conflict have treated it as a unidimensional variable ruble and thomas 1976 in this research interpersonal agricultural water conflicts were measured in four types of within group in similar settlement within group out of the same settlement between farmers and industry and between farmers and state water organization one of the strengths of this view is that it considered conflict behavior as a process oriented approach in this study intention and behavior were seen as multidimensional subjects accordingly the conflict behaviors are influenced by multi expectation of conflicts as intention variables the results shed light on the relevant and resonant organization and industry conflict mechanism that enhance the conflict behaviors among each other this means that the organization conflict expectation coupled with the industry conflict expectation intensified the organization behaviors also the industry conflict expectation coupled with the organization conflict expectation intensified the industry conflict behaviors as it is shown all significant conflict behavior models are influenced by their intentions some conflict behaviors such as industry and organization conflict behaviors are influenced not only by their own intentions but also by their counterpart behaviors intentions this coordination improved the power of the statistical test for predicting conflict behaviors in this proposed model it was expected that the organization conflict expectation would be derived from the large portion of the constructs in the proposed model but in practice the land owning factor was more important rather than the psychological factors so this model is a good predictor of industry conflict behaviors surveying dimensions of conflict behavior can be acknowledged when the conflicts are perceived to be multi faceted and hence need to be addressed in a different manner this can help authorities to better understand the conflict behavior context to manage water conflicts the conflict discourses should be narrowed and reduced down to a single narrative identity that insists upon a connection between stakeholders since less attention has been paid to the ways in which farmers deal with agricultural water crises and their conflict narratives this study attempts to reduce this gap the proposed model indicated that understanding what is truly happening during conflict is a key sticking point to valid identification of water conflict context cowan 2003 it assumes that individual mental space contributes towards the water shortage attitudes an integrated system of mental and spiritual values senses concepts and beliefs constructs the individual mental space boychenko et al 2008 zhuge 2010 for this purpose environmental values biospheric egoistic and altruistic religious values sense of loss and belief in ambiguity were identified as individual s mental space dimensions which are described in detail below in providing sound answers to the water crisis religions by providing sound principles for attaining a certain ethical moral behavior have been recognized as one of the important determinants of environmental consciousness chuvieco 2012 emari et al 2017 hope and jones 2014 therefore farmers with strong religious values are expected to have a pro environmental worldview such as water shortage attitudes however religious values were not congruent with water shortage attitudes in this study one reason for this latter finding could be that some religious doctrines falsely assert that god will provide the help to reach water resources for example misinterpretation of this verse of the holy quran we sent down water from the sky in due measure and lodged it in the earth and we are able to take it all away almumenoon verse 18 may decrease concern about water shortage however the competitive claims of multiple stakeholders on water resources the sense of loss and concern about water shortage in rural and agriculturally dependent communities are inevitable sol√≠s 2005 in contrast to rational thought it appears that the sense of loss is associated with the decline of water shortage attitudes one reason for this unexpected finding could be that low water shortage attitude is not a problem in itself but the real problem stems from no control over water used for industry purposes in the same way it has been attempted to measure the importance of each of the three considered environmental value orientations biospheric egoistic and altruistic as determinants of water conflict behaviors among the three values postulated to the model the biospheric and altruistic values were linked to water shortage attitude and changed it positively while the egoistic values negatively affected the attitude the results indicated that the organization conflict expectation dimension of intention was excluded from the regression analysis although it was expected that this dimension of expectation would be contributed to the water conflict behavior no significantrelation was found between these variables perhaps the explanation for this finding can be that owning the land is more important than the psychological factors the endowment organization sazeman e auqaf the charity organization which has been established by law auqaf 2002 was put under the supervision of the ministry of culture the conflict expectation was made in villages covered by auqaf organization this organization is the owner of land and water catchment is performed by extracting water from wells located in these villages the findings confirmed that with respect to farmers expectation of conflict water shortage attitude was not a salient variable this result is related to the fact that farmers did not perceive water shortage as a problem in this region according to the findings the industry conflict expectation was improved under the water shortage attitude and reference group norms the farmers believed that water scarcity was rooted in illegal water wells and the expansion of the industry in this area in addition the industry sectors were in contact with social leaders of the target farmers in the region who frame issues and develop understanding of their settlements these findings have been confirmed by several research scholars please see karjaluoto et al 2002 siegel and siegel 1957 yu et al 2007 in contrast it seems that the industry conflict expectation declined with social capital and culture of conflict dimensions these finding were not congruent with other evidence from different fields li√±√°n and santos 2007 these results suggested that the level of culture of conflict is the key determinant of industry conflicts thus this finding confirmed the importance of developing farmers empowerment programs in water conflict management 6 conclusions stakeholder participation especially local people is of great interest in managing scarce water resources however water scarcity has led to local conflicts in many arid and semi arid regions therefore identifying causes and antecedents of conflict can be helpful in understanding and thus trying to resolve the conflict consequently this study aims at providing insight into understanding why internal processes either do or do not give rise to farmers water conflicts the tpb has been a particularly useful applied framework to predict a wide range of behavior in diverse contexts including conflict behavior however this study is one of the initial attempts that tries to explain determinants of farmers water conflicts in the iranian context as a semi arid region using modified tpb the empirical findings have proved the applicability of our proposed modified cognitive psychological model tpb in determining the conflict of farmers with other water users in the context of a semi arid region iran further the modified tpb developed here is of practical significance since the inclusion of additional constructs farmers multiple intentions has improved predictive utility for the proposed model from 10 3 to 13 3 when compared to the tpb model just described in the paper multiple intentions allow for thick descriptions of farmer industry sector and farmer state water organization conflict grounded not only in their own intentions but also in their counterpart behaviors intentions therefore having successful negotiation thread requires perceiving identifying diverse intentions and motivations of different stakeholders in sum this study suggests to water policymakers and water responsible authorities in arid and semi arid regions that promoting the sustainable water management should emphasize the conflict management of different water users the results suggest that social capital and water shortage attitude are the main drivers of intention or expectation of conflict in addition to culture of conflict therefore empowering farmers through agricultural associations would involve them as full and equal partners in crop appraisal and policy setting improving social learning and negotiation skills are also highly acknowledged among farmers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
5954,infiltration processes in layered slopes can be strongly affected by the different hydraulic properties of the soils constituting the layers with potential downslope flow diversion that can have effects on slope stability as well as on runoff generation and groundwater recharge in this respect volcanoclastic soil covers represent a typical example as layers with strongly contrasting textures are deposited during the various eruptive phases in this paper the results of a transient infiltration test carried out in a densely instrumented physical model of a layered volcanoclastic sloping cover are presented the soil cover was constituted by a layer of gravelly pumices interbedded between two layers of finer ashes sandy loams even with such an extreme contrast in texture capable of significantly delaying the advancement of infiltration through the layer of pumices flow diversion occurred only temporarily at the interface between the upper layer of ashes and the pumices in fact although a long lasting intense rainfall was applied into an initially dry soil profile the downslope diverted water volume in form of a subsurface runoff was just a small fraction of the total applied rainfall in fact the accumulation of water above the upper edge of the pumices responsible of the subsurface runoff soon led to the establishment of a large water potential gradient which redirected the infiltrating flow through the pumices and stopped the downslope flow diversion keywords infiltration processes physical flume model layered pyroclastic deposits 1 introduction granular shallow covers involved in rainfall induced landslides are spread throughout the world in the case of slopes covered by cohesionless deposits and characterized by inclination larger than the friction angle of the soils the slope stability is guaranteed by the contribution to soil shear strength offered by matric suction in unsaturated conditions e g fredlund and morgenstern 1977 vanapalli et al

capparelli 2019 the influence of layers of coarse grained soils has been studied and exploited for the case of artificial layered covers such as those realized to prevent infiltration into landfills in this case layers of extremely contrasting texture are used so to exploit the so called phenomenon of the capillary barrier in fact in unsaturated conditions coarse layers are characterized by small retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity so to confine infiltrating water within the overlying layers and divert downslope the flow in this respect several studies have been carried out to define the most effective sequence and textural composition of the layers e g khire et al 2000 aubertin et al 2009 rahardjo et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 soil layering is often observed in natural slopes in

gradually decreasing with depth and the finest textured layers at the top e g wallace 1973 rahardjo et al 2004 in pyroclastic covers the layering depends on the history of deposition of the materials spewed out by the eruptions and on the following weathering processes as a result pyroclastic soil profiles often present several layers with contrasting textural and physical characteristics in campania southern italy several eruptions of large volcanic complexes i e somma vesuvius phlegrean fields and roccamonfina occurred during the last 40 000 years rolandi et al 2003 the resulting

variable characteristics in terms of number thickness and properties of the soil layers constituting the profile del soldato et al 2018 de vita et al 2006 weathering processes occurred in between the

and olivares 2010 several studies investigated how layering affects the infiltration process through the volcanoclastic covers of campania and the eventual triggering of landslides cascini et al 2008b damiano et al 2017 damiano and olivares 2010 mancarella et al 2012 although some authors argued that in some cases the pumices may act as a capillary barrier through which water can pass only if a critical value of the water potential is attained ross 1990 stormont and anderson 1999 the behavior of volcanoclastic layered profiles during infiltration is more complex as it depends on initial moisture conditions and on the infiltration rate in initially dry conditions the deepening of the wetting front can be hindered by the coarse layers of pumices characterized by small unsaturated hydraulic conductivity differently in wet conditions the finer ash layers present the smallest hydraulic conductivity and prevent the penetration of the wetting front in both cases the accumulation of water within the soil profile may lead to the establishment of subsurface downslope flow which depending on the intensity and duration of rainfall and on the morphology of the considered hillslope can either enhance slope drainage with positive effects on slope stability or cause flow concentration leading to local failure damiano 2018 however the effects of soil cover layering on drainage processes in natural slopes have not been investigated so far in fact most of the experimental studies dealing with infiltration through layered slopes focused on water potential and water content

layers aim of this study is to investigate the possible flow diversion in a deposit characterized by a layer of pumices interbedded through layers of ashes indeed flow diversion may affect slope stability as well as several hydrological processes occurring along the studied slopes such as runoff generation groundwater recharge to this aim the results of transient infiltration experiments carried out in a physical model of a layered volcanoclastic slope reconstituted in an instrumented experimental flume are presented it is equipped with a series of devices which allow monitoring soil wetting during the entire experiment and the measurement of the outflow from the different layers at the foot of the slope so to identify the conditions leading to the establishment of downslope flows 2 materials and methods to study the behavior of layered volcanoclastic deposits during infiltration and drainage processes an experimental campaign has been carried out in a small scale model of a layered slope in the following subsections the main physical properties of the soils used to reconstitute the deposit the characteristics of the physical model and the series of experiments are described 2 1 soil properties aiming at studying the effects of layers with contrasting textural and hydraulic properties on the dynamics of infiltration and drainage processes developing in sloping volcanoclastic deposits two soils of markedly different characteristics have been used the two soils have been collected along the slope of pizzo d alvano close to the village of episcopio near sarno a town 30 km from naples italy surrounded by mountains covered with layered pyroclastic deposits laying upon fractured carbonate bedrock fig 1 a along the slopes of these mountains on 5th may 1998 a series of catastrophic debris flows were triggered by a rainstorm of about 120 mm in 48 h del prete at al 1998 cascini 2004 cascini et al 2008a b specifically the two soils were collected along a slope with inclination angle of 20 from horizons belonging to the soil profile originated by eruption of 1780 1800 b c of somma vesuvius designated as bb and cb in fig 1b the first soil horizon bb is a volcanic ash with porosity ranging between 0 62 and 0 66 the second soil horizon cb is constituted by pumices of the eruption of 1780 1800 b c fig 2 shows the grain size distribution of the two soils determined by sieving according to the standard iso 11277 2009 specifically the usda soil classification of the ashes is sandy loam with a grain size distribution already observed in other studies in pizzo d alvano e g terribile et al 2000 de vita and piscopo 2002 bilotta et al 2005 while the pumices are a sandy gravel table 1 gives the main physical and mechanical properties of the two soils as derived by experiments on small specimens olivares et al 2019 guadagno 1991 basile et al 2003 de vita et al 2013 and mathematical model calibration capparelli and versace 2014 it is worth to note that the two soils have been selected as they present two of the most contrasting textures of adjoining layers among the horizons usually found in the volcanoclastic layered deposits of campania consequently it is expected that also their hydraulic behavior in unsaturated conditions should present quite different features in terms of both water retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity this should strongly affect infiltration and drainage processes developing in a layered deposit constituted by such soils 2 2 slope model the physical model has been built in the experimental flume available at the laboratory of environmental cartography and hydrogeological modeling camilab of the universit√† della calabria which allows deeply analyzing the infiltration process in slopes with layered deposits with thickness close to that of real slopes by measuring both overland and subsurface runoff it consists of two connected independently tilting flume branches respectively designed to study landslide triggering and propagation each 1 m wide and 3 m long the flume is equipped with tensiometers for measuring soil water potential inside the slope time domain reflectometry tdr system and probes for measuring soil volumetric water content and laser transducers for measuring soil surface displacements in the direction orthogonal to the sliding plane more details about the experimental flume can be found in spolverino et al 2019 the longitudinal section and plan view of the model are reported in fig 3 the experimental flume is provided with two series of nozzles along both sides connected to a digitally controlled pressurized water circuit able to sprinkle an artificial rainfall of controlled intensity all over the model to monitor the actual rainfall intensity applied to the slope two tipping bucket rain gauges located in two different positions within the flume are also available the reconstituted layered deposit was 270 cm long and 60 cm wide and it consisted of a 10 cm thick layer of pumices interbedded between two layers of ashes both the upper and lower layers of ashes had a thickness of 20 cm the ratio between the thickness and the length of the model did not allow to consider the slope as infinite although such a simplified geometry would be of help for the interpretation of the experimental results however the adopted boundary conditions described hereinafter were such that the flow in the deposit was mostly driven by potential energy gradients directed vertically or orthogonally to the slope surface i e related to gravity and capillarity respectively thus limiting the extension of the zones affected by uphill and downhill boundaries the layers were reconstituted in the flume with the moist tamping technique following the procedure described in olivares et al 2009 so to obtain a packing of the soil particles which was similar as the one of natural covers in primary deposition conditions aiming at achieving a homogeneous and balanced water potential distribution before the infiltration experiment the layered deposit initially in horizontal position was subjected to a series of wetting and equalization evaporation phases which lasted in total three months afterwards the deposit was tilted to an inclination angle of 38 and an equalization phase of two more weeks was carried out so to attain a nearly hydrostatic distribution of water potential the choice of the inclination angle of 38 equal to the friction angle of the ashes table 1 was made to prevent the failure of the slope during the infiltration test before the attainment of complete saturation during the wetting drying cycles the upper layer of ashes initially very loose experienced a volumetric strain in the order of 3 which resulted in a mean reduction of the total thickness of the deposit of about 0 6 cm which was detected by the laser transducers table 2 reports the characteristics of the layered deposit before the beginning of the infiltration test two pictures showing the physical model of the layered slope in the experimental flume are given in fig 4 aiming at detecting the effects of the layers on the infiltration process the deposit was equipped with 10 tensiometers located at four different depths approximately along three alignments orthogonal to the slope surface near the center of the deposit and 8 tdr probes located at three depths along the same alignments the tdr probes consisting of three parallel metallic rods 10 cm long and with an external interspace of 3 cm were buried in the soil deposit with the rods parallel to the slope inclination the tensiometers were the miniaturized type soil moisture inc characterized by ceramic cups 3 cm long and 1 5 cm wide which were placed with their longer axis orthogonal to the slope in this way although the soil volumes sampled by the two different sensors were quite different i e about 70 cm3 for the tdr probes about 10 cm3 for the tensiometers their dimension in the direction of the propagation of the wetting front were similar i e about 3 cm in both cases hence the different sampling volumes might affect the observed results especially whereas the infiltration process were not homogeneous while the tdr probes were buried in all the three layers the tensiometers could not be placed within the layer of pumices as their very coarse gravelly nature do not allow the establishment of the required hydraulic contact between the soil and the tensiometer cap so the tensiometers were placed close to the upper and lower interfaces between pumices and ashes in fig 5 the sketch of the longitudinal section of the deposit is shown with the indication of the position of tensiometers and tdr probes to increase the reliability of soil volumetric water content estimates provided by tdr the interpretation of the measurements was carried out with a soil specific calibration curve experimentally determined over reconstituted samples of the ashes capparelli et al 2018 the deposit was confined at all the sides by plexiglass panels so to have impervious boundaries the only exception was the flume cross section at the foot of the slope where a seepage face boundary condition was realized by means of a perforated metal panel with circular holes with diameter of 0 5 cm regularly spaced every 0 7 cm interbedded between the soil deposit and the panel a layer of geotextile was placed so to prevent the detachment of soil particles the perforated panel shown in fig 6 was provided with gutters at the base of each soil layer as well as in correspondence of the top soil surface so to separately collect at the foot of the slope water outflow from the three layers and overland runoff the measurement of the outflow rates was carried out with tipping bucket rain gauges located at the outlet of each 2 3 infiltration test aim of the infiltration test was the assessment of the establishment of downslope flow components caused by the adjoining layers with different textural and hydraulic characteristics paying specific attention to the interface between the upper layer of ashes and the pumices where a capillary barrier effect could arise according to the research objectives experimental conditions were determined with the aim of emphasizing the conditions which could promote the phenomenon therefore both the applied rainfall intensity its duration and the succession of the various phases have been defined based on the observed results summarizing the main steps that have been carried out were i initially a high rainfall intensity i e about 32 mm h was applied ii after about 20 min an intense overland runoff was activated thus subtracting part of the rainfall from the infiltration process iii the rainfall intensity was reduced to about 9 mm h constant until the wetting front reached the base of the upper layer of ashes iv after about 2 5 h from the beginning of the test rainfall intensity was increased to about 50 mm h and it was interrupted when a large part of the upper layer of ashes started sliding leaving some of the sensors uncovered the total duration of the infiltration was 257 min with a mean rainfall intensity of 27 5 mm h corresponding to a return period of about 100 years according to the depth duration frequency curves of extreme rainfall of the area of pizzo d alvano afterwards some of the sensors kept acquiring data until 350 min table 3 summarizes the details of the various phases of the test 3 results and discussion fig 7 shows the trend of pore water pressure as measured by the tensiometers installed at various depths and positions within the layered deposit the upper three tensiometers placed within the uppermost layer of ashes at the depth of 6 5 cm below the soil surface i e tensiometers t2 t4 and t9 of fig 7 responded nearly simultaneously and showing quite similar increasing trends of pressure this indicates that the applied rainfall intensity could be considered homogeneous throughout the entire physical model differently the three tensiometers buried at the depth of 18 5 cm within the same layer i e tensiometers t1 t3 and t10 in fig 7 clearly indicate that the progress of the infiltration followed quite a delayed and smoother trend in the upslope alignment compared to both the other two which still resulted very similar to each other with the middle alignment responding slightly before the downslope one such a slower infiltration in the upper part of the model should be likely ascribed to some possible influence of the upper impervious boundary although 1 m far and to some local soil heterogeneity as also confirmed by the time history of soil water content reported in fig 8 as measured by the tdr probes in fact probe s6 showed a much slower soil wetting compared to probe s8 and even more to probe s7 the response of the tdr probes at the depth of 18 5 cm was generally delayed with respect to the tensiometers placed in close positions with the water content that started changing only when the corresponding tensiometer registered pore pressure above 15 kpa the response delay was between 30 and 35 min for the various probes this was probably due to the combined effect of the non linearity of soil water retention curve i e coarse grained ashes showing quite a small water content variation in the pressure range between 50 kpa and 15 kpa and of the response of the tdr probes which are sensitive to the spatial average of the water present within the investigated soil volume e g zegelin et al 1989 compared to the tensiometers quickly responding to water coming in contact with the porous caps regardless of the heterogeneous response along the three investigated alignments in all cases a strong water potential gradient developed across the upper ashes during the first 40 90 min depending on the alignment this indicates that in this phase the infiltration flow was essentially orthogonal to the slope afterwards all the tensiometers placed in the upper layer reached quite similar pressure values namely around 3 0 kpa in these conditions the water flow tended to be driven by the unit gravitational potential gradient thus becoming essentially vertical the vertical infiltration rate was therefore close to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil which can therefore be estimated around 9 mm h as often observed when large scale experiments are carried out and thus soil structural porosity is involved in the flow near saturation the hydraulic conductivity results much higher than what is estimated on small specimens as reported in table 1 however both the water content and the estimated hydraulic conductivity at 3 0 kpa seem in line with the unsaturated behavior of the soil b from pizzo d alvano described by bilotta et al 2005 presenting physical characteristics resembling those of the ashes tested here fig 8 shows that the tdr probes placed in the layer of pumices started registering an increase of soil water content at quite different times and in the same order as in the overlying layer of ashes specifically wetting was registered first in the middle alignment after about 140 min about 10 min later the wetting front in the pumices was detected in the downslope section finally in the upslope alignment a steep wetting front arrived after about 200 min from the beginning of the test this indicates that the building of the water pressure gradient needed for the water to penetrate the dry pumices was controlled by the wetting of the uppermost layer of ashes as it can be seen in fig 7 in both the upslope and downslope alignments the water reached the middle of the pumices about 50 min after the establishment of the maximum water potential gradient across the layer of pumices i e when the tensiometer at the depth of 18 5 cm had reached the value of 3 0 kpa while the tensiometer below the pumices at the depth of 32 cm was still recording the initial water pressure around 38 40 kpa after about 90 min for the downslope alignment and after 150 min upslope considering that initially the pumices were at a pressure between 40 kpa and 50 kpa as indicated by the initial values of the tensiometers t1 t3 t5 t8 and t10 in fig 7 this result indicates that a water potential gradient of several meters over few centimeters had to develop to let water enter the pumices this implies that in these conditions the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the pumices was more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the adjoining ashes i e in the order of 10 8 m s the time needed for the building up of such a high gradient caused a delay in the progress of infiltration and an accumulation of water within the upper layer of ashes figs 7 and 8 this delay is even more evident in the graphs of fig 9 specifically fig 9a reports the time at which the tensiometers installed at the various depths recorded the arrival of the wetting front similarly in fig 9b the arrival times of the wetting front as detected by tdr probes installed also within the layer of pumices are reported the inclination of the lines plotted in the graphs of fig 9 gives an estimate of the propagation speed of the infiltration process i e the more inclined the line is the faster was the phenomenon clearly showing that the phenomenon progressed more slowly through the pumices than in the ashes it is worth to note the substantial agreement between the wetting front propagation speed estimated by tdr probes and tensiometers in fact the slight delay of soil moisture increment compared to that of suction can be ascribed not only to the different sampling volumes of the two sensors but mainly to the strong non linearity of the wet branch of the soil water retention curve nonetheless the outflow from the upper layer of ashes measured at the perforated panel placed in the downslope section of the flume and plotted in fig 10 did not seem to indicate the establishment of a significant subsurface runoff through the upper layer of ashes in fact only between 40 and 50 min from the beginning of the test a peak of about 6 5 l h was observed afterwards the outflow first reduced to about 0 6 l h and then increased again to about 2 l h after 130 140 min fig 10 the discharge of 6 5 l h outflowing from the upper layer of ashes indicates the temporary establishment of a significant downslope directed subsurface runoff in fact even considering the high rainfall intensity of 32 mm h initially applied the outflow corresponding to a vertical flow through such a layer would only correspond to about 2 3 l h considering the projection over a horizontal plane of the inclined outflow section as sketched in fig 11 a the observed flow rate likely outflowing through only the lowest part of the upper layer cross section see fig 11b corresponds to such a high specific discharge i e of the order of 100 mm h that it can be argued that between 40 and 50 min from the beginning of the test a saturated or nearly saturated layer formed in the ashes at the foot of the slope near the interface with the underlying pumices differently the discharge of about 0 6 l h observed between 50 and 120 min exactly equals the outflow caused by a vertical infiltration at a rate of 9 mm h thus confirming the establishment of vertical flow already argued from the tensiometer readings the value of nearly 2 l h observed from 140 to 170 min and then slowly decreasing despite the strong increase of the applied rainfall also does not seem to indicate the persistence of a significant downslope subsurface flow component through the upper layer of ashes the short duration of flow diversion depended not only on the contrast of texture between adjoining layers but also on the initial condition of the pumices as well as on the applied rainfall intensity i in fact for the given hydraulic properties of the soils the water potential gradient required for the progress of the infiltration into the pumices without accumulation of water above the interface should accommodate the infiltrating flow rate q n with the existing hydraulic conductivity 1 q n k p cos Œ± œà n in eq 1 n represents the direction orthogonal to the interface Œ± is the inclination angle of the interface k p is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the pumices the gravity driven downslope flow q s along the interface i e neglecting any water potential gradient parallel to it has the following expression in which k a represents the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the ashes 2 q s k a sin Œ± owing to the coarse texture of the pumices in dry conditions and with the high applied rainfall intensity it is likely k p i hence the establishment of a water potential gradient œà n 1 is required before the infiltrating water can cross the interface between ashes and pumices the resulting accumulation of water above the interface causes the increase of the hydraulic conductivity of ashes and if k a k p so that a significant downslope diverted flow q s may be promoted before infiltrating water crosses the interface fig 11b once the gradient in eq 1 becomes large enough the pumices below the interface progressively get wet their conductivity grows the hydraulic gradient above the interface reduces and when q n i cos Œ± the flow through the upper ashes tends to become vertical and q s disappears fig 11c therefore the persistence of the diverted flow is strictly related to the interplay between the hydraulic properties of the two adjoining soils the initial dryness of the profile and the infiltration rate in turn related to the applied rainfall intensity in fact the phenomenon is controlled by how small is k p at the beginning of the infiltration how the ratio k a k p across the interface changes in time with varying œà and how wet the pumices should become to achieve k p i the obtained experimental results indicate that even starting from quite dry conditions water pressure between 30 kpa and 40 kpa and with high applied rainfall intensity the contrast in the hydraulic properties between the studied ashes and pumices was not enough to promote the formation of downslope diverted flow capable of transferring a significant amount of water towards the foot of the slope although rainfall events with high intensity are not rare e g a rain event lasting 18 min with mean intensity of 32 mm h like the first phase of the experiment happens nearly every year they mostly occur when the soil is already wet hence this result seems to indicate that in real slopes with layers of volcanoclastic soils like those studied here infiltration mostly develops either orthogonally to the slope surface i e capillarity driven for initially dry soil or vertically i e gravity driven for wet soil these findings somehow confirm the results of the simulations carried out by mancarella et al 2012 guadagno 1991 for a slope with layers of volcaniclastic ashes and pumices resembling those studied here in which long lasting capillary barrier and associated downslope flow component along the interface between the layers were guaranteed by the very dry initial conditions and by the extremely different hydraulic characteristic curves assumed for the two soils mancarella and simeone 2012 the outflows from the layer of pumices registered from about 140 min onward as well as from the lower layer of ashes starting about 200 min from the beginning of the test are both too small to be interpreted as the result of downslope flow components through the two lower layers in fact even the peaks of about 3 4 l h outflowing from the lower layer of ashes are less than the outflow corresponding to the vertical propagation of the applied rainfall rate of 50 mm h hence in this phase of the test most of the water infiltrating in the lower ashes was still stored within the layer as also indicated by the still growing water content measured by tdr probes s1 and s2 until the end of the rainfall fig 8 a further confirmation of the interpretation of the behavior of the layered deposit during the infiltration test is offered by plotting the water balance in fig 12 in the graph the water storage in the soil is estimated by assuming that the specific volume of water stored within a soil layer could be calculated based on the average of the water contents measured by the tdr probes buried in it multiplied by the thickness of that layer in the same graph the cumulated rainfall and runoff both overland and subsurface are also plotted the overland runoff could be measured only in the first 100 min because soil material carried by the flow blocked the outlet of the gutter and made the measured outflow unreliable after that time however the overland runoff could be estimated accepting a negligible margin of error as the difference between cumulated rainfall and the sum of soil storage and subsurface runoff the estimated trend of the soil storage presents two abrupt jumps one around 90 min from the beginning of the test the other after about 200 min these jumps should be considered artifacts due to the position of the tdr probes placed at some distance below the upper interface of each layer and used to estimate their total water storage so the increment of water content was detected with some delay and it was suddenly ascribed to the entire layer even if water entered gradually with the progress of the infiltration the water content distribution within each layer became smoother and the estimated storage became more reliable hence the plot confirms that during the first two phases of the test respectively characterized by rainfall intensity of 32 mm h and 9 mm h overland runoff did not subtract a significant amount of water as the sum of cumulated subsurface runoff and soil storage after 150 min was practically equal to the cumulated rainfall similarly also during the third phase of the test with rainfall intensity of 50 mm h the overland runoff was initially small hence for nearly four hours the applied 90 mm rainfall was mostly stored within the deposit with the sum of overland and subsurface runoff accounting for less than 10 mm only after about 230 min when the soil storage seemed to reach a nearly stable value the overland runoff estimated in this phase as the difference between the other measured terms of the water balance became the major component of the water balance subtracting nearly all the 12 5 mm of rainfall applied in the last 15 min before the end of the rainfall 4 conclusions the infiltration of rainfall with variable intensity into a sloping layered volcanoclastic deposit has been studied by means of physical modeling specifically a three layered deposit inclined at 38 with a layer of coarse pumices interbedded between two layers of finer ashes was instrumented with tdr probes tensiometers for the measurement of soil water content and suction and gutters for the collection and measurement of overland and subsurface runoff from each layer at the foot of the slope starting form a relatively dry condition with water pressure between 50 kpa and 30 kpa and water contents between 0 05 and 0 1 in the pumices and 0 18 and 0 26 in the ashes the deposit was subjected for more than four hours to a rainfall of variable intensity starting with 32 mm h then reduced to 9 mm h and finally increased to 50 mm h the obtained results indicate that the layer of initially dry coarse pumices delayed the advancement of the wetting front inducing the accumulation of water into the overlying ashes and the temporary establishment of a downslope directed subsurface flow driven by the component of gravity parallel to the slope this was due to the very small value of the unsaturated conductivity of dry pumices which required the building up of a high gradient of pressure to let the water penetrate through them however for the considered experimental conditions the textural difference between the ashes sandy loam and pumices gravel with sand was not so large to let this condition persist for long time and after about 10 min as soon as the infiltration through the pumices started the subsurface runoff stopped afterwards the infiltration process continued with flow direction always between orthogonal to the slope when the prevailing gradient was due to capillarity and vertical when gravity dominated the amount of water drained by the subsurface runoff towards the foot of the slope was therefore quite small compared to the total infiltrated volume the persistence of the diverted flow for a longer time would be favored by a dryer initial condition and by the application of a higher rainfall intensity however considering that the duration and intensity of the applied rainfall were quite extreme i e more than 90 mm falling in about four hours the obtained results suggest that in real slopes it is very unlikely that the presence of coarse layers of pumices might induce the establishment of significant downslope subsurface drainage nor the attainment of saturation in the overlying finer layers the infiltration processes might be only temporarily delayed but with flow mostly remaining orthogonal to the slope surface this result indicates that the layers of pumices very unlikely cause the overlying ashes to become so wet to compromise their equilibrium

5954,infiltration processes in layered slopes can be strongly affected by the different hydraulic properties of the soils constituting the layers with potential downslope flow diversion that can have effects on slope stability as well as on runoff generation and groundwater recharge in this respect volcanoclastic soil covers represent a typical example as layers with strongly contrasting textures are deposited during the various eruptive phases in this paper the results of a transient infiltration test carried out in a densely instrumented physical model of a layered volcanoclastic sloping cover are presented the soil cover was constituted by a layer of gravelly pumices interbedded between two layers of finer ashes sandy loams even with such an extreme contrast in texture capable of significantly delaying the advancement of infiltration through the layer of pumices flow diversion occurred only temporarily at the interface between the upper layer of ashes and the pumices in fact although a long lasting intense rainfall was applied into an initially dry soil profile the downslope diverted water volume in form of a subsurface runoff was just a small fraction of the total applied rainfall in fact the accumulation of water above the upper edge of the pumices responsible of the subsurface runoff soon led to the establishment of a large water potential gradient which redirected the infiltrating flow through the pumices and stopped the downslope flow diversion keywords infiltration processes physical flume model layered pyroclastic deposits 1 introduction granular

capparelli 2019 the influence of layers of coarse grained soils has been studied and exploited for the case of artificial layered covers such as those realized to prevent infiltration into landfills in this case layers of extremely contrasting texture are used so to exploit the so called phenomenon of the capillary barrier in fact in unsaturated conditions coarse layers are characterized by small retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity so to confine infiltrating water within the overlying layers and divert downslope the flow in this respect several studies have been carried out to define the most effective sequence and textural composition of the layers e g khire et al 2000 aubertin et al 2009 rahardjo et al 2013 zhan et al 2014 soil layering is often observed in natural slopes in

damiano et al 2017 damiano and olivares 2010 mancarella et al 2012 although some authors argued that in some cases the pumices may act as a capillary barrier through which water can pass only if a critical value of the water potential is attained ross 1990 stormont and anderson 1999 the behavior of volcanoclastic layered profiles during infiltration is more complex as it depends on initial moisture conditions and on the infiltration rate in initially dry conditions the deepening of the wetting front can be hindered by the coarse layers of pumices characterized by small unsaturated hydraulic conductivity differently in wet conditions the finer ash layers present the smallest hydraulic conductivity and prevent the penetration of the wetting front in both cases the accumulation of water within the soil profile may lead to the establishment of subsurface downslope flow which depending on the intensity and duration of rainfall and on the morphology of the considered hillslope can either enhance slope drainage with positive effects on slope stability or cause flow concentration leading to local failure damiano 2018 however the effects of soil cover layering on drainage processes in natural slopes have not been investigated so far in fact most of the experimental studies dealing with infiltration through layered slopes focused on water potential and water content

layers aim of this study is to investigate the possible flow diversion in a deposit characterized by a layer of pumices interbedded through layers of ashes indeed flow diversion may affect slope

carried out in a physical model of a layered volcanoclastic slope reconstituted in an instrumented experimental flume are presented it is equipped with a series of devices which allow monitoring soil wetting during the entire experiment and the measurement of the outflow from the different layers at the foot of the slope so to identify the conditions leading to the establishment of downslope flows 2 materials and methods to study the behavior of layered volcanoclastic deposits during infiltration and drainage processes an experimental campaign has been carried out in a small scale model of a layered slope in the following subsections the main physical properties of the soils used to reconstitute the deposit the characteristics of the physical model and the series of experiments are described 2 1 soil properties aiming at studying the effects of layers with contrasting textural and hydraulic properties on the dynamics of infiltration and drainage processes developing in sloping volcanoclastic deposits two soils of markedly different characteristics have been used the two soils have been collected along the slope of pizzo d alvano close to the village of episcopio near sarno a town 30 km from naples italy surrounded by mountains covered with layered pyroclastic deposits laying upon fractured carbonate bedrock fig 1 a along the slopes of these mountains on 5th may 1998 a series of catastrophic debris flows were triggered by a rainstorm of about 120 mm in 48 h del prete at al 1998 cascini 2004 cascini et al 2008a b specifically the two soils were collected along a slope with inclination angle of 20 from horizons belonging to the soil profile originated by eruption of 1780 1800 b c of somma vesuvius designated as bb and cb in fig 1b the first soil horizon bb is a volcanic ash with porosity ranging between 0 62 and 0 66 the second soil horizon cb is constituted by pumices of the eruption of 1780 1800 b c fig 2 shows the grain size distribution of the two soils determined by sieving according to the standard iso 11277 2009 specifically the usda soil classification of the ashes is sandy loam with a grain size distribution already observed in other studies in pizzo d alvano e g terribile et al 2000 de vita and piscopo 2002 bilotta et al 2005 while the pumices are a sandy gravel table 1 gives the main physical and mechanical properties of the two soils as derived by experiments on small specimens olivares et al 2019 guadagno 1991 basile et al 2003 de vita et al 2013 and mathematical model calibration capparelli and versace 2014 it is worth to note that the two soils have been selected as they present two of the most contrasting textures of adjoining layers among the horizons usually found in the volcanoclastic layered deposits of campania consequently it is expected that also their hydraulic behavior in unsaturated conditions should present quite different features in terms of both water retention capacity and hydraulic conductivity this should strongly affect infiltration and drainage processes developing in a layered deposit constituted by such soils 2 2 slope model the physical model has been built in the experimental flume available at the laboratory of environmental cartography and hydrogeological modeling camilab of the universit√† della calabria which allows deeply analyzing the infiltration process in slopes with layered deposits with thickness close to that of real slopes by measuring both overland and subsurface runoff it consists of two connected independently tilting flume branches respectively designed to study landslide triggering and propagation each 1 m wide and 3 m long the flume is equipped with tensiometers for measuring soil water potential inside the slope time domain reflectometry tdr system and probes for measuring soil volumetric water content and laser transducers for measuring soil surface displacements in the direction orthogonal to the sliding plane more details about the experimental flume can be found in spolverino et al 2019 the longitudinal section and plan view of the model are reported in fig 3 the experimental flume is provided with two series of nozzles along both sides connected to a digitally controlled pressurized water circuit able to sprinkle an artificial rainfall of controlled intensity all over the model to monitor the actual rainfall intensity applied to the slope two tipping bucket rain gauges located in two different positions within the flume are also available the reconstituted layered deposit was 270 cm long and 60 cm wide and it consisted of a 10 cm thick layer of pumices interbedded between two layers of ashes both the upper and lower layers of ashes had a thickness of 20 cm the ratio between the thickness and the length of the model did not allow to consider the slope as infinite although such a simplified geometry would be of help for the interpretation of the experimental results however the adopted boundary conditions described hereinafter were such that the flow in the deposit was mostly driven by potential energy gradients directed vertically or orthogonally to the slope surface i e related to gravity and capillarity respectively thus limiting the extension of the zones affected by uphill and downhill boundaries the layers were reconstituted in the flume with the moist tamping technique following the procedure described in olivares et al 2009 so to obtain a packing of the soil particles which was similar as the one of natural covers in primary deposition conditions aiming at achieving a homogeneous and balanced water potential distribution before the infiltration experiment the layered deposit initially in horizontal position was subjected to a series of wetting and equalization evaporation phases which lasted in total three months afterwards the deposit was tilted to an inclination angle of 38 and an equalization phase of two more weeks was carried out so to attain a nearly hydrostatic distribution of water potential the choice of the inclination angle of 38 equal to the friction angle of the ashes table 1 was made to prevent the failure of the slope during the infiltration test before the attainment of complete saturation during the wetting drying cycles the upper layer of ashes initially very loose experienced a volumetric strain in the order of 3 which resulted in a mean reduction of the total thickness of the deposit of about 0 6 cm which was detected by the laser transducers table 2 reports the characteristics of the layered deposit before the beginning of the infiltration test two pictures showing the physical model of the layered slope in the experimental flume are given in fig 4 aiming at detecting the effects of the layers on the infiltration process the deposit was equipped with 10 tensiometers located at four different depths approximately along three alignments orthogonal to the slope surface near the center of the deposit and 8 tdr probes located at three depths along the same alignments the tdr probes consisting of three parallel metallic rods 10 cm long and with an external interspace of 3 cm were buried in the soil deposit with the rods parallel to the slope inclination the tensiometers were the miniaturized type soil moisture inc characterized by ceramic cups 3 cm long and 1 5 cm wide which were placed with their longer axis orthogonal to the slope in this way although the soil volumes sampled by the two different sensors were quite different i e about 70 cm3 for the tdr probes about 10 cm3 for the tensiometers their dimension in the direction of the propagation of the wetting front were similar i e about 3 cm in both cases hence the different sampling volumes might affect the observed results especially whereas the infiltration process were not homogeneous while the tdr probes were buried in all the three layers the tensiometers could not be placed within the layer of pumices as their very coarse gravelly nature do not allow the establishment of the required hydraulic contact between the soil and the tensiometer cap so the tensiometers were placed close to the upper and lower interfaces between pumices and ashes in fig 5 the sketch of the longitudinal section of the deposit is shown with the indication of the position of tensiometers and tdr probes to increase the reliability of soil volumetric water content estimates provided by tdr the interpretation of the measurements was carried out with a soil specific calibration curve experimentally determined over reconstituted samples of the ashes capparelli et al 2018 the deposit was confined at all the sides by plexiglass panels so to have impervious boundaries the only exception was the flume cross section at the foot of the slope where a seepage face boundary condition was realized by means of a perforated metal panel with circular holes with diameter of 0 5 cm regularly spaced every 0 7 cm interbedded between the soil deposit and the panel a layer of geotextile was placed so to prevent the detachment of soil particles the perforated panel shown in fig 6 was provided with gutters at the base of each soil layer as well as in correspondence of the top soil surface so to separately collect at the foot of the slope water outflow from the three layers and overland runoff the measurement of the outflow rates was carried out with tipping bucket rain gauges located at the outlet of each 2 3 infiltration test aim of the infiltration test was the assessment of the establishment of downslope flow components caused by the adjoining layers with different textural and hydraulic characteristics paying specific attention to the interface between the upper layer of ashes and the pumices where a capillary barrier effect could arise according to the research objectives experimental conditions were determined with the aim of emphasizing the conditions which could promote the phenomenon therefore both the applied rainfall intensity its duration and the succession of the various phases have been defined based on the observed results summarizing the main steps that have been carried out were i initially a high rainfall intensity i e about 32 mm h was applied ii after about 20 min an intense overland runoff was activated thus subtracting part of the rainfall from the infiltration process iii the rainfall intensity was reduced to about 9 mm h constant until the wetting front reached the base of the upper layer of ashes iv after about 2 5 h from the beginning of the test rainfall intensity was increased to about 50 mm h and it was interrupted when a large part of the upper layer of ashes started sliding leaving some of the sensors uncovered the total duration of the infiltration was 257 min with a mean rainfall intensity of 27 5 mm h corresponding to a return period of about 100 years according to the depth duration frequency curves of extreme rainfall of the area of pizzo d alvano afterwards some of the sensors kept acquiring data until 350 min table 3 summarizes the details of the various phases of the test 3 results and discussion fig 7 shows the trend of pore water pressure as measured by the tensiometers installed at various depths and positions within the layered deposit the upper three tensiometers placed within the uppermost layer of ashes at the depth of 6 5 cm below the soil surface i e tensiometers t2 t4 and t9 of fig 7 responded nearly simultaneously and showing quite similar increasing trends of pressure this indicates that the applied rainfall intensity could be considered homogeneous throughout the entire physical model differently the three tensiometers buried at the depth of 18 5 cm within the same layer i e tensiometers t1 t3 and t10 in fig 7 clearly indicate that the progress of the infiltration followed quite a delayed and smoother trend in the upslope alignment compared to both the other two which still resulted very similar to each other with the middle alignment responding slightly before the downslope one such a slower infiltration in the upper part of the model should be likely ascribed to some possible influence of the upper impervious boundary although 1 m far and to some local soil heterogeneity as also confirmed by the time history of soil water content reported in fig 8 as measured by the tdr probes in fact probe s6 showed a much slower soil wetting compared to probe s8 and even more to probe s7 the response of the tdr probes at the depth of 18 5 cm was generally delayed with respect to the tensiometers placed in close positions with the water content that started changing only when the corresponding tensiometer registered pore pressure above 15 kpa the response delay was between 30 and 35 min for the various probes this was probably due to the combined effect of the non linearity of soil water retention curve i e coarse grained ashes showing quite a small water content variation in the pressure range between 50 kpa and 15 kpa and of the response of the tdr probes which are sensitive to the spatial average of the water present within the investigated soil volume e g zegelin et al 1989 compared to the tensiometers quickly responding to water coming in contact with the porous caps regardless of the heterogeneous response along the three investigated alignments in all cases a strong water potential gradient developed across the upper ashes during the first 40 90 min depending on the alignment this indicates that in this phase the infiltration flow was essentially orthogonal to the slope afterwards all the tensiometers placed in the upper layer reached quite similar pressure values namely around 3 0 kpa in these conditions the water flow tended to be driven by the unit gravitational potential gradient thus becoming essentially vertical the vertical infiltration rate was therefore close to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil which can therefore be estimated around 9 mm h as often observed when large scale experiments are carried out and thus soil structural porosity is involved in the flow near saturation the hydraulic conductivity results much higher than what is estimated on small specimens as reported in table 1 however both the water content and the estimated hydraulic conductivity at 3 0 kpa seem in line with the unsaturated behavior of the soil b from pizzo d alvano described by bilotta et al 2005 presenting physical characteristics resembling those of the ashes tested here fig 8 shows that the tdr probes placed in the layer of pumices started registering an increase of soil water content at quite different times and in the same order as in the overlying layer of ashes specifically wetting was registered first in the middle alignment after about 140 min about 10 min later the wetting front in the pumices was detected in the downslope section finally in the upslope alignment a steep wetting front arrived after about 200 min from the beginning of the test this indicates that the building of the water pressure gradient needed for the water to penetrate the dry pumices was controlled by the wetting of the uppermost layer of ashes as it can be seen in fig 7 in both the upslope and downslope alignments the water reached the middle of the pumices about 50 min after the establishment of the maximum water potential gradient across the layer of pumices i e when the tensiometer at the depth of 18 5 cm had reached the value of 3 0 kpa while the tensiometer below the pumices at the depth of 32 cm was still recording the initial water pressure around 38 40 kpa after about 90 min for the downslope alignment and after 150 min upslope considering that initially the pumices were at a pressure between 40 kpa and 50 kpa as indicated by the initial values of the tensiometers t1 t3 t5 t8 and t10 in fig 7 this result indicates that a water potential gradient of several meters over few centimeters had to develop to let water enter the pumices this implies that in these conditions the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the pumices was more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the adjoining ashes i e in the order of 10 8 m s the time needed for the building up of such a high gradient caused a delay in the progress of infiltration and an accumulation of water within the upper layer of ashes figs 7 and 8 this delay is even more evident in the graphs of fig 9 specifically fig 9a reports the time at which the tensiometers installed at the various depths recorded the arrival of the wetting front similarly in fig 9b the arrival times of the wetting front as detected by tdr probes installed also within the layer of pumices are reported the inclination of the lines plotted in the graphs of fig 9 gives an estimate of the propagation speed of the infiltration process i e the more inclined the line is the faster was the phenomenon clearly showing that the phenomenon progressed more slowly through the pumices than in the ashes it is worth to note the substantial agreement between the wetting front propagation speed estimated by tdr probes and tensiometers in fact the slight delay of soil moisture increment compared to that of suction can be ascribed not only to the different sampling volumes of the two sensors but mainly to the strong non linearity of the wet branch of the soil water retention curve nonetheless the outflow from the upper layer of ashes measured at the perforated panel placed in the downslope section of the flume and plotted in fig 10 did not seem to indicate the establishment of a significant subsurface runoff through the upper layer of ashes in fact only between 40 and 50 min from the beginning of the test a peak of about 6 5 l h was observed afterwards the outflow first reduced to about 0 6 l h and then increased again to about 2 l h after 130 140 min fig 10 the discharge of 6 5 l h outflowing from the upper layer of ashes indicates the temporary establishment of a significant downslope directed subsurface runoff in fact even considering the high rainfall intensity of 32 mm h initially applied the outflow corresponding to a vertical flow through such a layer would only correspond to about 2 3 l h considering the projection over a horizontal plane of the inclined outflow section as sketched in fig 11 a the observed flow rate likely outflowing through only the lowest part of the upper layer cross section see fig 11b corresponds to such a high specific discharge i e of the order of 100 mm h that it can be argued that between 40 and 50 min from the beginning of the test a saturated or nearly saturated layer formed in the ashes at the foot of the slope near the interface with the underlying pumices differently the discharge of about 0 6 l h observed between 50 and 120 min exactly equals the outflow caused by a vertical infiltration at a rate of 9 mm h thus confirming the establishment of vertical flow already argued from the tensiometer readings the value of nearly 2 l h observed from 140 to 170 min and then slowly decreasing despite the strong increase of the applied rainfall also does not seem to indicate the persistence of a significant downslope subsurface flow component through the upper layer of ashes the short duration of flow diversion depended not only on the contrast of texture between adjoining layers but also on the initial condition of the pumices as well as on the applied rainfall intensity i in fact for the given hydraulic properties of the soils the water potential gradient required for the progress of the infiltration into the pumices without accumulation of water above the interface should accommodate the infiltrating flow rate q n with the existing hydraulic conductivity 1 q n k p cos Œ± œà n in eq 1 n represents the direction orthogonal to the interface Œ± is the inclination angle of the interface k p is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the pumices the gravity driven downslope flow q s along the interface i e neglecting any water potential gradient parallel to it has the following expression in which k a represents the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the ashes 2 q s k a sin Œ± owing to the coarse texture of the pumices in dry conditions and with the high applied rainfall intensity it is likely k p i hence the establishment of a water potential gradient œà n 1 is required before the infiltrating water can cross the interface between ashes and pumices the resulting accumulation of water above the interface causes the increase of the hydraulic conductivity of ashes and if k a k p so that a significant downslope diverted flow q s may be promoted before infiltrating water crosses the interface fig 11b once the gradient in eq 1 becomes large enough the pumices below the interface progressively get wet their conductivity grows the hydraulic gradient above the interface reduces and when q n i cos Œ± the flow through the upper ashes tends to become vertical and q s disappears fig 11c therefore the persistence of the diverted flow is strictly related to the interplay between the hydraulic properties of the two adjoining soils the initial dryness of the profile and the infiltration rate in turn related to the applied rainfall intensity in fact the phenomenon is controlled by how small is k p at the beginning of the infiltration how the ratio k a k p across the interface changes in time with varying œà and how wet the pumices should become to achieve k p i the obtained experimental results indicate that even starting from quite dry conditions water pressure between 30 kpa and 40 kpa and with high applied rainfall intensity the contrast in the hydraulic properties between the studied ashes and pumices was not enough to promote the formation of downslope diverted flow capable of transferring a significant amount of water towards the foot of the slope although rainfall events with high intensity are not rare e g a rain event lasting 18 min with mean intensity of 32 mm h like the first phase of the experiment happens nearly every year they mostly occur when the soil is already wet hence this result seems to indicate that in real slopes with layers of volcanoclastic soils like those studied here infiltration mostly develops either orthogonally to the slope surface i e capillarity driven for initially dry soil or vertically i e gravity driven for wet soil these findings somehow confirm the results of the simulations carried out by mancarella et al 2012 guadagno 1991 for a slope with layers of volcaniclastic ashes and pumices resembling those studied here in which long lasting capillary barrier and associated downslope flow component along the interface between the layers were guaranteed by the very dry initial conditions and by the extremely different hydraulic characteristic curves assumed for the two soils mancarella and simeone 2012 the outflows from the layer of pumices registered from about 140 min onward as well as from the lower layer of ashes starting about 200 min from the beginning of the test are both too small to be interpreted as the result of downslope flow components through the two lower layers in fact even the peaks of about 3 4 l h outflowing from the lower layer of ashes are less than the outflow corresponding to the vertical propagation of the applied rainfall rate of 50 mm h hence in this phase of the test most of the water infiltrating in the lower ashes was still stored within the layer as also indicated by the still growing water content measured by tdr probes s1 and s2 until the end of the rainfall fig 8 a further confirmation of the interpretation of the behavior of the layered deposit during the infiltration test is offered by plotting the water balance in fig 12 in the graph the water storage in the soil is estimated by assuming that the specific volume of water stored within a soil layer could be calculated based on the average of the water contents measured by the tdr probes buried in it multiplied by the thickness of that layer in the same graph the cumulated rainfall and runoff both overland and subsurface are also plotted the overland runoff could be measured only in the first 100 min because soil material carried by the flow blocked the outlet of the gutter and made the measured outflow unreliable after that time however the overland runoff could be estimated accepting a negligible margin of error as the difference between cumulated rainfall and the sum of soil storage and subsurface runoff the estimated trend of the soil storage presents two abrupt jumps one around 90 min from the beginning of the test the other after about 200 min these jumps should be considered artifacts due to the position of the tdr probes placed at some distance below the upper interface of each layer and used to estimate their total water storage so the increment of water content was detected with some delay and it was suddenly ascribed to the entire layer even if water entered gradually with the progress of the infiltration the water content distribution within each layer became smoother and the estimated storage became more reliable hence the plot confirms that during the first two phases of the test respectively characterized by rainfall intensity of 32 mm h and 9 mm h overland runoff did not subtract a significant amount of water as the sum of cumulated subsurface runoff and soil storage after 150 min was practically equal to the cumulated rainfall similarly also during the third phase of the test with rainfall intensity of 50 mm h the overland runoff was initially small hence for nearly four hours the applied 90 mm rainfall was mostly stored within the deposit with the sum of overland and subsurface runoff accounting for less than 10 mm only after about 230 min when the soil storage seemed to reach a nearly stable value the overland runoff estimated in this phase as the difference between the other measured terms of the water balance became the major component of the water balance subtracting nearly all the 12 5 mm of rainfall applied in the last 15 min before the end of the rainfall 4 conclusions the infiltration of rainfall with variable intensity into a sloping layered volcanoclastic deposit has been studied by means of physical modeling specifically a three layered deposit inclined at 38 with a layer of coarse pumices interbedded between two layers of finer ashes was instrumented with tdr probes tensiometers for the measurement of soil water content and suction and gutters for the collection and measurement of overland and subsurface runoff from each layer at the foot of the slope starting form a relatively dry condition with water pressure between 50 kpa and 30 kpa and water contents between 0 05 and 0 1 in the pumices and 0 18 and 0 26 in the ashes the deposit was subjected for more than four hours to a rainfall of variable intensity starting with 32 mm h then reduced to 9 mm h and finally increased to 50 mm h the obtained results indicate that the layer of initially dry coarse pumices delayed the advancement of the wetting front inducing the accumulation of water into the overlying ashes and the temporary establishment of a downslope directed subsurface flow driven by the component of gravity parallel to the slope this was due to the very small value of the unsaturated conductivity of dry pumices which required the building up of a high gradient of pressure to let the water penetrate through them however for the considered experimental conditions the textural difference between the ashes sandy loam and pumices gravel with sand was not so large to let this condition persist for long time and after about 10 min as soon as the infiltration through the pumices started the subsurface runoff stopped afterwards the infiltration process continued with flow direction always between orthogonal to the slope when the prevailing gradient was due to capillarity and vertical when gravity dominated the amount of water drained by the subsurface runoff towards the foot of the slope was therefore quite small compared to the total infiltrated volume the persistence of the diverted flow for a longer time would be favored by a dryer initial condition and by the application of a higher rainfall intensity however considering that the duration and intensity of the applied rainfall were quite extreme i e more than 90 mm falling in about four hours the obtained results suggest that in real slopes it is very unlikely that the presence of coarse layers of pumices might induce the establishment of significant downslope subsurface drainage nor the attainment of saturation in the overlying finer layers the infiltration processes might be only temporarily delayed but with flow mostly remaining orthogonal to the slope surface this result indicates that the layers of pumices very unlikely cause the overlying ashes to become so wet to compromise their equilibrium
