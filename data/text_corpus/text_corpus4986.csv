24930,predator prey dynamics are increasingly being modified by the alteration of natural habitats such alteration has led to increased predation rates and local extirpation of woodland caribou rangifer tarandus caribou in western canada linear features such as roads or seismic lines narrow corridors used for petroleum exploration that are cleared of vegetation increase predation rates on caribou by increasing wolf canis lupus movement rates and by facilitating access into caribou habitat linear feature restoration is therefore hypothesised to help reverse caribou declines however with the high financial cost to restore approximately 350 000 km of seismic lines within western canada s boreal forests theoretical predictions can clarify the efficacy of such actions we use a mathematical model based on coupled ordinary differential equations representing predator prey dynamics to estimate equilibrium densities of caribou moose alces alces and wolves under various parameter scenarios changes in equilibrium density serve as a proxy for the expected effect of linear feature restoration on population densities our model captures dynamical feedbacks between caribou and wolf densities and also includes moose which are the wolf s primary prey species with our best estimates of parameter values caribou density increased 2 51 fold if all linear features were restored and 1 61 fold if only seismic lines were restored as a comparison simulated predator reductions increased caribou densities 3 92 fold nearly twice the total response of linear feature restoration the effect of restoration was increased if caribou group size was smaller yet was less pronounced if carrying capacity for ungulates was higher by varying the parameter values and fixing population densities our approach allowed us to partition the caribou populations response from restoration into the contributions of the various mechanisms and feedbacks in particular contrasting simulation results where wolf densities are kept fixed with those where they are free to respond to prey allowed us to disentangle the relative importance of wolf functional and numerical response this novel approach indicates that most of the increase in caribou densities after restoration was due to reduced foraging efficiency of wolves especially reduced habitat overlap overall our results suggest that restoration could substantially benefit caribou populations but only if all linear features are restored which is far from realistic linear feature restoration alone may not lead to population recovery and should therefore be coupled with other direct management actions to successfully recover caribou keywords apparent competition conservation linear features predator prey interactions rangifer tarandus restoration 1 introduction recovering endangered species requires research to identify causal agents of decline followed by carefully planned management actions to remove limiting factors caughley 1994 habitat alteration is a primary cause of species endangerment worldwide ceballos and ehrlich 2002 and the ecological mechanisms affected by habitat alteration are diverse mechanisms can range from direct pathways such as the removal of resources e g foraging sites to complex interactions that alter community interactions across multiple trophic levels decesare et al 2010 predator prey dynamics are a key component of community ecology and are increasingly recognized as a major driver of population change in landscapes modified by humans guiden et al 2019 woodland caribou rangifer tarandus caribou represent a classic case of a species in decline resulting from novel predator prey ecology there is broad agreement that predation facilitated by habitat alteration is causing the decline and extirpation of local subpopulations environment canada 2012 festa bianchet et al 2011 although other subspecies and ecotypes of rangifer spp are limited by bottom up factors ouellet et al 1996 schaefer et al 2016 tverra et al 2007 the habitat mediated predation hypothesis for sedentary woodland caribou has been supported based on mensurative latham et al 2011 mclellan et al 2012 mcloughlin et al 2005 rettie and messier 1998 wittmer et al 2005b and manipulative experiments hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 across north america woodland caribou living in areas with increased amounts of human habitat alteration are known to have reduced recruitment environment canada 2011 higher chance of predation related mortality apps et al 2013 and consequently lower population growth rates sorensen et al 2008 wittmer et al 2007 one of the most pervasive disturbance types within western canada are linear features such as roads pipelines and seismic lines which are long narrow clearings created for resource exploration and extraction these linear features increase the travel speed dickie et al 2017 and foraging efficiency of predators such as wolves canis lupus mckenzie et al 2012 and can lead wolves and other predators into peatlands that were previously refugia for caribou demars and boutin 2017 the increased foraging efficiency of wolves is coupled with increased densities of wolf prey moose alces alces and deer odocoileus spp which are supported by increased early seral habitat associated with forest clearing from practices such as forestry schneider and wasel 2000 for these reasons the canadian federal government has mandated that human habitat alteration within caribou ranges be reduced to a specified threshold environment canada 2012 given that seismic lines are the most ubiquitous type of habitat alteration in many caribou ranges enormous effort is being directed at piloting restoration trials and prioritizing areas for restoration bentham and coupal 2015 neufeld 2006 yet evaluating the benefit of habitat restoration to recover caribou populations is in its infancy several trials have tested techniques intended to reduce wolf movement rates such as depositing coarse woody debris bending trees across semismic lines or mounding soil keim et al 2019 neufeld 2006 these programs were designed to provide an immediate reduction of wolf use and travel speed as an interim step until vegetation recovery occurs as well as to assist with tree growth because trees especially within lowlands typically do not regenerate without intensive silviculture filicetti and nielsen 2018 lee and boutin 2006 preliminary results have been encouraging with reduced wolf use of seismic lines and decreased movement rates while on them keim et al 2019 such trials have not yet demonstrated a population level benefit to caribou primarily because the scale of implementation is much smaller than is needed to observe a numerical effect on caribou despite these challenges habitat restoration has intuitive appeal because human habitat alteration is considered an ultimate cause of caribou population decline the primary hypothetical pathways are that restoration can either reduce predator hunting efficiency of their primary prey moose or promote forest growth that will reduce forage for moose and deer thereby reducing predator foraging rates and predator abundance and ultimately lead to more caribou uncertainty in population responses increases along this hypothetical pathway due to variation that accumulates across ecological scales carpenter 2002 therefore establishing cause and effect will be challenging in contrast other approaches to caribou recovery such as predator reduction can have much more direct and measurable effects on caribou numbers hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 leading managers to question the efficacy and cost benefit ratio of habitat restoration to reduce the uncertainty associated with habitat restoration to recover caribou the objective of our analysis was to predict changes to caribou density based on restoring linear features previous research examining the effects of linear features on predator prey relationships have focused on single prey systems demars and boutin 2017 mckenzie et al 2012 spangenberg et al 2019 and such analyses may have limited applicability to caribou population dynamics which are highly influenced by population changes in both predators and other prey species serrouya et al 2017 serrouya et al 2015b moreover these previous studies have separated the effects of the predators foraging efficiency e g the functional response from increased abundance of predators and prey e g the numerical response without explicitly linking these two processes as a dynamic feedback demars and boutin 2017 mccutchen 2007 mckenzie et al 2012 thus the logical progression is to simultaneously link the functional and numerical processes as a dynamical feedback so that a robust evaluation of habitat restoration could be achieved such dynamical models have proven useful in other multi prey predator systems courchamp et al 2003 goldberg et al 2014 roemer et al 2002 where ecological theory has proven instrumental in predicting alternative policy outcomes to help solve applied problems our primary hypothesis was that simulating reduced wolf foraging efficiency would reduce the abundance of wolves and increase the abundance of caribou we tested this hypothesis using a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporate how changes to the wolf s foraging efficiency would simultaneously affect the abundance of caribou wolves and moose fig 1 serrouya et al 2015b we explicitly addressed the two main mechanisms linking linear features to caribou declines increased wolf movement rates and increased caribou wolf spatial overlap via facilitated predator movement into caribou habitat when simulating the restoration of linear features fig 1 the management relevance of isolating these two mechanisms was to estimate the importance of restoring linear features in areas that were once refuge for caribou i e peatlands or whether restoring linear features uniformly across a wolf s territory will provide greater benefit to caribou further we isolated the effect of reducing predator hunting efficiency by fixing predator densities to quantify the relative importance of efficiency functional response compared to the feedback into increased wolf productivity numerical response holling 1959 this partitioning of processes has not often been conducted in a dynamical framework but will provide a quantitative estimate of the relative effect of the functional and numerical response we then contrasted these outcomes to expected changes to caribou density following direct predator reductions a management tool being implemented in multiple caribou ranges hervieux et al 2014 by partitioning the functional and numerical responses considering the responses simultaneously and comparing these to direct predator reduction management actions to recover caribou will become increasingly clear 2 materials and methods we used ordinary differential equations to represent the relationship between wolves moose and caribou within the western boreal forests of north america whereby wolves were the shared predator moose were the primary prey and caribou were the secondary or alternate prey fig 1 we used equations similar to those used by serrouya et al 2015b which expanded rosenzweig and macarthur s 1963 predator prey models to include a second prey species as well as density dependent predator mortality 1 d p 1 d t r 1 p 1 1 p 1 k 1 a 1 p 1 c 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 2 d p 2 d t r 2 p 2 1 p 2 k 2 a 2 p 2 c 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 3 d c d t c b a 1 p 1 a 2 p 2 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 m c where pi are the densities of the prey species p1 is the primary prey moose and p2 is the secondary prey caribou ki and ri are the corresponding carrying capacities and intrinsic growth rates c is the predator density ai and thi are the predator foraging efficiencies and handling times on the respective prey species b is the conversion factor of prey to predator density and m is a mortality constant determining the strength of the density dependence in predator mortality this model can reflect a system where an increase in primary prey moose leads to increased predator populations wolves which incidentally increases secondary prey caribou predation a process termed apparent competition holt 1977 2 1 parameter values we used data from various literature sources to parametrize the model attempting to best match ecosystems found in northwestern canada table 1 for most parameters we used data from boreal woodland caribou habitat in british columbia and alberta or mountain woodland caribou in british columbia where caribou are secondary prey in a wolf moose system where information did not exist within these areas we used data from barren ground caribou populations rangifer tarandus groenlandicus on southampton island belcher islands heard 1990 and alaska haber 1977 we used the same carrying capacity as presented in serrouya et al 2015b for caribou 0 4 caribou km2 mcnay et al 2006 and obtained moose carrying capacity from boreal alaska 1 1 moose km2 gasaway et al 1992 we also used the intrinsic growth rate for the primary prey reported as 0 39 per year serrouya et al 2015b to our knowledge no study has quantified the intrinsic growth rate of sedentary caribou in a predator free hunting free system therefore we used an intrinsic growth rate of 0 30 per year corresponding to the maximum theoretical potential growth rate reported by bergerud 1980 and bergerud et al 1983 as well as estimated growth rates of barren ground caribou in southampton island and belcher islands which ranged between 0 21 and 0 31 per year heard 1990 we estimated the time wolves spent consuming moose th1 as 0 112 years based on the inverse of 8 93 moose killed and consumed by wolves per year corresponding to the asymptote of the type ii response reported by serrouya 2013 we assumed that the time spent by predators consuming prey thi was equal for caribou and moose while moose may take longer to consume than caribou which have less biomass larger ungulates are more prone to scavenging by other animals such as ravens or other carnivores thereby reducing time spent at a kill elbroch et al 2014 vucetich et al 2004 we chose a default value of 50 km2 per year for the predator density dependent mortality parameter m but varied this parameter within the lognormal sampling we calculated the conversion factor of prey to predator densities as the number of pups per pack per year average of 5 6 pups per pack per year webb et al 2011 average pack size of 5 27 serrouya et al 2016 divided by the average number of adult ungulates killed and consumed per pack we calculated the foraging efficiency of wolves ai as the product of the buffer distance within which wolves detect prey km the attack success i e proportion of encounters resulting in a kill fryxell et al 2007 the distance a wolf travels in one day i e the movement rate km day and an index of spatial overlap between the predator and prey species table 1 see below for details the distance travelled and the spatial overlap were the mechanisms we varied to test how foraging efficiency affects caribou numbers initial densities used in simulations were 0 06 0 095 and 0 008 animals km2 for caribou moose and wolves respectively environment and climate change canada 2017a mcnay et al 2013 serrouya et al 2016 though these values have no bearing on the resulting equilibrium densities 2 2 restoration mechanisms and scenarios we tested two mechanisms by which linear features increase kill rates increased wolf movement rates and increased spatial overlap between predators and prey we calculated foraging efficiency for three variations of these mechanisms i restoration reduces wolf movement rates ii restoration reduces overlap between predators and prey and iii restoration reduces both predator movement rates and overlap in each case we calculated foraging efficiency for three scenarios i under current landscape conditions ii when only seismic lines were restored partial restoration and iii when all linear features were restored full restoration fig 2 linear features increase wolf traveling speed while on these lines and therefore increase daily movement rates dickie et al 2017 we estimated the current movement rates of wolves based on the proportion of time wolves spent on linear features and the relative increase in speed while on these lines table 2 in northeastern alberta wolves spent approximately 15 of their time traveling on linear features and traveled an average speed of 0 35 km hr off linear features and 1 05 km hr on linear features i e three times faster on linear features dickie et al 2017 resulting in an average of 10 92 km traveled per day we simulated reductions in movement rates due to restoration by decreasing the amount of time wolves spent on linear features which is also representative of slowing wolves to the same speed as unaltered habitat in the scenario in which all linear features were restored wolves traveled an average of 0 35 km hr resulting in 8 40 km moved per day for the scenario where only seismic lines were restored distance moved per day was estimated as 10 08 km by reducing wolf use of linear features from 15 to 10 because approximately 5 of wolf locations were on seismic lines dickie et al 2017 we estimated the current overlap between wolves and their prey based on the proportion of time wolves spent in moose preferred habitat deciduous and mixed wood forests and caribou habitat peatlands defined as bogs and nutrient poor fens table 2 james et al 2004 based on global positioning system gps locations in northeastern british columbia wolves spent on average 0 30 and 0 15 of their time in moose and caribou habitat respectively demars and boutin 2017 appendix i we then calculated the expected overlap between wolves and their prey when all linear features were restored by examining the differences in wolf selection of moose and caribou habitat with and without linear features appendix i the presence of linear features increased wolf selection of caribou habitat by 1 48 times and by 1 04 times for moose habitat therefore we multiplied the proportion of gps locations in each habitat class by the back transformed selection coefficients to calculate the expected proportion of gps locations in each of the habitat categories of interest with no linear features resulting in 0 28 and 0 10 overlap with moose and caribou respectively for the scenario where only seismic lines were restored we did not have data to estimate proportion of time spent in moose and caribou habitat when there are no seismic lines but other linear features are still present therefore we reduced overlap by a third to 0 29 and 0 13 for moose and caribou respectively to match the proportional reduction in expected wolf time on seismic lines we calculated the daily foraging efficiency of wolves for caribou and moose and converted these to an annual value by multiplying by the average number of days in a year 365 25 table 2 we assumed linear features would not change attack success or the detection buffer in which predators can detect prey therefore wolf attack success was kept constant across scenarios at 0 064 for moose and 0 43 for caribou haber 1977 and a 200 m detection buffer was used fryxell et al 2007 serrouya et al 2015b social animals such as wolves hunt in packs though pack structure breaks down in spring and summer metz et al 2011 during these seasons wolves hunting alone would increase encounter rates with prey but handling time would be longer and attack success lower we assumed that wolves hunted in cohesive packs to maintain a simple system when estimating various components of wolf foraging efficiency the model was implemented in r ver 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and the package desolve soaetaert et al 2010 was used to solve ordinary differential equations see supplementary r code available online final output from the models included the moose caribou and wolf density animals km2 after 800 years a sufficiently long time for all species to reach equilibrium values for all simulations we quantified the fold change in each species population density following restoration as well as the annual predation rate of moose q 1 and caribou q 2 at equilibrium which approximates the proportion of prey killed per year q 1 a 1 c 1 a 2 p 2 t h 2 a 1 p 1 t h 1 and q 2 a 2 c 1 a 2 p 2 t h 2 a 1 p 1 t h 1 note that changes in equilibrium density serve as a proxy for the efficacy of restoration to accurately estimate equilibrium densities it was necessary to run the ordinary differential equation model over a long time scale see appendix ii for example however since various other factors not included in our model might impact caribou populations over such long time scales our results should not be interpreted as a population projection 800 years into the future for all simulations we assume that restoration occurs instantly i e we are not assuming any time lag but rather we ask what would the population change be under a given landscape condition 2 3 evaluating model sensitivity and uncertainty we evaluated the sensitivity of our results to the degree of uncertainty of each parameter in two ways first we varied each parameter by 15 and evaluated how variation in the parameter values affects the change in caribou equilibrium density following restoration second to understand the full magnitude of variation as a result of uncertainty in the chosen parameter values we sampled from lognormal distributions following elderd et al 2006 hereafter referred to as lognormal sampling for the lognormal sampling we varied all parameters simultaneously and measured the variability in resulting equilibrium densities of caribou moose and wolves we drew the value of each parameter independently with 1000 iterations we used a standard deviation on the logarithmic scale of log 1 1 for most parameters k1 k2 b r1 r2 a1 log 1 2 for less certain parameters m th i and log 2 for the least certain parameter a2 see section 2 4 below for both approaches we present the fold change in equilibrium densities following partial or complete restoration calculated as the equilibrium density under the restoration scenario divided by the equilibrium density under the current landscape scenario as well as the proportion of iterations that resulted in the extinction of each species 0 001 animals km2 2 3 1 uncertainty as a result of animal grouping throughout the year caribou form groups of 5 10 individuals rettie and messier 1998 with an average group size of up to 7 0 7 animals during the winter months culling et al 2006 in contrast during the calving period females disperse and are typically found as singletons culling et al 2006 dispersion is hypothesized to reduce predation risk by reducing detectability by predators and especially for more vulnerable calves if predators can predate multiple individuals per encounter demars et al 2016 group living can therefore reduce the foraging efficiency ai of wolves per individual caribou by reducing the encounter rate with prey if predators make only one kill per encounter the likelihood of survival per individual increases in groups demars et al 2016 the variation in group size increases our uncertainty in the estimation of the wolf s foraging efficiency for caribou a2 we present results assuming dispersed individuals while incorporating uncertainty using lognormal sampling with a larger standard deviation than for the other parameters specifically we drew the logarithm of a2 for the current scenario from a normal distribution with standard deviation log 2 we then generated the a2 values for the partial and full restoration scenarios by multiplying with the same restoration factors as in table 2 42 2 51 5 for partial restoration and 26 4 51 5 for full restoration we proceeded analogously for a 1 but with a standard deviation of log 1 1 and restoration factors 13 8 15 3 and 11 15 3 see table 2 we also evaluated the sensitivity of our conclusions to grouping behaviour by directly evaluating the effect of group size on caribou moose and wolf populations following restoration appendix iii 2 4 disentangling the functional and numerical responses we evaluated the relative influence of the predator s foraging efficiency functional response compared to changes to the predator s density numerical response on caribou densities to understand the relative importance of the numerical feedback to the overall effect of restoration first we fixed wolf and moose populations at their equilibrium densities from the current landscape conditions while varying the foraging efficiency of wolves ai this isolated the change in caribou densities due to reduced wolf foraging efficiency on caribou only i e the functional response next to quantify the relative influence of the predator s density i e numerical response we kept the foraging efficiency of wolves ai and moose density constant at the current landscape conditions and compared equilibrium densities of the current landscape scenario to when wolf densities were reduced to the equilibrium density in the full restoration scenario finally we reduced wolf density to 0 002 wolves km2 representing a nearly complete removal of wolves to compare the effects of restoration to the effects of predator reductions 3 results simulated linear feature restoration reduced the foraging efficiency of wolves for caribou a2 mostly by reducing the spatial overlap between wolves and caribou rather than reducing wolf movement rate reducing spatial overlap reduced a2 from 51 5 to 34 3 table 2 resulting in caribou equilibrium density changing from 0 095 to 0 202 km2 table 3 simulating full restoration by reducing wolf movement from 10 92 km day current landscape to 8 40 km day table 2 changed a2 to 39 6 and resulted in caribou equilibrium density changing from 0 095 to 0 160 km2 table 3 a 1 69 fold increase if both the overlap and movement rate mechanisms are considered then a2 is further reduced to 26 4 table 2 assuming that both mechanisms are at play and all linear features are restored the reduction in a2 resulted in a 2 51 fold increase in caribou density from 0 095 to 0 238 animals km2 table 3 if only seismic lines are restored the increase in caribou equilibrium density would be 1 61 fold table 3 the proportion of caribou killed per year by wolves declined from 0 23 to 0 12 if all linear features are restored and both mechanisms are affected by restoration table 3 wolf foraging efficiency for moose was relatively unaffected by changes in wolf movement rate or the spatial overlap between wolves and moose related to restoration table 3 when both mechanisms are considered and all linear features are restored the proportion of moose killed by wolves was reduced by only 0 02 resulting in a 1 05 fold increase in moose equilibrium density from 0 908 to 0 957 animals km2 table 3 if only seismic lines are restored moose equilibrium density increased 1 02 fold to 0 928 animals km2 table 3 wolf equilibrium density was minimally affected by restoration simulations only decreasing by 1 04 fold from 0 014 to 0 013 animals km2 when all linear features are restored and both mechanisms are considered in conjunction table 3 3 1 evaluating model sensitivity and uncertainty there was considerable variation in the resulting equilibrium densities when parameters were varied independently fig 3 and when using lognormal sampling fig 4 though caribou populations consistently increased following restoration when each parameter was varied independently the fold change in caribou equilibrium density resulting from restoration was larger when k1 k2 r1 r2 a1 th1 th2 and m were 15 lower than the values chosen conversely the fold change in caribou equilibrium density was larger when a2 and b were 15 higher the effect of partial or full restoration was most sensitive to changes in th1 m r2 b and a2 the fold change in caribou equilibrium density ranged from 1 25 fold when b was 15 lower to 1049 83 fold when th1 was 15 lower as a result of near extinct population densities under the current landscape conditions using lognormal sampling caribou populations increased by a mean of 3 23 fold min 1 04 fold max 188 24 fold following full restoration and by a mean of 1 96 fold min 1 01 fold max 112 81 fold following partial restoration in 39 of cases caribou went extinct under current landscape conditions of those in 19 of cases caribou no longer went extinct under partial restoration and in 66 of cases caribou no longer went extinct under full restoration no other species went to extinction under any scenario the magnitude of the effect of restoration was reduced when caribou were assumed to live in groups appendix iii for example if we assume a group size of 7 animals year round full restoration increased caribou populations by 1 06 fold 3 2 disentangling the functional and numerical responses when wolf and moose densities were fixed at equilibrium values from the current scenario and thereby only foraging efficiency resulted in changes in predation rates functional response caribou densities increased from 0 095 to 0 226 animals km2 when all linear features are restored a 2 39 fold increase table 4 fig 5 when moose densities and wolf foraging efficiency were fixed at equilibrium values from the current scenario and thereby only the change in wolf densities from full restoration resulted in changes in predation rates numerical response caribou densities increased to 0 118 animals km2 a 1 25 fold increase table 4 fig 5 simulating predator reductions by reducing wolf populations to 0 002 animals km2 increased caribou densities by 3 92 fold to 0 371 animals km2 table 4 fig 5 4 discussion we simulated two mechanisms to predict the effectiveness of restoring linear features at increasing caribou populations reducing the movement rates of wolves and reducing the spatial overlap between wolves and their prey we also combined the effects of the two mechanisms and examined the scenarios of restoring all linear features or only seismic lines clearly restoring all linear features is an optimistic scenario but was intended to predict the maximum effect of how restoring anthropogenic linear features would affect caribou populations as expected simulated restoration increased the equilibrium density of caribou the optimistic restoration scenario assuming full restoration reduced movement rates and spatial overlap is predicted to have a substantial effect on caribou by increasing their equilibrium density by 2 51 fold most of this effect is caused by the reduction in spatial overlap between wolves and caribou although the effect of both movement rate and overlap provides the greatest benefit in reality restoration will likely affect both mechanisms concurrently with a reduction in movement contributing to less overlap with caribou here we defined changes in overlap as a result of decreased wolf selection for caribou habitat peatlands in the absence of linear features however reduced movement rates and therefore distance being covered while traveling through peatlands will also result in reduced overlap the total response of caribou densities to restoration was largely attributed to changes in the wolf s foraging efficiency i e functional response alone simulating reduced foraging efficiency while fixing wolf densities had nearly the same influence on caribou populations as when the numerical feedback was incorporated the numerical effect only i e changes in wolf densities resulting from restoration had a much smaller effect on caribou populations this is largely because wolf densities were minimally affected by restoration activities counter to our hypothesis that wolf populations would be reduced following simulated restoration the predator equation eq 3 was a type ii numerical response meaning that wolves were subjected to density dependent mortality m all else being equal wolf densities increase with increasing prey densities but at a declining rate because of social constraints among packs such as higher inter pack mortality of wolves as the number of packs increases cariappa et al 2011 cubaynes et al 2014 furthermore we used a type ii functional response meaning that as prey density increases the predator becomes satiated by handling time and the per capita kill rate plateaus holling 1959 if wolves are supported by a large moose population and foraging efficiency for moose is not substantially reduced by restoration as we have simulated here large changes to the predator density are not expected finally restoration would reduce overlap with caribou habitat where prey biomass is low but does not affect overlap with moose habitat where prey biomass is high the increase in caribou densities regardless of a minor wolf numerical response suggests that a management approach of reducing foraging efficiency can be an effective recovery option simulating the direct reduction of wolf populations had nearly twice the effect on caribou densities than did the total response to full restoration fig 4 these findings are supported by the stabilization of and increase in caribou populations following predator reductions in western north america hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 given that direct predator reductions can occur more rapidly than habitat restoration this finding highlights the importance of implementing multiple management options simultaneously to increase caribou densities predicting the effect of partial restoration of linear features is more difficult than for full restoration because of two contrasting assumptions the first is that restoring seismic lines will reduce the spatial overlap at the same proportion as the reduction in movement rates from the decreased use of linear features because seismic lines cover a much greater area than other linear features and extend into areas where there are no other disturbances it is conceivable that removing seismic lines will create much more predator free space i e reduced overlap than removing other linear features fig 2 secondly we assume that restoring seismic lines will not cause compensatory use of other linear features i e wolves would not increase their use of other linear features due to the removal of seismic lines given that compensatory selection for roads over natural linear features such as rivers or streams has been found to occur in other systems compensatory behaviour is likely to occur as restoration occurs newton et al 2017 we argue that the predator free space created by clearing vast areas of human habitat alteration that is dominated by seismic lines would be greater than the effect of compensatory behaviour by wolves as restoration trials expand across time and space further work should evaluate simulated partial restoration scenarios and empirically test these predictions to understand restoration effectiveness and inform implementation there was considerable variation in equilibrium densities as a result of our sensitivity and uncertainty analyses nonetheless all simulations showed an increase in caribou densities after partial and full restoration and in some cases restoration prevented the extinction of caribou populations using log normal sampling the mean predicted change in caribou populations was higher when incorporating uncertainty than when uncertainty was not included suggesting that our default scenario may under estimate the effect of restoration our sensitivity analysis in which parameters where varied simultaneously suggests that our results were most sensitive to wolf handling time of moose which is one of our most certain parameters messier 1994 serrouya et al 2015a our results were also particularly sensitive to caribou intrinsic rate of increase the wolf mortality parameter conversion factor of prey to wolf densities and foraging efficiency on caribou for both the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses there was more variation in caribou equilibrium densities under the current landscape scenario than under the partial or full restoration scenarios as such cases where the fold change in caribou density following restoration was large were due to low caribou equilibrium densities under the current landscape scenario this suggests that populations at low density receive the most benefit from reducing predator foraging efficiency via restoration because patterns were consistent and restoration always increased caribou population densities our qualitative results were robust to the uncertainty in our parameters our findings add to the limited amount of work on the potential efficacy of linear feature restoration yet highlight that consistent conclusions among studies are lacking recent work has suggested that intensive linear feature restoration can result in stable or increasing caribou populations over long time periods such as 50 years johnson et al 2019 likewise mckenzie et al 2012 found that seismic lines were expected to alter the functional response of wolves enough to affect encounter rates of prey especially at low prey densities presumably having demographic consequences conversely a recent spatial simulation parameterized using gps data suggests that full linear feature restoration would be expected to reduce caribou mortality by up to 25 but that this would likely not be sufficient to stop caribou declines spangenberg et al 2019 similarly two other spatially explicit simulation studies found that a very modest increase in wolf numbers from a numerical effect linked to ungulate densities dawe et al 2014 serrouya et al 2011 dwarfed any effect of line density or predator foraging efficiency demars et al unpublished research mccutchen 2007 these studies suggest that manipulating the foraging efficiency through restoration would have a limited effect on caribou numbers however none of these studies dynamically linked the functional and numerical response of predators whereas in reality these two components are inseparable a dynamic approach using ordinary differential equations accounts for the fact that an increased foraging efficiency will simultaneously affect the ratio of prey to predators which ultimately affects predation rates vucetich et al 2011 furthermore we were able to disentangle the relative contribution of foraging efficiency and the feedback into a wolf numerical response showing that foraging efficiency alone had a substantive effect on caribou densities 4 1 assumptions the goal of our analysis was not to predict future population dynamics under varied land use or climate change scenarios which would be very challenging given the complexity of the system instead we isolated the potential magnitude of the effect of linear feature restoration the primary habitat management action being proposed in western canada to do so we made a number of simplifying assumptions the most important of which we address here the potential outcomes of climate change that could affect caribou physiology r 2 or habitat use ouellet et al 1996 schaefer et al 2016 and alternative population trajectories i e extinction vortices allee effects were not explicitly considered when treating caribou as group living animals year round caribou populations increased following restoration but the magnitude of the effect of restoration on caribou populations was greatly diminished appendix iii the difference in caribou population response between populations assumed to live as singletons compared to when group size is included increases uncertainty in our predictions however caribou predation occurs more frequently during the summer months for both calves and adults mcloughlin et al 2003 when caribou tend to be dispersed in addition estimates of group size are female biased as the surveys are flown to collect data on calf cow ratios and therefore do not consider that male caribou are more often in smaller groups year round finally as caribou populations decline so do their average group size mclellan et al 2010 meaning that restoration effects could be more pronounced on a per capita basis with smaller populations the benefit of restoration to caribou likely lies between the solitary and the group extremes but we speculate that the benefit to caribou is likely closer to when caribou were treated as singletons for the reasons mentioned above we assume that the carrying capacity of moose k 1 and caribou k2 were unaffected by the abundance of seismic lines or by climate change seismic lines cover tens of thousands of linear kilometers and can be associated with more abundant forage for moose than undisturbed habitat finnegan et al 2018 but their surface area is minimal relative the overall landscape pattison et al 2016 for example all linear features account for 1 79 of the landscape within boreal caribou range in alberta whereas seismic lines are only 1 20 and forest cutblocks account for 2 03 table 5 therefore seismic lines are unlikely to have a substantial impact on k 1 or k2 and in this context our assumption is unlikely to affect results given a 15 change in carrying capacity was estimated to have a small influence on the fold change in caribou populations following restoration a difference of 0 14 fold change and the effect of restoration on carrying capacity is estimated to be 1 2 the effect of changing carrying capacity on caribou equilibrium densities following restoration is likely negligible indeed if carrying capacity for moose and caribou increased following restoration our results are likely conservative in that they overestimate the influence of restoration additionally sedentary caribou tend to be predation limited rather than food limited like their counterparts farther north or east climate change is expected to increase moose forage via increased fire intervals shifting conifer and mixedwood stands to deciduous stands and grasslands stralberg et al 2018 however the influence of climate change on peatlands is expected to be muted schneider et al 2009 given the uncertainty in the effects of climate change on k 1 and k2 we did not explicitly quantify the influence of climate change on caribou populations however our sensitivity analysis in which k 1 and k2 are varied independently suggest that an increase in k 1 and decrease in k2 as expected under a climate change scenario may mute the predicted effect of restoration on caribou populations future work should investigate the influence of restoration on carrying capacity of ungulates and contrast these influences to those expected under a changing climate that alters wildfire regimes schwartz and franzmann 1991 our analysis assumes that wolf use of linear features and the resulting changes in movement rates reported by dickie et al 2017 are representative of western canada the time wolves spend on seismic lines may be influenced by their availability as well as the availability of other linear features mysterud and ims 1998 the density of linear features in the study by dickie et al 2017 varied between 1 3 km km2 which is similar to or less than much of western canada therefore we may have under estimated the initial movement rates on linear features under the current landscape scenario making our predictions conservative in that the effect of restoration on caribou populations would potentially be larger than what we state an additional factor that makes our simulations conservative is that we assume restoration is instantaneous whereas caribou populations are likely to continue declining over the decades it would take to implement restoration our model necessarily represents a simplified moose wolf caribou dominated food web this simplification holds across the majority of the boreal forests of western canada wolves are the dominant predator of caribou hayes et al 2003 seip 1992 wittmer et al 2005a and moose are typically the dominant prey species supporting wolf populations messier 1994 however there are shifts in both predator and prey densities across the landscape which has not been incorporated in these models for example in some parts of the boreal encroaching white tailed deer or other ungulates may provide additional food sources to wolves latham et al 2011 or other predators such as black bears may represent a significant proportion of caribou calf mortality pinard et al 2012 understanding how these shifts in the predator prey community impact population response to restoration is important to consider when predicting the efficacy of caribou recovery strategies a final assumption is that restoration treatments reduce wolf movement to levels that approximate an unaltered forest as with the first assumption the periodic radio collaring of wolves in areas of restored habitat will be the best approach to validate this assumption while large areas of restored linear features are needed to observe a population level effect on wolves and caribou the behavioural responses of wolves to restoration treatments can be tested across a much shorter time frame nonetheless given the uncertainty we recommend pursuing restoration in a manner than can test some of the population level predictions from this model first contiguous areas must be restored at least as large as the scale of an individual wolf territory all seismic lines within this area should be removed where possible for a robust test of model predictions in summary our simple model allows us to draw robust conclusions regarding the efficacy of linear feature restoration for caribou recovery to make quantitative predictions for caribou population dynamics over the next decades or centuries however a more detailed model with many more factors such as climate change or allee effects would be necessary 4 2 conclusions the strength of this analysis is predicated on the dynamic and simultaneous feedback between the functional and numerical responses of wolves and consequent impacts to their prey this approach allowed us to conclude that linear feature restoration can benefit caribou populations but only under the unlikely scenario of removing nearly all linear features within caribou ranges it is important to note that even partial restoration seismic lines only in boreal british columbia and alberta means restoring c 350 000 km of seismic lines whereas full restoration means restoring seismic lines plus c 40 000 km of other linear feature types including paved highways full restoration is virtually impossible to achieve but was simulated to contextualize caribou densities in near pristine conditions therefore the fold change for partial restoration should be considered the more realistic scenario though still unlikely to achieve in the short term moreover increasing caribou populations by 2 51 fold to 0 238 caribou km2 following complete restoration would still result in caribou densities below what is observed in landscapes with minimal human habitat alteration saskatchewan 0 37 caribou km2 mcloughlin et al 2016 this result could be caused by broader scale changes to ecosystems such as the expansion of deer across western north america dawe et al 2014 socioeconomic constraints to habitat restoration at the scale simulated here as well as the cost and time scales required to realize the benefits of restoration treatments should temper expectations from the optimistic values we present it is unrealistic to assume complete or even partial restoration which would require eliminating over 350 000 km of seismic lines within canada s western boreal forest can be achieved in the short term in contrast our model predicts a more pronounced increase in caribou via direct predator reductions as has been confirmed empirically and in short time frames serrouya et al 2019 therefore we emphasize the need for multiple coordinated recovery actions applied in the same area particularly we suggest that population based actions such as predator and prey management or safe havens e g serrouya et al 2019 should be considered while

24930,predator prey dynamics are increasingly being modified by the alteration of natural habitats such alteration has led to increased predation rates and local extirpation of woodland caribou rangifer tarandus caribou in western canada linear features such as roads or seismic lines narrow corridors used for petroleum exploration that are cleared of vegetation increase predation rates on caribou by increasing wolf canis lupus movement rates and by facilitating access into caribou habitat linear feature restoration is therefore hypothesised to help reverse caribou declines however with the high financial cost to restore approximately 350 000 km of seismic lines within western canada s boreal forests theoretical predictions can clarify the efficacy of such actions we use a mathematical model based on coupled ordinary differential equations representing predator prey dynamics to estimate equilibrium densities of caribou moose alces alces and wolves under various parameter scenarios changes in equilibrium density serve as a proxy for the expected effect of linear feature restoration on population densities our model captures dynamical feedbacks between caribou and wolf densities and also includes moose which are the wolf s primary prey species with our best estimates of parameter values caribou density increased 2 51 fold if all linear features were restored and 1 61 fold if only seismic lines were restored as a comparison simulated predator reductions increased caribou densities 3 92 fold nearly twice the total response of linear feature restoration the effect of restoration was increased if caribou group size was smaller yet was less pronounced if carrying capacity for ungulates was higher by varying the parameter values and fixing population densities our approach allowed us to partition the caribou populations response from restoration into the contributions of the various mechanisms and feedbacks in particular contrasting simulation results where wolf densities are kept fixed with those where they are free to respond to prey allowed us to disentangle the relative importance of wolf functional and numerical response this novel approach indicates that most of the increase in caribou densities after restoration was due to reduced foraging efficiency of wolves especially reduced habitat overlap overall our results suggest that restoration could substantially benefit caribou populations but only if all linear features are restored which is far from realistic linear feature restoration alone may not lead to population recovery and should therefore be coupled with other direct management actions to successfully recover caribou keywords apparent competition conservation linear features predator prey interactions rangifer tarandus restoration 1 introduction recovering endangered species requires research to identify causal agents of decline followed by carefully planned management actions to remove limiting factors caughley 1994 habitat alteration is a primary cause of species endangerment worldwide ceballos and ehrlich 2002 and the ecological mechanisms affected by habitat alteration are diverse mechanisms can range from direct pathways such as the removal of resources e g foraging sites to complex interactions that alter community interactions across multiple trophic levels decesare et al 2010 predator prey dynamics are a key component of community ecology and are increasingly recognized as a major driver of population change in landscapes modified by humans guiden et al 2019 woodland caribou rangifer tarandus caribou represent a classic case of a species in decline resulting from novel predator prey ecology there is broad agreement that predation facilitated by habitat alteration is causing the decline and extirpation of local subpopulations environment canada 2012 festa bianchet et al 2011 although other subspecies and ecotypes of rangifer spp are limited by bottom up factors ouellet et al 1996 schaefer et al 2016 tverra et al 2007 the habitat mediated predation hypothesis for sedentary woodland caribou has been supported based on mensurative latham et al 2011 mclellan et al 2012 mcloughlin et al 2005 rettie and messier 1998 wittmer et al 2005b and manipulative experiments hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 across north america woodland caribou living in areas with increased amounts of human habitat alteration are known to have reduced recruitment environment canada 2011 higher chance of predation related mortality apps et al 2013 and consequently lower population growth rates sorensen et al 2008 wittmer et al 2007 one of the most pervasive disturbance types within western canada are linear features such as roads pipelines and seismic lines which are long narrow clearings created for resource exploration and extraction these linear features increase the travel speed dickie et al 2017 and foraging efficiency of predators such as wolves canis lupus mckenzie et al 2012 and can lead wolves and other predators into peatlands that were previously refugia for caribou demars and boutin 2017 the increased foraging efficiency of wolves is coupled with increased densities of wolf prey moose alces alces and deer odocoileus spp which are supported by increased early seral habitat associated with forest clearing from practices such as forestry schneider and wasel 2000 for these reasons the canadian federal government has mandated that human habitat alteration within caribou ranges be reduced to a specified threshold environment canada 2012 given that seismic lines are the most ubiquitous type of habitat alteration in many caribou ranges enormous effort is being directed at piloting restoration trials and prioritizing areas for restoration bentham and coupal 2015 neufeld 2006 yet evaluating the benefit of habitat restoration to recover caribou populations is in its infancy several trials have tested techniques intended to reduce wolf movement rates such as depositing coarse woody debris bending trees across semismic lines or mounding soil keim et al 2019 neufeld 2006 these programs were designed to provide an immediate reduction of wolf use and travel speed as an interim step until vegetation recovery occurs as well as to assist with tree growth because trees especially within lowlands typically do not regenerate without intensive silviculture filicetti and nielsen 2018 lee and boutin 2006 preliminary results have been encouraging with reduced wolf use of seismic lines and decreased movement rates while on them keim et al 2019 such trials have not yet demonstrated a population level benefit to caribou primarily because the scale of implementation is much smaller than is needed to observe a numerical effect on caribou despite these challenges habitat restoration has intuitive appeal because human habitat alteration is considered an ultimate cause of caribou population decline the primary hypothetical pathways are that restoration can either reduce predator hunting efficiency of their primary prey moose or promote forest growth that will reduce forage for moose and deer thereby reducing predator foraging rates and predator abundance and ultimately lead to more caribou uncertainty in population responses increases along this hypothetical pathway due to variation that accumulates across ecological scales carpenter 2002 therefore establishing cause and effect will be challenging in contrast other approaches to caribou recovery such as predator reduction can have much more direct and measurable effects on caribou numbers hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 leading managers to question the efficacy and cost benefit ratio of habitat restoration to reduce the uncertainty associated with habitat restoration to recover caribou the objective of our analysis was to predict changes to caribou density based on restoring linear features previous research examining the effects of linear features on predator prey relationships have focused on single prey systems demars and boutin 2017 mckenzie et al 2012 spangenberg et al 2019 and such analyses may have limited applicability to caribou population dynamics which are highly influenced by population changes in both predators and other prey species serrouya et al 2017 serrouya et al 2015b moreover these previous studies have separated the effects of the predators foraging efficiency e g the functional response from increased abundance of predators and prey e g the numerical response without explicitly linking these two processes as a dynamic feedback demars and boutin 2017 mccutchen 2007 mckenzie et al 2012 thus the logical progression is to simultaneously link the functional and numerical processes as a dynamical feedback so that a robust evaluation of habitat restoration could be achieved such dynamical models have proven useful in other multi prey predator systems courchamp et al 2003 goldberg et al 2014 roemer et al 2002 where ecological theory has proven instrumental in predicting alternative policy outcomes to help solve applied problems our primary hypothesis was that simulating reduced wolf foraging efficiency would reduce the abundance of wolves and increase the abundance of caribou we tested this hypothesis using a system of ordinary differential equations that incorporate how changes to the wolf s foraging efficiency would simultaneously affect the abundance of caribou wolves and moose fig 1 serrouya et al 2015b we explicitly addressed the two main mechanisms linking linear features to caribou declines increased wolf movement rates and increased caribou wolf spatial overlap via facilitated predator movement into caribou habitat when simulating the restoration of linear features fig 1 the management relevance of isolating these two mechanisms was to estimate the importance of restoring linear features in areas that were once refuge for caribou i e peatlands or whether restoring linear features uniformly across a wolf s territory will provide greater benefit to caribou further we isolated the effect of reducing predator hunting efficiency by fixing predator densities to quantify the relative importance of efficiency functional response compared to the feedback into increased wolf productivity numerical response holling 1959 this partitioning of processes has not often been conducted in a dynamical framework but will provide a quantitative estimate of the relative effect of the functional and numerical response we then contrasted these outcomes to expected changes to caribou density following direct predator reductions a management tool being implemented in multiple caribou ranges hervieux et al 2014 by partitioning the functional and numerical responses considering the responses simultaneously and comparing these to direct predator reduction management actions to recover caribou will become increasingly clear 2 materials and methods we used ordinary differential equations to represent the relationship between wolves moose and caribou within the western boreal forests of north america whereby wolves were the shared predator moose were the primary prey and caribou were the secondary or alternate prey fig 1 we used equations similar to those used by serrouya et al 2015b which expanded rosenzweig and macarthur s 1963 predator prey models to include a second prey species as well as density dependent predator mortality 1 d p 1 d t r 1 p 1 1 p 1 k 1 a 1 p 1 c 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 2 d p 2 d t r 2 p 2 1 p 2 k 2 a 2 p 2 c 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 3 d c d t c b a 1 p 1 a 2 p 2 1 a 1 t h 1 p 1 a 2 t h 2 p 2 m c where pi are the densities of the prey species p1 is the primary prey moose and p2 is the secondary prey caribou ki and ri are the corresponding carrying capacities and intrinsic growth rates c is the predator density ai and thi are the predator foraging efficiencies and handling times on the respective prey species b is the conversion factor of prey to predator density and m is a mortality constant determining the strength of the density dependence in predator mortality this model can reflect a system where an increase in primary prey moose leads to increased predator populations wolves which incidentally increases secondary prey caribou predation a process termed apparent competition holt 1977 2 1 parameter values we used data from various literature sources to parametrize the model attempting to best match ecosystems found in northwestern canada table 1 for most parameters we used data from boreal woodland caribou habitat in british columbia and alberta or mountain woodland caribou in british columbia where caribou are secondary prey in a wolf moose system where information did not exist within these areas we used data from barren ground caribou populations rangifer tarandus groenlandicus on southampton island belcher islands heard 1990 and alaska haber 1977 we used the same carrying capacity as presented in serrouya et al 2015b for caribou 0 4 caribou km2 mcnay et al 2006 and obtained moose carrying capacity from boreal alaska 1 1 moose km2 gasaway et al 1992 we also used the intrinsic growth rate for the primary prey reported as 0 39 per year serrouya et al 2015b to our knowledge no study has quantified the intrinsic growth rate of sedentary caribou in a predator free hunting free system therefore we used an intrinsic growth rate of 0 30 per year corresponding to the maximum theoretical potential growth rate reported by bergerud 1980 and bergerud et al 1983 as well as estimated growth rates of barren ground caribou in southampton island and belcher islands which ranged between 0 21 and 0 31 per year heard 1990 we estimated the time wolves spent consuming moose th1 as 0 112 years based on the inverse of 8 93 moose killed and consumed by wolves per year corresponding to the asymptote of the type ii response reported by serrouya 2013 we assumed that the time spent by predators consuming prey thi was equal for caribou and moose while moose may take longer to consume than caribou which have less biomass larger ungulates are more prone to scavenging by other animals such as ravens or other carnivores thereby reducing time spent at a kill elbroch et al 2014 vucetich et al 2004 we chose a default value of 50 km2 per year for the predator density dependent mortality parameter m but varied this parameter within the lognormal sampling we calculated the conversion factor of prey to predator densities as the number of pups per pack per year average of 5 6 pups per pack per year webb et al 2011 average pack size of 5 27 serrouya et al 2016 divided by the average number of adult ungulates killed and consumed per pack we calculated the foraging efficiency of wolves ai as the product of the buffer distance within which wolves detect prey km the attack success i e proportion of encounters resulting in a kill fryxell et al 2007 the distance a wolf travels in one day i e the movement rate km day and an index of spatial overlap between the predator and prey species table 1 see below for details the distance travelled and the spatial overlap were the mechanisms we varied to test how foraging efficiency affects caribou numbers initial densities used in simulations were 0 06 0 095 and 0 008 animals km2 for caribou moose and wolves respectively environment and climate change canada 2017a mcnay et al 2013 serrouya et al 2016 though these values have no bearing on the resulting equilibrium densities 2 2 restoration mechanisms and scenarios we tested two mechanisms by which linear features increase kill rates increased wolf movement rates and increased spatial overlap between predators and prey we calculated foraging efficiency for three variations of these mechanisms i restoration reduces wolf movement rates ii restoration reduces overlap between predators and prey and iii restoration reduces both predator movement rates and overlap in each case we calculated foraging efficiency for three scenarios i under current landscape conditions ii when only seismic lines were restored partial restoration and iii when all linear features were restored full restoration fig 2 linear features increase wolf traveling speed while on these lines and therefore increase daily movement rates dickie et al 2017 we estimated the current movement rates of wolves based on the proportion of time wolves spent on linear features and the relative increase in speed while on these lines table 2 in northeastern alberta wolves spent approximately 15 of their time traveling on linear features and traveled an average speed of 0 35 km hr off linear features and 1 05 km hr on linear features i e three times faster on linear features dickie et al 2017 resulting in an average of 10 92 km traveled per day we simulated reductions in movement rates due to restoration by decreasing the amount of time wolves spent on linear features which is also representative of slowing wolves to the same speed as unaltered habitat in the scenario in which all linear features were restored wolves traveled an average of 0 35 km hr resulting in 8 40 km moved per day for the scenario where only seismic lines were restored distance moved per day was estimated as 10 08 km by reducing wolf use of linear features from 15 to 10 because approximately 5 of wolf locations were on seismic lines dickie et al 2017 we estimated the current overlap between wolves and their prey based on the proportion of time wolves spent in moose preferred habitat deciduous and mixed wood forests and caribou habitat peatlands defined as bogs and nutrient poor fens table 2 james et al 2004 based on global positioning system gps locations in northeastern british columbia wolves spent on average 0 30 and 0 15 of their time in moose and caribou habitat respectively demars and boutin 2017 appendix i we then calculated the expected overlap between wolves and their prey when all linear features were restored by examining the differences in wolf selection of moose and caribou habitat with and without linear features appendix i the presence of linear features increased wolf selection of caribou habitat by 1 48 times and by 1 04 times for moose habitat therefore we multiplied the proportion of gps locations in each habitat class by the back transformed selection coefficients to calculate the expected proportion of gps locations in each of the habitat categories of interest with no linear features resulting in 0 28 and 0 10 overlap with moose and caribou respectively for the scenario where only seismic lines were restored we did not have data to estimate proportion of time spent in moose and caribou habitat when there are no seismic lines but other linear features are still present therefore we reduced overlap by a third to 0 29 and 0 13 for moose and caribou respectively to match the proportional reduction in expected wolf time on seismic lines we calculated the daily foraging efficiency of wolves for caribou and moose and converted these to an annual value by multiplying by the average number of days in a year 365 25 table 2 we assumed linear features would not change attack success or the detection buffer in which predators can detect prey therefore wolf attack success was kept constant across scenarios at 0 064 for moose and 0 43 for caribou haber 1977 and a 200 m detection buffer was used fryxell et al 2007 serrouya et al 2015b social animals such as wolves hunt in packs though pack structure breaks down in spring and summer metz et al 2011 during these seasons wolves hunting alone would increase encounter rates with prey but handling time would be longer and attack success lower we assumed that wolves hunted in cohesive packs to maintain a simple system when estimating various components of wolf foraging efficiency the model was implemented in r ver 3 3 1 r core team 2016 and the package desolve soaetaert et al 2010 was used to solve ordinary differential equations see supplementary r code available online final output from the models included the moose caribou and wolf density animals km2 after 800 years a sufficiently long time for all species to reach equilibrium values for all simulations we quantified the fold change in each species population density following restoration as well as the annual predation rate of moose q 1 and caribou q 2 at equilibrium which approximates the proportion of prey killed per year q 1 a 1 c 1 a 2 p 2 t h 2 a 1 p 1 t h 1 and q 2 a 2 c 1 a 2 p 2 t h 2 a 1 p 1 t h 1 note that changes in equilibrium density serve as a proxy for the efficacy of restoration to accurately estimate equilibrium densities it was necessary to run the ordinary differential equation model over a long time scale see appendix ii for example however since various other factors not included in our model might impact caribou populations over such long time scales our results should not be interpreted as a population projection 800 years into the future for all simulations we assume that restoration occurs instantly i e we are not assuming any time lag but rather we ask what would the population change be under a given landscape condition 2 3 evaluating model sensitivity and uncertainty we evaluated the sensitivity of our results to the degree of uncertainty of each parameter in two ways first we varied each parameter by 15 and evaluated how variation in the parameter values affects the change in caribou equilibrium density following restoration second to understand the full magnitude of variation as a result of uncertainty in the chosen parameter values we sampled from lognormal distributions following elderd et al 2006 hereafter referred to as lognormal sampling for the lognormal sampling we varied all parameters simultaneously and measured the variability in resulting equilibrium densities of caribou moose and wolves we drew the value of each parameter independently with 1000 iterations we used a standard deviation on the logarithmic scale of log 1 1 for most parameters k1 k2 b r1 r2 a1 log 1 2 for less certain parameters m th i and log 2 for the least certain parameter a2 see section 2 4 below for both approaches we present the fold change in equilibrium densities following partial or complete restoration calculated as the equilibrium density under the restoration scenario divided by the equilibrium density under the current landscape scenario as well as the proportion of iterations that resulted in the extinction of each species 0 001 animals km2 2 3 1 uncertainty as a result of animal grouping throughout the year caribou form groups of 5 10 individuals rettie and messier 1998 with an average group size of up to 7 0 7 animals during the winter months culling et al 2006 in contrast during the calving period females disperse and are typically found as singletons culling et al 2006 dispersion is hypothesized to reduce predation risk by reducing detectability by predators and especially for more vulnerable calves if predators can predate multiple individuals per encounter demars et al 2016 group living can therefore reduce the foraging efficiency ai of wolves per individual caribou by reducing the encounter rate with prey if predators make only one kill per encounter the likelihood of survival per individual increases in groups demars et al 2016 the variation in group size increases our uncertainty in the estimation of the wolf s foraging efficiency for caribou a2 we present results assuming dispersed individuals while incorporating uncertainty using lognormal sampling with a larger standard deviation than for the other parameters specifically we drew the logarithm of a2 for the current scenario from a normal distribution with standard deviation log 2 we then generated the a2 values for the partial and full restoration scenarios by multiplying with the same restoration factors as in table 2 42 2 51 5 for partial restoration and 26 4 51 5 for full restoration we proceeded analogously for a 1 but with a standard deviation of log 1 1 and restoration factors 13 8 15 3 and 11 15 3 see table 2 we also evaluated the sensitivity of our conclusions to grouping behaviour by directly evaluating the effect of group size on caribou moose and wolf populations following restoration appendix iii 2 4 disentangling the functional and numerical responses we evaluated the relative influence of the predator s foraging efficiency functional response compared to changes to the predator s density numerical response on caribou densities to understand the relative importance of the numerical feedback to the overall effect of restoration first we fixed wolf and moose populations at their equilibrium densities from the current landscape conditions while varying the foraging efficiency of wolves ai this isolated the change in caribou densities due to reduced wolf foraging efficiency on caribou only i e the functional response next to quantify the relative influence of the predator s density i e numerical response we kept the foraging efficiency of wolves ai and moose density constant at the current landscape conditions and compared equilibrium densities of the current landscape scenario to when wolf densities were reduced to the equilibrium density in the full restoration scenario finally we reduced wolf density to 0 002 wolves km2 representing a nearly complete removal of wolves to compare the effects of restoration to the effects of predator reductions 3 results simulated linear feature restoration reduced the foraging efficiency of wolves for caribou a2 mostly by reducing the spatial overlap between wolves and caribou rather than reducing wolf movement rate reducing spatial overlap reduced a2 from 51 5 to 34 3 table 2 resulting in caribou equilibrium density changing from 0 095 to 0 202 km2 table 3 simulating full restoration by reducing wolf movement from 10 92 km day current landscape to 8 40 km day table 2 changed a2 to 39 6 and resulted in caribou equilibrium density changing from 0 095 to 0 160 km2 table 3 a 1 69 fold increase if both the overlap and movement rate mechanisms are considered then a2 is further reduced to 26 4 table 2 assuming that both mechanisms are at play and all linear features are restored the reduction in a2 resulted in a 2 51 fold increase in caribou density from 0 095 to 0 238 animals km2 table 3 if only seismic lines are restored the increase in caribou equilibrium density would be 1 61 fold table 3 the proportion of caribou killed per year by wolves declined from 0 23 to 0 12 if all linear features are restored and both mechanisms are affected by restoration table 3 wolf foraging efficiency for moose was relatively unaffected by changes in wolf movement rate or the spatial overlap between wolves and moose related to restoration table 3 when both mechanisms are considered and all linear features are restored the proportion of moose killed by wolves was reduced by only 0 02 resulting in a 1 05 fold increase in moose equilibrium density from 0 908 to 0 957 animals km2 table 3 if only seismic lines are restored moose equilibrium density increased 1 02 fold to 0 928 animals km2 table 3 wolf equilibrium density was minimally affected by restoration simulations only decreasing by 1 04 fold from 0 014 to 0 013 animals km2 when all linear features are restored and both mechanisms are considered in conjunction table 3 3 1 evaluating model sensitivity and uncertainty there was considerable variation in the resulting equilibrium densities when parameters were varied independently fig 3 and when using lognormal sampling fig 4 though caribou populations consistently increased following restoration when each parameter was varied independently the fold change in caribou equilibrium density resulting from restoration was larger when k1 k2 r1 r2 a1 th1 th2 and m were 15 lower than the values chosen conversely the fold change in caribou equilibrium density was larger when a2 and b were 15 higher the effect of partial or full restoration was most sensitive to changes in th1 m r2 b and a2 the fold change in caribou equilibrium density ranged from 1 25 fold when b was 15 lower to 1049 83 fold when th1 was 15 lower as a result of near extinct population densities under the current landscape conditions using lognormal sampling caribou populations increased by a mean of 3 23 fold min 1 04 fold max 188 24 fold following full restoration and by a mean of 1 96 fold min 1 01 fold max 112 81 fold following partial restoration in 39 of cases caribou went extinct under current landscape conditions of those in 19 of cases caribou no longer went extinct under partial restoration and in 66 of cases caribou no longer went extinct under full restoration no other species went to extinction under any scenario the magnitude of the effect of restoration was reduced when caribou were assumed to live in groups appendix iii for example if we assume a group size of 7 animals year round full restoration increased caribou populations by 1 06 fold 3 2 disentangling the functional and numerical responses when wolf and moose densities were fixed at equilibrium values from the current scenario and thereby only foraging efficiency resulted in changes in predation rates functional response caribou densities increased from 0 095 to 0 226 animals km2 when all linear features are restored a 2 39 fold increase table 4 fig 5 when moose densities and wolf foraging efficiency were fixed at equilibrium values from the current scenario and thereby only the change in wolf densities from full restoration resulted in changes in predation rates numerical response caribou densities increased to 0 118 animals km2 a 1 25 fold increase table 4 fig 5 simulating predator reductions by reducing wolf populations to 0 002 animals km2 increased caribou densities by 3 92 fold to 0 371 animals km2 table 4 fig 5 4 discussion we simulated two mechanisms to predict the effectiveness of restoring linear features at increasing caribou populations reducing the movement rates of wolves and reducing the spatial overlap between wolves and their prey we also combined the effects of the two mechanisms and examined the scenarios of restoring all linear features or only seismic lines clearly restoring all linear features is an optimistic scenario but was intended to predict the maximum effect of how restoring anthropogenic linear features would affect caribou populations as expected simulated restoration increased the equilibrium density of caribou the optimistic restoration scenario assuming full restoration reduced movement rates and spatial overlap is predicted to have a substantial effect on caribou by increasing their equilibrium density by 2 51 fold most of this effect is caused by the reduction in spatial overlap between wolves and caribou although the effect of both movement rate and overlap provides the greatest benefit in reality restoration will likely affect both mechanisms concurrently with a reduction in movement contributing to less overlap with caribou here we defined changes in overlap as a result of decreased wolf selection for caribou habitat peatlands in the absence of linear features however reduced movement rates and therefore distance being covered while traveling through peatlands will also result in reduced overlap the total response of caribou densities to restoration was largely attributed to changes in the wolf s foraging efficiency i e functional response alone simulating reduced foraging efficiency while fixing wolf densities had nearly the same influence on caribou populations as when the numerical feedback was incorporated the numerical effect only i e changes in wolf densities resulting from restoration had a much smaller effect on caribou populations this is largely because wolf densities were minimally affected by restoration activities counter to our hypothesis that wolf populations would be reduced following simulated restoration the predator equation eq 3 was a type ii numerical response meaning that wolves were subjected to density dependent mortality m all else being equal wolf densities increase with increasing prey densities but at a declining rate because of social constraints among packs such as higher inter pack mortality of wolves as the number of packs increases cariappa et al 2011 cubaynes et al 2014 furthermore we used a type ii functional response meaning that as prey density increases the predator becomes satiated by handling time and the per capita kill rate plateaus holling 1959 if wolves are supported by a large moose population and foraging efficiency for moose is not substantially reduced by restoration as we have simulated here large changes to the predator density are not expected finally restoration would reduce overlap with caribou habitat where prey biomass is low but does not affect overlap with moose habitat where prey biomass is high the increase in caribou densities regardless of a minor wolf numerical response suggests that a management approach of reducing foraging efficiency can be an effective recovery option simulating the direct reduction of wolf populations had nearly twice the effect on caribou densities than did the total response to full restoration fig 4 these findings are supported by the stabilization of and increase in caribou populations following predator reductions in western north america hervieux et al 2014 serrouya et al 2019 given that direct predator reductions can occur more rapidly than habitat restoration this finding highlights the importance of implementing multiple management options simultaneously to increase caribou densities predicting the effect of partial restoration of linear features is more difficult than for full restoration because of two contrasting assumptions the first is that restoring seismic lines will reduce the spatial overlap at the same proportion as the reduction in movement rates from the decreased use of linear features because seismic lines cover a much greater area than other linear features and extend into areas where there are no other disturbances it is conceivable that removing seismic lines will create much more predator free space i e reduced overlap than removing other linear features fig 2 secondly we assume that restoring seismic lines will not cause compensatory use of other linear features i e wolves would not increase their use of other linear features due to the removal of seismic lines given that compensatory selection for roads over natural linear features such as rivers or streams has been found to occur in other systems compensatory behaviour is likely to occur as restoration occurs newton et al 2017 we argue that the predator free space created by clearing vast areas of human habitat alteration that is dominated by seismic lines would be greater than the effect of compensatory behaviour by wolves as restoration trials expand across time and space further work should evaluate simulated partial restoration scenarios and empirically test these predictions to understand restoration effectiveness and inform implementation there was considerable variation in equilibrium densities as a result of our sensitivity and uncertainty analyses nonetheless all simulations showed an increase in caribou densities after partial and full restoration and in some cases restoration prevented the extinction of caribou populations using log normal sampling the mean predicted change in caribou populations was higher when incorporating uncertainty than when uncertainty was not included suggesting that our default scenario may under estimate the effect of restoration our sensitivity analysis in which parameters where varied simultaneously suggests that our results were most sensitive to wolf handling time of moose which is one of our most certain parameters messier 1994 serrouya et al 2015a our results were also particularly sensitive to caribou intrinsic rate of increase the wolf mortality parameter conversion factor of prey to wolf densities and foraging efficiency on caribou for both the sensitivity and uncertainty analyses there was more variation in caribou equilibrium densities under the current landscape scenario than under the partial or full restoration scenarios as such cases where the fold change in caribou density following restoration was large were due to low caribou equilibrium densities under the current landscape scenario this suggests that populations at low density receive the most benefit from reducing predator foraging efficiency via restoration because patterns were consistent and restoration always increased caribou population densities our qualitative results were robust to the uncertainty in our parameters our findings add to the limited amount of work on the potential efficacy of linear feature restoration yet highlight that consistent conclusions among studies are lacking recent work has suggested that intensive linear feature restoration can result in stable or increasing caribou populations over long time periods such as 50 years johnson et al 2019 likewise mckenzie et al 2012 found that seismic lines were expected to alter the functional response of wolves enough to affect encounter rates of prey especially at low prey densities presumably having demographic consequences conversely a recent spatial simulation parameterized using gps data suggests that full linear feature restoration would be expected to reduce caribou mortality by up to 25 but that this would likely not be sufficient to stop caribou declines spangenberg et al 2019 similarly two other spatially explicit simulation studies found that a very modest increase in wolf numbers from a numerical effect linked to ungulate densities dawe et al 2014 serrouya et al 2011 dwarfed any effect of line density or predator foraging efficiency demars et al unpublished research mccutchen 2007 these studies suggest that manipulating the foraging efficiency through restoration would have a limited effect on caribou numbers however none of these studies dynamically linked the functional and numerical response of predators whereas in reality these two components are inseparable a dynamic approach using ordinary differential equations accounts for the fact that an increased foraging efficiency will simultaneously affect the ratio of prey to predators which ultimately affects predation rates vucetich et al 2011 furthermore we were able to disentangle the relative contribution of foraging efficiency and the feedback into a wolf numerical response showing that foraging efficiency alone had a substantive effect on caribou densities 4 1 assumptions the goal of our analysis was not to predict future population dynamics under varied land use or climate change scenarios which would be very challenging given the complexity of the system instead we isolated the potential magnitude of the effect of linear feature restoration the primary habitat management action being proposed in western canada to do so we made a number of simplifying assumptions the most important of which we address here the potential outcomes of climate change that could affect caribou physiology r 2 or habitat use ouellet et al 1996 schaefer et al 2016 and alternative population trajectories i e extinction vortices allee effects were not explicitly considered when treating caribou as group living animals year round caribou populations increased following restoration but the magnitude of the effect of restoration on caribou populations was greatly diminished appendix iii the difference in caribou population response between populations assumed to live as singletons compared to when group size is included increases uncertainty in our predictions however caribou predation occurs more frequently during the summer months for both calves and adults mcloughlin et al 2003 when caribou tend to be dispersed in addition estimates of group size are female biased as the surveys are flown to collect data on calf cow ratios and therefore do not consider that male caribou are more often in smaller groups year round finally as caribou populations decline so do their average group size mclellan et al 2010 meaning that restoration effects could be more pronounced on a per capita basis with smaller populations the benefit of restoration to caribou likely lies between the solitary and the group extremes but we speculate that the benefit to caribou is likely closer to when caribou were treated as singletons for the reasons mentioned above we assume that the carrying capacity of moose k 1 and caribou k2 were unaffected by the abundance of seismic lines or by climate change seismic lines cover tens of thousands of linear kilometers and can be associated with more abundant forage for moose than undisturbed habitat finnegan et al 2018 but their surface area is minimal relative the overall landscape pattison et al 2016 for example all linear features account for 1 79 of the landscape within boreal caribou range in alberta whereas seismic lines are only 1 20 and forest cutblocks account for 2 03 table 5 therefore seismic lines are unlikely to have a substantial impact on k 1 or k2 and in this context our assumption is unlikely to affect results given a 15 change in carrying capacity was estimated to have a small influence on the fold change in caribou populations following restoration a difference of 0 14 fold change and the effect of restoration on carrying capacity is estimated to be 1 2 the effect of changing carrying capacity on caribou equilibrium densities following restoration is likely negligible indeed if carrying capacity for moose and caribou increased following restoration our results are likely conservative in that they overestimate the influence of restoration additionally sedentary caribou tend to be predation limited rather than food limited like their counterparts farther north or east climate change is expected to increase moose forage via increased fire intervals shifting conifer and mixedwood stands to deciduous stands and grasslands stralberg et al 2018 however the influence of climate change on peatlands is expected to be muted schneider et al 2009 given the uncertainty in the effects of climate change on k 1 and k2 we did not explicitly quantify the influence of climate change on caribou populations however our sensitivity analysis in which k 1 and k2 are varied independently suggest that an increase in k 1 and decrease in k2 as expected under a climate change scenario may mute the predicted effect of restoration on caribou populations future work should investigate the influence of restoration on carrying capacity of ungulates and contrast these influences to those expected under a changing climate that alters wildfire regimes schwartz and franzmann 1991 our analysis assumes that wolf use of linear features and the resulting changes in movement rates reported by dickie et al 2017 are representative of western canada the time wolves spend on seismic lines may be influenced by their availability as well as the availability of other linear features mysterud and ims 1998 the density of linear features in the study by dickie et al 2017 varied between 1 3 km km2 which is similar to or less than much of western canada therefore we may have under estimated the initial movement rates on linear features under the current landscape scenario making our predictions conservative in that the effect of restoration on caribou populations would potentially be larger than what we state an additional factor that makes our simulations conservative is that we assume restoration is instantaneous whereas caribou populations are likely to continue declining over the decades it would take to implement restoration our model necessarily represents a simplified moose wolf caribou dominated food web this simplification holds across the majority of the boreal forests of western canada wolves are the dominant predator of caribou hayes et al 2003 seip 1992 wittmer et al 2005a and moose are typically the dominant prey species supporting wolf populations messier 1994 however there are shifts in both predator and prey densities across the landscape which has not been incorporated in these models for example in some parts of the boreal encroaching white tailed deer or other ungulates may provide additional food sources to wolves latham et al 2011 or other predators such as black bears may represent a significant proportion of caribou calf mortality pinard et al 2012 understanding how these shifts in the predator prey community impact population response to restoration is important to consider when predicting the efficacy of caribou recovery strategies a final assumption is that restoration treatments reduce wolf movement to levels that approximate an unaltered forest as with the first assumption the periodic radio collaring of wolves in areas of restored habitat will be the best approach to validate this assumption while large areas of restored linear features are needed to observe a population level effect on wolves and caribou the behavioural responses of wolves to restoration treatments can be tested across a much shorter time frame nonetheless given the uncertainty we recommend pursuing restoration in a manner than can test some of the population level predictions from this model first contiguous areas must be restored at least as large as the scale of an individual wolf territory all seismic lines within this area should be removed where possible for a robust test of model predictions in summary our simple model allows us to draw robust conclusions regarding the efficacy of linear feature restoration for caribou recovery to make quantitative predictions for caribou population dynamics over the next decades or centuries however a more detailed model with many more factors such as climate change or allee effects would be necessary 4 2 conclusions the strength of this analysis is predicated on the dynamic and simultaneous feedback between the functional and numerical responses of wolves and consequent impacts to their prey this approach allowed us to conclude that linear feature restoration can benefit caribou populations but only under the unlikely scenario of removing nearly all linear features within caribou ranges it is important to note that even partial restoration seismic lines only in boreal british columbia and alberta means restoring c 350 000 km of seismic lines whereas full restoration means restoring seismic lines plus c 40 000 km of other linear feature types including paved highways full restoration is virtually impossible to achieve but was simulated to contextualize caribou densities in near pristine conditions therefore the fold change for partial restoration should be considered the more realistic scenario though still unlikely to achieve in the short term moreover increasing caribou populations by 2 51 fold to 0 238 caribou km2 following complete restoration would still result in caribou densities below what is observed in landscapes with minimal human habitat alteration saskatchewan 0 37 caribou km2 mcloughlin et al 2016 this result could be caused by broader scale changes to ecosystems such as the expansion of deer across western north america dawe et al 2014 socioeconomic constraints to habitat restoration at the scale simulated here as well as the cost and time scales required to realize the benefits of restoration treatments should temper expectations from the optimistic values we present it is unrealistic to assume complete or even partial restoration which would require eliminating over 350 000 km of seismic lines within canada s western boreal forest can be achieved in the short term in contrast our model predicts a more pronounced increase in caribou via direct predator reductions as has been confirmed empirically and in short time frames serrouya et al 2019 therefore we emphasize the need for multiple coordinated recovery actions applied in the same area particularly we suggest that population based actions such as predator and prey management or safe havens e g serrouya et al 2019 should be considered while

24931,metabolic rate the biological rate of energy processing is often considered to be the fundamental determinant of pace of life in biological systems assuming foraging performance to be the central link between metabolic rate and pace of life we modeled the behavior of biological units with different metabolic rate as foraging groups with or without within group variation in metabolic rate in environments of various resource configurations with or without group level behaviors such as information sharing and division of labor our results show how metabolic rate can interact with the resource environment to produce differences in energy gain and lifespan the results also suggest that in a group context rather than the average metabolic rate of the group it is the composition of the group that matters such that metabolically diverse groups outperform metabolically homogenous groups with a proposed experimental approach to test these predictions these findings bring new insights to possible gene environment interactions that may be involved in the evolution of intraspecific differences in metabolic rates and how metabolic diversity may contribute to the evolution of group living keywords metabolic rate pace of life agent based model foraging group living honeybees 1 introduction energy is the primary driver of all life processes and therefore metabolic rate mr the biological rate that determines the acquisition and expenditure of energy has been proposed as the fundamental driver of structure and function at all levels of biological organization brown et al 2004 interspecific differences in mr have long been a topic of interest sibly et al 2012 but the adaptive rationale for intraspecific variation in mr is less clear and the fitness consequences of such differences have only recently become a major research focus burton et al 2011 the observation that differences in life history traits can be correlated to differences in mr ricklefs and wikelski 2002 has led to the hypothesis that mr is the fundamental driver of pace of life syndrome pols a suite of correlated traits that define differences in animal personality careau and garland 2012 houston 2010 réale et al 2010 biro and stamps 2010 burton et al 2011 le galliard et al 2013 dammhahn et al 2018 however it has been repeatedly pointed out that the majority of evidence for the pols hypothesis is correlational glazier 2015 mathot et al 2015 krams et al 2017 and there is an urgent need for experimental and theoretical investigations into the functional mechanisms through which mr can influence behavior and life history mathot and frankenhuis 2018 within a species the relationship between mr and life history arguably is most fundamentally linked through foraging a behavior which defines the acquisition of energy that is required to run all the life processes comprising the so called metabolic engine including foraging itself biro and stamps 2010 this can result in a positive feedback loop between mr and foraging such that a higher mr by making more energy available for performing foraging behavior provides a benefit in terms of higher energy acquisition however a higher mr can also come with a higher maintenance cost requiring increased energetic allocation or expenditure both while active and at rest which can overshadow any acquisition benefits associated with it this complex relationship underlies theoretical predictions careau et al 2008 as well as empirical observations reviewed in arnqvist et al 2017 that mr can show either a positive or a negative correlation with performance measures in different biological systems therefore while mr can be expected to have a significant influence on performance the exact nature of the functional relationship between them is far from clear the complexity of this functional relationship is further highlighted when one considers the fact that the mr of an individual animal is itself a composite function of the considerable variation in the mr of its different organs and tissues each of which also differs in how it affects the performance of the animal speakman et al 2004 konarzewski and książek 2013 experimental approaches to understanding the complex influence of mr on performance can be confounded by a number of different variables including processes operating at different levels of biological organization it therefore can be instructive to take a modeling approach to understand how the costs and benefits associated with a variation in mr can influence performance and life history parameters and generate testable predictions but such models are surprisingly rare sibly et al 2013 since foraging can be considered as one of the central links between mr and performance measures relevant to pol we develop an agent based mechanistic model with the goal to examine how mr can interact with the resource environment to influence resource acquisition while paying out its allocation costs we model biological units consisting of groups of agents such as an individual animal consisting of different organs and tissues or a social group constituted of different individuals to achieve our additional goal of testing how variation in mr within these units can influence the performance of the entire unit we quantify rates of resource collection and lifespan as our two measures of performance that are relevant to pols theory because they can be calculated as a function of mr with the least number of assumptions in our model we aim for broad generality and parsimony in our model construction and use assumptions derived from the literature wherever possible but then also use a series of sensitivity analyses to test the influence of some of the assumptions on the results of the model 2 methods 2 1 model description we built an agent based model using netlogo v 5 3 1 to simulate the behavior of a group of central place foragers that share resources within the group largely drawing inspiration from the biology of social insects such as a honeybee colony in an environment with non depleting energy patches of either large or small value distributed in either a random or a clumped fashion an agent leaves its central place to forage with a fixed amount of energy that is required to complete a foraging trip harano et al 2013 it spends this energy at a rate dictated by its active metabolic rate ma to move randomly in the foraging environment at a speed dictated by its ma nachtigall et al 1995 reinhold 1999 skandalis and darveau 2012 darveau et al 2014 and collect all the energy resources it encounters upon its return to the central place the agent deposits all the energy it has collected into a pool called the energy store the agent then collects a fixed amount of energy from the store and consumes it at a rate dictated by its resting metabolic rate mr it leaves for a new foraging trip when it has spent this energy an agent has a fixed limit of maximum lifetime energy expenditure emax neukirch 1982 and it dies upon reaching this value defined as death due to senescence or if the value of the central place energy store goes to zero defined as death due to starvation each run of a simulation continues until all agents in a group are dead a period which defines the lifespan of the group derivations and definitions of all parameters and the parameter values used to simulate the model are summarized in table s1 2 2 model environment the foraging environment consists of 2500 patches arranged in a grid 5 of which contain a fixed energy value each patch is surrounded by eight other patches and was assigned a score 0 8 equal to the number of adjacent patches that contains energy a dispersion index was calculated for the environment as the variance of these scores over the mean of these scores averaged across all patches our basic environment is a random environment defined as an environment with a dispersion index of 1 0 1 2 3 agent characteristics there are three types of agents defined by their discretely distinct ma those with low mr mal medium mr mam and high mr mah these three types of agents are used to create four types of groups with 20 agents each pure low all mal pure medium all mam pure high all mah and mixed half mal and half mah we assume the most parsimonious positive relationship between mr and movement velocity in this model 1 v x kmax where vx is the movement velocity and max is the active metabolic rate of an agent of a given type x and k is a constant that defines the unit conversion between metabolic rate and movement velocity each agent also has a resting metabolic rate mrx arbitrarily assumed to be ¼ of its ma 2 mrx 1 4 max an agent initiates a foraging trip carrying an amount of energy e0 the trip energy available for use for the entire foraging trip and the energetic cost of movement cm for a single time step during foraging was defined as 3 cm max etce where et is the total amount of energy being carried by the agent at time t and ce is a constant representing the energetic cost imposed by each unit of energy being carried cm is subtracted from e0 at each time step the agent spends foraging in the environment at the beginning of a foraging trip time step 0 et is equal to trip energy e0 and it decreases at each time step as the agent moves through the environment and it increases at each time step the agent encounters a patch and picks up the energy load from it the rate at which e0 is reduced is higher when et is large due to the increased energetic expenditure required to carry larger amounts of energy when an agent encounters a patch the energy value of the patch ep is instantaneously added to its current energy et and it continues its movement uninterrupted at the start of each time step an agent calculates the energetic cost to return to the central place from its current location in a straight line and once the total energy spent foraging cm including the return trip is greater than or equal to e0 the agent ceases foraging and returns to the central place by moving in a straight line heinze et al 2018 the net energetic gain from a foraging trip eg can therefore be summarized as 4 eg nep cm where n is the number of food patches encountered during the foraging trip the energetic yield of a foraging trip nep is added to the current value of the energy store at time t st when the energetic yield of a foraging trip is greater than the cost of the trip cm eg is positive and the foraging trip has a net positive effect on the energy store however the cost of the trip can also be greater than the yield in which case eg is negative and the trip has a net negative effect on the energy store upon its return to the central place and after depositing its energetic load into the energy store the agent draws an amount of resting energy er from the energy store and remains in the central place spending er at a rate dictated by its mr and once the value of er equals zero it draws e0 from the energy store and leaves the central place on another foraging trip agents with higher mr spend this resting energy er more quickly and therefore engage in more frequent foraging trips agents have activity cycles divided into an active time ta during which they forage and tr when they rest and an entire activity cycle of ta tr is referred to as a day during tr agents draw energy from the energy store reducing it by a value equal to their mr at each time step 2 4 simulations at the start of each simulation run all agents have 0 energy et 0 and the value of the energy store st is set to an amount of energy enough for 10 foraging trips per agent the model environment and agent characteristics described above refer to the 1 basic environment we modified the environment and agent characteristics in the following manner to evaluate five additional environments that investigate further aspects of how mr may influence performance 2 temporal variation environment where the energy value of the food patches ep switches from large to small or vice versa during the rest period of each day tr while mean ep remains the same as in the basic environment the large and small patch values were calculated such that the coefficient of variation from the mean was always 1 which ensures that variability is constant across different patch values 3 spatial variation environment where food patches are distributed in the environment in clumps instead of at random these clumped environments were defined as having a dispersion index equal to 3 0 1 4 information environment where an agent shares information about the location in terms of distance and direction of the last food patch it encountered in its previous foraging trip as it is typical of honeybees seeley 1995 after every foraging trip an agent compares its foraging gain eg to the average foraging gain gavg across all trips by all agents in the group and adds the location as a unit of information to a group level information pool with a probability pi defined as 5 pi eg 2gavg this results in a probability of 1 for information sharing when eg 2gavg last encountered food patch by an agent is twice as good as the average of what other agents have found and a probability of 0 for information sharing when eg gavg last encountered food patch is much poorer than the average of what other agents have found all pi values were scaled between 0 and 1 agents leaving on a foraging trip have a fixed probability of 0 9 for randomly selecting an information unit from the information pool to use a high probability of using information while still allowing for some agents to not use previously gathered information and explore new areas of the environment an information unit can be used only once and once used the information unit is removed from the information pool an agent using information travels in a straight line from the central place to the specified location after which it reverts to moving randomly for the remainder of the foraging trip 5 spatial variation with information environment a combination of the second and the third environments 6 division of labor environment where half the agents within a group are randomly designated as foragers each day while the other half act as non foragers who remain at the central place non foragers represent agents dedicated to within nest tasks and they deplete the energy store according to their mr in a manner identical to the behavior of all agents during tr the environments with information sharing or division of labor are the only ones in which we assume group level properties that are relevant to the functioning of social groups for the simulation of each environment a single group of each type pure high pure medium pure low or mixed is placed by itself into a randomly generated environment of the given type each of these simulations was run across a range of food patch values 1 ep 100 000 and repeated 1000 times and we report each of our performance measures as the average of 1000 simulated groups we do not report error bars in our figures because they were too small and did not lead us to any interesting biological insights additional simulations were run to assess the sensitivity of the model and the functional importance of some of the parameters since we used 20 agents to simulate our model to save on computing time we evaluated the effect of group size at 1 2 20 and 200 agents the effect of group composition was evaluated with additional group types consisting of 1 1 1 or 1 2 1 mix of low medium and high mr agents the mathematical relationship between ma and velocity was tested at vx kmax 0 5 vx kmax vx kmax 2 vx kmax 3 and vx 6 a constant value unrelated to amr the effect of load cost ce was examined at ce 0 0001 ce 0 001 and ce 0 01 the set of different relationships examined here is an arbitrary choice and was meant to cover a broad range of possible but simple relationships various rules based on different currencies that might dictate when a forager leaves for a foraging trip were also evaluated including after spending a constant amount of energy er 10 after spending a random amount of energy er a random number between 0 and 20 with an average of 10 after spending a constant number of time steps 60 and after spending a random number of time steps a random number 20 and 120 with an average of 60 3 results the size of the energy store st for any group over its lifetime expectedly increases with patch value in all environments fig 1 a therefore in order to compare results across patch values we divided the lifetime energy storage by the patch value ep which reveals that the pure low groups collect more energy than other groups at smaller patch values while the pure high groups collect the most amount of energy when patch values are large fig 1b s1 the parabolic shape of this measure is a result of higher survival of agents with the initial increase in patch value and therefore a decreased starvation risk and then a decrease in agent lifespan at large patch values from the energetic cost of movement with large loads given the limit on lifetime energetic expenditure the parabolic shape however should not be interpreted as a lower performance in richer environments because the size of the energy stores was indeed larger in richer environments fig 1a also note that energy collected and stored can be used for reproduction and therefore the production of new agents at a certain rate aspects that are not part of our model for the sake of parsimony in terms of daily energy storage the pure high groups store more energy across nearly all patch values and all groups show a peak in daily collection at intermediate patch values fig 1c these patterns hold true across a range of group sizes when lifetime energy storage is evaluated on a per agent basis fig s2 including a group consisting of a single individual indicating that the results of the model applies to individual foragers as well as groups to determine the relative advantage of the different groups over each other we calculated their relative foraging success by dividing the lifetime energy storage of each group at each patch value by the mean lifetime energy storage of all groups across all environments at that patch value the relative foraging success is a unitless measure where a score of 1 indicates an average performance a score of 2 indicates a performance twice as good as average and so on in all environments the pure low groups have a higher relative foraging success than pure high groups for small patch values and this trend reverses at large patch values fig 2 at very large and very small patch values the performance of the pure medium groups falls between the pure low and the pure high groups but at intermediate patch values the pure medium groups show a small advantage over all other groups in majority of the environments in the division of labor environment fig 2f the mixed groups show a distinct advantage across all but the largest patch values a pattern that is also noticed when considering the absolute size of the lifetime energy store fig s1f the overall decrease in foraging success for all groups in the division of labor environment is expected because only half the agents forage on any given day information has little effect on relative foraging success in a spatially random environment fig 2d but when information is used in a spatially variable environment fig 2e all groups show an increase in foraging success we further tested the effect of group composition in the basic and the division of labor environments by examining the performance of four groups with the same mr at the group level with a group size of 24 we examined 4 group compositions with the same group level mr in addition to the pure medium all mam and the standard mixed 1 2 mal and 1 2 mah groups used throughout the model we created two more mixed groups one with an equal number of high medium and low mr agents 1 3 mal 1 3 mam 1 3 mah and another consisting of a quarter low mr agents half medium mr agents and a quarter high mr agents 1 4 mal 1 2 mam 1 4 mah in the basic scenario the precise composition of agent metabolic rates has little effect on group performance and the average metabolic rate of the group dictates foraging success fig s3 in the division of labor scenario however we see that the standard mixed group composed of only high and low mr agents outperforms both the pure medium group and the two additional groups each containing agents of all the three types at intermediate patch values high mr agents are costly and at small patch values they can be even more costly by engaging in low yield foraging trips conversely at larger patch values high mr agents pay out their maintenance costs by achieving greater foraging yields than low mr agents the advantage of mixed colonies is reduced at very small or large patch values because the different advantages of high and low mr agents cancel out each other at these values the advantage available at intermediate patch values to the standard mixed group is due to its higher variance the same reason why it is able to outperform the other two mixed groups pure low and mixed groups have substantially longer lifespans than both pure high and pure medium groups under all patch values but the advantage is reduced at extreme patch values both small and large fig 3 all groups show a sharp increase in lifespan as patch value initially increases which marks the threshold at which agents begins to live until senescence rather than dying of starvation fig s4 this threshold patch value is smallest for the pure low group and largest for the pure high group which follows from their respective energetic demands the large difference in lifespan between the mixed and the pure medium group is interesting since both groups have identical energetic requirement at the group level however the presence of low mr individuals in the mixed groups allows these groups to survive longer than the homogeneous pure medium groups mixed groups have very similar lifespans as pure low groups except in the division of labor environment where all groups live somewhat longer fig 3f because division of labor allows agents to forage half as often which saves energy and takes them longer to reach the maximum lifetime energetic expenditure the decline in lifespan in the richest environments is attributable to the energetic cost of carrying large energy loads and the model constraint that requires the agents to always fully exploit a patch the difference in group lifespan between low and high mr groups fundamentally arises from the longer individual lifespan of low mr agents fig 4 a interestingly the lifespan of low and high mr agents differs depending on whether they live in pure or mixed groups these observed differences in lifespan can be further explored in terms of what we define as realized lifespan as agents die of senescence when they have used a fixed amount of energy and as their mr determines the pace at which they reach this energy maximum each mr has a specific maximum life expectancy associated with it we defined life expectancy for each mr as the age at which an agent would die if it only rested and did not forage in terms of realized lifespan calculated as actual lifespan life expectancy all three types of agents low medium high have very similar patterns fig 4b showing a sharp increase with the initial increase in patch value and an eventual decrease at large patch values as seen earlier the frequency distribution of lifespan is bimodal for agents of all three mr types fig 4c with an initial peak for agents that die of starvation and a second peak for those that die of senescence interestingly low mr agents in mixed groups die less frequently of senescence a shorter second peak and more frequently of starvation a taller first peak compared to those in pure groups who show the opposite pattern in contrast high mr agents in mixed groups die less frequently of starvation a shorter first peak and more frequently of senescence a taller second peak compared to those in pure groups who show the opposite pattern fig 4c load cost ce has a strong negative influence on the total amount of energy harvested and stored at small patch values a reduced load cost resulted in pure low groups gathering more energy than pure high groups and an increased load cost resulting in a reversal of fortunes fig 5 a the negative effect of increased load cost on low mr groups is correlated to a higher reduction in lifespan advantage experienced by them compared to high mr groups fig s5a at large patch values a change in load cost has little effect on the relative performance of the different groups fig 5b load cost has a strong effect on foraging returns in poor resource environments as the load cost represents a larger proportion of the total cost of a foraging trip on the other hand load cost has a strong effect on lifespan in rich environments fig s5b due to the multiplicative relationship between load cost and the amount of resources gathered on a trip the cost of a single trip can comprise a much larger portion of the maximum lifetime energy expenditure of an individual when patch value is large this is consistent with the general decline in lifespan observed at larger patch values fig 3 the relationship between active metabolic rate and movement velocity is a critical assumption in the model and different relationships lead to significantly different results the difference in energy storage due to different assumptions made between ma and movement velocity is more prominent in poor environments the assumption of a simple linear relationship provides the least advantage to a group of any specific metabolic type fig 5c and d low mr groups perform better when movement velocity is either unrelated to mr a constant or it is a saturating function of mr while high mr groups can do better when movement velocity is an accelerating function of mr overall high mr groups outperform low mr groups when the cost of a high mr is compensated for by a velocity advantage the model is more sensitive to whether a currency of energy or time is used as a foraging rule rather than whether it is a random or a constant value of the specific currency fig 5e and f a foraging rule based on time gives an advantage to low mr groups at both small and large patch values while a foraging rule based on energy gives an advantage to low mr groups at small patch values and a small advantage to high mr groups at large patch values when agents leave on foraging trips based on a time rule high mr agents pay a higher energetic cost of unproductive waiting than low mr agents and both mr types forage at similar frequencies using an energy based foraging rule which is more consistent with individuals foraging to meet an energetic need leads to high mr agents foraging more frequently than low mr agents 4 discussion our model suggests that differences in mr can interact with the resource environment to have a significant impact on the foraging success and lifespan of individuals and groups broadly the pure low mr groups had an advantage in lifespan in all environments and in energy storage in resource poor environments while the pure high mr groups stored more energy than other groups in rich environments this finding is consistent with both theoretical and empirical work suggesting that both a high mr and a fast pace of life pol are more likely to be adaptive only when resources are abundant while a slow pol has an advantage when resources are scarce biro and stamps 2010 burton et al 2011 auer et al 2015 the pure medium groups outperformed all other groups in term of energy storage in environments of intermediate richness while division of labor allowed the mixed groups to take the lead in all environments except in the very richest ones division of labor resulted in an advantage to mixed groups consisting of low and high mr individuals over other groups this is an interesting result because at the group level the mixed group is similar to the pure intermediate mr group as both groups have identical mr when averaged across all agents this outcome arises in spite of our parsimonious assumption that labor foraging or staying in the nest is divided randomly across individuals of different mr although in reality division of labor is a non random process beshers and fewell 2001 such division of labor related advantage may be even more exaggerated if labor is adaptively allocated such that individuals with higher mr perform tasks that are more energetically demanding while those with lower mr perform less demanding tasks feuerbacher et al 2003 or have low mr individuals forage in poor environments and high mr individuals forage in rich environments thereby optimizing the energetic cost benefit ratio this supports the idea that diversity among the units constituting a higher level phenotype can be adaptive because it allows a larger range of response to a complex and dynamic environment piersma and drent 2003 woods 2014 an idea especially relevant to groups showing division of labor such as social insects myerscough and oldroyd 2004 oldroyd and fewell 2007 while behavioral variation and division of labor are considered to be the primary mechanisms that allow social groups to adjust for variations in the resource environment our results show that interindividual variation in mr can be a primary mechanism underlying this advantage understanding such energetic principles of biological organization and the links between mr and pol at the individual and the group level can bring insights to fundamental questions regarding social evolution such as how variation in mr drives division of labor and contributes to the extraordinary ecological success of social groups variability in the environment reduced the performance of all groups to an extent and the ability to use information in such environments not too surprisingly allowed them to compensate for this decrease this indicates that the ability to share information amplifies the foraging advantage of all groups but does not provide an advantage to foragers of any particular mr interestingly the pure low groups showed the largest influence of information use in these environments extracting a large advantage from such behavior when the environment was poor but also showing the highest decline in relative performance when the environment was rich somewhat counterintuitively mixed groups or those with intermediate mr did not show any particular advantage over the other groups in a variable environment suggesting that division is labor is the critical factor that can provide an advantage to mixed groups rather than metabolic diversity alone the mechanisms underlying lifespan is one of the most important and unresolved question in biology and our use of a maximum lifetime energy expenditure to determine senescence is in line with both the pol and the rate of living hypotheses careau and garland 2012 speakman 2005 empirical findings on the effect of mr on lifespan are quite mixed with studies reporting the association of longer lifespan with a low mr wikelski et al 2003 being often confounded by other factors duarte and speakman 2014 our results show a consistent lifespan advantage for individuals with low mr but individuals of all mr types show an increase in lifespan as the environment initially becomes richer due to the accompanying decrease in starvation risk individuals however also show a decline in lifespan in the richest environments due to the energetic cost of harvesting large energy loads as they maximize energetic gain this is consistent with the observation that individuals which forage more or work harder have reduced lifespans schmid hempel and wolf 1988 either as a direct consequence of energy expenditure or as a consequence of higher oxidative stress associated with higher activity levels margotta et al 2018 such energetic constraints and the need to preserve lifespan may be responsible for why animals choose to maximize foraging efficiency as a currency rather than rate of energy gain schmid hempel et al 1985 houston et al 1988 nolet 2002 our results also show an interesting influence of group context on the lifespan of individuals with different mr low mr individuals in mixed groups die less frequently of senescence than those in pure low mr groups while high mr individuals in mixed groups die more frequently of senescence than those in pure high mr groups death due to starvation has exactly the opposite pattern in mixed versus pure groups this suggests that the fitness of different mr types in a group can be subject to frequency dependent processes and such mechanisms can play an important role in the dynamics of social evolution the frequency distribution defining the interindividual variation in mr within a group by setting the rates of resource acquisition allocation and expenditure can therefore have a complex effect in determining its life history trajectory and pol this also means that individuals of different mr types may not contribute equally to measures of group performance which may also underlie the workload based reproductive conflicts seen in eusocial groups schmid hempel 1990 these results therefore suggest that diversity in mr can create the scope for both cooperation and conflict in social groups and understanding these dynamics can provide a metabolic or energetic basis for social evolution our model was found to be sensitive to the assumptions regarding the energetic cost of carrying a load the relationship between mr and movement velocity and the rule based on which foragers leave the nest on a foraging trip it is therefore important to test these relationships to get a comprehensive understanding regarding how mr can be expected to influence life history parameters and pol in different species or in different resource environments since intraspecific variation in mr can have a genetic component arnqvist et al 2010 the observed interaction between the resource environment and mr on our performance measures can be depicted as behavioral or metabolic reaction norms fig 6 which can then be used to make testable predictions regarding how mr may influence pol in different environments the next important steps in extending this model involve first validating it and then building in other important life history parameters to investigate important ideas such as how differences in metabolic rate can translate to differences in relative allocations into survival growth and reproduction since our model spans different levels of biological organization social insects can serve as excellent experimental systems to test its predictions at both the individual and the group level social insect colonies which are characterized by a high degree of behavioral and physiological variation jeanson and weidenmuller 2014 and can be experimentally taken apart and reassembled in different configurations to study individual and group level properties are ideal for understanding how variation in mr might be associated with interindividual variation in behavior and pol and how these parameters scale up to determine life history and pol at the colony level waters et al 2010 shik et al 2012 prior experimental work shows that interindividual behavioral variation is significantly influenced by differences in energetic demand and mr mayack and naug 2011 2013 katz and naug 2015 2016 reade et al 2019 given this since there are known and ecologically relevant genetic markers for mr in honeybees harrison and fewell 2002 it is possible to measure the performance of individuals of known mr types and that of experimentally created groups with specific frequencies of these different mr types in different types of resource environments using such an approach and measuring various behavioral and life history parameters can allow a powerful test of how gene environment interactions with respect to interindividual

24931,metabolic rate the biological rate of energy processing is often considered to be the fundamental determinant of pace of life in biological systems assuming foraging performance to be the central link between metabolic rate and pace of life we modeled the behavior of biological units with different metabolic rate as foraging groups with or without within group variation in metabolic rate in environments of various resource configurations with or without group level behaviors such as information sharing and division of labor our results show how metabolic rate can interact with the resource environment to produce differences in energy gain and lifespan the results also suggest that in a group context rather than the average metabolic rate of the group it is the composition of the group that matters such that metabolically diverse groups outperform metabolically homogenous groups with a proposed experimental approach to test these predictions these findings bring new insights to possible gene environment interactions that may be involved in the evolution of intraspecific differences in metabolic rates and how metabolic diversity may contribute to the evolution of group living keywords metabolic rate pace of life agent based model foraging group living honeybees 1 introduction energy is the primary driver of all life processes and therefore metabolic rate mr the biological rate that determines the acquisition and expenditure of energy has been proposed as the fundamental driver of structure and function at all levels of biological organization brown et al 2004 interspecific differences in mr have long been a topic of interest sibly et al 2012 but the adaptive rationale for intraspecific variation in mr is less clear and the fitness consequences of such differences have only recently become a major research focus burton et al 2011 the observation that differences in life history traits can be correlated to differences in mr ricklefs and wikelski 2002 has led to the hypothesis that mr is the fundamental driver of pace of life syndrome pols a suite of correlated traits that define differences in animal personality careau and garland 2012 houston 2010 réale et al 2010 biro and stamps 2010 burton et al 2011 le galliard et al 2013 dammhahn et al 2018 however it has been repeatedly pointed out that the majority of evidence for the pols hypothesis is correlational glazier 2015 mathot et al 2015 krams et al 2017 and there is an urgent need for experimental and theoretical investigations into the functional mechanisms through which mr can influence behavior and life history mathot and frankenhuis 2018 within a species the relationship between mr and life history arguably is most fundamentally linked through foraging a behavior which defines the acquisition of energy that is required to run all the life processes comprising the so called metabolic engine including foraging itself biro and stamps 2010 this can result in a positive feedback loop between mr and foraging such that a higher mr by making more energy available for performing foraging behavior provides a benefit in terms of higher energy acquisition however a higher mr can also come with a higher maintenance cost requiring increased energetic allocation or expenditure both while active and at rest which can overshadow any acquisition benefits associated with it this complex relationship underlies theoretical predictions careau et al 2008 as well as empirical observations reviewed in arnqvist et al 2017 that mr can show either a positive or a negative correlation with performance measures in different biological systems therefore while mr can be expected to have a significant influence on performance the exact nature of the functional relationship between them is far from clear the complexity of this functional relationship is further highlighted when one considers the fact that the mr of an individual animal is itself a composite function of the considerable variation in the mr of its different organs and tissues each of which also differs in how it affects the performance of the animal speakman et al 2004 konarzewski and książek 2013 experimental approaches to understanding the complex influence of mr on performance can be confounded by a number of different variables including processes operating at different levels of biological organization it therefore can be instructive to take a modeling approach to understand how the costs and benefits associated with a variation in mr can influence performance and life history parameters and generate testable predictions but such models are surprisingly rare sibly et al 2013 since foraging can be considered as one of the central links between mr and performance measures relevant to pol we develop an agent based mechanistic model with the goal to examine how mr can interact with the resource environment to influence resource acquisition while paying out its allocation costs we model biological units consisting of groups of agents such as an individual animal consisting of different organs and tissues or a social group constituted of different individuals to achieve our additional goal of testing how variation in mr within these units can influence the performance of the entire unit we quantify rates of resource collection and lifespan as our two measures of performance that are relevant to pols theory because they can be calculated as a function of mr with the least number of assumptions in our model we aim for broad generality and parsimony in our model construction and use assumptions derived from the literature wherever possible but then also use a series of sensitivity analyses to test the influence of some of the assumptions on the results of the model 2 methods 2 1 model description we built an agent based model using netlogo v 5 3 1 to simulate the behavior of a group of central place foragers that share resources within the group largely drawing inspiration from the biology of social insects such as a honeybee colony in an environment with non depleting energy patches of either large or small value distributed in either a random or a clumped fashion an agent leaves its central place to forage with a fixed amount of energy that is required to complete a foraging trip harano et al 2013 it spends this energy at a rate dictated by its active metabolic rate ma to move randomly in the foraging environment at a speed dictated by its ma nachtigall et al 1995 reinhold 1999 skandalis and darveau 2012 darveau et al 2014 and collect all the energy resources it encounters upon its return to the central place the agent deposits all the energy it has collected into a pool called the energy store the agent then collects a fixed amount of energy from the store and consumes it at a rate dictated by its resting metabolic rate mr it leaves for a new foraging trip when it has spent this energy an agent has a fixed limit of maximum lifetime energy expenditure emax neukirch 1982 and it dies upon reaching this value defined as death due to senescence or if the value of the central place energy store goes to zero defined as death due to starvation each run of a simulation continues until all agents in a group are dead a period which defines the lifespan of the group derivations and definitions of all parameters and the parameter values used to simulate the model are summarized in table s1 2 2 model environment the foraging environment consists of 2500 patches arranged in a grid 5 of which contain a fixed energy value each patch is surrounded by eight other patches and was assigned a score 0 8 equal to the number of adjacent patches that contains energy a dispersion index was calculated for the environment as the variance of these scores over the mean of these scores averaged across all patches our basic environment is a random environment defined as an environment with a dispersion index of 1 0 1 2 3 agent characteristics there are three types of agents defined by their discretely distinct ma those with low mr mal medium mr mam and high mr mah these three types of agents are used to create four types of groups with 20 agents each pure low all mal pure medium all mam pure high all mah and mixed half mal and half mah we assume the most parsimonious positive relationship between mr and movement velocity in this model 1 v x kmax where vx is the movement velocity and max is the active metabolic rate of an agent of a given type x and k is a constant that defines the unit conversion between metabolic rate and movement velocity each agent also has a resting metabolic rate mrx arbitrarily assumed to be ¼ of its ma 2 mrx 1 4 max an agent initiates a foraging trip carrying an amount of energy e0 the trip energy available for use for the entire foraging trip and the energetic cost of movement cm for a single time step during foraging was defined as 3 cm max etce where et is the total amount of energy being carried by the agent at time t and ce is a constant representing the energetic cost imposed by each unit of energy being carried cm is subtracted from e0 at each time step the agent spends foraging in the environment at the beginning of a foraging trip time step 0 et is equal to trip energy e0 and it decreases at each time step as the agent moves through the environment and it increases at each time step the agent encounters a patch and picks up the energy load from it the rate at which e0 is reduced is higher when et is large due to the increased energetic expenditure required to carry larger amounts of energy when an agent encounters a patch the energy value of the patch ep is instantaneously added to its current energy et and it continues its movement uninterrupted at the start of each time step an agent calculates the energetic cost to return to the central place from its current location in a straight line and once the total energy spent foraging cm including the return trip is greater than or equal to e0 the agent ceases foraging and returns to the central place by moving in a straight line heinze et al 2018 the net energetic gain from a foraging trip eg can therefore be summarized as 4 eg nep cm where n is the number of food patches encountered during the foraging trip the energetic yield of a foraging trip nep is added to the current value of the energy store at time t st when the energetic yield of a foraging trip is greater than the cost of the trip cm eg is positive and the foraging trip has a net positive effect on the energy store however the cost of the trip can also be greater than the yield in which case eg is negative and the trip has a net negative effect on the energy store upon its return to the central place and after depositing its energetic load into the energy store the agent draws an amount of resting energy er from the energy store and remains in the central place spending er at a rate dictated by its mr and once the value of er equals zero it draws e0 from the energy store and leaves the central place on another foraging trip agents with higher mr spend this resting energy er more quickly and therefore engage in more frequent foraging trips agents have activity cycles divided into an active time ta during which they forage and tr when they rest and an entire activity cycle of ta tr is referred to as a day during tr agents draw energy from the energy store reducing it by a value equal to their mr at each time step 2 4 simulations at the start of each simulation run all agents have 0 energy et 0 and the value of the energy store st is set to an amount of energy enough for 10 foraging trips per agent the model environment and agent characteristics described above refer to the 1 basic environment we modified the environment and agent characteristics in the following manner to evaluate five additional environments that investigate further aspects of how mr may influence performance 2 temporal variation environment where the energy value of the food patches ep switches from large to small or vice versa during the rest period of each day tr while mean ep remains the same as in the basic environment the large and small patch values were calculated such that the coefficient of variation from the mean was always 1 which ensures that variability is constant across different patch values 3 spatial variation environment where food patches are distributed in the environment in clumps instead of at random these clumped environments were defined as having a dispersion index equal to 3 0 1 4 information environment where an agent shares information about the location in terms of distance and direction of the last food patch it encountered in its previous foraging trip as it is typical of honeybees seeley 1995 after every foraging trip an agent compares its foraging gain eg to the average foraging gain gavg across all trips by all agents in the group and adds the location as a unit of information to a group level information pool with a probability pi defined as 5 pi eg 2gavg this results in a probability of 1 for information sharing when eg 2gavg last encountered food patch by an agent is twice as good as the average of what other agents have found and a probability of 0 for information sharing when eg gavg last encountered food patch is much poorer than the average of what other agents have found all pi values were scaled between 0 and 1 agents leaving on a foraging trip have a fixed probability of 0 9 for randomly selecting an information unit from the information pool to use a high probability of using information while still allowing for some agents to not use previously gathered information and explore new areas of the environment an information unit can be used only once and once used the information unit is removed from the information pool an agent using information travels in a straight line from the central place to the specified location after which it reverts to moving randomly for the remainder of the foraging trip 5 spatial variation with information environment a combination of the second and the third environments 6 division of labor environment where half the agents within a group are randomly designated as foragers each day while the other half act as non foragers who remain at the central place non foragers represent agents dedicated to within nest tasks and they deplete the energy store according to their mr in a manner identical to the behavior of all agents during tr the environments with information sharing or division of labor are the only ones in which we assume group level properties that are relevant to the functioning of social groups for the simulation of each environment a single group of each type pure high pure medium pure low or mixed is placed by itself into a randomly generated environment of the given type each of these simulations was run across a range of food patch values 1 ep 100 000 and repeated 1000 times and we report each of our performance measures as the average of 1000 simulated groups we do not report error bars in our figures because they were too small and did not lead us to any interesting biological insights additional simulations were run to assess the sensitivity of the model and the functional importance of some of the parameters since we used 20 agents to simulate our model to save on computing time we evaluated the effect of group size at 1 2 20 and 200 agents the effect of group composition was evaluated with additional group types consisting of 1 1 1 or 1 2 1 mix of low medium and high mr agents the mathematical relationship between ma and velocity was tested at vx kmax 0 5 vx kmax vx kmax 2 vx kmax 3 and vx 6 a constant value unrelated to amr the effect of load cost ce was examined at ce 0 0001 ce 0 001 and ce 0 01 the set of different relationships examined here is an arbitrary choice and was meant to cover a broad range of possible but simple relationships various rules based on different currencies that might dictate when a forager leaves for a foraging trip were also evaluated including after spending a constant amount of energy er 10 after spending a random amount of energy er a random number between 0 and 20 with an average of 10 after spending a constant number of time steps 60 and after spending a random number of time steps a random number 20 and 120 with an average of 60 3 results the size of the energy store st for any group over its lifetime expectedly increases with patch value in all environments fig 1 a therefore in order to compare results across patch values we divided the lifetime energy storage by the patch value ep which reveals that the pure low groups collect more energy than other groups at smaller patch values while the pure high groups collect the most amount of energy when patch values are large fig 1b s1 the parabolic shape of this measure is a result of higher survival of agents with the initial increase in patch value and therefore a decreased starvation risk and then a decrease in agent lifespan at large patch values from the energetic cost of movement with large loads given the limit on lifetime energetic expenditure the parabolic shape however should not be interpreted as a lower performance in richer environments because the size of the energy stores was indeed larger in richer environments fig 1a also note that energy collected and stored can be used for reproduction and therefore the production of new agents at a certain rate aspects that are not part of our model for the sake of parsimony in terms of daily energy storage the pure high groups store more energy across nearly all patch values and all groups show a peak in daily collection at intermediate patch values fig 1c these patterns hold true across a range of group sizes when lifetime energy storage is evaluated on a per agent basis fig s2 including a group consisting of a single individual indicating that the results of the model applies to individual foragers as well as groups to determine the relative advantage of the different groups over each other we calculated their relative foraging success by dividing the lifetime energy storage of each group at each patch value by the mean lifetime energy storage of all groups across all environments at that patch value the relative foraging success is a unitless measure where a score of 1 indicates an average performance a score of 2 indicates a performance twice as good as average and so on in all environments the pure low groups have a higher relative foraging success than pure high groups for small patch values and this trend reverses at large patch values fig 2 at very large and very small patch values the performance of the pure medium groups falls between the pure low and the pure high groups but at intermediate patch values the pure medium groups show a small advantage over all other groups in majority of the environments in the division of labor environment fig 2f the mixed groups show a distinct advantage across all but the largest patch values a pattern that is also noticed when considering the absolute size of the lifetime energy store fig s1f the overall decrease in foraging success for all groups in the division of labor environment is expected because only half the agents forage on any given day information has little effect on relative foraging success in a spatially random environment fig 2d but when information is used in a spatially variable environment fig 2e all groups show an increase in foraging success we further tested the effect of group composition in the basic and the division of labor environments by examining the performance of four groups with the same mr at the group level with a group size of 24 we examined 4 group compositions with the same group level mr in addition to the pure medium all mam and the standard mixed 1 2 mal and 1 2 mah groups used throughout the model we created two more mixed groups one with an equal number of high medium and low mr agents 1 3 mal 1 3 mam 1 3 mah and another consisting of a quarter low mr agents half medium mr agents and a quarter high mr agents 1 4 mal 1 2 mam 1 4 mah in the basic scenario the precise composition of agent metabolic rates has little effect on group performance and the average metabolic rate of the group dictates foraging success fig s3 in the division of labor scenario however we see that the standard mixed group composed of only high and low mr agents outperforms both the pure medium group and the two additional groups each containing agents of all the three types at intermediate patch values high mr agents are costly and at small patch values they can be even more costly by engaging in low yield foraging trips conversely at larger patch values high mr agents pay out their maintenance costs by achieving greater foraging yields than low mr agents the advantage of mixed colonies is reduced at very small or large patch values because the different advantages of high and low mr agents cancel out each other at these values the advantage available at intermediate patch values to the standard mixed group is due to its higher variance the same reason why it is able to outperform the other two mixed groups pure low and mixed groups have substantially longer lifespans than both pure high and pure medium groups under all patch values but the advantage is reduced at extreme patch values both small and large fig 3 all groups show a sharp increase in lifespan as patch value initially increases which marks the threshold at which agents begins to live until senescence rather than dying of starvation fig s4 this threshold patch value is smallest for the pure low group and largest for the pure high group which follows from their respective energetic demands the large difference in lifespan between the mixed and the pure medium group is interesting since both groups have identical energetic requirement at the group level however the presence of low mr individuals in the mixed groups allows these groups to survive longer than the homogeneous pure medium groups mixed groups have very similar lifespans as pure low groups except in the division of labor environment where all groups live somewhat longer fig 3f because division of labor allows agents to forage half as often which saves energy and takes them longer to reach the maximum lifetime energetic expenditure the decline in lifespan in the richest environments is attributable to the energetic cost of carrying large energy loads and the model constraint that requires the agents to always fully exploit a patch the difference in group lifespan between low and high mr groups fundamentally arises from the longer individual lifespan of low mr agents fig 4 a interestingly the lifespan of low and high mr agents differs depending on whether they live in pure or mixed groups these observed differences in lifespan can be further explored in terms of what we define as realized lifespan as agents die of senescence when they have used a fixed amount of energy and as their mr determines the pace at which they reach this energy maximum each mr has a specific maximum life expectancy associated with it we defined life expectancy for each mr as the age at which an agent would die if it only rested and did not forage in terms of realized lifespan calculated as actual lifespan life expectancy all three types of agents low medium high have very similar patterns fig 4b showing a sharp increase with the initial increase in patch value and an eventual decrease at large patch values as seen earlier the frequency distribution of lifespan is bimodal for agents of all three mr types fig 4c with an initial peak for agents that die of starvation and a second peak for those that die of senescence interestingly low mr agents in mixed groups die less frequently of senescence a shorter second peak and more frequently of starvation a taller first peak compared to those in pure groups who show the opposite pattern in contrast high mr agents in mixed groups die less frequently of starvation a shorter first peak and more frequently of senescence a taller second peak compared to those in pure groups who show the opposite pattern fig 4c load cost ce has a strong negative influence on the total amount of energy harvested and stored at small patch values a reduced load cost resulted in pure low groups gathering more energy than pure high groups and an increased load cost resulting in a reversal of fortunes fig 5 a the negative effect of increased load cost on low mr groups is correlated to a higher reduction in lifespan advantage experienced by them compared to high mr groups fig s5a at large patch values a change in load cost has little effect on the relative performance of the different groups fig 5b load cost has a strong effect on foraging returns in poor resource environments as the load cost represents a larger proportion of the total cost of a foraging trip on the other hand load cost has a strong effect on lifespan in rich environments fig s5b due to the multiplicative relationship between load cost and the amount of resources gathered on a trip the cost of a single trip can comprise a much larger portion of the maximum lifetime energy expenditure of an individual when patch value is large this is consistent with the general decline in lifespan observed at larger patch values fig 3 the relationship between active metabolic rate and movement velocity is a critical assumption in the model and different relationships lead to significantly different results the difference in energy storage due to different assumptions made between ma and movement velocity is more prominent in poor environments the assumption of a simple linear relationship provides the least advantage to a group of any specific metabolic type fig 5c and d low mr groups perform better when movement velocity is either unrelated to mr a constant or it is a saturating function of mr while high mr groups can do better when movement velocity is an accelerating function of mr overall high mr groups outperform low mr groups when the cost of a high mr is compensated for by a velocity advantage the model is more sensitive to whether a currency of energy or time is used as a foraging rule rather than whether it is a random or a constant value of the specific currency fig 5e and f a foraging rule based on time gives an advantage to low mr groups at both small and large patch values while a foraging rule based on energy gives an advantage to low mr groups at small patch values and a small advantage to high mr groups at large patch values when agents leave on foraging trips based on a time rule high mr agents pay a higher energetic cost of unproductive waiting than low mr agents and both mr types forage at similar frequencies using an energy based foraging rule which is more consistent with individuals foraging to meet an energetic need leads to high mr agents foraging more frequently than low mr agents 4 discussion our model suggests that differences in mr can interact with the resource environment to have a significant impact on the foraging success and lifespan of individuals and groups broadly the pure low mr groups had an advantage in lifespan in all environments and in energy storage in resource poor environments while the pure high mr groups stored more energy than other groups in rich environments this finding is consistent with both theoretical and empirical work suggesting that both a high mr and a fast pace of life pol are more likely to be adaptive only when resources are abundant while a slow pol has an advantage when resources are scarce biro and stamps 2010 burton et al 2011 auer et al 2015 the pure medium groups outperformed all other groups in term of energy storage in environments of intermediate richness while division of labor allowed the mixed groups to take the lead in all environments except in the very richest ones division of labor resulted in an advantage to mixed groups consisting of low and high mr individuals over other groups this is an interesting result because at the group level the mixed group is similar to the pure intermediate mr group as both groups have identical mr when averaged across all agents this outcome arises in spite of our parsimonious assumption that labor foraging or staying in the nest is divided randomly across individuals of different mr although in reality division of labor is a non random process beshers and fewell 2001 such division of labor related advantage may be even more exaggerated if labor is adaptively allocated such that individuals with higher mr perform tasks that are more energetically demanding while those with lower mr perform less demanding tasks feuerbacher et al 2003 or have low mr individuals forage in poor environments and high mr individuals forage in rich environments thereby optimizing the energetic cost benefit ratio this supports the idea that diversity among the units constituting a higher level phenotype can be adaptive because it allows a larger range of response to a complex and dynamic environment piersma and drent 2003 woods 2014 an idea especially relevant to groups showing division of labor such as social insects myerscough and oldroyd 2004 oldroyd and fewell 2007 while behavioral variation and division of labor are considered to be the primary mechanisms that allow social groups to adjust for variations in the resource environment our results show that interindividual variation in mr can be a primary mechanism underlying this advantage understanding such energetic principles of biological organization and the links between mr and pol at the individual and the group level can bring insights to fundamental questions regarding social evolution such as how variation in mr drives division of labor and contributes to the extraordinary ecological success of social groups variability in the environment reduced the performance of all groups to an extent and the ability to use information in such environments not too surprisingly allowed them to compensate for this decrease this indicates that the ability to share information amplifies the foraging advantage of all groups but does not provide an advantage to foragers of any particular mr interestingly the pure low groups showed the largest influence of information use in these environments extracting a large advantage from such behavior when the environment was poor but also showing the highest decline in relative performance when the environment was rich somewhat counterintuitively mixed groups or those with intermediate mr did not show any particular advantage over the other groups in a variable environment suggesting that division is labor is the critical factor that can provide an advantage to mixed groups rather than metabolic diversity alone the mechanisms underlying lifespan is one of the most important and unresolved question in biology and our use of a maximum lifetime energy expenditure to determine senescence is in line with both the pol and the rate of living hypotheses careau and garland 2012 speakman 2005 empirical findings on the effect of mr on lifespan are quite mixed with studies reporting the association of longer lifespan with a low mr wikelski et al 2003 being often confounded by other factors duarte and speakman 2014 our results show a consistent lifespan advantage for individuals with low mr but individuals of all mr types show an increase in lifespan as the environment initially becomes richer due to the accompanying decrease in starvation risk individuals however also show a decline in lifespan in the richest environments due to the energetic cost of harvesting large energy loads as they maximize energetic gain this is consistent with the observation that individuals which forage more or work harder have reduced lifespans schmid hempel and wolf 1988 either as a direct consequence of energy expenditure or as a consequence of higher oxidative stress associated with higher activity levels margotta et al 2018 such energetic constraints and the need to preserve lifespan may be responsible for why animals choose to maximize foraging efficiency as a currency rather than rate of energy gain schmid hempel et al 1985 houston et al 1988 nolet 2002 our results also show an interesting influence of group context on the lifespan of individuals with different mr low mr individuals in mixed groups die less frequently of senescence than those in pure low mr groups while high mr individuals in mixed groups die more frequently of senescence than those in pure high mr groups death due to starvation has exactly the opposite pattern in mixed versus pure groups this suggests that the fitness of different mr types in a group can be subject to frequency dependent processes and such mechanisms can play an important role in the dynamics of social evolution the frequency distribution defining the interindividual variation in mr within a group by setting the rates of resource acquisition allocation and expenditure can therefore have a complex effect in determining its life history trajectory and pol this also means that individuals of different mr types may not contribute equally to measures of group performance which may also underlie the workload based reproductive conflicts seen in eusocial groups schmid hempel 1990 these results therefore suggest that diversity in mr can create the scope for both cooperation and conflict in social groups and understanding these dynamics can provide a metabolic or energetic basis for social evolution our model was found to be sensitive to the assumptions regarding the energetic cost of carrying a load the relationship between mr and movement velocity and the rule based on which foragers leave the nest on a foraging trip it is therefore important to test these relationships to get a comprehensive understanding regarding how mr can be expected to influence life history parameters and pol in different species or in different resource environments since intraspecific variation in mr can have a genetic component arnqvist et al 2010 the observed interaction between the resource environment and mr on our performance measures can be depicted as behavioral or metabolic reaction norms fig 6 which can then be used to make testable predictions regarding how mr may influence pol in different environments the next important steps in extending this model involve first validating it and then building in other important life history parameters to investigate important ideas such as how differences in metabolic rate can translate to differences in relative allocations into survival growth and reproduction since our model spans different levels of biological organization social insects can serve as excellent experimental systems to test its predictions at both the individual and the group level social insect colonies which are characterized by a high degree of behavioral and physiological variation jeanson and weidenmuller 2014 and can be experimentally taken apart and reassembled in different configurations to study individual and group level properties are ideal for understanding how variation in mr might be associated with interindividual variation in behavior and pol and how these parameters scale up to determine life history and pol at the colony level waters et al 2010 shik et al 2012 prior experimental work shows that interindividual behavioral variation is significantly influenced by differences in energetic demand and mr mayack and naug 2011 2013 katz and naug 2015 2016 reade et al 2019 given this since there are known and ecologically relevant genetic markers for mr in honeybees harrison and fewell 2002 it is possible to measure the performance of individuals of known mr types and that of experimentally created groups with specific frequencies of these different mr types in different types of resource environments using such an approach and measuring various behavioral and life history parameters can allow a powerful test of how gene environment interactions with respect to interindividual variation in mr can impact energy acquisition and allocation characteristics and influence pace of life at different levels of biological organization to shape social evolution author contributions dn

24932,we develop a three stage stochastic individual based model for the phenology of the parthenogenetic mayfly neocloeon triangulifer ephemeroptera baetidae mayflies are poikilothermic and develop at a rate dependent on the temperature of their aquatic environment the model was built using development data for each aquatic stage from controlled laboratory studies to determine the variation in development rates present in the population and the development rate response curve to temperature variable temperature experiments simulating diel temperature changes were used to validate the model the thermal input data for the model is based on average daily water temperature recordings from white clay creek from january 2007 to 2013 the model predicts a multivoltine life cycle with a mode of 3 generations per year that agrees well with field observations an optimally timed quiescent period for larvae triggered by day length is shown to enhance synchronization of adult emergence any future stream temperature rise is predicted to increase the number of generations per year and desynchronize adult emergence and these changes could lead to significant population decline in species that reproduce sexually keywords phenology mayfly individual based model climate change voltinism 1 introduction mayflies are benthic macroinvertebrates that are primary consumers of algae and organic detritus in most freshwater streams rivers wetlands and lakes and in turn serve as an important food source for fish and other aquatic and terrestrial predators allan and castillo 2007 they are highly sensitive to pollution and their presence alongside caddisflies and stoneflies is commonly used as an indicator of stream health rosenberg and resh 1993 mayflies have a three stage life cycle egg nymph adult and undergo hemimetabolous metamorphosis brittain 1982 satori and brittain 2015 immature mayflies or nymphs are aquatic and pass through an indeterminant number of molts 10 15 or more final instar nymphs molt twice in quick succession to a terrestrial stage first to a sexually immature winged adult stage subimago and then a final time to the sexually mature winged adult imago the imago stage is ephemeral lasting only several hours to several days during which adults form a mating swarm over the water before mated females return to the water surface to lay their eggs and die approximately 95 99 of the life cycle of most north temperate species is spent as an egg or nymph in the aquatic system sweeney et al 1992 mayflies are notable for their synchronous mass emergence with some emergence events so large and widespread they can be observed on doppler weather radar u s fish wildlife service fisheries midwest region sweeney and vannote 1982 mayflies like other insects are poikilothermic or cold blooded the rate at which they grow and develop and the timing of their life stages are thus directly controlled by environmental conditions especially temperature and food sweeney and vannote 1984 mayfly species in the tropics and warm temperate regions typically have a multivoltine life cycle while those in cool temperate regions have a univoltine life cycle gray 1981 jackson and sweeney 1995 jacobi and benke 1991 many species of baetidae have the ability to switch from multivoltine to univoltine or even semivoltine in rare cases depending on water temperature and food availability satori and brittain 2015 a variety of mathematical modeling frameworks have been developed to describe phenology and predict voltinism in mayflies and other insects these models built on earlier work describing plant phenology where temperature is also a critical factor for growth and development wang 1960 many of the recent insect studies have focused on pests such as mountain pine beetle bentz et al 1991 logan and amman 1986 powell and bentz 2009 régnière et al 2015 spruce budworm régnière 1990 cooke and régnière 1996 nealis and régnière 2014 régnière et al 2012b and sugarcane aphid wang et al 2019 because understanding and predicting population dynamics are important in infestation management pruess 1983 early life history studies of mayflies and other aquatic insects applied the degree day concept which assumes development rate is a linear function of temperature to help summarize or predict the timing of the life cycle e g miller 1941 huffaker 1944 fahy 1973 clifford 1978 sweeney and schnack 1977 sweeney 1978 markarian 1980 gillooly and dodson 2000 these analyses were based on field or laboratory data measuring egg and larval development times in constant and variable temperature treatments some of these degree day models incorporated lower developmental thresholds for egg or nymphal development that were observed or estimated to be 0 c while others observed or assumed it was 0 c where data were available from multiple sites or treatments that included thermal extremes some noted that the linear nature or consistency of the degree day model might not be applicable appropriate e g lillehammer et al 1989 giberson and rosenberg 1994 more recently a two stage phenological model for mayflies was developed to predict how a single species could maintain a univoltine life cycle across a broad geographic range representing a wide range of thermal habitats newbold et al 1994 it used the degree day concept but incorporated a lower threshold for development as a parameter to be estimated by fitting the model to field data however its applicability was somewhat limited due to the fact that only one individual was simulated it included just two life stages and the same annual thermal regime was used repeatedly herein we develop a three stage individual based stochastic phenological model for species of mayfly neocloeontriangulifer ephemeroptera baetidae mcdunnough 1931 to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature this species has been used as a laboratory model in ecological and toxicological studies sweeney and vannote 1984 sweeney et al 1993 kim et al 2017 jackson and funk 2019 laboratory and field data indicate that n triangulifer formerly classified in the genus cloeon or centroptilum has at least three generations per year in white clay creek 39 52 n 75 46 w 125 m with a highly synchronized adult emergence for the overwintering generation sweeney and vannote 1984 neocloeon triangulifer reproduce through obligate parthenogenesis funk et al 2006 even though individuals are clones there is much variability in development times e g 6 30 days at 25 c for egg stage and life history characteristics growth size fecundity when they are reared under constant temperature laboratory controlled conditions development rates are not measured directly but are inferred as the inverse of the observed development time in a given stage thus the development rate can be thought of as the proportion of the total stage duration per unit of time régnière et al 2012a many different distributions have been used to model variation in poikilotherm development examples include the distribution model of sharpe et al 1977 the logistic function règniére 1984 the lognormal distribution régnière et al 2012a the weibull distribution function wagner et al 1984 and the extended von foerster model gilbert et al 2004 it is important to fit the distribution of development times directly rather than transform the data to developmental rates 1 time when using least squares this is due to the fact that the transformation is nonlinear and consequentially an error in observed and predicted developmental times at a given temperature does not translate to the same error in observed and predicted developmental rates at all temperatures bentz et al 1991 another key component to phenological modeling is the parameterization of a mean development rate curve that is temperature dependent degree day models use a linear rate curve that is a reasonable approximation at intermediate temperature but not at extremes moore and remais 2014 linear rate models can estimate the lower temperature threshold for development many different nonlinear models have been developed and tested in the literature some are biophysical mechanistic like the model of sharpe and demichele 1977 which is based on arrhenius and eyring s equations while other models are more phenomenological logan et al 1976 lactin et al 1995 some nonlinear models can estimate both upper and lower temperature thresholds for development and the temperature at which the rate of development is maximized for an overview see logan 1988 and for more recent studies validating different nonlinear rate curves against experimental data see martínez garcía et al 2016 kontodimas et al 2004 for poikilotherms the rate at which physiological time progresses generally depends both on the development rate curve and the actual sequence and range of temperature experienced by the animals taylor 1981 régnière and powell 2013 a variety of frameworks have been used in the literature to model phenology including cohort based models sharpe et al 1977 curry et al 1978b wagner et al 1985 logan 1988 bentz et al 1991 distributed delay models welch et al 1978 partial differential equations gilbert et al 2004 powell and bentz 2009 pasquali et al 2019 rossini et al 2019 integral projection models goodsman et al 2018 and individual based models régnière and powell 2013 nealis and régnière 2014 grimm and railsback 2005 wang et al 2019 although all approaches can be productive we prefer to use individual based models ibms because they provide a flexible and convenient modeling framework individuals are given a stochastic rate of development and are simulated as they pass through life stages ibms can readily incorporate responses that might be discontinuous e g characterized by thresholds or if then rules or stochastic in nature kolpas et al 2007 natural selection can be incorporated by transmitting developmental rates to progeny régnière and powell 2013 in general ibms have higher computational demands than other models but with modern computing capabilities this is less of an issue than it was in past decades furthermore computational tools such as parallel simulation li et al 2009 graphics processing units li et al 2009 sanders and kandrot 2010 and the vectorization of code in matlab can improve performance here we introduce describe and test a three stage egg nymph adult stochastic individual based model for the phenology of the mayfly n triangulifer the egg and nymph stages are aquatic while the adult stage is terrestrial the model uses development data for each aquatic stage from controlled temperature food photoperiod laboratory studies to determine the variation in development rates and the development rate response curve to temperature variable temperature experiments simulating diel temperature changes are used for model validation the thermal input data for the model is based on average daily water temperature recordings from white clay creek from january 2007 to 2013 the model enables us to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature a larval quiescent period triggered by short day length is added to the model in order to explore its impact on seasonal synchrony finally we use the model to predict how warming the natural pattern and magnitude of temperature of white clay creek and freshwater habitats in general might impact the phenology of this mayfly 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory data 2 1 1 laboratory methods development times for n triangulifer were determined in the laboratory following methods described in sweeney et al 2018 test animals were from a culture maintained at the stroud water research center clone wcc 2 individuals were reared at both constant and variable temperature treatments with a 15 9 h light dark photoperiod with lights on at 0500h and lights off at 2000h for the egg stage hatching times were recorded in days from oviposition to hatching for the nymph stage development times were recorded in days from egg hatch to adult emergence 2 1 2 constant temperature data for the egg stage individuals were reared at 5 constant temperature treatments t 15 20 25 28 32 c for the nymph stage individuals were reared at 10 constant temperature treatments t 14 16 18 20 22 24 25 26 27 28 c high mortality led to small sample sizes at the warmer temperature treatments distributions of development times were right skewed toward longer development times see table 1 for development time data as expected for both stages the median development time decreases as temperature increases the constant temperature data is used to parameterize the model in section 2 2 7 2 1 3 variable temperature data for the nymph stage additional variable temperature experiments were performed to simulate diel changes in temperature with a daily average of t av 18 22 26 c the following periodic ramp function was used to simulate a diel temperature change of 5 c throughout the day with a ramp rate of 0 5 c per hour 1 t t t av 2 5 0 t 1 5 0 5 t 1 5 t av 2 5 1 5 t 11 5 t av 2 5 11 5 t 13 5 0 5 t 23 5 t av 2 5 13 5 t 23 5 t av 2 5 23 5 t 24 where t is in hours since 0500 h see table 2 for development time data at 26 c the median individual exposed to the variable temperature experiment takes two days longer to develop than the median individual exposed to the constant temperature experiment in the appendix we take a more thorough look at the differences between the distributions from the constant and variable temperature experiments at all temperature treatments furthermore we discuss how differences in timing can be explained with jensen s inequality jensen 1906 by considering the convexity of the temperature dependent development rate curve the variable temperature data is used for model validation in section 3 1 2 2 individual based model formulation we use the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 to describe the individual based model ibm see fig 1 for a schematic overview of the model 2 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise in the mayfly n triangulifer through direct control by temperature a larval quiescent period triggered by day length is included in order to explore its impact on seasonal synchrony finally we use the model to predict how warming the natural pattern and magnitude of temperature of white clay creek and freshwater habitats in general might impact the phenology of this mayfly 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales each individual in the model is characterized by its age 0 a 1 and stage j there are three stages in the model egg j 0 nymph j 1 and adult j 2 the egg and nymph stage are aquatic while the adult stage is terrestrial the rate at which individuals age in stages 0 and 1 is probabilistic individuals develop at different rates and is temperature dependent the rate at which individuals age in stage 2 is constant as adults are short lived only living about one day the duration of the adult stage is probably also temperature dependent but data is not readily available time is discretized into time steps of length δt 1 day the scale by which temperature is recorded 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling let a i j t be the physiological age of individual i in stage j at time t at each time step individuals age according to the equation 2 a i j t n 1 a i j t n r i j t t n 1 δ t where r i j t t is the temperature dependent development rate of individual i in stage j for the egg j 0 and nymph j 1 stage the rate of development at time t is found by multiplying the relative rate of development r by the population mean development rate function r m t as follows 3 r i j t r i j r m t t j 0 1 this ensures individuals remain in the same percentile throughout the stage with their rate only adjusting to environmental conditions the stochastic treatment of development rates and the development rate function are discussed in section 2 2 7 the adult stage j 2 is treated deterministically an individual s rate of development is given by 4 r i j t 1 j 2 so individuals age out of the stage in one day once an individual reaches or exceeds age one its age is reset to 0 and it moves to the next stage according to the update rule j mod j 1 3 this means an individual in the egg stage moves to the nymph stage an individual in the nymph stage moves to the adult stage and an individual in the adult stage moves back to the egg stage because our focus is on phenology we do not include any mortality with individuals simply replacing themselves individuals entering a new stage are reassigned a stochastic rate of development if j 0 1 or a constant rate of development 1 day 1 if j 2 preliminary experimental work indicates that some mayfly species are not only sensitive to water temperature but day length funk et al 2019 the species n triangulifer overwinters as nymphs and may respond to shorter days by going into a quiescent state where development is suspended even if the temperature is briefly favorable we incorporate this into the ibm by adding a lower threshold for day length l below which individual nymphs enter a quiescent state and do not develop regardless of temperature the lower threshold of day length l triggering a larval quiescent period was treated as a parameter in the range 9 5 12 h 2 2 4 design concepts basic principles herein we explain the theory underlying the design of eq 2 poikilotherms develop at a rate dependent on the temperature of their environment let a j t be the physiological age of the mean individual in stage j at time t such that a j 0 0 at the beginning of the stage and a j t f 1 at the end of the stage it follows that the mean individual ages according the equation 5 da j dt r m t t a j 0 0 where r m r m t t is the temperature dependent mean development rate if the environment is constant then the rate of development is constant and the solution to eq 5 is simply 6 a j t r m t where t f 1 r m if the environment is variable then the solution to the initial value problem 5 is given by 7 a j t 0 t r m t s ds where t f is the solution to a j t f 1 when the development rate function is linear a j t 0 t m t s t min ds where t min is the lower developmental threshold evaluating this expression at t f it follows that a j t f m 1 m 0 t f t s t min ds thus the reciprocal of the slope of the development rate curve 1 m gives the number of degree days to complete development when the development rate function is nonlinear it is often not possible to find an analytical expression for a j t however one can easily estimate the physiological age of an individual with a riemann sum approximation to formulate a right hand riemann sum approximation of eq 7 over 0 t divide the time interval into n equally spaced subintervals of length δt t n with t i iδt for i 0 1 n the right endpoint riemann sum approximation of the integral in eq 7 is then given by 8 a j t n 0 t n r m t s ds i 1 n r m t t i δ t eq 2 follows from the splitting property of the integral as an iterative version of eq 8 emergence rates of development are temperature dependent the existence of a structurally stable multivoltine life cycle is a system level property of the model that is a consequence of the life cycle seasonal temperature day length variation and stage specific differences in rates of aging stochasticity relative rates of development in the egg and nymph stage are determined probabilistically see section 2 2 7 observation a total of 100 replicate simulations were run to obtain sufficient model analysis statistics local maximum corresponding to peaks in adult emergence were filtered using the criteria for a peak to be 5 or more of the population with a peak to peak window of 20 days or more based on a conservative lower bound for development times in the temperature range 0 22 c see table 1 this allows us to quantify the number of generations per year and the degree of synchrony in adult emergence 2 2 5 initialization the following protocol was used to initialize the model because field observations suggest n triangulifer overwinter as early to middle instar nymphs we ran the ibm with a delta distribution of n 5000 individuals all in the nymph stage of age 0 4 forced temporally with a test dataset that consisted of the year 2007 recycled over multiple generations the model was run until the age distribution of nymphs on january 1st reached a metastable state this took approximately 10 15 generations and was verified by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of ages in each stage over time the metastable state was insensitive to small changes in the initial age of individuals we subsequently used the metastable distributions from this test run to initialize the full simulation over 2007 2013 2 2 6 input data input temperature data t t for the ibm consisted of average daily water temperature from a forested site in white clay creek 39 52 n 75 46 w 125 m upstream of the stroud water research center from january 2007 to 2013 duration of day length for avondale pa from january 2007 to 2013 was obtained from the united states naval observatory dataset and was in the range 9 35 15 h usno 2 2 7 submodels distribution ofdevelopment times we adopted the sharpe model sharpe et al 1977 for our stochastic treatment of development times because it is well tested and validated in the literature and provides the best fit to the n triangulifer data when compared to other distribution models the sharpe model gives a simple yet effective explanation for the right skewed nature of development time data as resulting from inverting a symmetric distribution of development rates the sharpe model sharpe et al 1977 starts with the assumption that r the rate control enzyme for development has a symmetric distribution about some mean we will assume this distribution is a truncated normal of the form n r r m σ where r m is the mean rate σ is the standard deviation and r min r r max let t u r 1 r be a random variable representing the development time of an individual because the transformation u is strictly monotonic it follows from change of variables that the distribution of times is given by g t f v t v t where v t 1 t is the inverse of u r then 9 g t r m σ f 1 t 1 t 2 c t 2 2 π σ 2 exp 1 r m t 2 2 σ 2 t 2 1 r max t 1 r min where c is the constant of normalization nonlinear least squares can be used to fit the cumulative distribution function corresponding to eq 9 directly to development time data to find the best fit r m and σ at each temperature now suppose the distributions all have the same shape that is the coefficient of variation c v σ r m is independent of temperature furthermore let r r r m be the normalized rate of development and t 1 r r m t it follows from change of variables that the normalized rate distribution is 10 f r c v n r 1 c v r min r m r r max r m and the normalized time distribution is 11 g t c v g t r m 1 r m c t 2 2 π c v 2 exp 1 t 2 2 c v 2 t 2 r m r max t r m r min for each stage development time data at each constant temperature treatment was normalized by dividing by the median development time the normalized data at each temperature treatment was then pooled and fit to the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the sharpe model eq 11 over 0 using nonlinear least squares curve fitting in matlab for the egg stage data the best fit coefficient of variation was c v 0 112 0 009 while for the nymph stage c v 0 050 0 001 for the egg stage an individual s stochastic relative rate of development r i j was sampled from n r 1 0 112 while for the nymph stage r i j was sampled from n r 1 0 050 the distribution of development times in a variable temperature environment can readily be calculated from eqs 7 and 11 as follows when viewed in light of eq 6 the normalized development time t r m t can be interpreted as the physiological age at which an individual completes development relative to the mean age of 1 it follows see curry et al 1978a for a proof that the distribution of development times in a variable temperature environment is given by g a j t c v developmentrate curve let r m r m t be the temperature dependent population mean development rate curve in degree day models the development rate curve is assumed to be linear moore and remais 2014 that is 12 r m t m t t min where m is the slope of the rate curve in units of degree days 1 and t min is the lower developmental threshold such that r t min 0 for temperature below t min the rate is assumed zero we also considered two different phenomenological nonlinear rate models that are derived using a matched asymptotic method the logan iii model hilbert and logan 1983 logan 1988 martínez garcía et al 2016 has the form 13 r m t ϕ t t min 2 t t min 2 d 2 exp t m t t min δ where t min is the lower developmental threshold for temperature below t min the rate is zero t m is the lethal maximum temperature in degrees c above t min δ is the width of the high temperature boundary area and ϕ and d are empirical constants the lactin model lactin et al 1995 is a modification of the logan i model logan et al 1976 logan 1988 that removes a redundant parameter and allows for the estimation of a lower developmental threshold t min it has the form 14 r m t e ρ t e ρ t a t a t δ λ where t a is the supraoptimal temperature at which r λ δ is the width of the high temperature boundary and ρ and λ are empirical constants for temperature below t min the rate is zero we use the root mean square error rmse to quantify the goodness of fit between the predicted development rate curves and the observed egg and nymph stage development rate data the rmse is defined as 15 rmse i 1 n r ˆ i r i 2 n where r ˆ i is the predicted development rate and r i is the observed development rate for the nymph stage we had sufficient data i e 10 temperature treatments to fit both linear and nonlinear models of the development rate curve while for the egg stage we had limited data i e 5 temperature treatments and thus fit only a linear model table 3 summarizes the results of fitting the data using curve fitting in matlab the parameter estimates rmse developmental thresholds t min and t max optima t opt and inflection points t inf are reported note that we incorporated an estimate of the chronic thermal maximum t max 30 c for the nymph stage data before fitting nonlinear rate curves the maximum was calculated from experimental data as the least upper temperature at which chronic mortality reaches 100 this single data point is crucial for reliably fitting the data to nonlinear models that are capable of describing the high temperature decline in development rates logan 1988 when fitting the linear rate curve we restricted the data to the linear portion of the temperature regime for the egg stage all data was included in the temperature range 15 32 c while for the nymph stage the range was restricted to 14 24 c fig 2 shows the results of fitting the nonlinear lactin model lactin et al 1995 and the linear model 12 to the nymph stage mean development rate data and a linear model to the egg stage mean development rate data water temperature typically remains between 0 and 22 c therefore we selected the linear rate model for the nymph stage in the baseline ibm simulations no warming because it performed the best in this temperature range 3 results 3 1 model validation variable temperature data to validate the model the predicted distribution of development times was calculated as g a j t 0 05 and compared to the observed distribution of development times at each temperature treatment when calculating physiological age we tested each rate curve model e g linear logan iii lactin with temperature modeled according to eq 1 fig 3 compares the predicted cumulative distribution of development times to the observed distribution for each model and each temperature treatment table 4 summarizes the rmses all three models have comparably small rmse at t av 22 c the lactin and logan iii models have comparable errors at each temperature and do a factor of three better than the linear model when t av 26 c this is not surprising because t av 26 c is outside of the range where the linear model fits the development rate data all three models consistently underestimate emergence time at this temperature kolmogorov smirnov test note that two variable temperature treatments were conducted at t av 14 28 c but were not used for model validation for the following reasons experiments at t av 14 c were censored because approximately 20 of the population developed at a significantly slower rate and had not completed development when the experiment was terminated this treatment needs to be repeated to confirm this finding and a new model for development would need to be considered that does not rely on the same shape hypothesis the temperature treatment at t av 28 c was not included due to low sample size n 8 resulting from high mortality 3 2 ibm simulations of phenology the model shows a multivoltine life cycle with a mode of 3 generations per year with emergence of the first generation typically starting in late may early june see table 4 for a summary of results and fig 4 for a sample realization over 2007 2009 when l 10 11 this agrees well with field observations that report n triangulifer to have a relatively long overwintering larval generation followed by at least two summer generations sweeney and vannote 1984 the existence of a larval quiescent period is not needed for synchronization while the choice of l does not impact the mode of 3 generations per year it does greatly affect the degree of synchronization in adult emergence a lower threshold of l 11 h corresponding to a quiescence roughly between october 20 and february 21 optimally enhances synchronization as measured by peak emergence numbers and variation in the number of generations per year see table 5 the degree of synchrony can also be seen in the steady state age distribution of nymphs on january 1st obtained using our initialization protocol without the day length threshold the steady state age distribution has mean 0 4 and standard deviation 0 3 the introduction of a day length threshold of l 11 h does not significantly change the age distribution however when l 11 the age distribution of nymphs changes substantially becoming tightly peaked with mean 0 01 and standard deviation 0 04 increasing the day length threshold above 11 h increases the mean and standard deviation back to baseline levels to estimate the impact of warming stream temperature on the phenology of n triangulifer we ran the full model with l 11 over 2007 2013 but with temperature increased by 1 3 6 c we did not consider 9 c as this would lead to lethal chronic temperature above t max 30 c for the 1 c increase we retained the linear model of nymph rate development for all other increments the lactin model eq 14 was selected the mode of the number of generations per year increases to 4 with a temperature increase of 1 and 3 c and then to 5 generations per year when temperature increases by 6 c see table 6 for a summary of results and fig 5 for a sample realization over 2007 2009 synchronization in adult emergence goes down with increasing temperature with the maximum peak in adult emergence dropping by a factor of two or more with just a 1 c increase an increase in temperature of 3 or 6 c does not significantly decrease synchronization further the mismatch between the seasonal temperature cycle and photoperiod cycle contributes to the loss of synchrony with warming a day length threshold of 11 h no longer optimizes maximum peak emergence when temperature warms in particular l 10 is optimal when temperature is increased by 1 c and l 10 5 is optimal when temperature is increased by 3 6 c 4 discussion our stochastic individual based model shows that multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature alone moreover the number and timing of the generations agrees well with field observations sweeney and vannote 1984 theoretical results for minimal models linear rate sinusoidal temperature have shown seasonal temperature variation and stage specific differences in rates of aging are sufficient to create structurally stable uni and multi voltine cycles in n stage organisms powell et al 2000 this has been tested in more realistic models of mountain pine beetle that include nonlinear rate functions and are driven with realistic temperature series bentz et al 1991 powell et al 2000 in our model of n triangulifer the egg and nymph stage have different developmental thresholds see table 3 thus our ibm provides further evidence that seasonal synchrony is a robust feature of temperature dependent models for poikilotherm development preliminary experimental work indicates that certain mayfly species are not only sensitive to temperature but day length funk et al 2019 while our model demonstrates seasonal temperature changes alone are sufficient to establish seasonality the existence of a larval quiescent period triggered by day length greatly enhances synchronization by varying the lower day length threshold for quiescence we showed there exists an optimal threshold that maximizes peak emergence and minimizes variation in the number of generations per year for n triangulifer the optimal threshold was 11 h which corresponds to a larval quiescence roughly between october 20 and february 21 without this quiescence larvae could continue to develop into mid november to late december on days where the temperature exceeds the lower developmental threshold which would spread out emergence later into the fall absence of the quiescence that results in late emergence could be a problem if the air temperature is too cold the next day for the molt to imago or for adult flight while n triangulifer is parthenogenetic the majority of mayfly species are not and rely on coordinated mass emergence over their ephemeral reproductive life span in order to find a mate and reproduce more efficiently as well as to increase overall reproductive success through mechanisms such as predator satiation sweeney and vannote 1982 our model provides evidence for the value of a quiescent period as an additional stabilizing factor to increase the degree of synchrony scientists have high confidence that greenhouse gas emissions will cause global temperature and consequentially stream temperature to rise ipcc 2014 regional increases in air and stream temperature for the time period 1960 2014 have been documented by usgs jastram and rice 2015 regression based statistical models that use air temperature as the predictor of stream temperature estimate increases ranging between 1 and 9 c by the year 2050 arismendi et al 2014 while stream temperature will certainly be affected by climate change it may also be impacted by industrial discharges hydrologic alteration land cover and topography jastram and rice 2015 approximately 20 of mayfly species worldwide may be at risk due to factors such as pollution invasive species habitat loss and degradation and climate change jacobus et al 2019 rising temperature is changing the geographical ranges population dynamics and phenologies of aquatic insect communities jacobus et al 2019 warming lengthens the season for development in poikilotherms in multivoltine species with developmental plasticity this could lead to an increase in the number of generations per year boosting population growth an observational study of the mayfly ephemera danica in the uk showed the species was capable of adjusting voltinism in response to spatial and temporal water temperature variations everall et al 2015 in our model increasing temperature is predicted to increase the number of generations per year in accordance with these findings moreover it has been shown that mayflies become smaller and have decreased fecundity as temperature warms and that responses are taxa and gender specific sweeney et al 2018 sardi na et al 2017 this could change the role of mayflies as consumers of algae and detritus in stream food webs and as a major food source for fish sweeney et al 1992 recently it has been hypothesized that if information on seasonal change conveyed by the photoperiod is blurred by rapid warming a lost generation unable to complete development will result van dyck et al 2015 this may have been confirmed in a study on the impact of increased water temperature on the late season phenology of the mayfly baetis liebenauae glazaczow et al 2016 while our model doesn t include population dynamics it highlights the role of a quiescent period triggered by photoperiod in synchronizing mayfly dynamics and preventing late fall emergence furthermore the model shows that warming creates a mismatch between the seasonal temperature cycle and photoperiod cycle the day length threshold without warming is no longer optimal with warming incorporating temperature dependent population dynamics births deaths into the current ibm are needed to predict more accurately the implications of warming on population viability and will be the subject of future work funding this paper benefitted from grants from the us national science foundation deb1455906to bws jkj and dhf and the stroud endowment for environmental research appendix a understanding differences between constant and variable temperature experiments with jensen s inequaltiy fig a 6 compares the cumulative distribution of development times for three variable temperature treatments with daily average t av against three comparable constant temperature treatments where temperature is fixed at t av throughout the day there is a significant difference between the distributions kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 at all temperature treatments this difference is most pronounced at t av 26 c maximum absolute difference 0 5 and least pronounced at t av 22 c maximum absolute difference 0 15 individuals tend to take less time to develop in the variable temperature treatments than in the constant when t av 18 c and more time in the variable temperature experiments when t av 22 26 c this can be understood in terms of jensen s inequality which relates the effects of nonlinear averaging to concavity fig a 7 illustrates jensen s inequality for a simple two point temperature average the result generalizes to the case of a continuous average when t t inf the rate curve is convex and the average rate is greater than the rate at the average temperature in this case individuals require less time to complete development in a variable environment than in a constant environment when t t inf the rate curve is concave and the average rate is less than the rate at the average temperature in this case individuals require more time to complete development in a variable environment than in a constant environment the logan iii model gives an estimate of t inf 18 2 while the lactin model gives an estimate of t inf 19 7 when t av 18 c temperature fluctuations of 2 5 c primarily cover the convex portion of the rate curve in the lactin model but not in the logan iii model thus the lactin model better explains the temperature treatment effect according to jensen s inequality in contrast when t av 22 26 c temperature fluctuations of 2 5 c primarily cover the concave portion of the rate curve in both the lactin and logan iii model in this case both models explain the temperature treatment effect according to jensen s inequality 
24932,we develop a three stage stochastic individual based model for the phenology of the parthenogenetic mayfly neocloeon triangulifer ephemeroptera baetidae mayflies are poikilothermic and develop at a rate dependent on the temperature of their aquatic environment the model was built using development data for each aquatic stage from controlled laboratory studies to determine the variation in development rates present in the population and the development rate response curve to temperature variable temperature experiments simulating diel temperature changes were used to validate the model the thermal input data for the model is based on average daily water temperature recordings from white clay creek from january 2007 to 2013 the model predicts a multivoltine life cycle with a mode of 3 generations per year that agrees well with field observations an optimally timed quiescent period for larvae triggered by day length is shown to enhance synchronization of adult emergence any future stream temperature rise is predicted to increase the number of generations per year and desynchronize adult emergence and these changes could lead to significant population decline in species that reproduce sexually keywords phenology mayfly individual based model climate change voltinism 1 introduction mayflies are benthic macroinvertebrates that are primary consumers of algae and organic detritus in most freshwater streams rivers wetlands and lakes and in turn serve as an important food source for fish and other aquatic and terrestrial predators allan and castillo 2007 they are highly sensitive to pollution and their presence alongside caddisflies and stoneflies is commonly used as an indicator of stream health rosenberg and resh 1993 mayflies have a three stage life cycle egg nymph adult and undergo hemimetabolous metamorphosis brittain 1982 satori and brittain 2015 immature mayflies or nymphs are aquatic and pass through an indeterminant number of molts 10 15 or more final instar nymphs molt twice in quick succession to a terrestrial stage first to a sexually immature winged adult stage subimago and then a final time to the sexually mature winged adult imago the imago stage is ephemeral lasting only several hours to several days during which adults form a mating swarm over the water before mated females return to the water surface to lay their eggs and die approximately 95 99 of the life cycle of most north temperate species is spent as an egg or nymph in the aquatic system sweeney et al 1992 mayflies are notable for their synchronous mass emergence with some emergence events so large and widespread they can be observed on doppler weather radar u s fish wildlife service fisheries midwest region sweeney and vannote 1982 mayflies like other insects are poikilothermic or cold blooded the rate at which they grow and develop and the timing of their life stages are thus directly controlled by environmental conditions especially temperature and food sweeney and vannote 1984 mayfly species in the tropics and warm temperate regions typically have a multivoltine life cycle while those in cool temperate regions have a univoltine life cycle gray 1981 jackson and sweeney 1995 jacobi and benke 1991 many species of baetidae have the ability to switch from multivoltine to univoltine or even semivoltine in rare cases depending on water temperature and food availability satori and brittain 2015 a variety of mathematical modeling frameworks have been developed to describe phenology and predict voltinism in mayflies and other insects these models built on earlier work describing plant phenology where temperature is also a critical factor for growth and development wang 1960 many of the recent insect studies have focused on pests such as mountain pine beetle bentz et al 1991 logan and amman 1986 powell and bentz 2009 régnière et al 2015 spruce budworm régnière 1990 cooke and régnière 1996 nealis and régnière 2014 régnière et al 2012b and sugarcane aphid wang et al 2019 because understanding and predicting population dynamics are important in infestation management pruess 1983 early life history studies of mayflies and other aquatic insects applied the degree day concept which assumes development rate is a linear function of temperature to help summarize or predict the timing of the life cycle e g miller 1941 huffaker 1944 fahy 1973 clifford 1978 sweeney and schnack 1977 sweeney 1978 markarian 1980 gillooly and dodson 2000 these analyses were based on field or laboratory data measuring egg and larval development times in constant and variable temperature treatments some of these degree day models incorporated lower developmental thresholds for egg or nymphal development that were observed or estimated to be 0 c while others observed or assumed it was 0 c where data were available from multiple sites or treatments that included thermal extremes some noted that the linear nature or consistency of the degree day model might not be applicable appropriate e g lillehammer et al 1989 giberson and rosenberg 1994 more recently a two stage phenological model for mayflies was developed to predict how a single species could maintain a univoltine life cycle across a broad geographic range representing a wide range of thermal habitats newbold et al 1994 it used the degree day concept but incorporated a lower threshold for development as a parameter to be estimated by fitting the model to field data however its applicability was somewhat limited due to the fact that only one individual was simulated it included just two life stages and the same annual thermal regime was used repeatedly herein we develop a three stage individual based stochastic phenological model for species of mayfly neocloeontriangulifer ephemeroptera baetidae mcdunnough 1931 to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature this species has been used as a laboratory model in ecological and toxicological studies sweeney and vannote 1984 sweeney et al 1993 kim et al 2017 jackson and funk 2019 laboratory and field data indicate that n triangulifer formerly classified in the genus cloeon or centroptilum has at least three generations per year in white clay creek 39 52 n 75 46 w 125 m with a highly synchronized adult emergence for the overwintering generation sweeney and vannote 1984 neocloeon triangulifer reproduce through obligate parthenogenesis funk et al 2006 even though individuals are clones there is much variability in development times e g 6 30 days at 25 c for egg stage and life history characteristics growth size fecundity when they are reared under constant temperature laboratory controlled conditions development rates are not measured directly but are inferred as the inverse of the observed development time in a given stage thus the development rate can be thought of as the proportion of the total stage duration per unit of time régnière et al 2012a many different distributions have been used to model variation in poikilotherm development examples include the distribution model of sharpe et al 1977 the logistic function règniére 1984 the lognormal distribution régnière et al 2012a the weibull distribution function wagner et al 1984 and the extended von foerster model gilbert et al 2004 it is important to fit the distribution of development times directly rather than transform the data to developmental rates 1 time when using least squares this is due to the fact that the transformation is nonlinear and consequentially an error in observed and predicted developmental times at a given temperature does not translate to the same error in observed and predicted developmental rates at all temperatures bentz et al 1991 another key component to phenological modeling is the parameterization of a mean development rate curve that is temperature dependent degree day models use a linear rate curve that is a reasonable approximation at intermediate temperature but not at extremes moore and remais 2014 linear rate models can estimate the lower temperature threshold for development many different nonlinear models have been developed and tested in the literature some are biophysical mechanistic like the model of sharpe and demichele 1977 which is based on arrhenius and eyring s equations while other models are more phenomenological logan et al 1976 lactin et al 1995 some nonlinear models can estimate both upper and lower temperature thresholds for development and the temperature at which the rate of development is maximized for an overview see logan 1988 and for more recent studies validating different nonlinear rate curves against experimental data see martínez garcía et al 2016 kontodimas et al 2004 for poikilotherms the rate at which physiological time progresses generally depends both on the development rate curve and the actual sequence and range of temperature experienced by the animals taylor 1981 régnière and powell 2013 a variety of frameworks have been used in the literature to model phenology including cohort based models sharpe et al 1977 curry et al 1978b wagner et al 1985 logan 1988 bentz et al 1991 distributed delay models welch et al 1978 partial differential equations gilbert et al 2004 powell and bentz 2009 pasquali et al 2019 rossini et al 2019 integral projection models goodsman et al 2018 and individual based models régnière and powell 2013 nealis and régnière 2014 grimm and railsback 2005 wang et al 2019 although all approaches can be productive we prefer to use individual based models ibms because they provide a flexible and convenient modeling framework individuals are given a stochastic rate of development and are simulated as they pass through life stages ibms can readily incorporate responses that might be discontinuous e g characterized by thresholds or if then rules or stochastic in nature kolpas et al 2007 natural selection can be incorporated by transmitting developmental rates to progeny régnière and powell 2013 in general ibms have higher computational demands than other models but with modern computing capabilities this is less of an issue than it was in past decades furthermore computational tools such as parallel simulation li et al 2009 graphics processing units li et al 2009 sanders and kandrot 2010 and the vectorization of code in matlab can improve performance here we introduce describe and test a three stage egg nymph adult stochastic individual based model for the phenology of the mayfly n triangulifer the egg and nymph stages are aquatic while the adult stage is terrestrial the model uses development data for each aquatic stage from controlled temperature food photoperiod laboratory studies to determine the variation in development rates and the development rate response curve to temperature variable temperature experiments simulating diel temperature changes are used for model validation the thermal input data for the model is based on average daily water temperature recordings from white clay creek from january 2007 to 2013 the model enables us to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature a larval quiescent period triggered by short day length is added to the model in order to explore its impact on seasonal synchrony finally we use the model to predict how warming the natural pattern and magnitude of temperature of white clay creek and freshwater habitats in general might impact the phenology of this mayfly 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory data 2 1 1 laboratory methods development times for n triangulifer were determined in the laboratory following methods described in sweeney et al 2018 test animals were from a culture maintained at the stroud water research center clone wcc 2 individuals were reared at both constant and variable temperature treatments with a 15 9 h light dark photoperiod with lights on at 0500h and lights off at 2000h for the egg stage hatching times were recorded in days from oviposition to hatching for the nymph stage development times were recorded in days from egg hatch to adult emergence 2 1 2 constant temperature data for the egg stage individuals were reared at 5 constant temperature treatments t 15 20 25 28 32 c for the nymph stage individuals were reared at 10 constant temperature treatments t 14 16 18 20 22 24 25 26 27 28 c high mortality led to small sample sizes at the warmer temperature treatments distributions of development times were right skewed toward longer development times see table 1 for development time data as expected for both stages the median development time decreases as temperature increases the constant temperature data is used to parameterize the model in section 2 2 7 2 1 3 variable temperature data for the nymph stage additional variable temperature experiments were performed to simulate diel changes in temperature with a daily average of t av 18 22 26 c the following periodic ramp function was used to simulate a diel temperature change of 5 c throughout the day with a ramp rate of 0 5 c per hour 1 t t t av 2 5 0 t 1 5 0 5 t 1 5 t av 2 5 1 5 t 11 5 t av 2 5 11 5 t 13 5 0 5 t 23 5 t av 2 5 13 5 t 23 5 t av 2 5 23 5 t 24 where t is in hours since 0500 h see table 2 for development time data at 26 c the median individual exposed to the variable temperature experiment takes two days longer to develop than the median individual exposed to the constant temperature experiment in the appendix we take a more thorough look at the differences between the distributions from the constant and variable temperature experiments at all temperature treatments furthermore we discuss how differences in timing can be explained with jensen s inequality jensen 1906 by considering the convexity of the temperature dependent development rate curve the variable temperature data is used for model validation in section 3 1 2 2 individual based model formulation we use the odd protocol grimm et al 2010 to describe the individual based model ibm see fig 1 for a schematic overview of the model 2 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to see whether multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise in the mayfly n triangulifer through direct control by temperature a larval quiescent period triggered by day length is included in order to explore its impact on seasonal synchrony finally we use the model to predict how warming the natural pattern and magnitude of temperature of white clay creek and freshwater habitats in general might impact the phenology of this mayfly 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales each individual in the model is characterized by its age 0 a 1 and stage j there are three stages in the model egg j 0 nymph j 1 and adult j 2 the egg and nymph stage are aquatic while the adult stage is terrestrial the rate at which individuals age in stages 0 and 1 is probabilistic individuals develop at different rates and is temperature dependent the rate at which individuals age in stage 2 is constant as adults are short lived only living about one day the duration of the adult stage is probably also temperature dependent but data is not readily available time is discretized into time steps of length δt 1 day the scale by which temperature is recorded 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling let a i j t be the physiological age of individual i in stage j at time t at each time step individuals age according to the equation 2 a i j t n 1 a i j t n r i j t t n 1 δ t where r i j t t is the temperature dependent development rate of individual i in stage j for the egg j 0 and nymph j 1 stage the rate of development at time t is found by multiplying the relative rate of development r by the population mean development rate function r m t as follows 3 r i j t r i j r m t t j 0 1 this ensures individuals remain in the same percentile throughout the stage with their rate only adjusting to environmental conditions the stochastic treatment of development rates and the development rate function are discussed in section 2 2 7 the adult stage j 2 is treated deterministically an individual s rate of development is given by 4 r i j t 1 j 2 so individuals age out of the stage in one day once an individual reaches or exceeds age one its age is reset to 0 and it moves to the next stage according to the update rule j mod j 1 3 this means an individual in the egg stage moves to the nymph stage an individual in the nymph stage moves to the adult stage and an individual in the adult stage moves back to the egg stage because our focus is on phenology we do not include any mortality with individuals simply replacing themselves individuals entering a new stage are reassigned a stochastic rate of development if j 0 1 or a constant rate of development 1 day 1 if j 2 preliminary experimental work indicates that some mayfly species are not only sensitive to water temperature but day length funk et al 2019 the species n triangulifer overwinters as nymphs and may respond to shorter days by going into a quiescent state where development is suspended even if the temperature is briefly favorable we incorporate this into the ibm by adding a lower threshold for day length l below which individual nymphs enter a quiescent state and do not develop regardless of temperature the lower threshold of day length l triggering a larval quiescent period was treated as a parameter in the range 9 5 12 h 2 2 4 design concepts basic principles herein we explain the theory underlying the design of eq 2 poikilotherms develop at a rate dependent on the temperature of their environment let a j t be the physiological age of the mean individual in stage j at time t such that a j 0 0 at the beginning of the stage and a j t f 1 at the end of the stage it follows that the mean individual ages according the equation 5 da j dt r m t t a j 0 0 where r m r m t t is the temperature dependent mean development rate if the environment is constant then the rate of development is constant and the solution to eq 5 is simply 6 a j t r m t where t f 1 r m if the environment is variable then the solution to the initial value problem 5 is given by 7 a j t 0 t r m t s ds where t f is the solution to a j t f 1 when the development rate function is linear a j t 0 t m t s t min ds where t min is the lower developmental threshold evaluating this expression at t f it follows that a j t f m 1 m 0 t f t s t min ds thus the reciprocal of the slope of the development rate curve 1 m gives the number of degree days to complete development when the development rate function is nonlinear it is often not possible to find an analytical expression for a j t however one can easily estimate the physiological age of an individual with a riemann sum approximation to formulate a right hand riemann sum approximation of eq 7 over 0 t divide the time interval into n equally spaced subintervals of length δt t n with t i iδt for i 0 1 n the right endpoint riemann sum approximation of the integral in eq 7 is then given by 8 a j t n 0 t n r m t s ds i 1 n r m t t i δ t eq 2 follows from the splitting property of the integral as an iterative version of eq 8 emergence rates of development are temperature dependent the existence of a structurally stable multivoltine life cycle is a system level property of the model that is a consequence of the life cycle seasonal temperature day length variation and stage specific differences in rates of aging stochasticity relative rates of development in the egg and nymph stage are determined probabilistically see section 2 2 7 observation a total of 100 replicate simulations were run to obtain sufficient model analysis statistics local maximum corresponding to peaks in adult emergence were filtered using the criteria for a peak to be 5 or more of the population with a peak to peak window of 20 days or more based on a conservative lower bound for development times in the temperature range 0 22 c see table 1 this allows us to quantify the number of generations per year and the degree of synchrony in adult emergence 2 2 5 initialization the following protocol was used to initialize the model because field observations suggest n triangulifer overwinter as early to middle instar nymphs we ran the ibm with a delta distribution of n 5000 individuals all in the nymph stage of age 0 4 forced temporally with a test dataset that consisted of the year 2007 recycled over multiple generations the model was run until the age distribution of nymphs on january 1st reached a metastable state this took approximately 10 15 generations and was verified by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of ages in each stage over time the metastable state was insensitive to small changes in the initial age of individuals we subsequently used the metastable distributions from this test run to initialize the full simulation over 2007 2013 2 2 6 input data input temperature data t t for the ibm consisted of average daily water temperature from a forested site in white clay creek 39 52 n 75 46 w 125 m upstream of the stroud water research center from january 2007 to 2013 duration of day length for avondale pa from january 2007 to 2013 was obtained from the united states naval observatory dataset and was in the range 9 35 15 h usno 2 2 7 submodels distribution ofdevelopment times we adopted the sharpe model sharpe et al 1977 for our stochastic treatment of development times because it is well tested and validated in the literature and provides the best fit to the n triangulifer data when compared to other distribution models the sharpe model gives a simple yet effective explanation for the right skewed nature of development time data as resulting from inverting a symmetric distribution of development rates the sharpe model sharpe et al 1977 starts with the assumption that r the rate control enzyme for development has a symmetric distribution about some mean we will assume this distribution is a truncated normal of the form n r r m σ where r m is the mean rate σ is the standard deviation and r min r r max let t u r 1 r be a random variable representing the development time of an individual because the transformation u is strictly monotonic it follows from change of variables that the distribution of times is given by g t f v t v t where v t 1 t is the inverse of u r then 9 g t r m σ f 1 t 1 t 2 c t 2 2 π σ 2 exp 1 r m t 2 2 σ 2 t 2 1 r max t 1 r min where c is the constant of normalization nonlinear least squares can be used to fit the cumulative distribution function corresponding to eq 9 directly to development time data to find the best fit r m and σ at each temperature now suppose the distributions all have the same shape that is the coefficient of variation c v σ r m is independent of temperature furthermore let r r r m be the normalized rate of development and t 1 r r m t it follows from change of variables that the normalized rate distribution is 10 f r c v n r 1 c v r min r m r r max r m and the normalized time distribution is 11 g t c v g t r m 1 r m c t 2 2 π c v 2 exp 1 t 2 2 c v 2 t 2 r m r max t r m r min for each stage development time data at each constant temperature treatment was normalized by dividing by the median development time the normalized data at each temperature treatment was then pooled and fit to the cumulative distribution function corresponding to the sharpe model eq 11 over 0 using nonlinear least squares curve fitting in matlab for the egg stage data the best fit coefficient of variation was c v 0 112 0 009 while for the nymph stage c v 0 050 0 001 for the egg stage an individual s stochastic relative rate of development r i j was sampled from n r 1 0 112 while for the nymph stage r i j was sampled from n r 1 0 050 the distribution of development times in a variable temperature environment can readily be calculated from eqs 7 and 11 as follows when viewed in light of eq 6 the normalized development time t r m t can be interpreted as the physiological age at which an individual completes development relative to the mean age of 1 it follows see curry et al 1978a for a proof that the distribution of development times in a variable temperature environment is given by g a j t c v developmentrate curve let r m r m t be the temperature dependent population mean development rate curve in degree day models the development rate curve is assumed to be linear moore and remais 2014 that is 12 r m t m t t min where m is the slope of the rate curve in units of degree days 1 and t min is the lower developmental threshold such that r t min 0 for temperature below t min the rate is assumed zero we also considered two different phenomenological nonlinear rate models that are derived using a matched asymptotic method the logan iii model hilbert and logan 1983 logan 1988 martínez garcía et al 2016 has the form 13 r m t ϕ t t min 2 t t min 2 d 2 exp t m t t min δ where t min is the lower developmental threshold for temperature below t min the rate is zero t m is the lethal maximum temperature in degrees c above t min δ is the width of the high temperature boundary area and ϕ and d are empirical constants the lactin model lactin et al 1995 is a modification of the logan i model logan et al 1976 logan 1988 that removes a redundant parameter and allows for the estimation of a lower developmental threshold t min it has the form 14 r m t e ρ t e ρ t a t a t δ λ where t a is the supraoptimal temperature at which r λ δ is the width of the high temperature boundary and ρ and λ are empirical constants for temperature below t min the rate is zero we use the root mean square error rmse to quantify the goodness of fit between the predicted development rate curves and the observed egg and nymph stage development rate data the rmse is defined as 15 rmse i 1 n r ˆ i r i 2 n where r ˆ i is the predicted development rate and r i is the observed development rate for the nymph stage we had sufficient data i e 10 temperature treatments to fit both linear and nonlinear models of the development rate curve while for the egg stage we had limited data i e 5 temperature treatments and thus fit only a linear model table 3 summarizes the results of fitting the data using curve fitting in matlab the parameter estimates rmse developmental thresholds t min and t max optima t opt and inflection points t inf are reported note that we incorporated an estimate of the chronic thermal maximum t max 30 c for the nymph stage data before fitting nonlinear rate curves the maximum was calculated from experimental data as the least upper temperature at which chronic mortality reaches 100 this single data point is crucial for reliably fitting the data to nonlinear models that are capable of describing the high temperature decline in development rates logan 1988 when fitting the linear rate curve we restricted the data to the linear portion of the temperature regime for the egg stage all data was included in the temperature range 15 32 c while for the nymph stage the range was restricted to 14 24 c fig 2 shows the results of fitting the nonlinear lactin model lactin et al 1995 and the linear model 12 to the nymph stage mean development rate data and a linear model to the egg stage mean development rate data water temperature typically remains between 0 and 22 c therefore we selected the linear rate model for the nymph stage in the baseline ibm simulations no warming because it performed the best in this temperature range 3 results 3 1 model validation variable temperature data to validate the model the predicted distribution of development times was calculated as g a j t 0 05 and compared to the observed distribution of development times at each temperature treatment when calculating physiological age we tested each rate curve model e g linear logan iii lactin with temperature modeled according to eq 1 fig 3 compares the predicted cumulative distribution of development times to the observed distribution for each model and each temperature treatment table 4 summarizes the rmses all three models have comparably small rmse at t av 22 c the lactin and logan iii models have comparable errors at each temperature and do a factor of three better than the linear model when t av 26 c this is not surprising because t av 26 c is outside of the range where the linear model fits the development rate data all three models consistently underestimate emergence time at this temperature kolmogorov smirnov test note that two variable temperature treatments were conducted at t av 14 28 c but were not used for model validation for the following reasons experiments at t av 14 c were censored because approximately 20 of the population developed at a significantly slower rate and had not completed development when the experiment was terminated this treatment needs to be repeated to confirm this finding and a new model for development would need to be considered that does not rely on the same shape hypothesis the temperature treatment at t av 28 c was not included due to low sample size n 8 resulting from high mortality 3 2 ibm simulations of phenology the model shows a multivoltine life cycle with a mode of 3 generations per year with emergence of the first generation typically starting in late may early june see table 4 for a summary of results and fig 4 for a sample realization over 2007 2009 when l 10 11 this agrees well with field observations that report n triangulifer to have a relatively long overwintering larval generation followed by at least two summer generations sweeney and vannote 1984 the existence of a larval quiescent period is not needed for synchronization while the choice of l does not impact the mode of 3 generations per year it does greatly affect the degree of synchronization in adult emergence a lower threshold of l 11 h corresponding to a quiescence roughly between october 20 and february 21 optimally enhances synchronization as measured by peak emergence numbers and variation in the number of generations per year see table 5 the degree of synchrony can also be seen in the steady state age distribution of nymphs on january 1st obtained using our initialization protocol without the day length threshold the steady state age distribution has mean 0 4 and standard deviation 0 3 the introduction of a day length threshold of l 11 h does not significantly change the age distribution however when l 11 the age distribution of nymphs changes substantially becoming tightly peaked with mean 0 01 and standard deviation 0 04 increasing the day length threshold above 11 h increases the mean and standard deviation back to baseline levels to estimate the impact of warming stream temperature on the phenology of n triangulifer we ran the full model with l 11 over 2007 2013 but with temperature increased by 1 3 6 c we did not consider 9 c as this would lead to lethal chronic temperature above t max 30 c for the 1 c increase we retained the linear model of nymph rate development for all other increments the lactin model eq 14 was selected the mode of the number of generations per year increases to 4 with a temperature increase of 1 and 3 c and then to 5 generations per year when temperature increases by 6 c see table 6 for a summary of results and fig 5 for a sample realization over 2007 2009 synchronization in adult emergence goes down with increasing temperature with the maximum peak in adult emergence dropping by a factor of two or more with just a 1 c increase an increase in temperature of 3 or 6 c does not significantly decrease synchronization further the mismatch between the seasonal temperature cycle and photoperiod cycle contributes to the loss of synchrony with warming a day length threshold of 11 h no longer optimizes maximum peak emergence when temperature warms in particular l 10 is optimal when temperature is increased by 1 c and l 10 5 is optimal when temperature is increased by 3 6 c 4 discussion our stochastic individual based model shows that multivoltinism and seasonal synchrony can arise through direct control by temperature alone moreover the number and timing of the generations agrees well with field observations sweeney and vannote 1984 theoretical results for minimal models linear rate sinusoidal temperature have shown seasonal temperature variation and stage specific differences in rates of aging are sufficient to create structurally stable uni and multi voltine cycles in n stage organisms powell et al 2000 this has been tested in more realistic models of mountain pine beetle that include nonlinear rate functions and are driven with realistic temperature series bentz et al 1991 powell et al 2000 in our model of n triangulifer the egg and nymph stage have different developmental thresholds see table 3 thus our ibm provides further evidence that seasonal synchrony is a robust feature of temperature dependent models for poikilotherm development preliminary experimental work indicates that certain mayfly species are not only sensitive to temperature but day length funk et al 2019 while our model demonstrates seasonal temperature changes alone are sufficient to establish seasonality the existence of a larval quiescent period triggered by day length greatly enhances synchronization by varying the lower day length threshold for quiescence we showed there exists an optimal threshold that maximizes peak emergence and minimizes variation in the number of generations per year for n triangulifer the optimal threshold was 11 h which corresponds to a larval quiescence roughly between october 20 and february 21 without this quiescence larvae could continue to develop into mid november to late december on days where the temperature exceeds the lower developmental threshold which would spread out emergence later into the fall absence of the quiescence that results in late emergence could be a problem if the air temperature is too cold the next day for the molt to imago or for adult flight while n triangulifer is parthenogenetic the majority of mayfly species are not and rely on coordinated mass emergence over their ephemeral reproductive life span in order to find a mate and reproduce more efficiently as well as to increase overall reproductive success through mechanisms such as predator satiation sweeney and vannote 1982 our model provides evidence for the value of a quiescent period as an additional stabilizing factor to increase the degree of synchrony scientists have high confidence that greenhouse gas emissions will cause global temperature and consequentially stream temperature to rise ipcc 2014 regional increases in air and stream temperature for the time period 1960 2014 have been documented by usgs jastram and rice 2015 regression based statistical models that use air temperature as the predictor of stream temperature estimate increases ranging between 1 and 9 c by the year 2050 arismendi et al 2014 while stream temperature will certainly be affected by climate change it may also be impacted by industrial discharges hydrologic alteration land cover and topography jastram and rice 2015 approximately 20 of mayfly species worldwide may be at risk due to factors such as pollution invasive species habitat loss and degradation and climate change jacobus et al 2019 rising temperature is changing the geographical ranges population dynamics and phenologies of aquatic insect communities jacobus et al 2019 warming lengthens the season for development in poikilotherms in multivoltine species with developmental plasticity this could lead to an increase in the number of generations per year boosting population growth an observational study of the mayfly ephemera danica in the uk showed the species was capable of adjusting voltinism in response to spatial and temporal water temperature variations everall et al 2015 in our model increasing temperature is predicted to increase the number of generations per year in accordance with these findings moreover it has been shown that mayflies become smaller and have decreased fecundity as temperature warms and that responses are taxa and gender specific sweeney et al 2018 sardi na et al 2017 this could change the role of mayflies as consumers of algae and detritus in stream food webs and as a major food source for fish sweeney et al 1992 recently it has been hypothesized that if information on seasonal change conveyed by the photoperiod is blurred by rapid warming a lost generation unable to complete development will result van dyck et al 2015 this may have been confirmed in a study on the impact of increased water temperature on the late season phenology of the mayfly baetis liebenauae glazaczow et al 2016 while our model doesn t include population dynamics it highlights the role of a quiescent period triggered by photoperiod in synchronizing mayfly dynamics and preventing late fall emergence furthermore the model shows that warming creates a mismatch between the seasonal temperature cycle and photoperiod cycle the day length threshold without warming is no longer optimal with warming incorporating temperature dependent population dynamics births deaths into the current ibm are needed to predict more accurately the implications of warming on population viability and will be the subject of future work funding this paper benefitted from grants from the us national science foundation deb1455906to bws jkj and dhf and the stroud endowment for environmental research appendix a understanding differences between constant and variable temperature experiments with jensen s inequaltiy fig a 6 compares the cumulative distribution of development times for three variable temperature treatments with daily average t av against three comparable constant temperature treatments where temperature is fixed at t av throughout the day there is a significant difference between the distributions kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 at all temperature treatments this difference is most pronounced at t av 26 c maximum absolute difference 0 5 and least pronounced at t av 22 c maximum absolute difference 0 15 individuals tend to take less time to develop in the variable temperature treatments than in the constant when t av 18 c and more time in the variable temperature experiments when t av 22 26 c this can be understood in terms of jensen s inequality which relates the effects of nonlinear averaging to concavity fig a 7 illustrates jensen s inequality for a simple two point temperature average the result generalizes to the case of a continuous average when t t inf the rate curve is convex and the average rate is greater than the rate at the average temperature in this case individuals require less time to complete development in a variable environment than in a constant environment when t t inf the rate curve is concave and the average rate is less than the rate at the average temperature in this case individuals require more time to complete development in a variable environment than in a constant environment the logan iii model gives an estimate of t inf 18 2 while the lactin model gives an estimate of t inf 19 7 when t av 18 c temperature fluctuations of 2 5 c primarily cover the convex portion of the rate curve in the lactin model but not in the logan iii model thus the lactin model better explains the temperature treatment effect according to jensen s inequality in contrast when t av 22 26 c temperature fluctuations of 2 5 c primarily cover the concave portion of the rate curve in both the lactin and logan iii model in this case both models explain the temperature treatment effect according to jensen s inequality 
24933,mechanistic effect models are gaining increasing interest in ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment era for explaining effects on an individual s life history traits e g growth and reproduction debtox is the leading toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd modelling approach debtox is the application of a model based on dynamic energy budget deb theory to toxic effects but the term is generally used to refer to practical simplified models from this theoretical framework the debtox approach has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades but an updated model is urgently needed the need for revision is triggered by three relative recent developments the broad acceptance of simple tktd models for survival guts the development and successful application of reserve less deb models for invertebrates debkiss and the concrete interest in debtox from the field of era for pesticides in europe in this paper an updated debtox model is presented that is based on debkiss follows the tktd formulation as established for guts i e explicitly taking damage into consideration and includes a starvation module that is essential for time varying exposure as some toxicant action mechanisms may induce starvation the updated model is illustrated with a case study for springtails exposed to chlorpyrifos in food and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena keywords energy budget debtox debkiss toxicokinetic toxicodynamic modelling ecotoxicity environmental risk assessment 1 introduction mechanistic or process based models are essential tools to understand toxic effects on organisms over time at all levels of biological organisation ashauer and escher 2010 grimm and martin 2013 jager et al 2006 at the individual level mechanistic effect models take the form of toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd models for effects on survival the leading framework is the general unified threshold model for survival guts jager et al 2011 jager and ashauer 2018 for sub lethal effects the only tktd models with any track record in ecotoxicology are based on dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 various practical models have been derived from deb theory for ecotoxicological applications ranging from the full standard animal model to several simplified versions see overview in jager et al 2014 in general these models can be referred to as debtox though this term is usually reserved for the simplified deb models that are specifically intended for analysis of laboratory ecotoxicity tests these simplified debtox models have a considerable history starting in 1996 with the presentation of a series of equations to analyse standard test results for daphnia magna reproduction kooijman and bedaux 1996 and fish growth kooijman and bedaux 1996a this version also made it into regulatory guidance oecd 2006 under the heading of biology based methods simplified debtox models have been very successful in explaining effects on multiple endpoints over the life cycle of an animal see e g jager et al 2006 more recently limited updates to the equations have been presented billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 correcting some small errors in the original formulation but keeping the core of the model intact however three recent developments prompt a more thorough overhaul the establishment of the guts framework for survival modelling jager et al 2011 jager and ashauer 2018 the development of reserve less debkiss models jager 2018 jager et al 2013 and the concrete interest in using debtox for environmental risk assessment era of pesticides efsa 2018 the guts framework unifies virtually all tktd models for the endpoint survival and has been judged ready for use by the european food safety authority efsa for risk assessment of pesticides in europe efsa 2018 guts does not only unify different models it also unifies modellers by providing a common language and a common layout for tktd modelling for example it explicitly distinguishes between toxicokinetics tk and damage dynamics the internal concentration leads to generally abstract damage which is repaired at a certain rate it is the damage that ultimately drives the toxic effect guts models can still be formulated to work in the absence of measured body residues in the form of so called reduced models debtox models have always implicitly assumed that the property driving the toxic effect is the internal concentration but the experience with guts has shown that this position is not tenable anymore debkiss is a simplified deb model framework for animals that completely removes the reserve compartment assimilates obtained from food are directly used to fuel metabolism without any buffering even though debkiss was formulated as a consistent framework rather recently jager et al 2013 reserve less models are actually at the basis of deb theory and its application in ecotoxicology kooijman and metz 1984 removing the reserve simplifies the model and its application considerably while still capturing the life history of many species in the classical debtox models billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 reserve has always played a hidden role usually in immediate steady state with the food availability and requiring an abstract parameter g that could not be fitted on the data and was fixed to a not unreasonable value the demonstrated usefulness of debkiss see list of publications at http www debtox info debkiss appl html makes this framework a prime candidate as basis for an updated simplified debtox model tktd models including debtox are gaining increasing interest for era of pesticides in europe with as most recent milestone the 2018 efsa scientific opinion on tktd models efsa 2018 even though debtox was judged not to be ready for use yet its potential for application in era was recognised it is good to note that the efsa opinion does not single out a specific deb model version but it does state to facilitate wider use debtox models should be made more accessible to non advanced model users by promoting the use of simplified versions when applicable clearly there is regulatory interest in simplified model versions several problematic issues were identified in the opinion hampering acceptance of debtox mainly a lack of suitable case studies for pesticides and aquatic organisms with extrapolation to pulsed exposure scenarios and a lack of user friendly software furthermore the efsa opinion stresses the need for a separate evaluation of the physiological part of the model for each relevant species this latter point seems to be rooted in a confusion about deb model versions the standard non simplified deb animal model can be used for era as proposed by baas et al 2018 zimmer et al 2018 but cannot be parameterised completely from laboratory ecotoxicity data species specific defaults for the basic life history need to be taken from an on line parameter collection marques et al 2018 clearly such defaults would require regulatory evaluation however simplified debtox models do not need such defaults and can usually be parameterised using only the results of a toxicity test as long as observations on growth and reproduction over time are available the lack of pesticide relevant case studies is however a more serious issue and relates to an important weakness almost all debtox applications have so far been performed with presumed constant exposure the only examples with a pesticide and time varying exposure that i am aware of is a study for d magna exposed to the insecticide fenvalerate pieters et al 2006 this study did show that debtox can be fitted to the effect patterns for a single pulse early in life but this is insufficient basis for extrapolation to all kinds of exposure scenarios for all life stages in principle tktd models should be able to deal with time varying exposure in fact that feature is one of the main drivers for their development and application ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2006 however time varying exposure requires some thought in the debtox context as it can easily lead to a starvation situation even in presence of abundant food toxicant induced starvation can occur when a toxicant affects the assimilation rate or the maintenance costs of an organism when we expose a fully grown adult to such a toxicant its assimilation rate will not be sufficient to cover its maintenance needs which represents a starvation situation the animal has to deviate from the basic rules for the energy budget for a juvenile this problem is less acute it can decrease its growth rate and thereby free energy for maintenance this specific starvation problem for adults will be relevant for time varying food availability as well see discussion in van der meer 2016 clearly debtox would benefit from a dedicated and consistent starvation approach which it currently lacks in this contribution i present an updated debtox model based on the debkiss framework and consistent with the recent developments for guts to allow the model to operate consistently with time varying conditions food availability and toxicant exposure i will also present a simple preliminary starvation module this module is internally consistent i e respects mass balance in the animal but requires more detailed testing the use of the model will be illustrated with a simple data set for constant exposure however in the near future more useful data sets with time varying exposure will become available allowing for a more serious evaluation of the model s performance in extrapolating between different exposure situations the presented debtox model is intended for use in ecotoxicological studies in general and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena 2 model description the debkiss framework is described in detail elsewhere jager 2018 jager et al 2013 however a summary as relevant for the current application is provided in the supporting information the supporting information also contains the full derivation of the model in compound parameters below only the final equations will be shown the symbols used are explained in table 1 for model application in ecotoxicology and risk assessment a few simplifications are generally justified which allow deriving a compact model in the form of compound parameters primary parameters are the rather abstract parameters that are directly linked to metabolic processes e g the volume specific costs for somatic maintenance compound parameters are easy to interpret combinations of primary parameters e g maximum body length and the von bertalanffy growth rate constant that have a direct link to measurable properties the simplifications proposed are to focus on the juvenile adult stages i e ignore embryos treat reproduction as a continuous process rather than considering clutches of eggs and a reproduction buffer and ignore the details of the feeding process treat the scaled functional response as a parameter f between 0 and 1 furthermore i propose to include the process of maturity maintenance by default but link it to the somatic maintenance rate in a specific manner to ensure that body size is a good proxy for maturity status jager and zimmer 2012 finally toxicant stress is limited to four metabolic processes assimilation maintenance somatic and maturity growth and reproduction the mass flows of the resulting model are shown in fig 1 2 1 toxicokinetics and damage dynamics previous debtox models have largely ignored the damage concept and used the scaled internal concentration as driver for the toxic effect the developments in the guts framework have shown that damage needs to be considered and this property has now received a central position in that context jager and ashauer 2018 furthermore in linking adverse outcome pathways aop to deb models damage was identified as integrating concept murphy et al 2018 guts applies a generic damage compartment with first order kinetics linked to a one compartment tk model however in the absence of information on tk e g measured body residues one will need to make use of a reduced model which is simplified by combining tk and damage dynamics into a single compartment the same strategy can be followed for debtox see fig 2 below i will only outline the equations for the reduced model as debtox will usually be applied in situations without access to detailed tk information the full model is provided in the supporting information for a non growing and non reproducing organism scaled damage follows simple first order kinetics 1 d d t d k d c w d damage is scaled and has the unit of the external concentration this equation only has a single parameter the dominant rate constant k d depending on the relative speed of the damage dynamics and tk k d needs to be interpreted as a tk elimination rate or as a damage repair rate table 2 or even as a combination of both if both processes have a similar speed for reduced guts models in either case the same equation applies the main reason for calling this state variable scaled damage instead of scaled internal concentration is in the interpretation of the rate constant k d estimated from toxicity data is not necessarily a tk elimination rate however in the context of debtox the implications are more substantial in this setting animals will inevitably be growing and reproducing which affects scaled damage dynamics certainly when it is driven by tk the life history traits of the debkiss model are thus feeding back to the scaled damage module fig 2 this setup can become quite complicated as environmental stress e g food limitation will influence these feedbacks and thereby interact with the toxicity furthermore chemicals may affect growth and reproduction see next section and thereby affect their own damage dynamics again three forms of feedback need to be considered changes in the surface volume ratio of the organism growth dilution and elimination with reproduction the classical debtox models have focussed on the first two and have ignored the latter probably because it needs additional parameters when damage repair is fast an implicit assumption in the classical debtox models the damage equation represents tk and these feedback processes generally make sense table 2 however when tk is dominated by biotransformation things already become more complex as biotransformation rates are unlikely to be governed by the surface volume ratio when damage repair is slow the scaled damage equation represents damage dynamics and the realism of all these feedback processes is not so obvious anymore table 2 given these complexities i propose the following generic equation for scaled damage 2 d d t d k d x u c w x e d x g x r d in this equation the feedback processes can be modified by setting the four factors x to an appropriate value note that there are separate factors x u and x e for surface volume scaling of uptake and elimination respectively growth dilution and losses through reproduction each have their factor x g and x r that works in the same way as an elimination process which is why they can be added the factors x should receive very specific values when the associated process is deemed relevant and those values will change over time as a practical implementation i propose to use a vector x with four switches set to 1 when a feedback process is included and 0 when it is excluded the specific factors x of eq 2 can then be derived in the following manner 3 x u x e x g x r x l m l l m l 3 l d d t l r f b v k r v 4 x u max 1 x u x e max 1 x e the circle stands for element wise multiplication hadamard product for example the factor for growth dilution x g is derived by multiplying the third element of x either 0 or 1 with the third element of the right hand vector in eq 3 the relative volumetric growth rate the max operator ensures that x u and x e are set to one when their designated switch is set to zero the vector on the right hand side of eq 3 contains the standard formulations for surface volume scaling and growth dilution jager and zimmer 2012 to include losses with reproduction two new parameters are introduced the egg dry weight as fraction of the mother s dry weight f bv and a partition coefficient for damage between egg material and structure k rv this formulation follows from the assumption that the toxicant or its damage is transported with the flow of biomass based on dry weight to the eggs it should be noted that f bv will not generally be constant over time however starting with a reasonable fixed value is a good strategy for investigating the potential impact of losses with egg production different settings for the vector x may be appropriate for different species chemical combinations the classical debtox models follow from x 1 1 1 0 and this has been used without much discussion in most published cases however for damage dominated dynamics x 0 0 0 0 as also used in guts may be a better starting point this configuration was for example used for the case study in the efsa opinion efsa 2018 the simple tk equation of classical debtox is thus replaced by a configurable scaled damage equation with four switches for processes that can be set on or off this freedom of choice in the model is not really practical but there is currently no support for selecting one version for all situations standard toxicity tests growth and or reproduction over time under constant exposure may not offer much possibility for distinguishing between the different possible configurations of the scaled damage equation the configuration will therefore also have little impact on the model fit however for extrapolations to untested conditions e g limiting food levels or time varying exposure the impact may be considerable it is thus conceivable that additional test conditions e g different food levels or pulsed exposure will provide better opportunities to select between the different options furthermore additional endpoints such as survival may provide the necessary information although this will rest on an assumption that the same form of damage drives the effects on all endpoints in the near future more detailed data sets are likely to become available as debtox will be investigated for use in era eventually that will provide more insight into which feedbacks are most appropriate for which species and which compound classes and more insight in how to set up experiments to provide information on the relevant switches this update of the debtox tk equation is proposed for all deb based models used in ecotoxicology including the standard deb animal model however when a reserve compartment and or reproduction buffer is included in the model the potential effect of the dynamics of these compartments on tk and damage dynamics needs to be considered as well see van haren et al 1994 2 2 stress factor and modes of action the scaled damage level is translated into a dimensionless stress level through a linear with threshold relationship 5 s b b max 0 d z b this is essentially the same equation as applied in classical debtox models with one modification the tolerance concentration is replaced by its reciprocal which is now an effect strength b b the reason for this aesthetic change in parameter definition is consistency with the survival models it is good to stress that this linear with threshold relationship has little theoretical underpinning it is practical as not all changes at the molecular or cellular level will translate into observable effects at the whole organism level furthermore a threshold allows us to ignore non identified chemicals that are obviously present in every test system and a linear increase makes intuitive sense every additional molecule has the same increase in the stress level this relationship works well in practice and is also used in guts models for the hazard rate the threshold level is also often referred to as a no effect concentration baas et al 2018 kooijman and bedaux 1996 as it has the unit of an external concentration however the feedbacks in the damage equation eq 2 complicate the link between the threshold parameter z b and the maximum exposure concentration without effects on growth and reproduction furthermore these feedbacks make this link dependent on environmental conditions e g food availability therefore z b is best treated as a model parameter and model simulations are needed to predict no effect levels for relevant exposure conditions the stress level subsequently modifies the value of one or more primary model parameters as stated above the model in compound parameters offers access to four metabolic processes assimilation maintenance growth and reproduction in practice changes in these processes singly or in combination suffice to explain the patterns observed in toxicity tests ashauer and jager 2018 the affected metabolic process is generally referred to as a physiological mode of action pmoa similarly to the feedback processes in eq 3 i propose to use a vector s with on off switches to specify the pmoa in terms of these four metabolic processes specific stress factors s follow from this vector s and the value for s from eq 5 6 s a s m s g s r s s 7 s a min 1 s a the extra operation on s a maximising its value to 1 is needed as s a will be applied in the form of a linear decrease of a parameter which should not become negative in general it is advisable to start from pmoa s that affect a single process although combinations are certainly possible for example it seems that effects on growth costs are usually accompanied by an increase in reproduction costs ashauer and jager 2018 i here ignore the pmoa of hazard on reproduction of the classical debtox models as the costs for reproduction is very similar and generally fits better however that pmoa can be easily implemented as a slightly different functional form of using s r in the equations for growth and reproduction 2 3 effects on growth and reproduction the relationship between the stress level and the primary parameter is assumed to be linear however there is freedom in selecting the primary parameter for a decrease in assimilation we can multiply the maximum specific assimilation rate by 1 s or divide it by 1 s the first assumes a linear decrease in the specific assimilation rate whereas the second assumes a linear increase in the overhead costs for assimilation since this does not seem to be a critical decision for the model i propose to follow the tradition in debtox modelling see supporting information for details the resulting debkiss model in compound parameters with the specific stress factors s included is extremely compact the equations for body length l and cumulative reproductive output r c are 8 d d t l r b 1 s m 1 s g f l m 1 s a 1 s m l with l 0 l 0 9 r l l p max 0 r m 1 s r f l m l 2 1 s a l p 3 1 s m l m 3 l p 3 10 r l l p 0 11 d d t r c r with r c 0 0 any length measure can be used for l as long as it is used consistently and as long as the animal does not change shape during growth if there are changes in shape volumetric length cubic root of body volume or weight excluding any reproductive buffer or eggs should be used these equations are quite similar to the traditional debtox equations in compound parameters billoir et al 2008 kooijman and bedaux 1996 the difference is that i here use real body length rather than scaled length and the absence of the parameter g that governs the contribution of the reserve 2 4 adding effects on survival assuming that the same damage level affects both sub lethal and lethal toxicity a survival module from the guts framework can easily be added the stochastic death version is most consistent with the approach for sub lethal effects 12 h b s max 0 d z s 13 d d t s h h b s with s 0 1 this formulation matches the approach for sub lethal effects as there is a linear with threshold relationship between damage and the effect on a model parameter the hazard rate h the alternative approach of individual tolerance is less intuitive in this context as it has no analogue for continuous endpoints such as reproduction which cannot be viewed as an all or nothing effect an additional advantage of the stochastic death formulation is that survival can be expressed in the form of a differential equation which allows easy implementation in software alongside the equations for growth and reproduction 2 5 starvation module starvation may occur when we want to test or extrapolate to time varying food availability however it is important to stress that toxicants that affect assimilation or maintenance can also induce starvation even with ad libitum food provided in a laboratory setting this is especially of concern when exposure is pulsed under constant exposure individuals will generally grow to the maximum size that is sustainable under the stress conditions and remain at that size however under pulsed exposure there is the possibility for recovery and in between exposures an individual can grow to a size that is too large to accommodate a subsequent stress on assimilation or maintenance in eq 8 above dl dt can become negative for certain body lengths l when f is low and also when s a or s m are high even though shrinking is not unrealistic if we simply use the same equation for growth and shrinking the rate of shrinking will be incorrect it implies that overhead costs paid during growth are available again when structure is being used to pay maintenance costs furthermore organisms may avoid shrinking by redirecting resources from maturation reproduction because debkiss does not have a reserve compartment it is possible to include a consistent starvation module into the model with compound parameters as presented above this does require two additional parameters but reasonable defaults can be set the two stage starvation strategy presented here is based on the assumption that an animal facing starvation will first modify κ in an attempt to fulfil the maintenance costs if that is insufficient structure is burnt to fill those needs i e the animal shrinks starvation is triggered in the model above when dl dt becomes negative to keep the reproduction equation in the same form it is practical to translate the change in κ into a virtual food level for reproduction 14 f r f κ l l m 1 s m 1 s a 1 κ if that food level is above zero the 1 κ branch is sufficient to cover the maintenance needs the f r is used instead of f in the reproduction equation leading to reduced egg production and we can set dl dt to zero the animal can maintain its current body size if f r is below zero this triggers the second stage of starvation reproduction stops and the animal needs to shrink the shrinking equation in terms of compound parameters is 15 d d t l r b y p 1 s m f l m κ 1 s a 1 s m l the parameter y p is the product of two yield coefficients it covers the overhead costs for building the structure in the first place that are not recovered on shrinking as well as the overhead costs for fuelling maintenance from structure in the complete debkiss model both yields are by default set to 0 8 so a starting value for y p can be 0 64 application of this equation in the model requires some careful consideration of the length measure used for l for example many arthropods will not be able to shrink in length due to their carapace although they will shrink in terms of biomass it is important to note that κ is explicitly present in these two starvation equations whereas it was hidden in the compound parameters of the basic model there is unfortunately no way around this when κ is high most of the assimilation flux is already going to the soma somatic maintenance and structural growth which implies that there is little to gain from redirecting the 1 κ flux and starvation will rapidly result in shrinking an animal with a small κ can postpone shrinking for longer the complete debkiss model has κ as a parameter but to accurately identify it requires rather detailed biometric measurements on the species such as relationships between body lengths and structural weight dry wet weight ratio egg weight e g jager et al 2013 for deb applications κ 0 8 is considered a typical value jager et al 2013 kooijman 2010 so this value may be used as a starting point furthermore it may be possible to identify both κ and y p from data on life history under a series of time varying food scenarios since these parameters are not chemical specific they in principle need to be derived only once for a species this module represents just one plausible scenario for an organism to respond to starvation clearly more strategies are possible and different strategies will be needed for different species for example some species may be able to reduce their maintenance costs under starvation or use their reproduction buffer which is not considered in the present model in any case shrinking clearly cannot continue indefinitely in practice a limit to the amount of shrinking or to the minimum body size will be needed another thing to consider is that shrinking will lead to the reverse of growth dilution in the scaled damage equation concentration by shrinking if growth dilution is included in eq 2 shrinking will lead to an increase in damage which will increase toxicity for pmoas that include effects on assimilation and maintenance this turns into a positive feedback loop whether this also happens in real life remains to be investigated 3 case study to illustrate the model and its application to experimental data i provide a case study for the soil dwelling springtail folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food this data set was analysed earlier with the classical debtox model amended with a receptor kinetics module jager et al 2007 therefore the toxicity parameters are not directly comparable between both analyses the data set is truncated for survival and reproduction as these endpoints are affected by senescence later in life a process that is not included here the model is fitted to data for body size reproductive output and survival simultaneously by optimising an overall likelihood function for survival the likelihood contribution is calculated from the multinomial distribution jager et al 2011 for body length and cumulative reproduction the likelihood function is based on the normal distribution after square root transformation jager and zimmer 2012 the observations on body length and cumulative reproduction are treated as independent which is inappropriate as the same cohort of animals is followed over time unfortunately there is no simple solution to deal with dependence the confidence intervals will suffer most and therefore need to be treated as approximate all fits were made with the byom platform in matlab using the debtox2019 package which also includes a script to redo this case study http www debtox info byom html as a first step five basic parameters are fitted to the two control treatments regular and solvent control l p l m r b r m and h b parameter values with likelihood based 95 confidence intervals in table 1 initial length l 0 was kept fixed see supporting information these basic parameters were subsequently kept fixed when fitting the toxicity parameters on the complete data set this two stage strategy ensures that the control fit is not compromised to compensate for a structural misfit in the treatments furthermore fitting and analysing a model with 10 free parameters is technically challenging fitting only the five toxicity parameters makes it easier to run and compare a series of different model configurations different damage configurations and different pmoas however this two stage procedure requires a good quality control data set for this data set there is no need to fit all possible pmoas as there is hardly any effect on body size it is clear that this compound affects reproduction only s 0 0 0 1 that still leaves a series of options for the damage configuration x technically there are 16 permutations of x although not all of them are equally plausible here i fitted the four most obvious candidates see table 3 the configuration with most support is the fit without any feedback processes x 0 0 0 0 this fit is shown in fig 3 with the parameter values in table 1 including likelihood based 95 confidence intervals a damage configuration without feedbacks is perhaps not surprising given that the compound is an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor it is likely that the scaled damage represents inhibited enzymes which is why a receptor model was used in jager et al 2007 or the damage resulting from such an inhibition however a stronger identification of the most likely damage configuration would be possible with more detailed experimental data e g experiments at different food levels and or with time varying exposure looking more closely at the fit there seems to be some toxic effect on growth as well even though it is clearly insufficient to warrant one of the other single pmoas some care is needed since body size affects reproduction as well as damage dynamics through the feedbacks depending on the configuration of x a good fit for the body size data is important for a consistent overall model analysis 4 discussion in view of the recent developments with guts and debkiss and the current regulatory interest in tktd models an update of debtox is urgently required in this contribution i propose an updated set of simplified model equations using easy to interpret compound parameters in my opinion tktd models for practical applications need to be as simple and transparent as possible especially if they or model results are to be used by non experts the proposed debtox update is simple enough to be parameterised entirely from a somewhat extended toxicity test hence there is no need for relying on species specific default values it is good to note that strict application of defaults for the basic parameters will be impossible in practice as there are substantial differences in control response for the same species between laboratories and even between tests for a proper analysis of life history traits under stress it is crucial that the model provides a close correspondence to the control and therefore some adaptation of the basic parameters to the specific test situation will always be needed the ability to use only the test data for model parameterisation simplifies data analysis and also keeps the application of debtox in line with the way guts is used consistency with guts is further advanced by the move to use damage as the driver for toxic effects in fact the guts sd model now results as a special case of debtox for an animal that is not growing and not reproducing new modules have been derived to deal with losses due to reproduction and starvation both toxicant induced and due to food limitation these additional modules require additional parameters but these are only needed when these processes are deemed relevant which will not be for all cases and default values can be used as a starting point the extended damage equation provides a flexible way of testing different feedbacks from the life history traits to damage dynamics this equation may also prove to be useful in other tktd models e g in guts for growing animals and for the standard deb model additional cross fertilisation seems possible with individual based population models where a simple debtox module could serve as the individual level module for era applications such a modular approach may be of particular interest using the same module at different levels of biological organisation is efficient provides consistency in risk assessment and facilitates quality evaluation see jager and ashauer 2018a of course any simplification will come at a price a specific disadvantage of models formulated with compound parameters is that the proposed set of equations cannot easily be extended for example to include the embryo stage a reproduction buffer toxic effects on κ following maturity e g when l p is not constant or to predict effects on respiration rates to this end non simplified models in primary parameters such as standard deb or debkiss are needed application of these models phrased in primary parameters might be facilitated by working with compound parameters as inputs which are then internally translated into primary parameters see supporting information for the debkiss case the debtox model presented here removes elements from deb theory such as the reserve and maturity which will have consequences for model behaviour whether this matter will depend on the purpose for which the model is to be used however for ecotoxicological applications it is my expectation that the choice for a relevant tk damage configuration will generally outweigh the choice of deb model unfortunately almost all case studies with deb models and toxicants have so far been performed under constant exposure and constant environmental conditions therefore there is currently little opportunity to specify the limitations of the various models the main bottleneck for routine application of deb based models in ecotoxicology and era likely lies in the availability of suitable toxicity testing on life history traits see ashauer and jager 2018 toxicity tests even those for scientific studies are generally based on standard test protocols for regulatory purposes which have clearly not been developed with the needs of tktd modelling in mind proper parameterisation and testing of these models requires experiments of a design that is not restricted by the rather arbitrary rules of standard test protocols finally in terms of testing strategy it is important to stress that deb based data analyses usually highlight specific uncertainties in the data uncertainties that require additional experimental work that can then be limited in scope to elucidate a specific aspect therefore it is not just the debtox model that needs to be updated also the all too common mindset of doing the experiments first and then dropping the data on the modeller s desk needs to be changed to a more interactive and cyclical process conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements i

24933,mechanistic effect models are gaining increasing interest in ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment era for explaining effects on an individual s life history traits e g growth and reproduction debtox is the leading toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd modelling approach debtox is the application of a model based on dynamic energy budget deb theory to toxic effects but the term is generally used to refer to practical simplified models from this theoretical framework the debtox approach has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades but an updated model is urgently needed the need for revision is triggered by three relative recent developments the broad acceptance of simple tktd models for survival guts the development and successful application of reserve less deb models for invertebrates debkiss and the concrete interest in debtox from the field of era for pesticides in europe in this paper an updated debtox model is presented that is based on debkiss follows the tktd formulation as established for guts i e explicitly taking damage into consideration and includes a starvation module that is essential for time varying exposure as some toxicant action mechanisms may induce starvation the updated model is illustrated with a case study for springtails exposed to chlorpyrifos in food and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena keywords energy budget debtox debkiss toxicokinetic toxicodynamic modelling ecotoxicity environmental risk assessment 1 introduction mechanistic or process based models are essential tools to understand toxic effects on organisms over time at all levels of biological organisation ashauer and escher 2010 grimm and martin 2013 jager et al 2006 at the individual level mechanistic effect models take the form of toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tktd models for effects on survival the leading framework is the general unified threshold model for survival guts jager et al 2011 jager and ashauer 2018 for sub lethal effects the only tktd models with any track record in ecotoxicology are based on dynamic energy budget deb theory jusup et al 2017 kooijman 2010 various practical models have been derived from deb theory for ecotoxicological applications ranging from the full standard animal model to several simplified versions see overview in jager et al 2014 in general these models can be referred to as debtox though this term is usually reserved for the simplified deb models that are specifically intended for analysis of laboratory ecotoxicity tests these simplified debtox models have a considerable history starting in 1996 with the presentation of a series of equations to analyse standard test results for daphnia magna reproduction kooijman and bedaux 1996 and fish growth kooijman and bedaux 1996a this version also made it into regulatory guidance oecd 2006 under the heading of biology based methods simplified debtox models have been very successful in explaining effects on multiple endpoints over the life cycle of an animal see e g jager et al 2006 more recently limited updates to the equations have been presented billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 correcting some small errors in the original formulation but keeping the core of the model intact however three recent developments prompt a more thorough overhaul the establishment of the guts framework for survival modelling jager et al 2011 jager and ashauer 2018 the development of reserve less debkiss models jager 2018 jager et al 2013 and the concrete interest in using debtox for environmental risk assessment era of pesticides efsa 2018 the guts framework unifies virtually all tktd models for the endpoint survival and has been judged ready for use by the european food safety authority efsa for risk assessment of pesticides in europe efsa 2018 guts does not only unify different models it also unifies modellers by providing a common language and a common layout for tktd modelling for example it explicitly distinguishes between toxicokinetics tk and damage dynamics the internal concentration leads to generally abstract damage which is repaired at a certain rate it is the damage that ultimately drives the toxic effect guts models can still be formulated to work in the absence of measured body residues in the form of so called reduced models debtox models have always implicitly assumed that the property driving the toxic effect is the internal concentration but the experience with guts has shown that this position is not tenable anymore debkiss is a simplified deb model framework for animals that completely removes the reserve compartment assimilates obtained from food are directly used to fuel metabolism without any buffering even though debkiss was formulated as a consistent framework rather recently jager et al 2013 reserve less models are actually at the basis of deb theory and its application in ecotoxicology kooijman and metz 1984 removing the reserve simplifies the model and its application considerably while still capturing the life history of many species in the classical debtox models billoir et al 2008 jager and zimmer 2012 kooijman and bedaux 1996 reserve has always played a hidden role usually in immediate steady state with the food availability and requiring an abstract parameter g that could not be fitted on the data and was fixed to a not unreasonable value the demonstrated usefulness of debkiss see list of publications at http www debtox info debkiss appl html makes this framework a prime candidate as basis for an updated simplified debtox model tktd models including debtox are gaining increasing interest for era of pesticides in europe with as most recent milestone the 2018 efsa scientific opinion on tktd models efsa 2018 even though debtox was judged not to be ready for use yet its potential for application in era was recognised it is good to note that the efsa opinion does not single out a specific deb model version but it does state to facilitate wider use debtox models should be made more accessible to non advanced model users by promoting the use of simplified versions when applicable clearly there is regulatory interest in simplified model versions several problematic issues were identified in the opinion hampering acceptance of debtox mainly a lack of suitable case studies for pesticides and aquatic organisms with extrapolation to pulsed exposure scenarios and a lack of user friendly software furthermore the efsa opinion stresses the need for a separate evaluation of the physiological part of the model for each relevant species this latter point seems to be rooted in a confusion about deb model versions the standard non simplified deb animal model can be used for era as proposed by baas et al 2018 zimmer et al 2018 but cannot be parameterised completely from laboratory ecotoxicity data species specific defaults for the basic life history need to be taken from an on line parameter collection marques et al 2018 clearly such defaults would require regulatory evaluation however simplified debtox models do not need such defaults and can usually be parameterised using only the results of a toxicity test as long as observations on growth and reproduction over time are available the lack of pesticide relevant case studies is however a more serious issue and relates to an important weakness almost all debtox applications have so far been performed with presumed constant exposure the only examples with a pesticide and time varying exposure that i am aware of is a study for d magna exposed to the insecticide fenvalerate pieters et al 2006 this study did show that debtox can be fitted to the effect patterns for a single pulse early in life but this is insufficient basis for extrapolation to all kinds of exposure scenarios for all life stages in principle tktd models should be able to deal with time varying exposure in fact that feature is one of the main drivers for their development and application ashauer and escher 2010 jager et al 2006 however time varying exposure requires some thought in the debtox context as it can easily lead to a starvation situation even in presence of abundant food toxicant induced starvation can occur when a toxicant affects the assimilation rate or the maintenance costs of an organism when we expose a fully grown adult to such a toxicant its assimilation rate will not be sufficient to cover its maintenance needs which represents a starvation situation the animal has to deviate from the basic rules for the energy budget for a juvenile this problem is less acute it can decrease its growth rate and thereby free energy for maintenance this specific starvation problem for adults will be relevant for time varying food availability as well see discussion in van der meer 2016 clearly debtox would benefit from a dedicated and consistent starvation approach which it currently lacks in this contribution i present an updated debtox model based on the debkiss framework and consistent with the recent developments for guts to allow the model to operate consistently with time varying conditions food availability and toxicant exposure i will also present a simple preliminary starvation module this module is internally consistent i e respects mass balance in the animal but requires more detailed testing the use of the model will be illustrated with a simple data set for constant exposure however in the near future more useful data sets with time varying exposure will become available allowing for a more serious evaluation of the model s performance in extrapolating between different exposure situations the presented debtox model is intended for use in ecotoxicological studies in general and may find applications in science as well as in the regulatory arena 2 model description the debkiss framework is described in detail elsewhere jager 2018 jager et al 2013 however a summary as relevant for the current application is provided in the supporting information the supporting information also contains the full derivation of the model in compound parameters below only the final equations will be shown the symbols used are explained in table 1 for model application in ecotoxicology and risk assessment a few simplifications are generally justified which allow deriving a compact model in the form of compound parameters primary parameters are the rather abstract parameters that are directly linked to metabolic processes e g the volume specific costs for somatic maintenance compound parameters are easy to interpret combinations of primary parameters e g maximum body length and the von bertalanffy growth rate constant that have a direct link to measurable properties the simplifications proposed are to focus on the juvenile adult stages i e ignore embryos treat reproduction as a continuous process rather than considering clutches of eggs and a reproduction buffer and ignore the details of the feeding process treat the scaled functional response as a parameter f between 0 and 1 furthermore i propose to include the process of maturity maintenance by default but link it to the somatic maintenance rate in a specific manner to ensure that body size is a good proxy for maturity status jager and zimmer 2012 finally toxicant stress is limited to four metabolic processes assimilation maintenance somatic and maturity growth and reproduction the mass flows of the resulting model are shown in fig 1 2 1 toxicokinetics and damage dynamics previous debtox models have largely ignored the damage concept and used the scaled internal concentration as driver for the toxic effect the developments in the guts framework have shown that damage needs to be considered and this property has now received a central position in that context jager and ashauer 2018 furthermore in linking adverse outcome pathways aop to deb models damage was identified as integrating concept murphy et al 2018 guts applies a generic damage compartment with first order kinetics linked to a one compartment tk model however in the absence of information on tk e g measured body residues one will need to make use of a reduced model which is simplified by combining tk and damage dynamics into a single compartment the same strategy can be followed for debtox see fig 2 below i will only outline the equations for the reduced model as debtox will usually be applied in situations without access to detailed tk information the full model is provided in the supporting information for a non growing and non reproducing organism scaled damage follows simple first order kinetics 1 d d t d k d c w d damage is scaled and has the unit of the external concentration this equation only has a single parameter the dominant rate constant k d depending on the relative speed of the damage dynamics and tk k d needs to be interpreted as a tk elimination rate or as a damage repair rate table 2 or even as a combination of both if both processes have a similar speed for reduced guts models in either case the same equation applies the main reason for calling this state variable scaled damage instead of scaled internal concentration is in the interpretation of the rate constant k d estimated from toxicity data is not necessarily a tk elimination rate however in the context of debtox the implications are more substantial in this setting animals will inevitably be growing and reproducing which affects scaled damage dynamics certainly when it is driven by tk the life history traits of the debkiss model are thus feeding back to the scaled damage module fig 2 this setup can become quite complicated as environmental stress e g food limitation will influence these feedbacks and thereby interact with the toxicity furthermore chemicals may affect growth and reproduction see next section and thereby affect their own damage dynamics again three forms of feedback need to be considered changes in the surface volume ratio of the organism growth dilution and elimination with reproduction the classical debtox models have focussed on the first two and have ignored the latter probably because it needs additional parameters when damage repair is fast an implicit assumption in the classical debtox models the damage equation represents tk and these feedback processes generally make sense table 2 however when tk is dominated by biotransformation things already become more complex as biotransformation rates are unlikely to be governed by the surface volume ratio when damage repair is slow the scaled damage equation represents damage dynamics and the realism of all these feedback processes is not so obvious anymore table 2 given these complexities i propose the following generic equation for scaled damage 2 d d t d k d x u c w x e d x g x r d in this equation the feedback processes can be modified by setting the four factors x to an appropriate value note that there are separate factors x u and x e for surface volume scaling of uptake and elimination respectively growth dilution and losses through reproduction each have their factor x g and x r that works in the same way as an elimination process which is why they can be added the factors x should receive very specific values when the associated process is deemed relevant and those values will change over time as a practical implementation i propose to use a vector x with four switches set to 1 when a feedback process is included and 0 when it is excluded the specific factors x of eq 2 can then be derived in the following manner 3 x u x e x g x r x l m l l m l 3 l d d t l r f b v k r v 4 x u max 1 x u x e max 1 x e the circle stands for element wise multiplication hadamard product for example the factor for growth dilution x g is derived by multiplying the third element of x either 0 or 1 with the third element of the right hand vector in eq 3 the relative volumetric growth rate the max operator ensures that x u and x e are set to one when their designated switch is set to zero the vector on the right hand side of eq 3 contains the standard formulations for surface volume scaling and growth dilution jager and zimmer 2012 to include losses with reproduction two new parameters are introduced the egg dry weight as fraction of the mother s dry weight f bv and a partition coefficient for damage between egg material and structure k rv this formulation follows from the assumption that the toxicant or its damage is transported with the flow of biomass based on dry weight to the eggs it should be noted that f bv will not generally be constant over time however starting with a reasonable fixed value is a good strategy for investigating the potential impact of losses with egg production different settings for the vector x may be appropriate for different species chemical combinations the classical debtox models follow from x 1 1 1 0 and this has been used without much discussion in most published cases however for damage dominated dynamics x 0 0 0 0 as also used in guts may be a better starting point this configuration was for example used for the case study in the efsa opinion efsa 2018 the simple tk equation of classical debtox is thus replaced by a configurable scaled damage equation with four switches for processes that can be set on or off this freedom of choice in the model is not really practical but there is currently no support for selecting one version for all situations standard toxicity tests growth and or reproduction over time under constant exposure may not offer much possibility for distinguishing between the different possible configurations of the scaled damage equation the configuration will therefore also have little impact on the model fit however for extrapolations to untested conditions e g limiting food levels or time varying exposure the impact may be considerable it is thus conceivable that additional test conditions e g different food levels or pulsed exposure will provide better opportunities to select between the different options furthermore additional endpoints such as survival may provide the necessary information although this will rest on an assumption that the same form of damage drives the effects on all endpoints in the near future more detailed data sets are likely to become available as debtox will be investigated for use in era eventually that will provide more insight into which feedbacks are most appropriate for which species and which compound classes and more insight in how to set up experiments to provide information on the relevant switches this update of the debtox tk equation is proposed for all deb based models used in ecotoxicology including the standard deb animal model however when a reserve compartment and or reproduction buffer is included in the model the potential effect of the dynamics of these compartments on tk and damage dynamics needs to be considered as well see van haren et al 1994 2 2 stress factor and modes of action the scaled damage level is translated into a dimensionless stress level through a linear with threshold relationship 5 s b b max 0 d z b this is essentially the same equation as applied in classical debtox models with one modification the tolerance concentration is replaced by its reciprocal which is now an effect strength b b the reason for this aesthetic change in parameter definition is consistency with the survival models it is good to stress that this linear with threshold relationship has little theoretical underpinning it is practical as not all changes at the molecular or cellular level will translate into observable effects at the whole organism level furthermore a threshold allows us to ignore non identified chemicals that are obviously present in every test system and a linear increase makes intuitive sense every additional molecule has the same increase in the stress level this relationship works well in practice and is also used in guts models for the hazard rate the threshold level is also often referred to as a no effect concentration baas et al 2018 kooijman and bedaux 1996 as it has the unit of an external concentration however the feedbacks in the damage equation eq 2 complicate the link between the threshold parameter z b and the maximum exposure concentration without effects on growth and reproduction furthermore these feedbacks make this link dependent on environmental conditions e g food availability therefore z b is best treated as a model parameter and model simulations are needed to predict no effect levels for relevant exposure conditions the stress level subsequently modifies the value of one or more primary model parameters as stated above the model in compound parameters offers access to four metabolic processes assimilation maintenance growth and reproduction in practice changes in these processes singly or in combination suffice to explain the patterns observed in toxicity tests ashauer and jager 2018 the affected metabolic process is generally referred to as a physiological mode of action pmoa similarly to the feedback processes in eq 3 i propose to use a vector s with on off switches to specify the pmoa in terms of these four metabolic processes specific stress factors s follow from this vector s and the value for s from eq 5 6 s a s m s g s r s s 7 s a min 1 s a the extra operation on s a maximising its value to 1 is needed as s a will be applied in the form of a linear decrease of a parameter which should not become negative in general it is advisable to start from pmoa s that affect a single process although combinations are certainly possible for example it seems that effects on growth costs are usually accompanied by an increase in reproduction costs ashauer and jager 2018 i here ignore the pmoa of hazard on reproduction of the classical debtox models as the costs for reproduction is very similar and generally fits better however that pmoa can be easily implemented as a slightly different functional form of using s r in the equations for growth and reproduction 2 3 effects on growth and reproduction the relationship between the stress level and the primary parameter is assumed to be linear however there is freedom in selecting the primary parameter for a decrease in assimilation we can multiply the maximum specific assimilation rate by 1 s or divide it by 1 s the first assumes a linear decrease in the specific assimilation rate whereas the second assumes a linear increase in the overhead costs for assimilation since this does not seem to be a critical decision for the model i propose to follow the tradition in debtox modelling see supporting information for details the resulting debkiss model in compound parameters with the specific stress factors s included is extremely compact the equations for body length l and cumulative reproductive output r c are 8 d d t l r b 1 s m 1 s g f l m 1 s a 1 s m l with l 0 l 0 9 r l l p max 0 r m 1 s r f l m l 2 1 s a l p 3 1 s m l m 3 l p 3 10 r l l p 0 11 d d t r c r with r c 0 0 any length measure can be used for l as long as it is used consistently and as long as the animal does not change shape during growth if there are changes in shape volumetric length cubic root of body volume or weight excluding any reproductive buffer or eggs should be used these equations are quite similar to the traditional debtox equations in compound parameters billoir et al 2008 kooijman and bedaux 1996 the difference is that i here use real body length rather than scaled length and the absence of the parameter g that governs the contribution of the reserve 2 4 adding effects on survival assuming that the same damage level affects both sub lethal and lethal toxicity a survival module from the guts framework can easily be added the stochastic death version is most consistent with the approach for sub lethal effects 12 h b s max 0 d z s 13 d d t s h h b s with s 0 1 this formulation matches the approach for sub lethal effects as there is a linear with threshold relationship between damage and the effect on a model parameter the hazard rate h the alternative approach of individual tolerance is less intuitive in this context as it has no analogue for continuous endpoints such as reproduction which cannot be viewed as an all or nothing effect an additional advantage of the stochastic death formulation is that survival can be expressed in the form of a differential equation which allows easy implementation in software alongside the equations for growth and reproduction 2 5 starvation module starvation may occur when we want to test or extrapolate to time varying food availability however it is important to stress that toxicants that affect assimilation or maintenance can also induce starvation even with ad libitum food provided in a laboratory setting this is especially of concern when exposure is pulsed under constant exposure individuals will generally grow to the maximum size that is sustainable under the stress conditions and remain at that size however under pulsed exposure there is the possibility for recovery and in between exposures an individual can grow to a size that is too large to accommodate a subsequent stress on assimilation or maintenance in eq 8 above dl dt can become negative for certain body lengths l when f is low and also when s a or s m are high even though shrinking is not unrealistic if we simply use the same equation for growth and shrinking the rate of shrinking will be incorrect it implies that overhead costs paid during growth are available again when structure is being used to pay maintenance costs furthermore organisms may avoid shrinking by redirecting resources from maturation reproduction because debkiss does not have a reserve compartment it is possible to include a consistent starvation module into the model with compound parameters as presented above this does require two additional parameters but reasonable defaults can be set the two stage starvation strategy presented here is based on the assumption that an animal facing starvation will first modify κ in an attempt to fulfil the maintenance costs if that is insufficient structure is burnt to fill those needs i e the animal shrinks starvation is triggered in the model above when dl dt becomes negative to keep the reproduction equation in the same form it is practical to translate the change in κ into a virtual food level for reproduction 14 f r f κ l l m 1 s m 1 s a 1 κ if that food level is above zero the 1 κ branch is sufficient to cover the maintenance needs the f r is used instead of f in the reproduction equation leading to reduced egg production and we can set dl dt to zero the animal can maintain its current body size if f r is below zero this triggers the second stage of starvation reproduction stops and the animal needs to shrink the shrinking equation in terms of compound parameters is 15 d d t l r b y p 1 s m f l m κ 1 s a 1 s m l the parameter y p is the product of two yield coefficients it covers the overhead costs for building the structure in the first place that are not recovered on shrinking as well as the overhead costs for fuelling maintenance from structure in the complete debkiss model both yields are by default set to 0 8 so a starting value for y p can be 0 64 application of this equation in the model requires some careful consideration of the length measure used for l for example many arthropods will not be able to shrink in length due to their carapace although they will shrink in terms of biomass it is important to note that κ is explicitly present in these two starvation equations whereas it was hidden in the compound parameters of the basic model there is unfortunately no way around this when κ is high most of the assimilation flux is already going to the soma somatic maintenance and structural growth which implies that there is little to gain from redirecting the 1 κ flux and starvation will rapidly result in shrinking an animal with a small κ can postpone shrinking for longer the complete debkiss model has κ as a parameter but to accurately identify it requires rather detailed biometric measurements on the species such as relationships between body lengths and structural weight dry wet weight ratio egg weight e g jager et al 2013 for deb applications κ 0 8 is considered a typical value jager et al 2013 kooijman 2010 so this value may be used as a starting point furthermore it may be possible to identify both κ and y p from data on life history under a series of time varying food scenarios since these parameters are not chemical specific they in principle need to be derived only once for a species this module represents just one plausible scenario for an organism to respond to starvation clearly more strategies are possible and different strategies will be needed for different species for example some species may be able to reduce their maintenance costs under starvation or use their reproduction buffer which is not considered in the present model in any case shrinking clearly cannot continue indefinitely in practice a limit to the amount of shrinking or to the minimum body size will be needed another thing to consider is that shrinking will lead to the reverse of growth dilution in the scaled damage equation concentration by shrinking if growth dilution is included in eq 2 shrinking will lead to an increase in damage which will increase toxicity for pmoas that include effects on assimilation and maintenance this turns into a positive feedback loop whether this also happens in real life remains to be investigated 3 case study to illustrate the model and its application to experimental data i provide a case study for the soil dwelling springtail folsomia candida exposed to chlorpyrifos in food this data set was analysed earlier with the classical debtox model amended with a receptor kinetics module jager et al 2007 therefore the toxicity parameters are not directly comparable between both analyses the data set is truncated for survival and reproduction as these endpoints are affected by senescence later in life a process that is not included here the model is fitted to data for body size reproductive output and survival simultaneously by optimising an overall likelihood function for survival the likelihood contribution is calculated from the multinomial distribution jager et al 2011 for body length and cumulative reproduction the likelihood function is based on the normal distribution after square root transformation jager and zimmer 2012 the observations on body length and cumulative reproduction are treated as independent which is inappropriate as the same cohort of animals is followed over time unfortunately there is no simple solution to deal with dependence the confidence intervals will suffer most and therefore need to be treated as approximate all fits were made with the byom platform in matlab using the debtox2019 package which also includes a script to redo this case study http www debtox info byom html as a first step five basic parameters are fitted to the two control treatments regular and solvent control l p l m r b r m and h b parameter values with likelihood based 95 confidence intervals in table 1 initial length l 0 was kept fixed see supporting information these basic parameters were subsequently kept fixed when fitting the toxicity parameters on the complete data set this two stage strategy ensures that the control fit is not compromised to compensate for a structural misfit in the treatments furthermore fitting and analysing a model with 10 free parameters is technically challenging fitting only the five toxicity parameters makes it easier to run and compare a series of different model configurations different damage configurations and different pmoas however this two stage procedure requires a good quality control data set for this data set there is no need to fit all possible pmoas as there is hardly any effect on body size it is clear that this compound affects reproduction only s 0 0 0 1 that still leaves a series of options for the damage configuration x technically there are 16 permutations of x although not all of them are equally plausible here i fitted the four most obvious candidates see table 3 the configuration with most support is the fit without any feedback processes x 0 0 0 0 this fit is shown in fig 3 with the parameter values in table 1 including likelihood based 95 confidence intervals a damage configuration without feedbacks is perhaps not surprising given that the compound is an acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor it is likely that the scaled damage represents inhibited enzymes which is why a receptor model was used in jager et al 2007 or the damage resulting from such an inhibition however a stronger identification of the most likely damage configuration would be possible with more detailed experimental data e g experiments at different food levels and or with time varying exposure looking more closely at the fit there seems to be some toxic effect on growth as well even though it is clearly insufficient to warrant one of the other single pmoas some care is needed since body size affects reproduction as well as damage dynamics through the feedbacks depending on the configuration of x a good fit for the body size data is important for a consistent overall model analysis 4 discussion in view of the recent developments with guts and debkiss and the current regulatory interest in tktd models an update of debtox is urgently required in this contribution i propose an updated set of simplified model equations using easy to interpret compound parameters in my opinion tktd models for practical applications need to be as simple and transparent as possible especially if they or model results are to be used by non experts the proposed debtox update is simple enough to be parameterised entirely from a somewhat extended toxicity test hence there is no need for relying on species specific default values it is good to note that strict application of defaults for the basic parameters will be impossible in practice as there are substantial differences in control response for the same species between laboratories and even between tests for a proper analysis of life history traits under stress it is crucial that the model provides a close correspondence to the control and therefore some adaptation of the basic parameters to the specific test situation will always be needed the ability to use only the test data for model parameterisation simplifies data analysis and also keeps the application of debtox in line with the way guts is used consistency with guts is further advanced by the move to use damage as the driver for toxic effects in fact the guts sd model now results as a special case of debtox for an animal that is not growing and not reproducing new modules have been derived to deal with losses due to reproduction and starvation both toxicant induced and due to food limitation these additional modules require additional parameters but these are only needed when these processes are deemed relevant which will not be for all cases and default values can be used as a starting point the extended damage equation provides a flexible way of testing different feedbacks from the life history traits to damage dynamics this equation may also prove to be useful in other tktd models e g in guts for growing animals and for the standard deb model additional cross fertilisation seems possible with individual based population models where a simple debtox module could serve as the individual level module for era applications such a modular approach may be of particular interest using the same module at different levels of biological organisation is efficient provides consistency in risk assessment and facilitates quality evaluation see jager and ashauer 2018a of course any simplification will come at a price a specific disadvantage of models formulated with compound parameters is that the proposed set of equations cannot easily be extended for example to include the embryo stage a reproduction buffer toxic effects on κ following maturity e g when l p is not constant or to predict effects on respiration rates to this end non simplified models in primary parameters such as standard deb or debkiss are needed application of these models phrased in primary parameters might be facilitated by working with compound parameters as inputs which are then internally translated into primary parameters see supporting information for the debkiss case the debtox model presented here removes elements from deb theory such as the reserve and maturity which will have consequences for model behaviour whether this matter will depend on the purpose for which the model is to be used however for ecotoxicological applications it is my expectation that the choice for a relevant tk damage configuration will generally outweigh the choice of deb model unfortunately almost all case studies with deb models and toxicants have so far been performed under constant exposure and constant environmental conditions therefore there is currently little opportunity to specify the limitations of the various models the main bottleneck for routine application of deb based models in ecotoxicology and era likely lies in the availability of suitable toxicity testing on life history traits see ashauer and jager 2018 toxicity tests even those for scientific studies are generally based on standard test protocols for regulatory purposes which have clearly not been developed with the needs of tktd modelling in mind proper parameterisation and testing of these models requires experiments of a design that is not restricted by the rather arbitrary rules of standard test protocols finally in terms of testing strategy it is important to stress that deb based data analyses usually highlight specific uncertainties in the data uncertainties that require additional experimental work that can then be limited in scope to elucidate a specific aspect therefore it is not just the debtox model that needs to be updated also the all too common mindset of doing the experiments first and then dropping the data on the modeller s desk needs to be changed to a more interactive and cyclical process conflict of interest none declared acknowledgements i

24934,we demonstrate the efficacy of power law models in the analysis of tree branch growth the models can be interpreted as allometric equations which incorporate multiple driving variables in a single scaling relationship to predict the amount of growth within a branch we first used model selection criteria to identify the variables that most influenced 1 the length of individual elongating annual shoots and 2 the total length of all elongating annual shoots in the individual branches of silver birch betula pendula roth we then applied the two resulting power law equations as dynamic models to predict the trajectories of crown profile development and accumulation of branch biomass during tree growth using total branch length as a proxy for biomass in spite of the wide size range and geographical distribution of the study trees the models successfully reproduced the dynamic characteristics of crown development and branch biomass accumulation applying the model to predict long term growth of a single branch that was initiated at the crown top generated a realistic crown profile and produced a final basal branch size that was well within the range of field observations the models also predicted a set of more subtle and non trivial features of crown formation including the increased rate of growth towards the tree apex decrease in growth towards the lowest branches the effect of branching order on the amount of elongation and the higher vigour of thick branches when the effect of branch height was controlled in contrast a simple allometric model of the form y axb was incapable of capturing all the variability in growth of individual branches and of predicting the features of crown shape and branch size that are associated with the slowing down of growth towards the crown base we conclude that power law models where the parameter a is refined to include spatial information on branch features shows good potential for identifying and incorporating actual crown construction processes in dynamic models that utilize the structural features of tree crowns keywords allometry crown structure spatial interactions s systems structural parameters 1 introduction development of tree crown is an iterative process in which a tree constantly grows to adjust the three dimensional 3d structure in response to changes in the environment and the internal organization sorrensen cothern et al 1993 pretzsch 2014 although crown construction averaged over several tree species largely follows allometric laws and other biophysical rules farnsworth and niklas 1995 enquist 2002 bejan et al 2008 there remains ample variation within and between species and individuals lines et al 2012 bentley et al 2013 pretzsch 2014 a seemingly stochastic component is involved in within crown distribution of extension growth within branches buck sorlin 2000 stevenson et al 2000 kull and tulva 2002 koyama et al 2017 a wide variety of environmental factors can generate apparent stochasticity in crown development because they influence local growth habits and generate plastic responses environmental factors include the quantity and quality of light baraldi et al 1994 kukk and sõber 2015 wind and gravity brüchert and gardiner 2006 james et al 2006 mechanical contacts with neighbours hajek et al 2015 availability of growing space simard and zimonick 2005 temperature nakamura et al 2016 and activities of other organisms haukioja et al 1990 gonda king et al 2014 the internal organization of a crown comprises multiple organs and tissues competing for limited resources allocation among the competing sites is affected by concurrent physical and ecophysiological factors that include hormonal control and correlative inhibition sprugel 2002 tworkoski et al 2006 trade offs among elongation radial growth and reproduction obeso 1997 kramer et al 2014 biomechanical requirements sone et al 2006 loehle 2016 capacity of transport tissue grönlund et al 2016 and hydraulic limits koch et al 2004 several studies of trees have reported consistencies between annual elongation and internal and external factors under strictly controlled growth conditions normand et al 2009 chen and sumida 2017 in tree saplings messier and nikinmaa 2000 takahashi et al 2006 collet et al 2011 and in fixed crown positions osada et al 2014 the generation of crown asymmetry is well documented and the importance of hierarchical branching order for shoot growth is also well known jones and harper 1987 young and hubbell 1991 lintunen et al 2011 however the information available on within crown patterns of branch growth is scattered and spatially and ontogenetically limited because typical studies cover growth at specific crown positions of only a handful of trees growing at a single site in ecological interactions that shape the competitive success of individual trees the functioning of plastic growth patterns within the crown thus remains largely unexplored ford 2014 even the process based functional structural models of tree architecture frequently simplify representation of resource allocation to branches using growth rules that overlook the identification of the actual processes that generate crown architecture lacointe 2000 mathieu et al 2009 ford 2014 here we focus on the analysis of branch growth throughout the entire crowns of silver birch betula pendula roth individuals ranging from the juvenile to the reproductive stage within a geographical gradient our aim is to identify the best set of explanatory variables for dynamic models that encompass the patterns of branch growth shared by the tree individuals regardless of the developmental stage or the effects of unknown site specific factors we considered both structural variables and variables that estimated the availability of photosynthetic radiation as well as plausible proxies for physiological information as an advancement to our previous analyses of static crown structure lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 lintunen et al 2011 we demonstrate the use of power law models as a method that serves both to detect the dominant factors influencing branch growth within the crown and as a method for constructing dynamic models to estimate branch growth and crown formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 power law modelling the power law models can be considered as allometric scaling equations y axb in which the normalization constant a has been modified to include information on additional factors affecting the scaling relationship a procedure that has been implicitly adopted in many existing model equations e g cole and lorimer 1994 mäkinen 2002 kantola and mäkelä 2004 and explicitly considered in others white and gould 1965 kaitaniemi and lintunen 2008 peters et al 2018 we analysed branch growth within the crown of silver birch by focusing on annual branch elongation rate described as 1 the annual total branch elongation δlb calculated as the summed length of all elongating shoots within individual first order branches and 2 the annual length of the individual elongating shoots δls the models for δlb and δls were constructed as power law models imitating the s system approach voit 2000 as 1 δ l j α x 1 g 1 x 2 g 2 x 3 g 3 x i g i j b o r s where xi are independent explanatory variables α and gi are parameters and j b refers to the model of δlb and j s to the model of δls using branch diameter db as an example of an explanatory variable xgi the eq 1 can be interpreted as an allometric equation with the form 2 δ l j a d b g i j b o r s where gi is the scaling exponent and a is the normalization constant following from eq 1 as 3 a α x 1 g 1 x 2 g 2 x 3 g 3 x i 1 g i 1 the construction of power law models is not restricted to structural features which are widely used for the static allometric analysis of tree structure by utilizing logarithmically transformed versions of power law equations sileshi 2014 variables describing the contribution of physiological processes can be equally included in the list of independent explanatory variables xi as long as their values can be considered constant at the time scale when the value of the dependent response variable such as δlj here is set voit and sands 1996 yet the potential of power law models to operate as dynamical models of plant development by themselves has remained largely unexplored with few examples covering the dynamic processes of tree growth voit and sands 1996 renton et al 2005a b in other contexts the s system approach with its power law notation has been documented extensively with plentiful justification for process modelling savageau 1979a b voit 2000 voit et al 2015 2 2 variables for models of branch elongation in silver birch we considered a selected set of structural and physiological variables to potentially influence branch growth in silver birch fig 1 table 1 we first used a full set of candidate variables to construct models according to eq 1 and then used model selection criteria to identify the most parsimonious set of variables to remain as independent variables xi one year was used as the time step to calculate δlj and to estimate the values of xi branch specific values were used for δlb and values specific for an individual long shoot fig 1 were used for δls as described in table 1 the annual levels of par and narea were included as potential xi variables because both have been associated with crown growth habits in different studies umeki and seino 2003 dong et al 2015 coble et al 2017 par and parav table 1 indicate the potential to capture photosynthates and narea indicates the availability and distribution of a key nutrient that also itself is related to the photosynthetic potential within the crown evans 1989 wyka et al 2016 although the values of par and parav correlate with narea their relationship in silver birch is not straightforwardly linear which leaves open the possibility of partially independent effects kaitaniemi et al 2018 the availability of growing space and the risk of mechanical abrasion within the stand are also both known to influence growth allocation young and hubbell 1991 hajek et al 2015 and their potential effects were included in the models using lbn to indicate the proximity of neighbouring trees the variables db ds and dbh or variables closely related to them are standard variables in models of plant development and their influence on elongation growth can be linked to both structural allometry and transport capacity within a tree ford et al 1990 grote and pretzsch 2002 savage et al 2010 dbh also serves to indicate the age and ontogenetic stage of a tree the annual values of the variables hrt hrc and lrb in turn represented the variants of positional variables which have turned out successful in characterizing many patterns of tree growth baldwin and peterson 1997 grote and pretzsch 2002 remphrey et al 2002 renton et al 2006 normand et al 2009 they can be considered as aggregate variables that potentially contain information on many types of processes for example they are to some extent linked with the distribution of par within the silver birch crown kaitaniemi et al 2018 but may also reflect various features of internal organization in terms of the relative transport capacity for nutritive hormonal or other substances within the stem crown or individual branch sachs 2004 in the analysis of δlb their average values also reflected structural constraints stemming from previous growth events we excluded branch mortality and other types of resource loss due to the lack of substantial data and likewise did not consider the numbers of buds produced within branches 2 3 data for model calibration the data for the calibration of the branch growth models originated from eight study plots with two to six trees each n 32 trees in all and were a subset of the data described in further detail in table 1 from both kaitaniemi and lintunen 2010 and lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 the sample trees had either scots pine pinus sylvestris l or silver birch as the dominant neighbouring species already existing architectural models were used in the estimation of par and parav for these two species kaitaniemi et al 2018 the 4 35 year old study trees were in the phase of active growth and covered a wide size range table 2 the study plots were located along a 400 km southwest northeast transect between latitudes 60 n and 63 n and longitudes 21 e and 29 e in the boreal forest zone of finland and represented myrtillus type forest sites characterized by mesic till soils and medium fertility annual elongation through the growth of long shoots was measured to describe the rate of elongation in each study branch δls and δlb elongation was measured at the end of the growing season from a sample of 1 12 sample branches systematically selected from the basal middle and apical part of each tree crown on average there were six sample branches per tree δls was measured as the distance between the long shoot base and the most apical bud of a long shoot and δlb was calculated as the sum of all individual long shoot lengths within a branch fig 1 the δls values for each long shoot position were obtained along with the full 3d structure of the sample branches by recording the 3d positions of all individual short and long shoots and branching points using a digitizer in the field fig 1 lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 dead side branches were left out from the measurements the procedure provided also the 3d positions of the sample branches within the main stem the branching orders i and the lengths of branch segments between the long shoot positions were also recorded which yielded positional information for model development fig 1 in addition to the detailed measurements of the sample branches the length lb and branching angle for all the remaining branches of each tree was measured using the digitizer lintunen et al 2011 within each sample branch narea and relative par were estimated for one to two foliage sampling positions depending on branch size leaf samples for the determination of narea in the lowest crown parts mainly originated from the nonelongating short shoots whereas the samples in the uppermost parts frequently included two fully expanded basal leaves of elongating long shoots the leaf area was measured digitally from fresh samples and the amount of n was analysed from dried samples with the kjeldahl method par was estimated for the leaf sampling positions kaitaniemi et al 2018 using the lignum model as described in lintunen et al 2013 the instantaneous relative par with respect to the par of an open overcast sky was used as a shortcut estimate of the annual cumulative par gendron et al 1998 yoshimura and yamashita 2014 in order to estimate par for the positions of leaf samples the 3d crown structure with leaves of all trees on the plot was constructed using the models described in lintunen et al 2011 if the sampling position was located inside the canopy par was computed for a total of four random positions within a cube with 20 cm side lengths around the sampling point and the average of the values was used in the analyses to even out the fine scale variation of light in the crown kaitaniemi et al 2018 branch specific average values of relative par parav and narea narea av were used for the analysis of δlb whereas the analysis of δls included only those long shoots on average nine long shoots per tree for which measurements of narea and par were available within the same 20 cm cube where their basal point was located kaitaniemi et al 2018 branch base diameter db was measured at the base of each primary branch axis and diameters d for the remaining branch parts including ds were estimated with a taper model coefficient of determination r2 0 96 based on unpublished measurements collected during the study by lintunen 2013 4 d 0 3 i 1 1 0 98 lrb d b where i is the branching order such that for the primary branch i 1 for side branches bifurcating from the primary branch i 2 and so on in the estimation we assumed that the minimum acceptable diameter was 0 15 cm the minimum distance between the tips of the longest branches and the branches of each crown bordering neighbour tree was measured in four 90 degree compass sectors to obtain tree specific average distance of basal branches to neighbouring tree branches lbn the average of lbn was used for all branches and all long shoots within branches the measurements of lbn were restricted to neighbouring trees with stems within a 5 m radius from the target tree stem 2 4 model selection we first parameterized the model in eq 1 for both δlb and δls with all the candidate explanatory variables table 1 included and then proceeded with backward elimination of the variables that did not contribute to the model fit occasionally when elimination occurred between two almost equally important variables the variables eliminated were added back at a later stage to ensure that the contribution of a particular variable was not dependent on other variables remaining in the model model selection and parameterization was conducted using the sas procedure nlmixed sas institute inc cary nc usa with the newton raphson method with line search as the optimization method normal distribution was set as the conditional distribution for the dependent variables δlb and δls wolfinger 1999 random effects were not considered because the focus was on the selection of fixed explanatory variables and their parameterization the bayesian information criterion bic was used as the criterion for model selection schwarz 1978 the steps of model selection are shown in appendix a 2 5 model validation and analysis we utilized model predicted trajectories of long term branch elongation and the resulting estimates of crown profile and branch biomass to validate the behaviour of the final models against three sources of additional data in the validation we assumed that the total branch length lt at any time step was suitable as a proxy for branch biomass the details of calculating the crown profile and the trajectories of growth using the models of δlb and δls are described in appendix a the first source of data for validation was the model of proportional branch biomass growth by tahvanainen and forss 2008 which provided an independent estimate of branch biomass increment over time in different crown positions we repeatedly applied the model of δlb to generate a similar trajectory of biomass increment as tahvanainen and forss 2008 the trajectory of growth was obtained by using the final model of δlb to predict the growth of a single branch initiated at the crown top the second source of data was the lt of the sample branches which was also obtained during the digitization of the 3d branch structure fig 1 the measured lt provided estimates of lt at different crown positions and that way reflected the prior trajectory of total branch elongation δlb in the field to validate the final model of δlb the average field measured lt was compared with lt predicted by the model at different crown positions during the crown development similar to the estimation of the biomass growth trajectory the third source of data were the lengths lb fig 1 of the remaining branches in our study trees i e those branches that were not used for model parameterization to estimate the average crown profile of the study trees to obtain a model predicted crown profile for comparison the model of δls was repeatedly applied to predict the branch main axis length lc at each annual time step and crown position because the model of δls predicted lc whereas lb in the data underestimated lc by ignoring curves within a branch fig 1 the crown profile for comparison was generated from lb by estimating lc 1 18lb see appendix a for more details for simplicity because the crown profile was obtained as a by product of comparing the model predicted and observed branch lengths during the crown development we assumed a constant 45 branching angle and a linear shape for all branches in the comparison description of a more accurate crown profile estimation for silver birch is available in lintunen et al 2011 finally a more detailed analysis of model behaviour in the various crown parts and in trees with differing size was obtained graphically by plotting the outcomes of altering the values of xi within a representative range 2 6 alternative models the performance of the final models of δls and δlb was further assessed by comparing them with alternative models obtained from the literature the fit of the alternative models was compared with the measured δls and δlb using the same model diagnostics as with the power law models in addition to bic the fit was assessed by analysing the regression between the observed vs the predicted values and testing the significance of slope b 1 and intercept a 0 piñeiro et al 2008 the root mean squared error rmse was also reported for the alternative models further the fit was also assessed by using the alternative models to generate similar growth trajectories as described in model validation and analysis first a simple allometric model was considered as plausible alternative for δlb 5 δlb αdb β second we used the empirical model underlying the statistics in table 2 of lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 to infer δlb from the statistical model explaining variation in growth vigour gv lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 measured gv as totlongt totlengtht 1 where totlongt is the measured total annual elongation at the end of year t and totlengtht 1 is the total length including all alive side branches at the end of year t 1 since gv in lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 was based on tree level sums of lengths including stem elongation we assumed that the individual branches grew with the same gv as whole trees resulting in 6 g v 0 13 p 1 0 003 t r e e a g e p 2 c i 12 0 014 t r e e a g e c i 12 δlb t gv lt t 1 where ci12 is a competition index p1 0 03 and p2 0 02 with scots pine neighbours and p1 0 and p2 0 03 with silver birch neighbours the measured values of input variables lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 were used in the analysis of δlb whereas the generation of growth trajectories relied on the average gv observed in the data third the model predicting δls and underlying the statistics in lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 was also applied to the subset of trees and shoots present in our sample 7 δ l s 1 18 23 3 c i 9 0 27 t r e e a g e 0 02 h r c 0 005 l c 0 0005 h r c l c 0 91 c i 9 t r e e a g e p 1 p 2 c i 9 p 3 t r e e a g e p 4 p 5 h r c

profile by predicting the δls of the primary branch was based on the observed average values of ci9 and treeage and the assumption of silver birch neighbours lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 the values of hrc and lc for the generation of crown profile were calculated as described in appendix a eqs 6 and 7 both describe statistical models with interactions between continuous variables which requires the values predicted to be calculated as described e g in jaccard et al 1990 we used the sas procedure genmod to generate the predicted values as an output 3 results 3 1 performance with calibration data the variables xi retained in the final model for total branch elongation δlb table 3 a included the height of branch base in relation to crown length hrc branch base diameter db and branch specific average values of both relative distance of long shoots from branch base along the main axis lrb av and side branch diameter at bifurcation points ds av the final model for individual long shoot elongation δls table 3b also included the height of branch base in relation to crown length hrc and branch base diameter db together with the diameter at the bifurcation point of the side branch bearing the long shoot ds the model in table 3a predicted δlb with higher precision table 4 fig 2 a than the model of eq 6 in which a constant gv throughout the crown was assumed table 4 fig 2b the fit of the allometric eq 5 with respect to δlb was also inadequate table 4 fig 2c the model in table 3b predicted δls slightly better table 4 fig 3 a than eq 7 table 4 fig 3b 3 2 performance with validation data the model of δlb produced a growth trajectory for lt that was closely similar to both the trajectory of total branch length observed in the field fig 4 a and the trajectory for branch biomass resulting from the model by tahvanainen and forss 2008 fig 4b predictions based on gv in eq 6 failed to follow the observed values the simple allometric model of eq 5 with parameters α 38 4 β 0 26 succeeded well in predicting lt although it did not track the curvilinear trajectories predicted by both the model of δlb and tahvanainen and forss 2008 fig 4 the model of δls applied to predict the growth trajectory of the branch main axis resulted in an approximate crown profile that followed the observed branch lengths whereas the model in eq 7 overestimated branch lengths fig 5 3 3 model predictions the parameter values in the final models table 3 suggest that hrc and db both have a strong effect on δlb table 3a further δlb was highest in branches with low branch specific average side branch diameter at the bifurcation points within a branch ds av and low branch specific average distance of shoots from the branch base along the main chord lrb av δls increased with increasing hrc and decreased as a function of db table 3b high ds was associated with increased δls the graphical plots showed an increase in δlb table 3a towards the crown apex and as a function of branch diameter fig 6 a δlb was highest in branches that showed the lowest ds av values and which had most of their shoots close to the branch base fig 6b δls table 3b increased towards the crown apex and decreased as a function of db fig 7 a high values of ds were associated with increased δls fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 model predicted crown features the model predicted trajectories of long term branch elongation were capable of reproducing the dynamic development of crown profile and the accumulation of branch length and biomass in the course of tree growth which are features not addressed by typical static crown profile models power et al 2012 crecente campo et al 2013 gao et al 2017 at the same time the models served as construction rules applicable throughout entire silver birch crowns and they predicted many non trivial features of crown formation which previously have been reported in various species and in separate studies the models reproduced a higher growth rate towards the tree apex in terms of both δlb goulet et al 2000 colombo and templeton 2006 and δls remphrey et al 2002 takahashi et al 2006 the decrease in δlb and δls in the lowest branches goulet et al 2000 umeki and kikuzawa 2000 the effect of branching order measured here as ds on δls kozlowski and ward 1961 and the higher values in the δlb of thick branches in comparisons using equal branch height goulet et al 2000 within crown accumulation of branch biomass estimated as the total length of the woody branch parts was closely similar to the growth trajectory based on direct biomass measures tahvanainen and forss 2008 the model of δlb appeared to slightly overestimate lt in comparison with the field observations which may result from the exclusion of dead side branches in the measurements of lt in the field 4 2 model performance the predicted crown profile corresponded to measurements of branch length and was comparable to our previous architectural model lintunen et al 2011 however the predicted lc of the longest primary branches remained below the approximate 3 m maximum reported for mature silver birch ilomäki et al 2003 sellin and kupper 2006 and observed also in the largest crowns of our data in part this may reflect the effects of stand density on crown development ilomäki et al 2003 hence potentially on the model parameters as well but may also reflect the unknown consequences of using the growth measurements of just a single year for model parameterization similarly the largest crowns in our data had also considerably higher lt than that predicted by the model which suggests the need for caution in applying the model to tree and stand conditions not typical for our data the crown profile and the resulting final branch length predicted by our models was also sensitive to the effect of ds which we estimated simply by assuming a taper model common for all branch positions thus the model precision can probably be improved by using refined values for ds and by re estimating its associated parameter g2 overall the new models were simpler than our previous model versions and provided reasonably good fit considering the wide size range and geographical distribution of the sample trees the amount of variation in growth of birch individuals can be large even in far more strictly defined tree samples umeki and kikuzawa 2000 umeki and seino 2003 4 3 modelling processes of crown construction we consider the dynamic nature of the models as an important step towards incorporating the actual crown construction processes in applications that utilize the structural features of crown shape an efficient tool in the process is the selection of variables for the final models which acts as a procedure for identifying key factors that modify branch growth a striking feature of the final models was that they operated with morphological variables that are measurable by hand or currently perhaps using terrestrial laser scanning raumonen et al 2015 sievänen et al 2018 the predictable behaviour of the models suggests that morphological measurements for estimating the amount of annual growth together with power law approximation can be successfully used to analyse and construct models that capture many essential features of actual growth processes in contrast to purely stochastic tree clones generated from laser scanning data potapov et al 2016 2017 power law models can provide insight into physiological processes because they can easily be refined to include and assess the importance of additional physiological factors in contrast to a more traditional approach in which a separate model is used to calculate the amount of resources and empirical growth rules are used to generate crown architecture renton et al 2005b the power law approach demonstrated its capability for dynamic generation of realistic crown features on its own it was also evident that the simple allometric model in which the normalization constant was included as a single variable without any spatial information was inadequate to predict the variability of growth in individual branches even though the allometric model reasonably followed the average growth trajectory of branches it failed to depict the slowing down of branch growth towards the crown base maillette 1982 thus the power law models provided improved features compared to the simple allometric model and also served as a tool for assessing factors that may influence the values of constituents in allometric equations and their patterns of covariation the values of the scaling exponent and normalization constant are tightly linked and various combinations of values may provide acceptable fit with empirical observations west and west 2011 analysing power law models with or without assuming a constant scaling exponent can be used to reveal information on processes that generate variation in empirically observed scaling relationships kaitaniemi and lintunen 2008 a useful future enhancement would be the addition or replacement of driving xi variables using variables that directly indicate the resources available for crown development a more explicit consideration of the branching topology and the sequence of events during crown and stand development may also be beneficial because various mechanisms can contribute to growth at different crown positions and at different times of tree ontogeny at the crown apex the availability of light may guide upward growth sufficient for a tree to persist in competition although at some point hydraulic constraints will limit the increase in height ishii et al 2008 at lower crown positions dynamically changing differences in relative shading henriksson 2001 amount of growing space jones and harper 1987 branch orientation in relation to the sun stoll and schmid 1998 gv and timing of events duchesneau et al 2001 may be more influential and give rise to other typical responses such as crown asymmetry the costs of maintenance are likely to increase as branch size increases cannell and morgan 1989 spatz and bruechert 2000 and the longest and most vigorous branches can also become subject to mechanical abrasion with neighbouring trees both setting limits to branch growth and gv hajek et al 2015 loehle 2016 since neighbouring trees and other biotic factors undergo simultaneous changes crown structure is likely to be rarely at the fully optimal state since we did not detect the effect of neighbour distance on branch growth the distance to neighbouring trees may have occurred over a range in which a change in distance itself does not explain crown expansion simard and zimonick 2005 the stand densities were relatively low lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 and extensive mechanical contacts generating prominent crown asymmetry were not anticipated or observed we also used an average measure of distance for all the basal branches throughout the crown whereas mechanical contacts may be prominent only in specific compass directions and in the longest branches hajek et al 2015 the list of explanatory variables in the final models included indirect factors such as ds hrc and lrb av whereas some direct factors were omitted such as par and narea which indicate potential photosynthetic capacity within the crown the exclusion of par and narea suggests that the indirect variables defining mainly the relative position of the branches and shoots within the crown were sufficient to capture the effect of par and narea there are several examples of positional effects in addition to light that can influence growth responses and the use of ds hrc and lrb av may have indicated the favourability of growth positions relative to the structural organization of the entire crown for example differences in the relative levels of shading instead of absolute differences in par may greatly modify the allocation of growth henriksson 2001 dong et al 2015 while differences in height or gv among branches may affect growth independently of light goulet et al 2000 osada et al 2014 and mechanisms of apical control may also contribute to growth allocation duchesneau et al 2001 palubicki et al 2009 the use of ds hrc and lrb av as indirect explanatory variables in the models can be considered as a shortcut to cover multiple possible configurations of internal organization although there may remain the need for more precise definition through the specification and inclusion of additional factors xi in the models however many alternative trait configurations may provide plants with equal performance in terms of growth or other measures of success delagrange et al 2004 hubbell 2006 marks and lechowicz 2006 kaitaniemi 2007 thus even a simplified model can be operationally efficient for many purposes rosindell et al 2012 some important factors were omitted from the models for reasons of simplicity or lack of sufficient data for example temperature precipitation and site fertility greatly influence tree growth niinemets and lukjanova 2003 dewar et al 2009 and in models where prediction at multiple locations and for several years is required they are clearly candidates to be included with their own xi as driving variables to indicate the availability of resources for growth investment in reproduction or losses to herbivory could be included as an efflux that removes resources from growth we also ignored the effects of neighbouring species and competition indices which we previously reported as being influential for silver birch growth and crown construction lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 instead they were considered through the use of par and narea both of which increase with the presence of silver birch as the dominant neighbouring species in comparison to scots pine neighbours with equal height kaitaniemi et al 2018 the positional variables ds hrc and lrb may have incorporated the direct effects of par and narea 5 conclusions we conclude that the power law approach shows good potential for modelling and analysing crown development at the level of 3d crown structure using variables that capture features of both structure and functioning of crowns the models can provide improved precision regarding allocation of growth compared with classical statistical models or simple allometric estimates of growth even further precision may be obtained by including resource availability and identifying the consequences of processes associated with detailed branching topology and spatial interactions among trees during stand development

24934,we demonstrate the efficacy of power law models in the analysis of tree branch growth the models can be interpreted as allometric equations which incorporate multiple driving variables in a single scaling relationship to predict the amount of growth within a branch we first used model selection criteria to identify the variables that most influenced 1 the length of individual elongating annual shoots and 2 the total length of all elongating annual shoots in the individual branches of silver birch betula pendula roth we then applied the two resulting power law equations as dynamic models to predict the trajectories of crown profile development and accumulation of branch biomass during tree growth using total branch length as a proxy for biomass in spite of the wide size range and geographical distribution of the study trees the models successfully reproduced the dynamic characteristics of crown development and branch biomass accumulation applying the model to predict long term growth of a single branch that was initiated at the crown top generated a realistic crown profile and produced a final basal branch size that was well within the range of field observations the models also predicted a set of more subtle and non trivial features of crown formation including the increased rate of growth towards the tree apex decrease in growth towards the lowest branches the effect of branching order on the amount of elongation and the higher vigour of thick branches when the effect of branch height was controlled in contrast a simple allometric model of the form y axb was incapable of capturing all the variability in growth of individual branches and of predicting the features of crown shape and branch size that are associated with the slowing down of growth towards the crown base we conclude that power law models where the parameter a is refined to include spatial information on branch features shows good potential for identifying and incorporating actual crown construction processes in dynamic models that utilize the structural features of tree crowns keywords allometry crown structure spatial interactions s systems structural parameters 1 introduction development of tree crown is an iterative process in which a tree constantly grows to adjust the three dimensional 3d structure in response to changes in the environment and the internal organization sorrensen cothern et al 1993 pretzsch 2014 although crown construction averaged over several tree species largely follows allometric laws and other biophysical rules farnsworth and niklas 1995 enquist 2002 bejan et al 2008 there remains ample variation within and between species and individuals lines et al 2012 bentley et al 2013 pretzsch 2014 a seemingly stochastic component is involved in within crown distribution of extension growth within branches buck sorlin 2000 stevenson et al 2000 kull and tulva 2002 koyama et al 2017 a wide variety of environmental factors can generate apparent stochasticity in crown development because they influence local growth habits and generate plastic responses environmental factors include the quantity and quality of light baraldi et al 1994 kukk and sõber 2015 wind and gravity brüchert and gardiner 2006 james et al 2006 mechanical contacts with neighbours hajek et al 2015 availability of growing space simard and zimonick 2005 temperature nakamura et al 2016 and activities of other organisms haukioja et al 1990 gonda king et al 2014 the internal organization of a crown comprises multiple organs and tissues competing for limited resources allocation among the competing sites is affected by concurrent physical and ecophysiological factors that include hormonal control and correlative inhibition sprugel 2002 tworkoski et al 2006 trade offs among elongation radial growth and reproduction obeso 1997 kramer et al 2014 biomechanical requirements sone et al 2006 loehle 2016 capacity of transport tissue grönlund et al 2016 and hydraulic limits koch et al 2004 several studies of trees have reported consistencies between annual elongation and internal and external factors under strictly controlled growth conditions normand et al 2009 chen and sumida 2017 in tree saplings messier and nikinmaa 2000 takahashi et al 2006 collet et al 2011 and in fixed crown positions osada et al 2014 the generation of crown asymmetry is well documented and the importance of hierarchical branching order for shoot growth is also well known jones and harper 1987 young and hubbell 1991 lintunen et al 2011 however the information available on within crown patterns of branch growth is scattered and spatially and ontogenetically limited because typical studies cover growth at specific crown positions of only a handful of trees growing at a single site in ecological interactions that shape the competitive success of individual trees the functioning of plastic growth patterns within the crown thus remains largely unexplored ford 2014 even the process based functional structural models of tree architecture frequently simplify representation of resource allocation to branches using growth rules that overlook the identification of the actual processes that generate crown architecture lacointe 2000 mathieu et al 2009 ford 2014 here we focus on the analysis of branch growth throughout the entire crowns of silver birch betula pendula roth individuals ranging from the juvenile to the reproductive stage within a geographical gradient our aim is to identify the best set of explanatory variables for dynamic models that encompass the patterns of branch growth shared by the tree individuals regardless of the developmental stage or the effects of unknown site specific factors we considered both structural variables and variables that estimated the availability of photosynthetic radiation as well as plausible proxies for physiological information as an advancement to our previous analyses of static crown structure lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 lintunen et al 2011 we demonstrate the use of power law models as a method that serves both to detect the dominant factors influencing branch growth within the crown and as a method for constructing dynamic models to estimate branch growth and crown formation 2 materials and methods 2 1 power law modelling the power law models can be considered as allometric scaling equations y axb in which the normalization constant a has been modified to include information on additional factors affecting the scaling relationship a procedure that has been implicitly adopted in many existing model equations e g cole and lorimer 1994 mäkinen 2002 kantola and mäkelä 2004 and explicitly considered in others white and gould 1965 kaitaniemi and lintunen 2008 peters et al 2018 we analysed branch growth within the crown of silver birch by focusing on annual branch elongation rate described as 1 the annual total branch elongation δlb calculated as the summed length of all elongating shoots within individual first order branches and 2 the annual length of the individual elongating shoots δls the models for δlb and δls were constructed as power law models imitating the s system approach voit 2000 as 1 δ l j α x 1 g 1 x 2 g 2 x 3 g 3 x i g i j b o r s where xi are independent explanatory variables α and gi are parameters and j b refers to the model of δlb and j s to the model of δls using branch diameter db as an example of an explanatory variable xgi the eq 1 can be interpreted as an allometric equation with the form 2 δ l j a d b g i j b o r s where gi is the scaling exponent and a is the normalization constant following from eq 1 as 3 a α x 1 g 1 x 2 g 2 x 3 g 3 x i 1 g i 1 the construction of power law models is not restricted to structural features which are widely used for the static allometric analysis of tree structure by utilizing logarithmically transformed versions of power law equations sileshi 2014 variables describing the contribution of physiological processes can be equally included in the list of independent explanatory variables xi as long as their values can be considered constant at the time scale when the value of the dependent response variable such as δlj here is set voit and sands 1996 yet the potential of power law models to operate as dynamical models of plant development by themselves has remained largely unexplored with few examples covering the dynamic processes of tree growth voit and sands 1996 renton et al 2005a b in other contexts the s system approach with its power law notation has been documented extensively with plentiful justification for process modelling savageau 1979a b voit 2000 voit et al 2015 2 2 variables for models of branch elongation in silver birch we considered a selected set of structural and physiological variables to potentially influence branch growth in silver birch fig 1 table 1 we first used a full set of candidate variables to construct models according to eq 1 and then used model selection criteria to identify the most parsimonious set of variables to remain as independent variables xi one year was used as the time step to calculate δlj and to estimate the values of xi branch specific values were used for δlb and values specific for an individual long shoot fig 1 were used for δls as described in table 1 the annual levels of par and narea were included as potential xi variables because both have been associated with crown growth habits in different studies umeki and seino 2003 dong et al 2015 coble et al 2017 par and parav table 1 indicate the potential to capture photosynthates and narea indicates the availability and distribution of a key nutrient that also itself is related to the photosynthetic potential within the crown evans 1989 wyka et al 2016 although the values of par and parav correlate with narea their relationship in silver birch is not straightforwardly linear which leaves open the possibility of partially independent effects kaitaniemi et al 2018 the availability of growing space and the risk of mechanical abrasion within the stand are also both known to influence growth allocation young and hubbell 1991 hajek et al 2015 and their potential effects were included in the models using lbn to indicate the proximity of neighbouring trees the variables db ds and dbh or variables closely related to them are standard variables in models of plant development and their influence on elongation growth can be linked to both structural allometry and transport capacity within a tree ford et al 1990 grote and pretzsch 2002 savage et al 2010 dbh also serves to indicate the age and ontogenetic stage of a tree the annual values of the variables hrt hrc and lrb in turn represented the variants of positional variables which have turned out successful in characterizing many patterns of tree growth baldwin and peterson 1997 grote and pretzsch 2002 remphrey et al 2002 renton et al 2006 normand et al 2009 they can be considered as aggregate variables that potentially contain information on many types of processes for example they are to some extent linked with the distribution of par within the silver birch crown kaitaniemi et al 2018 but may also reflect various features of internal organization in terms of the relative transport capacity for nutritive hormonal or other substances within the stem crown or individual branch sachs 2004 in the analysis of δlb their average values also reflected structural constraints stemming from previous growth events we excluded branch mortality and other types of resource loss due to the lack of substantial data and likewise did not consider the numbers of buds produced within branches 2 3 data for model calibration the data for the calibration of the branch growth models originated from eight study plots with two to six trees each n 32 trees in all and were a subset of the data described in further detail in table 1 from both kaitaniemi and lintunen 2010 and lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 the sample trees had either scots pine pinus sylvestris l or silver birch as the dominant neighbouring species already existing architectural models were used in the estimation of par and parav for these two species kaitaniemi et al 2018 the 4 35 year old study trees were in the phase of active growth and covered a wide size range table 2 the study plots were located along a 400 km southwest northeast transect between latitudes 60 n and 63 n and longitudes 21 e and 29 e in the boreal forest zone of finland and represented myrtillus type forest sites characterized by mesic till soils and medium fertility annual elongation through the growth of long shoots was measured to describe the rate of elongation in each study branch δls and δlb elongation was measured at the end of the growing season from a sample of 1 12 sample branches systematically selected from the basal middle and apical part of each tree crown on average there were six sample branches per tree δls was measured as the distance between the long shoot base and the most apical bud of a long shoot and δlb was calculated as the sum of all individual long shoot lengths within a branch fig 1 the δls values for each long shoot position were obtained along with the full 3d structure of the sample branches by recording the 3d positions of all individual short and long shoots and branching points using a digitizer in the field fig 1 lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 dead side branches were left out from the measurements the procedure provided also the 3d positions of the sample branches within the main stem the branching orders i and the lengths of branch segments between the long shoot positions were also recorded which yielded positional information for model development fig 1 in addition to the detailed measurements of the sample branches the length lb and branching angle for all the remaining branches of each tree was measured using the digitizer lintunen et al 2011 within each sample branch narea and relative par were estimated for one to two foliage sampling positions depending on branch size leaf samples for the determination of narea in the lowest crown parts mainly originated from the nonelongating short shoots whereas the samples in the uppermost parts frequently included two fully expanded basal leaves of elongating long shoots the leaf area was measured digitally from fresh samples and the amount of n was analysed from dried samples with the kjeldahl method par was estimated for the leaf sampling positions kaitaniemi et al 2018 using the lignum model as described in lintunen et al 2013 the instantaneous relative par with respect to the par of an open overcast sky was used as a shortcut estimate of the annual cumulative par gendron et al 1998 yoshimura and yamashita 2014 in order to estimate par for the positions of leaf samples the 3d crown structure with leaves of all trees on the plot was constructed using the models described in lintunen et al 2011 if the sampling position was located inside the canopy par was computed for a total of four random positions within a cube with 20 cm side lengths around the sampling point and the average of the values was used in the analyses to even out the fine scale variation of light in the crown kaitaniemi et al 2018 branch specific average values of relative par parav and narea narea av were used for the analysis of δlb whereas the analysis of δls included only those long shoots on average nine long shoots per tree for which measurements of narea and par were available within the same 20 cm cube where their basal point was located kaitaniemi et al 2018 branch base diameter db was measured at the base of each primary branch axis and diameters d for the remaining branch parts including ds were estimated with a taper model coefficient of determination r2 0 96 based on unpublished measurements collected during the study by lintunen 2013 4 d 0 3 i 1 1 0 98 lrb d b where i is the branching order such that for the primary branch i 1 for side branches bifurcating from the primary branch i 2 and so on in the estimation we assumed that the minimum acceptable diameter was 0 15 cm the minimum distance between the tips of the longest branches and the branches of each crown bordering neighbour tree was measured in four 90 degree compass sectors to obtain tree specific average distance of basal branches to neighbouring tree branches lbn the average of lbn was used for all branches and all long shoots within branches the measurements of lbn were restricted to neighbouring trees with stems within a 5 m radius from the target tree stem 2 4 model selection we first parameterized the model in eq 1 for both δlb and δls with all the candidate explanatory variables table 1 included and then proceeded with backward elimination of the variables that did not contribute to the model fit occasionally when elimination occurred between two almost equally important variables the variables eliminated were added back at a later stage to ensure that the contribution of a particular variable was not dependent on other variables remaining in the model model selection and parameterization was conducted using the sas procedure nlmixed sas institute inc cary nc usa with the newton raphson method with line search as the optimization method normal distribution was set as the conditional distribution for the dependent variables δlb and δls wolfinger 1999 random effects were not considered because the focus was on the selection of fixed explanatory variables and their parameterization the bayesian information criterion bic was used as the criterion for model selection schwarz 1978 the steps of model selection are shown in appendix a 2 5 model validation and analysis we utilized model predicted trajectories of long term branch elongation and the resulting estimates of crown profile and branch biomass to validate the behaviour of the final models against three sources of additional data in the validation we assumed that the total branch length lt at any time step was suitable as a proxy for branch biomass the details of calculating the crown profile and the trajectories of growth using the models of δlb and δls are described in appendix a the first source of data for validation was the model of proportional branch biomass growth by tahvanainen and forss 2008 which provided an independent estimate of branch biomass increment over time in different crown positions we repeatedly applied the model of δlb to generate a similar trajectory of biomass increment as tahvanainen and forss 2008 the trajectory of growth was obtained by using the final model of δlb to predict the growth of a single branch initiated at the crown top the second source of data was the lt of the sample branches which was also obtained during the digitization of the 3d branch structure fig 1 the measured lt provided estimates of lt at different crown positions and that way reflected the prior trajectory of total branch elongation δlb in the field to validate the final model of δlb the average field measured lt was compared with lt predicted by the model at different crown positions during the crown development similar to the estimation of the biomass growth trajectory the third source of data were the lengths lb fig 1 of the remaining branches in our study trees i e those branches that were not used for model parameterization to estimate the average crown profile of the study trees to obtain a model predicted crown profile for comparison the model of δls was repeatedly applied to predict the branch main axis length lc at each annual time step and crown position because the model of δls predicted lc whereas lb in the data underestimated lc by ignoring curves within a branch fig 1 the crown profile for comparison was generated from lb by estimating lc 1 18lb see appendix a for more details for simplicity because the crown profile was obtained as a by product of comparing the model predicted and observed branch lengths during the crown development we assumed a constant 45 branching angle and a linear shape for all branches in the comparison description of a more accurate crown profile estimation for silver birch is available in lintunen et al 2011 finally a more detailed analysis of model behaviour in the various crown parts and in trees with differing size was obtained graphically by plotting the outcomes of altering the values of xi within a representative range 2 6 alternative models the performance of the final models of δls and δlb was further assessed by comparing them with alternative models obtained from the literature the fit of the alternative models was compared with the measured δls and δlb using the same model diagnostics as with the power law models in addition to bic the fit was assessed by analysing the regression between the observed vs the predicted values and testing the significance of slope b 1 and intercept a 0 piñeiro et al 2008 the root mean squared error rmse was also reported for the alternative models further the fit was also assessed by using the alternative models to generate similar growth trajectories as described in model validation and analysis first a simple allometric model was considered as plausible alternative for δlb 5 δlb αdb β second we used the empirical model underlying the statistics in table 2 of lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 to infer δlb from the statistical model explaining variation in growth vigour gv lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 measured gv as totlongt totlengtht 1 where totlongt is the measured total annual elongation at the end of year t and totlengtht 1 is the total length including all alive side branches at the end of year t 1 since gv in lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 was based on tree level sums of lengths including stem elongation we assumed that the individual branches grew with the same gv as whole trees resulting in 6 g v 0 13 p 1 0 003 t r e e a g e p 2 c i 12 0 014 t r e e a g e c i 12 δlb t gv lt t 1 where ci12 is a competition index p1 0 03 and p2 0 02 with scots pine neighbours and p1 0 and p2 0 03 with silver birch neighbours the measured values of input variables lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 were used in the analysis of δlb whereas the generation of growth trajectories relied on the average gv observed in the data third the model predicting δls and underlying the statistics in lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 was also applied to the subset of trees and shoots present in our sample 7 δ l s 1 18 23 3 c i 9 0 27 t r e e a g e 0 02 h r c 0 005 l c 0 0005 h r c l c 0 91 c i 9 t r e e a g e p 1 p 2 c i 9 p 3 t r e e a g e p 4 p 5 h r c

profile by predicting the δls of the primary branch was based on the observed average values of ci9 and treeage and the assumption of silver birch neighbours lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 the values of hrc and lc for the generation of crown profile were calculated as described in appendix a eqs 6 and 7 both describe statistical models with interactions between continuous variables which requires the values predicted to be calculated as described e g in jaccard et al 1990 we used the sas procedure genmod to generate the predicted values as an output 3 results 3 1 performance with calibration data the variables xi retained in the final model for total branch elongation δlb table 3 a included the height of branch base in relation to crown length hrc branch base diameter db and branch specific average values of both relative distance of long shoots from branch base along the main axis lrb av and side branch diameter at bifurcation points ds av the final model for individual long shoot elongation δls table 3b also included the height of branch base in relation to crown length hrc and branch base diameter db together with the diameter at the bifurcation point of the side branch bearing the long shoot ds the model in table 3a predicted δlb with higher precision table 4 fig 2 a than the model of eq 6 in which a constant gv throughout the crown was assumed table 4 fig 2b the fit of the allometric eq 5 with respect to δlb was also inadequate table 4 fig 2c the model in table 3b predicted δls slightly better table 4 fig 3 a than eq 7 table 4 fig 3b 3 2 performance with validation data the model of δlb produced a growth trajectory for lt that was closely similar to both the trajectory of total branch length observed in the field fig 4 a and the trajectory for branch biomass resulting from the model by tahvanainen and forss 2008 fig 4b predictions based on gv in eq 6 failed to follow the observed values the simple allometric model of eq 5 with parameters α 38 4 β 0 26 succeeded well in predicting lt although it did not track the curvilinear trajectories predicted by both the model of δlb and tahvanainen and forss 2008 fig 4 the model of δls applied to predict the growth trajectory of the branch main axis resulted in an approximate crown profile that followed the observed branch lengths whereas the model in eq 7 overestimated branch lengths fig 5 3 3 model predictions the parameter values in the final models table 3 suggest that hrc and db both have a strong effect on δlb table 3a further δlb was highest in branches with low branch specific average side branch diameter at the bifurcation points within a branch ds av and low branch specific average distance of shoots from the branch base along the main chord lrb av δls increased with increasing hrc and decreased as a function of db table 3b high ds was associated with increased δls the graphical plots showed an increase in δlb table 3a towards the crown apex and as a function of branch diameter fig 6 a δlb was highest in branches that showed the lowest ds av values and which had most of their shoots close to the branch base fig 6b δls table 3b increased towards the crown apex and decreased as a function of db fig 7 a high values of ds were associated with increased δls fig 7b 4 discussion 4 1 model predicted crown features the model predicted trajectories of long term branch elongation were capable of reproducing the dynamic development of crown profile and the accumulation of branch length and biomass in the course of tree growth which are features not addressed by typical static crown profile models power et al 2012 crecente campo et al 2013 gao et al 2017 at the same time the models served as construction rules applicable throughout entire silver birch crowns and they predicted many non trivial features of crown formation which previously have been reported in various species and in separate studies the models reproduced a higher growth rate towards the tree apex in terms of both δlb goulet et al 2000 colombo and templeton 2006 and δls remphrey et al 2002 takahashi et al 2006 the decrease in δlb and δls in the lowest branches goulet et al 2000 umeki and kikuzawa 2000 the effect of branching order measured here as ds on δls kozlowski and ward 1961 and the higher values in the δlb of thick branches in comparisons using equal branch height goulet et al 2000 within crown accumulation of branch biomass estimated as the total length of the woody branch parts was closely similar to the growth trajectory based on direct biomass measures tahvanainen and forss 2008 the model of δlb appeared to slightly overestimate lt in comparison with the field observations which may result from the exclusion of dead side branches in the measurements of lt in the field 4 2 model performance the predicted crown profile corresponded to measurements of branch length and was comparable to our previous architectural model lintunen et al 2011 however the predicted lc of the longest primary branches remained below the approximate 3 m maximum reported for mature silver birch ilomäki et al 2003 sellin and kupper 2006 and observed also in the largest crowns of our data in part this may reflect the effects of stand density on crown development ilomäki et al 2003 hence potentially on the model parameters as well but may also reflect the unknown consequences of using the growth measurements of just a single year for model parameterization similarly the largest crowns in our data had also considerably higher lt than that predicted by the model which suggests the need for caution in applying the model to tree and stand conditions not typical for our data the crown profile and the resulting final branch length predicted by our models was also sensitive to the effect of ds which we estimated simply by assuming a taper model common for all branch positions thus the model precision can probably be improved by using refined values for ds and by re estimating its associated parameter g2 overall the new models were simpler than our previous model versions and provided reasonably good fit considering the wide size range and geographical distribution of the sample trees the amount of variation in growth of birch individuals can be large even in far more strictly defined tree samples umeki and kikuzawa 2000 umeki and seino 2003 4 3 modelling processes of crown construction we consider the dynamic nature of the models as an important step towards incorporating the actual crown construction processes in applications that utilize the structural features of crown shape an efficient tool in the process is the selection of variables for the final models which acts as a procedure for identifying key factors that modify branch growth a striking feature of the final models was that they operated with morphological variables that are measurable by hand or currently perhaps using terrestrial laser scanning raumonen et al 2015 sievänen et al 2018 the predictable behaviour of the models suggests that morphological measurements for estimating the amount of annual growth together with power law approximation can be successfully used to analyse and construct models that capture many essential features of actual growth processes in contrast to purely stochastic tree clones generated from laser scanning data potapov et al 2016 2017 power law models can provide insight into physiological processes because they can easily be refined to include and assess the importance of additional physiological factors in contrast to a more traditional approach in which a separate model is used to calculate the amount of resources and empirical growth rules are used to generate crown architecture renton et al 2005b the power law approach demonstrated its capability for dynamic generation of realistic crown features on its own it was also evident that the simple allometric model in which the normalization constant was included as a single variable without any spatial information was inadequate to predict the variability of growth in individual branches even though the allometric model reasonably followed the average growth trajectory of branches it failed to depict the slowing down of branch growth towards the crown base maillette 1982 thus the power law models provided improved features compared to the simple allometric model and also served as a tool for assessing factors that may influence the values of constituents in allometric equations and their patterns of covariation the values of the scaling exponent and normalization constant are tightly linked and various combinations of values may provide acceptable fit with empirical observations west and west 2011 analysing power law models with or without assuming a constant scaling exponent can be used to reveal information on processes that generate variation in empirically observed scaling relationships kaitaniemi and lintunen 2008 a useful future enhancement would be the addition or replacement of driving xi variables using variables that directly indicate the resources available for crown development a more explicit consideration of the branching topology and the sequence of events during crown and stand development may also be beneficial because various mechanisms can contribute to growth at different crown positions and at different times of tree ontogeny at the crown apex the availability of light may guide upward growth sufficient for a tree to persist in competition although at some point hydraulic constraints will limit the increase in height ishii et al 2008 at lower crown positions dynamically changing differences in relative shading henriksson 2001 amount of growing space jones and harper 1987 branch orientation in relation to the sun stoll and schmid 1998 gv and timing of events duchesneau et al 2001 may be more influential and give rise to other typical responses such as crown asymmetry the costs of maintenance are likely to increase as branch size increases cannell and morgan 1989 spatz and bruechert 2000 and the longest and most vigorous branches can also become subject to mechanical abrasion with neighbouring trees both setting limits to branch growth and gv hajek et al 2015 loehle 2016 since neighbouring trees and other biotic factors undergo simultaneous changes crown structure is likely to be rarely at the fully optimal state since we did not detect the effect of neighbour distance on branch growth the distance to neighbouring trees may have occurred over a range in which a change in distance itself does not explain crown expansion simard and zimonick 2005 the stand densities were relatively low lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 and extensive mechanical contacts generating prominent crown asymmetry were not anticipated or observed we also used an average measure of distance for all the basal branches throughout the crown whereas mechanical contacts may be prominent only in specific compass directions and in the longest branches hajek et al 2015 the list of explanatory variables in the final models included indirect factors such as ds hrc and lrb av whereas some direct factors were omitted such as par and narea which indicate potential photosynthetic capacity within the crown the exclusion of par and narea suggests that the indirect variables defining mainly the relative position of the branches and shoots within the crown were sufficient to capture the effect of par and narea there are several examples of positional effects in addition to light that can influence growth responses and the use of ds hrc and lrb av may have indicated the favourability of growth positions relative to the structural organization of the entire crown for example differences in the relative levels of shading instead of absolute differences in par may greatly modify the allocation of growth henriksson 2001 dong et al 2015 while differences in height or gv among branches may affect growth independently of light goulet et al 2000 osada et al 2014 and mechanisms of apical control may also contribute to growth allocation duchesneau et al 2001 palubicki et al 2009 the use of ds hrc and lrb av as indirect explanatory variables in the models can be considered as a shortcut to cover multiple possible configurations of internal organization although there may remain the need for more precise definition through the specification and inclusion of additional factors xi in the models however many alternative trait configurations may provide plants with equal performance in terms of growth or other measures of success delagrange et al 2004 hubbell 2006 marks and lechowicz 2006 kaitaniemi 2007 thus even a simplified model can be operationally efficient for many purposes rosindell et al 2012 some important factors were omitted from the models for reasons of simplicity or lack of sufficient data for example temperature precipitation and site fertility greatly influence tree growth niinemets and lukjanova 2003 dewar et al 2009 and in models where prediction at multiple locations and for several years is required they are clearly candidates to be included with their own xi as driving variables to indicate the availability of resources for growth investment in reproduction or losses to herbivory could be included as an efflux that removes resources from growth we also ignored the effects of neighbouring species and competition indices which we previously reported as being influential for silver birch growth and crown construction lintunen and kaitaniemi 2010 instead they were considered through the use of par and narea both of which increase with the presence of silver birch as the dominant neighbouring species in comparison to scots pine neighbours with equal height kaitaniemi et al 2018 the positional variables ds hrc and lrb may have incorporated the direct effects of par and narea 5 conclusions we conclude that the power law approach shows good potential for modelling and analysing crown development at the level of 3d crown structure using variables that capture features of both structure and functioning of crowns the models can provide improved precision regarding allocation of growth compared with classical statistical models or simple allometric estimates of growth even further precision may be obtained by including resource availability and identifying the consequences of processes associated with detailed branching topology and spatial interactions among trees during stand development
