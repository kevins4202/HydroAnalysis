19905,mixotrophic denitrification processes have a great potential in nitrogen removal in biological wastewater treatment processes however so far few studies have focused on the mixotrophic denitrification system using fe ii as an exclusively assisted electron donors and the underlying mechanisms in such a process remain unclear furthermore the mechanisms by which microorganisms cover carbon nitrogen phosphorus and iron in an iron assisted mixotrophic system remain unrevealed in this work we explore the feasibility of using fe ii as an assisted electron donor for enhancing simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal via long term reactor operation and batch tests the results show that fe ii could provide electrons for efficient nitrate reduction and that biological reactions played a predominant role in these systems in these systems thermomonas a strain of nitrate reduction fe ii oxidation bacterium was enriched and accounted for a maximum abundance of 60 2

wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request introduction conventional heterotrophic denitrification which has been widely adopted to treat municipal wastewater can reduce nitrate to n2 in the presence of carbon sources as electron donor however the enormous demand for carbon sources increases operational costs and requires accurate control of carbon dosing to prevent secondary pollution hellman et al 2019 recently significant progress especially concerning autotrophic denitrification has been made toward efficient nitrogen removal technology autotrophic denitrification can use inorganic compounds such as hydrogen reduced s compounds or iron as electron donors instead of organics to complete denitrification thus avoiding the requirement of organic carbon sources di capua et al 2019 compared to hydrogen and sulfur driven autotrophic denitrification iron driven autotrophic denitrification is recognized as a promising technology because it is safe and cost effective and avoids the potential environmental risks associated with sulfate emission tian et al 2020b zhu et al 2019 in addition it can achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen and other pollutants such as phosphorus and heavy metals park et al 2018 however iron driven autotrophic denitrification is also limited by a low denitrification rate high ferrous iron addition and large alkalinity requirement which severely impede the development of this process toward practical applications tian et al 2020a the mixotrophic process presents a potentially viable strategy over autotrophic denitrification by utilizing organic and inorganic compounds as co donors of electrons to provide energy and carbon sources bryce et al 2018 recently the sulfur based and the pyrite fes2 based mixotrophic denitrification systems have gained great attention zhang et al 2022 the former relies on the synergistic effects of heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrifiers to effectively control sulfate formation and maintain the system s ph stability sahinkaya et al 2013 the latter exploits multiple electron donors of sulfur fe ii and organics showing simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus lu et al 2021 xu et al 2022 nevertheless the present mixotrophic denitrification systems rely on sulfur as the electron donor which raises concern about the sulfate emission additionally it is difficult to accomplish flexible dosing with solid electron donors such as pyrite limiting its further practical applications moreover the underlying mechanisms in the pyrite based mixotrophic denitrification system remain unclear due to the complexity of the multiple reactions involved especially in the iron mediated denitrification process to date few studies have applied the combination of organics and fe ii to enhance denitrification efficiency the mixotrophic denitrification system using fe ii as the exclusively assisted inorganic electron donor may provide a new option to alleviate the aforementioned limitations microbially mediated no3 reduction coupled with fe ii oxidation nrfeox which plays a key role in the biogeochemical cycles of iron and nitrogen was discovered over two decades ago straub et al 1996 the importance of nrfeox has been highlighted in aquifers sediments and soils emmerich et al 2012 melton et al 2012 although this process has been intensively studied the microbially mediated nrfeox process remains controversial regarding whether it is a biological process or an indirect chemical process in terms of chemodenitrification recently a study revealed that microbially mediated nrfeox is involved in both biological and chemical processes and that biological processes contribute more than chemical processes to the reduction of nitrite within the two purely isolated nrfeox bacterial groups liu et al 2019 however it is not known whether the same results occur in complex systems such as bioreactor systems and to what extent biological or chemical denitrification occurs additionally microbial information is also lacking in understanding the mechanisms of the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification system gallionellaceae with a flanking community is reported to be the dominating strains in iron driven autotrophic denitrification tian et al 2020b however the distinctions between the dominant species under autotrophic and mixotrophic conditions are unclear yet identifying keystone species and exploring the ecological mechanisms are of great significance for understanding the functional linkages and guiding the operation of the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification system driven by these gaps we herein compared heterotrophic and mixotrophic denitrification systems to explore the technical feasibility of using fe ii as an assisting electron donor for enhancing denitrification performance and investigated the underlying mechanisms of the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification system our results are expected to provide an efficient approach for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal results bioreactor performance the performance of the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification hereafter referred to as md system was assessed by comparing it with a control heterotrophic denitrification hereafter referred to as hd system operated in parallel at different c n ratios fig 1 a as shown in fig 1b the nitrate removal performance in the md system was enhanced gradually as the ferrous iron level was increased after 35 days the overall nitrate removal rate in the md system was 0 27 kg n m 3d 1 at a cod n ratio of 3 which was significantly higher than that in the hd system 0 21 kg n m 3d 1 p 0 05 when the cod n was decreased from 2 0 to 1 0 the md system still had an obviously better nitrate removal performance than the hd system the accumulated nitrite was at a lower level in the effluents of both reactors as the cod n was decreased fig s1 in addition no ammonia was detected during the whole operation period indicating that fe ii cannot reduce nitrate or nitrite to ammonia the cod removal performance was gradually enhanced for both reactors at the start up stage and then stabilized after 40 days the cod removal reached 85 4 in the md system at the second stage which was lower than 88 9 in the hd system fig 1c only a trace amount of residual fe ii was detected in the effluent of the md system at the second stage resulting in an fe ii oxidation efficiency of 97 0 fig 1d as the influent cod n was decreased from 2 to 1 the fe2 removal declined from 75 2 to 54 9 po4 3 p 6 mg l 1 was fed into the two bioreactors throughout the operation only 12 7 of p removal was observed in the hd system in the whole operation which may result from microbial assimilation fig 1e for the md system a concurrent decrease in po4 3 p in the effluent was observed after dosing 28 mg l 1 fe ii resulting in a molar ratio of the removal p to the removal fe of 0 23 as the dosing of fe ii was increased to over 84 mg l 1 no detectable p in the effluent was observed in the subsequent operation nearly five months the long term operation demonstrates the feasibility and stability of phosphate removal in the md system kinetics of nitrogen reduction and fe acetate oxidation in the md system to better understand the md process several batch assays were conducted to investigate the kinetics of nitrogen reduction and the fe ii acetate oxidation process at neutral ph fig 2 a and 2b the calculated pseudo first order rate constants k of nitrate reduction are provided in table s1 the k value of nitrate reduction in the md group was higher than that in the hd group within the initial 12 h demonstrating that the presence of fe ii could enhance nitrate reduction in the md system after 12 h acetate was consumed while nitrate was not further reduced in either group although residual fe ii still existed in the md system these results were consistent with previous findings with pure cultures liu et al 2019 mixotrophic nrfeox microorganisms have a precedence order for the utilization of organic and inorganic electron donors they can directly reduce nitrate in the presence of organic electron donors via the heterotrophic pathway while using the coexisting fe ii as inorganic electron donors for nitrate reduction via the autotrophic pathway when only fe ii existed without organic electron donors fe ii could no longer donate electrons for nitrate reduction sodium acetate was used as the electron donor for denitrification and supporting cell growth fig 2c the k value of acetate oxidation in the md group was lower than that in the hd group indicating that fe ii might affect the acetate utilization rate fe ii was decreased from 4 8 mm to 0 4 mm within 30 h fig 2d in the md group the electron balance analysis confirms that fe ii could provide electrons for microbially driven nitrate reduction supplementary materials in other words the microbes in the md system were able to take electrons from fe ii into the cells for denitrification although the denitrification enhancement by fe ii was confirmed the interaction between fe ii and intermediates of nitrogen reduction should be clarified as fe ii could donate electrons for the denitrification process via biological and chemical processes according to the batch test results fig 3 a f reactions 1 3 all followed a first order kinetic reaction which was consistent with previous studies on the nrfeox process in the pure culture system liu et al 2019 from the fitting curves the rate constants for the reduction of nitrate and nitrite and the oxidation of fe ii were calculated and are listed in table 1 at an fe ii concentration of 5 mm the k chem for nitrite was calculated as 1 32 10 5 s 1 which was lower than that of 3 39 10 5 hd group and 2 53 10 5 s 1 md group suggesting that the biological contribution for nitrite reduction was higher than that of chemodenitrification correspondingly the k chem for fe ii was 7 92 10 6 s 1 at 3 mm nitrite control which was close to that of the 7 97 10 6 s 1 md group indicating that both biological and chemical oxidation of fe ii by nitrite played important roles fig 3g and 3h shows the calculated relative contributions of biological and chemical reactions to nitrite reduction and fe ii oxidation under various nitrite fe ii conditions the biological processes played more important roles than the chemical processes in nitrite reduction after the nitrite concentration exceeded 3 mm the relative contribution of the chemodenitrification was greater than that of the biological processes to fe ii oxidation however it should be noted that the model results were closely related to the biomass in the batch test the sludge concentration used in our batch tests was 386 mg l 1 approximately 1 8 of that in the md reactor therefore the contribution of biological reactions may be significantly larger than that of chemical reactions in uasbs microbial analysis of the md system biodenitrification includes a series of nitrogen reductases that convert nitrate to nitrite then nitrous oxide and finally to nitrogen which is driven by electron generation transport and consumption among the biodenitrification processes nadh is considered to be the primary electron donor for the heterotrophic process which is generated through the metabolism of organics and then oxidized to nad by complex i and donated electrons to electron transport chains the nadh nad ratio indicates the turnover rate of electrons reflecting the reducing power level of the heterotrophic processes li et al 2016a as shown in fig 4 a the difference in nadh nad between the heterotrophic and mixotrophic systems was not significant which is consistent with the cod electron utilization efficiency reported in the long term reactor operation suggesting that the reducing power of the heterotrophic process was not affected by introducing fe ii after long term acclimation accompanied by electron generation a proton gradient was established for the synthesis of atp which provides energy for cell growth cell maintenance and polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis zhang et al 2021 however the atp content of the microbes in the mixotrophic system was 0 26 μmol g 1 vss which was lower than that in the heterotrophic system 0 33 μmol g 1 vss a possible explanation for such a difference might be the microbial detoxification mechanism the nrfeox microbes could utilize efflux pumps to export toxic metal ions and regulate the intracellular iron concentration at the expense of atp to avoid cell damage by iron iii oxyhydr oxide mineral formation carlson et al 2012 for electron transport etsa could reflect the electron transport efficiency for two denitrification processes as shown in fig 4b the etsa value in the hd system was comparable to that in the md system at a cod n ratio of 3 as the cod n was decreased the microbes in the md system presented a significantly higher etsa than those in the hd system indicating that electron transport was enhanced by the presence of fe ii nar and nir are the essential nitrogen reductases for denitrifiers and are responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to no respectively the activities of nar and nir decreased with the decrease in cod n in both the hd and md systems suggesting that the key denitrification enzyme activities were closely related to the organic substrate concentration even in the md system fig 4c the activity of nar in the md system was higher than that in the hd system especially at a cod n ratio of 2 to 3 which is consistent with the reactor operation results of nitrate reduction demonstrating that the nitrate bioreduction process could be improved in the md system similarly the activity of nir in the md system was higher than that in the hd system at a cod n ratio of 3 however as the cod n decreased the nir activity in the md system gradually became lower than that in the hd system it was reported that the presence of fe ii might lead to nitrite accumulation in the pure culture system due to the potential interaction with nitrite reducing enzymes in the periplasm peng et al 2018 however there was no obvious nitrite accumulation difference between the md and hd groups which might be due to the combination of biological and chemical reactions the presence of functional genes for nitrogen metabolic pathways in the two systems was further confirmed by qpcr the abundances of narg norb and nosz in md were significantly higher than those in the hd system indicating a higher abundance of denitrifiers in the md system than in the hd system fig 4d evolution of the microbial community profiles nrfeox capable microbes are abundant in iron containing sediments and play a critical role in the natural fe and n cycles melton et al 2014 however it is still unclear how the microbial community structure changes when mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria are applied for nitrate containing wastewater treatment the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that the hd system was dominated by ralstonia and thauera with relative abundances of 20 4 and 5 7 respectively which were reported to be typical acetate fed denitrifiers fig 5 a and 5b miao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 for the md system thermomonas dominated and gradually increased in abundance as the cod n decreased reaching 60 2 at a cod n ratio of 1 additionally the abundance of rhodanobacter and geothrix increased and peaked at a cod n of 2 with 11 4 and 6 4 respectively thermomonas strains were obviously enriched in various types of bioreactors containing fe and nitrogen wastewater treatment such as nitrate polluted groundwater acid mine drainage and coal gasification wastewater hou et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b an isolated thermomonas strain brg3 was observed to have the capacity to couple fe ii oxidation and denitrification in the presence of an organic co substrate zhang et al 2018a in addition some species in thermomonas isolated from the denitrification reactor possess the ability of heterotrophic denitrification mergaert et al 2003 however it was also reported that thermomonas was identified with an autotrophic metabolic pathway by dna based stable isotope probing in the mixotrophic denitrification system xing et al 2018 therefore such a high abundance of thermomonans in the md system indicates that it was possibly a mixotrophic nrfeox bacterium which was highly associated with fe ii oxidation and could play a prominent role in denitrification rhodanobacter and geothrix were also reported to exist in the flanking community of the autotrophic nrfeox system species of rhodanobacter are considered acid tolerant denitrifiers that can use carboxylic acids and amino acids as energy and carbon sources to reduce nitrate lee et al 2007 a metagenomic study shows that they have all genes necessary for complete denitrification he et al 2016 and may play a detoxification role reducing toxic no to n2 in the nrfeox process tominski et al 2018 geothrix is recognized as an iron reducing bacterium that can reduce fe iii to fe ii lovley 2006 the high abundance of geothrix suggests that it might construct a cryptic cycle between the iron oxide produced by nrfeox and fe ii in addition geothrix was found to release electron shuttling compounds that can transfer electrons from the cell to fe iii oxide nevin and lovley 2002 geothrix could promote the fe n cycle in the system by enhancing lepidocrocite bioreduction o loughlin 2008 this could be responsible for the increase in etsa in the md system which resulted in the enhanced denitrification performance wang et al 2022 the typically dominant autotrophic nrfeox bacteria like gallionellaceae found in autotrophic fe ii denitrification reactors were not enriched in the md system indicating that the denitrification enhancement in the md system was not caused by the autotrophic nrfeox bacteria an interesting finding was that the whole community structure of the md system was similar to the flanking community structure of the autotrophic denitrification system tian et al 2020b but there was a large difference in the abundance these results may indicate that a similar md process also existed in the iron autotrophic denitrification system the metabolic pathways were predicted by picrust to further investigate the interactions in the microbial community fig 5c the abundance of functional enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism showed a significant difference between the hd and md systems the forecasted abundance of nitrate reductase nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase in the md system was higher than that in the hd system which is consistent with the qpcr results discussion the enhanced nitrate and phosphate removal by coupling fe ii with a carbon source was verified in this work previous studies and our batch and numerical modeling results imply that fe ii might be used as an electron donor in the denitrification process in which the biological process plays a vital role accordingly fig s2 illustrates the possible mechanisms of the denitrification process in the md system including biological electron supply biological electron consumption and chemodenitrification enriched functional nrfeox bacteria thermomonas may possess the lithotrophic electron pathway and can take up electrons from fe ii into cells meanwhile they have organotrophic electron pathways for synchronous acquisition of electrons from organic and inorganic electron donors for denitrification compared to heterotrophic denitrifiers mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria can supply more electrons to complete the denitrification process due to their broad spectrum of substrate utilization in addition biodenitrification is accomplished through a series of intracellular reductions driven by electron transport and consumption wan et al 2016 the activities of nitrogen reductases were enhanced in the md system suggesting that nrfeox bacteria exhibited a stronger denitrification capacity moreover a synergistic symbiotic relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms within the md system such as what exists in the iron autotrophic denitrification system may also play an important role in the denitrification process autotrophic microorganisms with iron oxidation capacity may produce some metabolic intermediates that can be further used as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers thus promoting the completion of the denitrification process xing et al 2018 the fe assisted mixotrophic denitrification system offers a potential alternative over the current heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification and achieves simultaneous phosphorus removal first using fe ii as an assisted electron donor can reduce the demand for organic carbon sources while enhancing the denitrification performance compared to sulfur autotrophic mixotrophic denitrification the use of dissolved fe ii allows for an improved electron utilization efficiency and precise dosing avoiding the low utilization efficiency caused by the low solubility of monomeric sulfur second the md system can achieve a faster start up and relatively higher biomass retention in the reactor than the autotrophic denitrification system the slower growth rate of the functional microorganisms in autotrophic denitrification systems is one of the main reasons for the long reactor start up time heterotrophic or mixotrophic microorganisms grow faster than autotrophic microorganisms and therefore can shorten the start up time and maintain a relatively high level of biomass in the reactor novák et al 1994 third the ph in md systems is relatively stable at the near neutral range without additional adjustment the ph ranged from 6 4 to 6 9 in the md system while the ph was alkaline 7 7 to 8 4 in the hd system the alkalinity produced by the heterotrophic process could be neutralized by h generated in fe ii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction and could keep the solution in the near neutral range alleviating the adverse effects on microbial metabolism caused by ph change sahinkaya and dursun 2012 additionally the md system is a more cost effective option than the hd system the price of feso4 technical grade was approximately 85 t 1 much less than the typical carbon source for denitrification such as glucose 460 t 1 sodium acetate 1200 t 1 market quotes in december 2022 china our results show that the mass ratio of ferrous addition to nitrate removal was about 20 the heterotrophic denitrification system required a carbon nitrogen ratio of about 6 for complete nitrate removal therefore the cost of fe ii to remove 1 kg of nitrate nitrogen was estimated to be 1 7 which was lower than glucose 2 8 and sodium acetate 9 2 adopting fe ii as the assisted electron donor can alleviate the excessive costs caused by carbon source the amount of fe ii required in the md system is also lower than that in the fe autotrophic denitrification system resulting in less iron sludge production and further reducing the costs required for iron sludge disposal finally the md system can achieve simultaneous removal of phosphorus and has the potential to remove other pollutants such as heavy metals it was reported that precipitates such as lepidocrocite produced in the nrfeox process can be efficient adsorbents for arsenic park et al 2018 although the md system offers several advantages several challenges need to be properly addressed for future development one concern is the cell encrustation induced by fe iii mineral formation in previous studies on mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria fe iii minerals were found to be formed in the pericellular and cytoplasmic areas leading to a decrease in the microbial metabolic activity and even to cell death klueglein et al 2014 therefore there is a risk that the md system can fail however in our work the md reactor was operated stably for more than six months and the sludge concentration kept stabilized at approximately 4000 mg l 1 of vss this result implies that there might be a dynamic balance between the microbial growth and mortality due to cell encrustation in the md system another concern is the unclear emission of n2o in the md system chemical denitrification of nitrite coupled to fe ii oxidation has been demonstrated to result in the formation of n2o kampschreur et al 2011 since fe ii oxidation has a nonnegligible chemical reaction in the md system this process may produce more n2o than the heterotrophic denitrification process in our work a higher abundance of norb and nosz which encode no and n2o reductases respectively was observed in the md system compared to the hd system this implies that the md system may emit more n2o enriching more microorganisms with nitrogen oxide reducing capacity the n2o emissions in the hd and md processes were not measured in this work and warrant further investigations this work reveals the feasibility and mechanism of using fe ii as an assisted electron donor for enhancing denitrification and phosphorus removal the findings of this work may provide a practical guide for achieving complete nitrate and phosphate removal while reducing carbon source use conclusions the enhanced simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification system was demonstrated in this work the electron balance results of the reactor operation and batch kinetics in the mixotrophic denitrification system indicate that fe ii could provide electrons as electron donors for nitrate reduction further numerical modeling reveals that biological reactions were dominant in these processes the mixotrophic nrfeox bacterium thermomonas dominated in the mixotrophic denitrification system and exhibited a stronger nitrogen reduction ability this work reveals the feasibility and mechanism of using fe ii as an assisted electron donor for enhancing denitrification and phosphorus removal the findings provide a practical guide for achieving complete nitrate and phosphate removal while reducing carbon source use material and methods experimental setup and bioreactor operation to evaluate the feasibility of denitrification with fe ii as an assisted electron donor in low c n wastewaters cod n 3 two laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors with a working volume of 1 l id 80 mm h 240

liquor suspended solids vss of activity sludge from wangtang municipal wastewater treatment plant hefei china synthetic wastewater was fed into both reactors to mimic wastewater containing per liter

nitrate ferrous sulfate and sodium acetate respectively the influent was purged with n2 gas for 30 min to alleviate the dissolved oxygen effects to explore the effect of cod n on the denitrification

nitrate nitrite and ammonium iron fe ii and total fe and phosphorus phosphate were measured daily in the reactor influent and effluent a series of batch assays were conducted to examine the kinetics of nitrogen reduction and fe ii acetate oxidation in the mixotrophic process the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 4 h and the reactors were operated at 30 2 c the details about the experimental design analytical methods batch tests and numerical modeling are provided in the supplementary materials bioinformatic analysis the functional gene abundance reducing power level and energy status

phosphate removal in the md system kinetics of nitrogen reduction and fe acetate oxidation in the md system to better understand the md process several batch assays were conducted to investigate the kinetics of nitrogen reduction and the fe ii acetate oxidation process at neutral ph fig 2 a and 2b the calculated pseudo first order rate constants k of nitrate reduction are provided in table s1 the k value of nitrate reduction in the md group was higher than that in the hd group within the initial 12 h demonstrating that the presence of fe ii could enhance nitrate reduction in the md system after 12 h acetate was consumed while nitrate was not further reduced in either group although residual fe ii still existed in the md system these results were consistent with previous findings with pure cultures liu et al 2019 mixotrophic nrfeox microorganisms have a precedence order for the utilization of organic and inorganic electron donors they can directly reduce nitrate in the presence of organic electron donors via the heterotrophic pathway while using the coexisting fe ii as inorganic electron donors for nitrate reduction via the autotrophic pathway when only fe ii existed without organic electron donors fe ii could no longer donate electrons for nitrate reduction sodium acetate was used as the electron donor for denitrification and supporting cell growth fig 2c the k value of acetate oxidation in the md group was lower than that in the hd group indicating that fe ii might affect the acetate utilization rate fe ii was decreased from 4 8 mm to 0 4 mm within 30 h fig 2d in the md group the electron balance analysis confirms that fe ii could provide electrons for microbially driven nitrate reduction supplementary materials in other words the microbes in the md system were able to take electrons from fe ii into the cells for denitrification although the denitrification enhancement by fe ii was confirmed the interaction between fe ii and intermediates of nitrogen reduction should be clarified as fe ii could donate electrons for the denitrification process via biological and chemical processes according to the batch test results fig 3 a f reactions 1 3 all followed a first order kinetic reaction which was consistent with previous studies on the nrfeox process in the pure culture system liu et al 2019 from the fitting curves the rate constants for the reduction of nitrate and nitrite and the oxidation of fe ii were calculated and are listed in table 1 at an fe ii concentration of 5 mm the k chem for nitrite was calculated as 1 32 10 5 s 1 which was lower than that of 3 39 10 5 hd group and 2 53 10 5 s 1 md group suggesting that the biological contribution for nitrite reduction was higher than that of chemodenitrification correspondingly the k chem for fe ii was 7 92 10 6 s 1 at 3 mm nitrite control which was close to that of the 7 97 10 6 s 1 md group indicating that both biological and chemical oxidation of fe ii by nitrite played important roles fig 3g and 3h shows the calculated relative contributions of biological and chemical reactions to nitrite reduction and fe ii oxidation under various nitrite fe ii conditions the biological processes played more important roles than the chemical processes in nitrite reduction after the nitrite concentration exceeded 3 mm the relative contribution of the chemodenitrification was greater than that of the biological processes to fe ii oxidation however it should be noted that the model results were closely related to the biomass in the batch test the sludge concentration used in our batch tests was 386 mg l 1 approximately 1 8 of that in the md reactor therefore the contribution of biological reactions may be significantly larger than that of chemical reactions in uasbs microbial analysis of the md system biodenitrification includes a series of nitrogen reductases that convert nitrate to nitrite then nitrous oxide and finally to nitrogen which is driven by electron generation transport and consumption among the biodenitrification processes nadh is considered to be the primary electron donor for the heterotrophic process which is generated through the metabolism of organics and then oxidized to nad by complex i and donated electrons to electron transport chains the nadh nad ratio indicates the turnover rate of electrons reflecting the reducing power level of the heterotrophic processes li et al 2016a as shown in fig 4 a the difference in nadh nad between the heterotrophic and mixotrophic systems was not significant which is consistent with the cod electron utilization efficiency reported in the long term reactor operation suggesting that the reducing power of the heterotrophic process was not affected by introducing fe ii after long term acclimation accompanied by electron generation a proton gradient was established for the synthesis of atp which provides energy for cell growth cell maintenance and polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis zhang et al 2021 however the atp content of the microbes in the mixotrophic system was 0 26 μmol g 1 vss which was lower than that in the heterotrophic system 0 33 μmol g 1 vss a possible explanation for such a difference might be the microbial detoxification mechanism the nrfeox microbes could utilize efflux pumps to export toxic metal ions and regulate the intracellular iron concentration at the expense of atp to avoid cell damage by iron iii oxyhydr oxide mineral formation carlson et al 2012 for electron transport etsa could reflect the electron transport efficiency for two denitrification processes as shown in fig 4b the etsa value in the hd system was comparable to that in the md system at a cod n ratio of 3 as the cod n was decreased the microbes in the md system presented a significantly higher etsa than those in the hd system indicating that electron transport was enhanced by the presence of fe ii nar and nir are the essential nitrogen reductases for denitrifiers and are responsible for the conversion of nitrate to nitrite and nitrite to no respectively the activities of nar and nir decreased with the decrease in cod n in both the hd and md systems suggesting that the key denitrification enzyme activities were closely related to the organic substrate concentration even in the md system fig 4c the activity of nar in the md system was higher than that in the hd system especially at a cod n ratio of 2 to 3 which is consistent with the reactor operation results of nitrate reduction demonstrating that the nitrate bioreduction process could be improved in the md system similarly the activity of nir in the md system was higher than that in the hd system at a cod n ratio of 3 however as the cod n decreased the nir activity in the md system gradually became lower than that in the hd system it was reported that the presence of fe ii might lead to nitrite accumulation in the pure culture system due to the potential interaction with nitrite reducing enzymes in the periplasm peng et al 2018 however there was no obvious nitrite accumulation difference between the md and hd groups which might be due to the combination of biological and chemical reactions the presence of functional genes for nitrogen metabolic pathways in the two systems was further confirmed by qpcr the abundances of narg norb and nosz in md were significantly higher than those in the hd system indicating a higher abundance of denitrifiers in the md system than in the hd system fig 4d evolution of the microbial community profiles nrfeox capable microbes are abundant in iron containing sediments and play a critical role in the natural fe and n cycles melton et al 2014 however it is still unclear how the microbial community structure changes when mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria are applied for nitrate containing wastewater treatment the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that the hd system was dominated by ralstonia and thauera with relative abundances of 20 4 and 5 7 respectively which were reported to be typical acetate fed denitrifiers fig 5 a and 5b miao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 for the md system thermomonas dominated and gradually increased in abundance as the cod n decreased reaching 60 2 at a cod n ratio of 1 additionally the abundance of rhodanobacter and geothrix increased and peaked at a cod n of 2 with 11 4 and 6 4 respectively thermomonas strains were obviously enriched in various types of bioreactors containing fe and nitrogen wastewater treatment such as nitrate polluted groundwater acid mine drainage and coal gasification wastewater hou et al 2020 zhang et al 2018b an isolated thermomonas strain brg3 was observed to have the capacity to couple fe ii oxidation and denitrification in the presence of an organic co substrate zhang et al 2018a in addition some species in thermomonas isolated from the denitrification reactor possess the ability of heterotrophic denitrification mergaert et al 2003 however it was also reported that thermomonas was identified with an autotrophic metabolic pathway by dna based stable isotope probing in the mixotrophic denitrification system xing et al 2018 therefore such a high abundance of thermomonans in the md system indicates that it was possibly a mixotrophic nrfeox bacterium which was highly associated with fe ii oxidation and could play a prominent role in denitrification rhodanobacter and geothrix were also reported to exist in the flanking community of the autotrophic nrfeox system species of rhodanobacter are considered acid tolerant denitrifiers that can use carboxylic acids and amino acids as energy and carbon sources to reduce nitrate lee et al 2007 a metagenomic study shows that they have all genes necessary for complete denitrification he et al 2016 and may play a detoxification role reducing toxic no to n2 in the nrfeox process tominski et al 2018 geothrix is recognized as an iron reducing bacterium that can reduce fe iii to fe ii lovley 2006 the high abundance of geothrix suggests that it might construct a cryptic cycle between the iron oxide produced by nrfeox and fe ii in addition geothrix was found to release electron shuttling compounds that can transfer electrons from the cell to fe iii oxide nevin and lovley 2002 geothrix could promote the fe n cycle in the system by enhancing lepidocrocite bioreduction o loughlin 2008 this could be responsible for the increase in etsa in the md system which resulted in the enhanced denitrification performance wang et al 2022 the typically dominant autotrophic nrfeox bacteria like gallionellaceae found in autotrophic fe ii denitrification reactors were not enriched in the md system indicating that the denitrification enhancement in the md system was not caused by the autotrophic nrfeox bacteria an interesting finding was that the whole community structure of the md system was similar to the flanking community structure of the autotrophic denitrification system tian et al 2020b but there was a large difference in the abundance these results may indicate that a similar md process also existed in the iron autotrophic denitrification system the metabolic pathways were predicted by picrust to further investigate the interactions in the microbial community fig 5c the abundance of functional enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism showed a significant difference between the hd and md systems the forecasted abundance of nitrate reductase nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase in the md system was higher than that in the hd system which is consistent with the qpcr results discussion the enhanced nitrate and phosphate removal by coupling fe ii with a carbon source was verified in this work previous studies and our batch and numerical modeling results imply that fe ii might be used as an electron donor in the denitrification process in which the biological process plays a vital role accordingly fig s2 illustrates the possible mechanisms of the denitrification process in the md system including biological electron supply biological electron consumption and chemodenitrification enriched functional nrfeox bacteria thermomonas may possess the lithotrophic electron pathway and can take up electrons from fe ii into cells meanwhile they have organotrophic electron pathways for synchronous acquisition of electrons from organic and inorganic electron donors for denitrification compared to heterotrophic denitrifiers mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria can supply more electrons to complete the denitrification process due to their broad spectrum of substrate utilization in addition biodenitrification is accomplished through a series of intracellular reductions driven by electron transport and consumption wan et al 2016 the activities of nitrogen reductases were enhanced in the md system suggesting that nrfeox bacteria exhibited a stronger denitrification capacity moreover a synergistic symbiotic relationship between autotrophic and heterotrophic microorganisms within the md system such as what exists in the iron autotrophic denitrification system may also play an important role in the denitrification process autotrophic microorganisms with iron oxidation capacity may produce some metabolic intermediates that can be further used as electron donors for heterotrophic denitrifiers thus promoting the completion of the denitrification process xing et al 2018 the fe assisted mixotrophic denitrification system offers a potential alternative over the current heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification and achieves simultaneous phosphorus removal first using fe ii as an assisted electron donor can reduce the demand for organic carbon sources while enhancing the denitrification performance compared to sulfur autotrophic mixotrophic denitrification the use of dissolved fe ii allows for an improved electron utilization efficiency and precise dosing avoiding the low utilization efficiency caused by the low solubility of monomeric sulfur second the md system can achieve a faster start up and relatively higher biomass retention in the reactor than the autotrophic denitrification system the slower growth rate of the functional microorganisms in autotrophic denitrification systems is one of the main reasons for the long reactor start up time heterotrophic or mixotrophic microorganisms grow faster than autotrophic microorganisms and therefore can shorten the start up time and maintain a relatively high level of biomass in the reactor novák et al 1994 third the ph in md systems is relatively stable at the near neutral range without additional adjustment the ph ranged from 6 4 to 6 9 in the md system while the ph was alkaline 7 7 to 8 4 in the hd system the alkalinity produced by the heterotrophic process could be neutralized by h generated in fe ii oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction and could keep the solution in the near neutral range alleviating the adverse effects on microbial metabolism caused by ph change sahinkaya and dursun 2012 additionally the md system is a more cost effective option than the hd system the price of feso4 technical grade was approximately 85 t 1 much less than the typical carbon source for denitrification such as glucose 460 t 1 sodium acetate 1200 t 1 market quotes in december 2022 china our results show that the mass ratio of ferrous addition to nitrate removal was about 20 the heterotrophic denitrification system required a carbon nitrogen ratio of about 6 for complete nitrate removal therefore the cost of fe ii to remove 1 kg of nitrate nitrogen was estimated to be 1 7 which was lower than glucose 2 8 and sodium acetate 9 2 adopting fe ii as the assisted electron donor can alleviate the excessive costs caused by carbon source the amount of fe ii required in the md system is also lower than that in the fe autotrophic denitrification system resulting in less iron sludge production and further reducing the costs required for iron sludge disposal finally the md system can achieve simultaneous removal of phosphorus and has the potential to remove other pollutants such as heavy metals it was reported that precipitates such as lepidocrocite produced in the nrfeox process can be efficient adsorbents for arsenic park et al 2018 although the md system offers several advantages several challenges need to be properly addressed for future development one concern is the cell encrustation induced by fe iii mineral formation in previous studies on mixotrophic nrfeox bacteria fe iii minerals were found to be formed in the pericellular and cytoplasmic areas leading to a decrease in the microbial metabolic activity and even to cell death klueglein et al 2014 therefore there is a risk that the md system can fail however in our work the md reactor was operated stably for more than six months and the sludge concentration kept stabilized at approximately 4000 mg l 1 of vss this result implies that there might be a dynamic balance between the microbial growth and mortality due to cell encrustation in the md system another concern is the unclear emission of n2o in the md system chemical denitrification of nitrite coupled to fe ii oxidation has been demonstrated to result in the formation of n2o kampschreur et al 2011 since fe ii oxidation has a nonnegligible chemical reaction in the md system this process may produce more n2o than the heterotrophic denitrification process in our work a higher abundance of norb and nosz which encode no and n2o reductases respectively was observed in the md system compared to the hd system this implies that the md system may emit more n2o enriching more microorganisms with nitrogen oxide reducing capacity the n2o emissions in the hd and md processes were not measured in this work and warrant further investigations this work reveals the feasibility and mechanism of using fe ii as an assisted electron donor for enhancing denitrification and phosphorus removal the findings of this work may provide a practical guide for achieving complete nitrate and phosphate removal while reducing carbon source use conclusions the enhanced simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in the iron assisted mixotrophic denitrification system was demonstrated in this work the electron balance results of the reactor operation and batch kinetics in the mixotrophic denitrification system indicate that fe ii could provide electrons as electron donors for nitrate reduction further numerical modeling reveals that biological reactions were dominant in these processes the mixotrophic nrfeox bacterium thermomonas dominated in the mixotrophic denitrification system and exhibited a stronger nitrogen reduction ability this work reveals the feasibility and mechanism of using fe ii as an assisted electron donor for enhancing denitrification and phosphorus removal the findings provide a practical guide for achieving complete nitrate and phosphate removal while reducing carbon source use material and methods experimental setup and bioreactor operation to evaluate the feasibility of denitrification with fe ii as an assisted electron donor in low c n wastewaters cod n 3 two laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors with a working volume of 1 l id 80 mm h 240

liquor suspended solids vss of activity sludge from wangtang municipal wastewater treatment plant hefei china synthetic wastewater was fed into both reactors to mimic wastewater containing per liter

nitrate ferrous sulfate and sodium acetate respectively the influent was purged with n2 gas for 30 min to alleviate the dissolved oxygen effects to explore the effect of cod n on the denitrification

19906,members of the genus tetrasphaera are putative polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that have been found in greater abundance than accumulibacter in many full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr wastewater treatment plants worldwide nevertheless previous studies on the effect of environmental conditions such as ph on the performance of ebpr have focused mainly on the response of accumulibacter to ph changes this study examines the impact of ph on a tetrasphaera pao enriched culture over a ph range from 6 0 to 8 0 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions to assess its impact on the stoichiometry and kinetics of tetrasphaera metabolism it was discovered that the rates of phosphorus p uptake and p release increased with an increase of ph within the tested range while pha production glycogen consumption and substrate uptake rate were less sensitive to ph changes the results suggest that tetrasphaera paos display kinetic advantages at high ph levels which is consistent with what has been observed previously for accumulibacter paos the results of this study show that ph has a substantial impact on the p release and uptake kinetics of paos where the p release rate was 3 times higher and the p uptake rate was 2 times higher at ph 8 0 vs ph 6 0 respectively process operational strategies promoting both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter activity at high ph do not conflict with each other but lead to a potentially synergistic impact that can benefit ebpr performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos accumulibacter tetrasphaera amino acids polyhydroxyalkanoate pha data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr technology is a sustainable and cost effective p removal process within wastewater treatment plants wwtps it relies on cyclic anaerobic and aerobic conditions to select for polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao that accumulate p in excess of metabolic requirements storing it intracellularly as polyphosphate the most well known pao is candidatus accumumlibacter however increased attention has been placed on a promising putative pao group tetrasphaera many full scale wwtps especially those employing sidestream fermentation have detected higher tetrasphaera abundances up to 35 in biomass than typical accumulibacter levels onnis hayden et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 tetrasphaera is able to take up diverse organics such as amino acids and or glucose and store these in various forms or produce other fermentation products such as volatile fatty acids vfas kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 2011 these storage products can provide carbon and energy sources for aerobic p uptake tetrasphaera can supply vfas anaerobically for other paos herbst et al 2019 nguyen et al 2015 allowing a synergistic interaction of organisms for p removal anaerobic pha synthesis by tetrasphaera was originally believed to be insignificant but has since been found to be dependant on the tetrasphaera clade composition close et al 2021 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 fernando et al 2019 showed that while accumulibacter have a higher specific p removal capacity high tetrasphaera abundances can lead to 50 of the p removal in full scale wwtps accumulibacter metabolism and physiology have been well established but tetrasphaera metabolism and its response to different ebpr operational conditions are less understood liu et al 2019 rubio rincón et al 2019b indeed tetrasphaera have a versatile physiology and a significantly different metabolism to accumulibacter operational and environmental conditions can also affect tetrasphaera abundance and metabolism barnard et al 2017 herbst et al 2019 onnis hayden et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 rey martínez et al 2019 improved understanding of tetrasphaera is needed to better optimise ebpr including understanding their response to operational conditions domestic and industrial wastewaters contain varying chemicals and compounds that may each influence the ph furthermore ph is a dynamic parameter that is impacted by multiple biological processes in wwtps the extracellular ph can influence the performance of ebpr systems significantly including the anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake rates as well as the p release to carbon uptake ratio bond et al 1999 chen and gu 2006 filipe et al 2001a 2001b d jeon et al 2001 pijuan et al 2004 smolders et al 1994 liu et al 1996 in some sequencing batch reactor sbr studies p removal deterioration has been linked with low ph zheng et al 2014 several studies showed that elevated ph 7 25 benefits paos over their primary putative competitors the glycogen accumulating organisms gaos improving ebpr performance filipe et al 2001a oehmen et al 2005 schuler and jenkins 2002 the aforementioned ebpr studies fed vfas as the sole carbon source which leads to the enrichment of accumulibacter whereby the impact of ph on tetrasphaera is unknown and represents a significant research gap for ebpr low affinity pit phosphate transporters that drive vfa uptake in accumulibacter have also been found in tetrasphaera herbst et al 2019 this could suggest that extracellular ph may also affect tetrasphaera carbon uptake and p release uptake mechanisms considering the high abundance of tetrasphaera in full scale ebpr plants and ph dynamics in wwtps it is important to understand the ph impact on tetrasphaera metabolism to evaluate its impact on ebpr performance this allows a more complete assessment of ebpr as well as optimisation and retrofitting of wwtps for more effective phosphorus removal and subsequent recovery thus the objective of the present study is to investigate the ph effect on tetrasphaera and its impact on the anaerobic and aerobic metabolism and kinetics in an ebpr process 2 results and discussion 2 1 sbr performance the tetrasphaera sbr was fed with cas aa as the sole carbon source and was operated for about a two month period prior to the batch tests at different ph levels the purpose of this period was to ensure a good and stable reactor performance with a p removal efficiency of 77 7 10 1 from day 50 onwards fig 1 this performance was maintained consistently in the sbr until the end of the study and could therefore be considered as steady state operation the typical organic carbon consumption pha glycogen and phosphorus profiles of the sbr are shown in fig 2 while the anaerobic and aerobic activity across multiple cycles of operation is shown in table s2 where it is compared with literature studies in order to provide a basis for comparison with previous tetrasphaera enrichments the enriched culture displayed the traditional pao phenotype of p release glycogen hydrolysis pha synthesis and organic carbon uptake during the slow feeding period of the anaerobic phase followed by p uptake glycogen formation and pha degradation in the aerobic phase note that the slow feeding period of the sbr led to a net increase in toc over time in the anaerobic phase fig 2 from table s2 the anaerobic p release c uptake ratio observed in this study was consistent with marques et al 2017 higher than close et al 2021 and lower than typical accumulibacter results table s2 a lower p release c uptake ratio in these and other tetrasphaera studies as compared to accumulibacter studies is commonly observed kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 nielsen et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 suggesting that tetrasphaera may require less atp from poly p hydrolysis for anaerobic c uptake furthermore the higher abundance of accumulibacter found in the tetrasphaera enrichments of this study table 1 see section 2 2 for detailed analysis of the microbial community and marques et al 2017 as compared to close et al 2021 likely contributed to the comparatively higher p release c uptake ratios in the aerobic phase 2 45 0 57 p mmol l of phosphate was taken up which is close to results from accumulibacter 2 20 to 2 50 p mmol l and much greater than the study of close et al 2021 which only reported 0 96 0 39 p mmol l of p uptake while marques et al 2017 found 1 76 0 25 p mmol l of aerobic p uptake it is notable that enrichments of tetrasphaera that contain some accumulibacter this study marques et al 2017 have shown appreciably better p removal performance as compared to cultures that are highly enriched in tetrasphaera alone without accumulibacter close et al 2021 this result supports the hypothesis that enrichment of multiple pao groups is indeed beneficial for ebpr performance despite the similar operational conditions applied to the enrichment sbr in each case determining factors that cause a shift in tetrasphaera clades were unclear and were beyond the scope of the present study further research is warranted to better understand the cause of population shifts within this group of paos as shown in table s1 higher average glycogen consumption c uptake 0 51 0 17 c mmol c mmol and pha production c uptake 0 52 0 13 c mmol c mmol were observed as compared to those obtained in the study of close et al 2021 and marques et al 2017 a similar level of glycogen production hydrolysis but a lower level of pha accumulation per carbon mole uptake were observed as compared with previous accumulibacter studies table s1 the higher pha storage by the present enriched culture could be due to either a higher fraction of pha storing tetrasphaera a higher accumulibacter fraction or both see section 2 2 for analysis of the microbial community through fish analysis tet2 174 25 50 and tet3 654 50 were the two most abundant tetrasphaera clades in this study while close et al 2021 mainly found tet2 892 59 5 10 7 and tet3 654 24 1 4 9 and marques et al 2017 found tet1 266 38 5 1 4 and tet3 654 31 0 4 3 close et al 2021 proposed that pha storing tetrasphaera may be more prominent within clade 2 which is consistent with the results of this study also accumulibacter has a higher pha production substrate uptake ratio table s2 than tetrasphaera accumulibacter abundance is 25 45 in this study which is higher than the 22 observed by marques et al 2017 and the 0 5 observed by close et al 2021 the high fraction of accumulibacter in this study is also likely to have contributed to the higher pha storage the nature of the carbon source casein hydrolysate in this study fed to the sbr is known to have a significant influence on pha storage by paos where a much higher pha storage is observed through the uptake of vfas such as acetate and propionate marques et al 2017 as also shown in table s1 phv was the most produced fraction of pha accounting for 74 7 6 3 whereas the amount of phb formed was only 25 3 6 3 a similar pha fractionation was reported in marques et al 2017 which also showed the presence of some accumulibacter in their tetrasphaera enrichment accumulibacter are known to produce mainly phb from fermentation products such as acetate smolders et al 1994 however phv accounted for 100 of the produced pha in close et al 2021 which had a very high tetrasphaera enrichment without accumulibacter this study supports the hypothesis that phv is the major pha fraction that is produced within tetrasphaera where the observed phb production could be formed by the accumulibacter fraction of the sludge overall the tetrasphaera enriched sbr in this study displayed similar p release and uptake behaviour as compared to previous studies close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 with slightly higher pha and glycogen storage perhaps related to the higher accumulibacter fraction of the present study the consistency of this reactor performance as compared to literature suggests a successfully enriched tetrasphaera reactor culture that was suitable for subsequent analysis of the impact of ph on their anaerobic and aerobic stoichiometry and kinetics 2 2 microbial analysis semi quantitative fish analysis indicated the presence of both pao groups tetrasphaera and accumulibacter in the enriched culture as shown in table 1 fish samples were analysed from the enrichment reactor during the batch experiment period day 65 and day 101 as well as from samples taken during the batch tests at the end of the batch tests figure s1 shows representative fish images of the most dominant paos observed from fish analysis tetrasphaera comprises a volume fraction of 50 of the total bacterial biovolume table 1 and figure s1 which was slightly higher than the values observed with high throughput sequencing 37 43 5 of the total 16s rrna gene reads analysed corresponded to tetrasphaera see table 2 within all organisms observed through 16s rrna gene sequencing tetrasphaera represented the largest group thus both fish and 16s rrna analysis indicate that tetrasphaera dominated the sbr culture and batch tests the dynamics of tetrasphaera abundance was relatively low in this work as compared to the dynamics observed in most biological wastewater treatment studies with only some fluctuation observed between the batch tests using probe tet3 654 according to fish the average volume fraction of accumulibacter was 25 to 45 biovolume from fish analysis marques et al 2017 had previously detected 22 accumulibacter in an enriched tetrasphaera culture also fed with amino acids as the carbon source it is likely that accumulibacter can survive on fermentation products such as vfas that have been found to be produced by tetrasphaera under anaerobic conditions close et al 2021 herbst et al 2019 kong et al 2008 nguyen et al 2015 nielsen et al 2012 from high throughput sequencing results gaos from the genus propionivibrio were detected at 2 1 2 4 of the microbial community table 2 semi quantitative fish analysis results showed a similar estimate constituting 5 of the biovolume data not shown propionivibrio is commonly observed in full scale ebpr plants at a similar level constituting up to 3 of the microbial community albertsen et al 2016 notably high throughput sequencing data revealed a much lower abundance of accumulibacter than was indicated by fish analysis tables 1 and 2 discrepancies between results from the amplicon based method and fish analysis have previously been attributed to i inefficient dna extraction prior to high throughput sequencing ii specificity of the fish probes or incomplete probe coverage or iii inconsistencies between biovolume measurements versus relative dna abundance albertsen et al 2012 in particular this tendency has been frequently observed for accumulibacter where the abundance of accumulibacter has been routinely estimated to be lower by sequencing as compared to fish in other ebpr studies carvalho et al 2021 rubio rincón et al 2019b valverde pérez et al 2016 quantitative links between accumulibacter abundance as assessed by fish and their metabolic activity have been well established in engineering related ebpr studies acevedo et al 2012 kolakovic et al 2021 oehmen et al 2010a 2007 rubio rincón et al 2019a tu and schuler 2013 zhang et al 2021 whereas similar quantitative correlations have so far been less established when applying other microbial techniques oehmen et al 2010b although different in absolute numbers both the fish analysis and the 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis showed tetrasphaera were dominant in the enriched sbr around the time of the batch test period moreover the dynamics of the microbial community over the operational period was not substantial suggesting that the microbial community of the enriched sbr was in pseudo steady state 2 3 batch test results at different ph levels anaerobic aerobic batch assays using casein hydrolysate as the sole c source were performed at different controlled ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 using the sludge from the enriched sbr to investigate the impact of ph on tetrasphaera and their metabolism from figures s2 s6 during the batch tests cas aa was taken up reflected by the decrease of toc which was accompanied by phosphorus release and a small level of glycogen hydrolysis pha was oxidised in the subsequent aerobic phase supplying the c and energy for biomass growth and replenishing the glycogen and polyphosphate pools in the ph range 6 0 8 0 the p release rate increased linearly from 2 56 0 39 to 8 63 0 79 mgp gvss h table 3 and fig 3 f these values were significantly lower than the rates observed with accumulibacter 61 5 to 88 8 mgp gvss h in ph range from 6 5 to 8 5 oehmen et al 2005 accumulibacter also take up organic carbon much quicker than tetrasphaera table 3 this higher rate of anaerobic activity is consistent with previous suggestions that tetrasphaera possess a lower relative ebpr activity than accumulibacter on a per cell basis fernando et al 2019 the substrate uptake pha production and glycogen degradation rates were independent of ph over the range of 6 0 to 8 0 fig 3d 3b and 3c respectively which agreed with studies on paos fed with acetate filipe et al 2001a smolders et al 1994 liu et al 1996 the resulting p release c uptake ratio has a positive correlation with ph fig 3a which was likely because of additional energy requirements for taking up the negatively charged amino acid ions at higher ph against the negative electrical potential of the cells tetrasphaera are also capable of generating energy from the fermentation of amino acids leading to the lower p release to substrate uptake ratios as compared to accumulibacter metabolism that were observed in this study this lower anaerobic p release also leads to a lower demand for storage compound consumption in the aerobic phase to drive p uptake and achieve successful ebpr the linear increase in p release rate as a function of ph coupled with the slight increase in the ratio of glycogen degradation per substrate uptake as a function of ph shows that the energy for amino acid uptake by tetrasphaera relies more on polyphosphate hydrolysis than glycogen degradation as ph increases the main role of glycogen in tetrasphaera metabolism is likely for generating reducing equivalents in order to close the redox balance of the cell close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 the pha substrate uptake ratio was higher in this work as compared to previous studies on tetrasphaera close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 though lower than that typically observed for accumulibacter table 3 the reasons could be attributed to the higher abundance of accumulibacter in this study according to fish as compared to previous studies close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 the low pha production substrate uptake ratio as compared to accumulibacter suggests that pha is not the sole storage compound within tetrasphaera close et al 2021 found that glutamate and aspartate were important storage polymers during amino acid uptake by tetrasphaera similarly to what was observed in anaerobic conditions in aerobic conditions no clear correlation was observed between pha utilization or glycogen production as a function of ph for tetrasphaera table 3 however the results in fig 3e show a clear linear increase in the p uptake rate as ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 for the tetrasphaera enriched culture an increase in p uptake at high ph was also observed in acetate and propionate fed accumulibacter paos between ph 6 5 and 7 5 filipe et al 2001c oehmen et al 2005 van veen et al 1993 have previously proposed that the rate of p release or p uptake in acinetobacter johnsonii was limited by the rate of deprotonation of a protein carrier located on the outside or inside of the cell membrane respectively during the transport of p across the cell membrane the rate of deprotonation of this carrier was proposed to be directly related to ph causing higher p release and uptake rates at higher ph levels in e coli and acinetobacter johnsonii van veen et al 1993 1994 van veen et al 1994 suggested that this ph mechanism impacting p release and uptake may be generally applicable to all types of bacteria giving examples of not only gram negative bacteria such as e coli and acinetobacter johnsonii but also gram positive bacteria such as micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus cereus the increased p release and uptake kinetics as a function of ph found in this study enriched in gram positive tetrasphaera also observed in previous studies focussed on gram negative accumulibacter filipe et al 2001c oehmen et al 2005 is consistent with the hypothesis of van veen et al 1994 and suggests that a similar ph impact on p release uptake could be expected for all paos the net p removal from the batch tests was calculated as the difference between p uptake and p release which revealed a significant increase from ph 6 to ph 8 where 2 08 0 12 p mmol l of net p removal was observed at ph 8 and 1 28 0 04 p mmol l of net p removal was observed at ph 6 for comparison the ph 7 tests showed a net p removal of 1 68 0 05 p mmol l where the tests at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 showed 10 difference as compared to ph 7 as a result reduced net p removal at low ph levels will also reduce the ability of paos to regenerate their polyphosphate pool for substrate uptake under anaerobic conditions and could lead to out competition by other organisms in the system e g gaos 2 4 implications of the study this study demonstrated how the ph affects tetrasphaera metabolism in an enriched culture the p release and uptake kinetics showed a strong dependence on the ph while intracellular pha and glycogen production and carbon source consumption rates were largely independent of ph changes at high ph levels chemical precipitation can potentially be a competing mechanism for p removal however chemical precipitation was considered unlikely to be a significant mechanism of p uptake in this study for two reasons 1 iron and aluminium salts were not present in appreciable quantities within the reactor media iron was only added at micronutrient levels and 2 the p release rate was observed to increase as a function of ph fig 3f as well as the p uptake rate fig 3e whereby a decrease in p release rate at the higher ph level would be expected if chemical precipitation had increased appreciably it is noteworthy that high ph conditions lead to higher rates of p release and uptake in both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter this suggests that high ph can improve the synergistic interaction of tetrasphaera and accumulibacter and enhance ebpr performance while tetrasphaera is capable of contributing to p removal through the anaerobic uptake of sugars and amino acids simultaneously producing fermentation products such as vfa nielsen et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 accumulibacter can survive on these fermentation productions while also contributing to further p removal close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 this promotes functional redundancy decreasing the reliance on only one type of pao to facilitate ebpr which can benefit ebpr process robustness functional redundancy has been previously shown to result in process performance benefits in wastewater treatment in other situations paulo et al 2020 wang et al 2021 high ph has been previously found to benefit paos over gaos filipe et al 2001d oehmen et al 2005 thus a high ph 8 can also lead to multiple benefits to the microbial community composition moreover considering the typical ph profile observed in uncontrolled ebpr processes at lab scale or full scale serafim et al 2002 serralta et al 2004 flores alsina et al 2015 the ph can increase substantially from 7 0 8 0 between the anaerobic and aerobic phases according to the results of this study such a ph profile would result in a nearly optimal aerobic p uptake rate for both pao groups coupled with an anaerobic p release rate that is 30 40 lower than what would have been observed if the ph were maintained at 8 0 anaerobically the typical ph profile in ebpr systems therefore leads to an increased net p removal capacity of the wwtp for both groups of paos further underlying the potential process benefits that can be achieved through selecting both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter overall this study reveals the short term impacts of ph on tetrasphaera kinetics and metabolism high ph can enhance tetrasphaera net p removal and thereby improve ebpr performance maintaining a relatively high ph often achieved without a dedicated ph controller could be a route to ensure efficient p removal however it is still unknown how ph impacts the long term performance and microbial selection of tetrasphaera communities which warrants further study 3 conclusions in this study the effect of ph on anaerobic and aerobic metabolism of an enriched culture of tetrasphaera paos was studied for the first time the p uptake and release rates by the enriched tetrasphaera sludge increased linearly with an increase of ph from 6 to 8 tetrasphaera are capable of taking up different organic carbon sources over a wide range of ph conditions producing fermentation products that can be consumed by accumulibacter high ph improves ebpr effectiveness as tetrasphaera display kinetic advantages at high ph levels similar to accumulibacter the typical ph variations observed in ebpr plants can promote higher net p removal by both groups optimisation of ebpr in wwtps may benefit from strategies that support a robust community of both accumulibacter and tetrasphaera experiencing a positive synergy between the two pao groups 4 materials and methods 4 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr for tetrasphaera enrichment a tetrasphaera pao culture was enriched in a laboratory scale anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 2 l the sbr was inoculated with biomass that was already enriched in tetrasphaera paos close et al 2021 the sbr was operated with an 8 h cycle which consisted of an initial anaerobic period of 4 h followed by a settling decanting period of 1 hour and an aerobic period of 3 h at the end of the decant phase 1 l of the supernatant was withdrawn from the sbr within 10 mins 400 ml of synthetic medium named

was composed of k2hpo4 84 2 mgp l and kh2po4 65 8 mgp l where 600 ml of solution b 150 mgp l was fed into the sbr during the first 2 min of the aerobic phase the reactor had a hydraulic retention time hrt of 16 h and 100 ml sludge was removed from the reactor during 1 min of each day resulting in a sludge retention time srt of 20 d around 0 2 ml min argon was bubbled into the sbr to maintain anaerobic conditions while 0 5 l min air was bubbled during the aerobic phase the reactor temperature was maintained at 20 1 c and the ph was at 7 1 0 1 by dosing 0 1 m hcl the sludge was mixed at 300 rpm stirring during the anaerobic and aerobic phases the reactor performance was assessed biologically and chemically see section 4 3 sbr dynamics were analysed by cycle studies where samples were

analysing total suspended solids tss and volatile suspended solids vss fluorescence in situ hybridisation fish and high throughput sequencing analyses were also performed to assess the microbial community dynamics 4 2 sbr batch experiments to study the impact of ph on tetrasphaera pao metabolism and kinetics under anaerobic and aerobic conditions batch experiments were carried out in duplicate on the sludge enriched in the sbr duplicated batch tests were performed for each ph ranging between 6 and 8 following experimental conditions similar to those applied for the sbr enrichment but at different controlled ph setpoints sludge for the batch experiments was taken from the enriched sbr during a period when high and stable p removal occurred from day 59 to day 93 the sludge was not returned to the parent sbr after finishing each experiment to avoid influencing the parent sbr due to the limitation of the sludge volume of the parent sbr the batch tests were performed sequentially on a weekly basis during this period the average p removal was 80 12 the batch tests were performed with 500 ml of working volume at 20 c for each batch test a 400 ml sample of mixed liquor was taken from the enriched sbr at the end of the aerobic stage when the cells have accumulated most of the phosphate the sludge was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of the aforementioned solution a without cas aa argon was bubbled to ensure anaerobic conditions prior to feeding of the carbon source the pellet was inoculated into the reactor followed by additions of 150 ml of phosphorus solution b and 100 ml of cas aa solution resulting in an initial concentration of 45 ppm of p po4 3 and 5 c mmol l respectively the temperature was maintained by a water bath at 20 1 c with the stirring rate at 300 rpm the ph of the reactor was controlled to the respective fixed setpoint 0 1 ph units by addition of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh when the ph values were above below the targeted ph values respectively the batch reactors were operated with a cycle of 8 h consisting of an anaerobic 4 h followed by a settling decant period 1 h and an aerobic phase 3 h similarly to the parent sbr to prevent any organic carbon entering the aerobic phase the reactor content was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at the end of the anaerobic phases then the pellet was resuspended again in mineral medium i e solution a but without carbon source water and the phosphorus media of solution b with a volume proportion of 2 5 1 1 5 respectively to mimic the media proportions of the anaerobic phase samples were taken at various points throughout the cycle and analysed by the chemical methods described in section 4 3 including fish sampling

19906,members of the genus tetrasphaera are putative polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos that have been found in greater abundance than accumulibacter in many full scale enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr wastewater treatment plants worldwide nevertheless previous studies on the effect of environmental conditions such as ph on the performance of ebpr have focused mainly on the response of accumulibacter to ph changes this study examines the impact of ph on a tetrasphaera pao enriched culture over a ph range from 6 0 to 8 0 under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions to assess its impact on the stoichiometry and kinetics of tetrasphaera metabolism it was discovered that the rates of phosphorus p uptake and p release increased with an increase of ph within the tested range while pha production glycogen consumption and substrate uptake rate were less sensitive to ph changes the results suggest that tetrasphaera paos display kinetic advantages at high ph levels which is consistent with what has been observed previously for accumulibacter paos the results of this study show that ph has a substantial impact on the p release and uptake kinetics of paos where the p release rate was 3 times higher and the p uptake rate was 2 times higher at ph 8 0 vs ph 6 0 respectively process operational strategies promoting both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter activity at high ph do not conflict with each other but lead to a potentially synergistic impact that can benefit ebpr performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos accumulibacter tetrasphaera amino acids polyhydroxyalkanoate pha data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr technology is a sustainable and cost effective p removal process within wastewater treatment plants wwtps it relies on cyclic anaerobic and aerobic conditions to select for polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao that accumulate p in excess of metabolic requirements storing it intracellularly as polyphosphate the most well known pao is candidatus accumumlibacter however increased attention has been placed on a promising putative pao group tetrasphaera many full scale wwtps especially those employing sidestream fermentation have detected higher tetrasphaera abundances up to 35 in biomass than typical accumulibacter levels onnis hayden et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 tetrasphaera is able to take up diverse organics such as amino acids and or glucose and store these in various forms or produce other fermentation products such as volatile fatty acids vfas kong et al 2005 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 2011 these storage products can provide carbon and energy sources for aerobic p uptake tetrasphaera can supply vfas anaerobically for other paos herbst et al 2019 nguyen et al 2015 allowing a synergistic interaction of organisms for p removal anaerobic pha synthesis by tetrasphaera was originally believed to be insignificant but has since been found to be dependant on the tetrasphaera clade composition close et al 2021 kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 fernando et al 2019 showed that while accumulibacter have a higher specific p removal capacity high tetrasphaera abundances can lead to 50 of the p removal in full scale wwtps accumulibacter metabolism and physiology have been well established but tetrasphaera metabolism and its response to different ebpr operational conditions are less understood liu et al 2019 rubio rincón et al 2019b indeed tetrasphaera have a versatile physiology and a significantly different metabolism to accumulibacter operational and environmental conditions can also affect tetrasphaera abundance and metabolism barnard et al 2017 herbst et al 2019 onnis hayden et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 rey martínez et al 2019 improved understanding of tetrasphaera is needed to better optimise ebpr including understanding their response to operational conditions domestic and industrial wastewaters contain varying chemicals and compounds that may each influence the ph furthermore ph is a dynamic parameter that is impacted by multiple biological processes in wwtps the extracellular ph can influence the performance of ebpr systems significantly including the anaerobic p release and aerobic p uptake rates as well as the p release to carbon uptake ratio bond et al 1999 chen and gu 2006 filipe et al 2001a 2001b d jeon et al 2001 pijuan et al 2004 smolders et al 1994 liu et al 1996 in some sequencing batch reactor sbr studies p removal deterioration has been linked with low ph zheng et al 2014 several studies showed that elevated ph 7 25 benefits paos over their primary putative competitors the glycogen accumulating organisms gaos improving ebpr performance filipe et al 2001a oehmen et al 2005 schuler and jenkins 2002 the aforementioned ebpr studies fed vfas as the sole carbon source which leads to the enrichment of accumulibacter whereby the impact of ph on tetrasphaera is unknown and represents a significant research gap for ebpr low affinity pit phosphate transporters that drive vfa uptake in accumulibacter have also been found in tetrasphaera herbst et al 2019 this could suggest that extracellular ph may also affect tetrasphaera carbon uptake and p release uptake mechanisms considering the high abundance of tetrasphaera in full scale ebpr plants and ph dynamics in wwtps it is important to understand the ph impact on tetrasphaera metabolism to evaluate its impact on ebpr performance this allows a more complete assessment of ebpr as well as optimisation and retrofitting of wwtps for more effective phosphorus removal and subsequent recovery thus the objective of the present study is to investigate the ph effect on tetrasphaera and its impact on the anaerobic and aerobic metabolism and kinetics in an ebpr process 2 results and discussion 2 1 sbr performance the tetrasphaera sbr was fed with cas aa as the sole carbon source and was operated for about a two month period prior to the batch tests at different ph levels the purpose of this period was to ensure a good and stable reactor performance with a p removal efficiency of 77 7 10 1 from day 50 onwards fig 1 this performance was maintained consistently in the sbr until the end of the study and could therefore be considered as steady state operation the typical organic carbon consumption pha glycogen and phosphorus profiles of the sbr are shown in fig 2 while the anaerobic and aerobic activity across multiple cycles of operation is shown in table s2 where it is compared with literature studies in order to provide a basis for comparison with previous tetrasphaera enrichments the enriched culture displayed the traditional pao phenotype of p release glycogen hydrolysis pha synthesis and organic carbon uptake during the slow feeding period of the anaerobic phase followed by p uptake glycogen formation and pha degradation in the aerobic phase note that the slow feeding period of the sbr led to a net increase in toc over time in the anaerobic phase fig 2 from table s2 the anaerobic p release c uptake ratio observed in this study was consistent with marques et al 2017 higher than close et al 2021 and lower than typical accumulibacter results table s2 a lower p release c uptake ratio in these and other tetrasphaera studies as compared to accumulibacter studies is commonly observed kristiansen et al 2013 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 nielsen et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 suggesting that tetrasphaera may require less atp from poly p hydrolysis for anaerobic c uptake furthermore the higher abundance of accumulibacter found in the tetrasphaera enrichments of this study table 1 see section 2 2 for detailed analysis of the microbial community and marques et al 2017 as compared to close et al 2021 likely contributed to the comparatively higher p release c uptake ratios in the aerobic phase 2 45 0 57 p mmol l of phosphate was taken up which is close to results from accumulibacter 2 20 to 2 50 p mmol l and much greater than the study of close et al 2021 which only reported 0 96 0 39 p mmol l of p uptake while marques et al 2017 found 1 76 0 25 p mmol l of aerobic p uptake it is notable that enrichments of tetrasphaera that contain some accumulibacter this study marques et al 2017 have shown appreciably better p removal performance as compared to cultures that are highly enriched in tetrasphaera alone without accumulibacter close et al 2021 this result supports the hypothesis that enrichment of multiple pao groups is indeed beneficial for ebpr performance despite the similar operational conditions applied to the enrichment sbr in each case determining factors that cause a shift in tetrasphaera clades were unclear and were beyond the scope of the present study further research is warranted to better understand the cause of population shifts within this group of paos as shown in table s1 higher average glycogen consumption c uptake 0 51 0 17 c mmol c mmol and pha production c uptake 0 52 0 13 c mmol c mmol were observed as compared to those obtained in the study of close et al 2021 and marques et al 2017 a similar level of glycogen production hydrolysis but a lower level of pha accumulation per carbon mole uptake were observed as compared with previous accumulibacter studies table s1 the higher pha storage by the present enriched culture could be due to either a higher fraction of pha storing tetrasphaera a higher accumulibacter fraction or both see section 2 2 for analysis of the microbial community through fish analysis tet2 174 25 50 and tet3 654 50 were the two most abundant tetrasphaera clades in this study while close et al 2021 mainly found tet2 892 59 5 10 7 and tet3 654 24 1 4 9 and marques et al 2017 found tet1 266 38 5 1 4 and tet3 654 31 0 4 3 close et al 2021 proposed that pha storing tetrasphaera may be more prominent within clade 2 which is consistent with the results of this study also accumulibacter has a higher pha production substrate uptake ratio table s2 than tetrasphaera accumulibacter abundance is 25 45 in this study which is higher than the 22 observed by marques et al 2017 and the 0 5 observed by close et al 2021 the high fraction of accumulibacter in this study is also likely to have contributed to the higher pha storage the nature of the carbon source casein hydrolysate in this study fed to the sbr is known to have a significant influence on pha storage by paos where a much higher pha storage is observed through the uptake of vfas such as acetate and propionate marques et al 2017 as also shown in table s1 phv was the most produced fraction of pha accounting for 74 7 6 3 whereas the amount of phb formed was only 25 3 6 3 a similar pha fractionation was reported in marques et al 2017 which also showed the presence of some accumulibacter in their tetrasphaera enrichment accumulibacter are known to produce mainly phb from fermentation products such as acetate smolders et al 1994 however phv accounted for 100 of the produced pha in close et al 2021 which had a very high tetrasphaera enrichment without accumulibacter this study supports the hypothesis that phv is the major pha fraction that is produced within tetrasphaera where the observed phb production could be formed by the accumulibacter fraction of the sludge overall the tetrasphaera enriched sbr in this study displayed similar p release and uptake behaviour as compared to previous studies close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 with slightly higher pha and glycogen storage perhaps related to the higher accumulibacter fraction of the present study the consistency of this reactor performance as compared to literature suggests a successfully enriched tetrasphaera reactor culture that was suitable for subsequent analysis of the impact of ph on their anaerobic and aerobic stoichiometry and kinetics 2 2 microbial analysis semi quantitative fish analysis indicated the presence of both pao groups tetrasphaera and accumulibacter in the enriched culture as shown in table 1 fish samples were analysed from the enrichment reactor during the batch experiment period day 65 and day 101 as well as from samples taken during the batch tests at the end of the batch tests figure s1 shows representative fish images of the most dominant paos observed from fish analysis tetrasphaera comprises a volume fraction of 50 of the total bacterial biovolume table 1 and figure s1 which was slightly higher than the values observed with high throughput sequencing 37 43 5 of the total 16s rrna gene reads analysed corresponded to tetrasphaera see table 2 within all organisms observed through 16s rrna gene sequencing tetrasphaera represented the largest group thus both fish and 16s rrna analysis indicate that tetrasphaera dominated the sbr culture and batch tests the dynamics of tetrasphaera abundance was relatively low in this work as compared to the dynamics observed in most biological wastewater treatment studies with only some fluctuation observed between the batch tests using probe tet3 654 according to fish the average volume fraction of accumulibacter was 25 to 45 biovolume from fish analysis marques et al 2017 had previously detected 22 accumulibacter in an enriched tetrasphaera culture also fed with amino acids as the carbon source it is likely that accumulibacter can survive on fermentation products such as vfas that have been found to be produced by tetrasphaera under anaerobic conditions close et al 2021 herbst et al 2019 kong et al 2008 nguyen et al 2015 nielsen et al 2012 from high throughput sequencing results gaos from the genus propionivibrio were detected at 2 1 2 4 of the microbial community table 2 semi quantitative fish analysis results showed a similar estimate constituting 5 of the biovolume data not shown propionivibrio is commonly observed in full scale ebpr plants at a similar level constituting up to 3 of the microbial community albertsen et al 2016 notably high throughput sequencing data revealed a much lower abundance of accumulibacter than was indicated by fish analysis tables 1 and 2 discrepancies between results from the amplicon based method and fish analysis have previously been attributed to i inefficient dna extraction prior to high throughput sequencing ii specificity of the fish probes or incomplete probe coverage or iii inconsistencies between biovolume measurements versus relative dna abundance albertsen et al 2012 in particular this tendency has been frequently observed for accumulibacter where the abundance of accumulibacter has been routinely estimated to be lower by sequencing as compared to fish in other ebpr studies carvalho et al 2021 rubio rincón et al 2019b valverde pérez et al 2016 quantitative links between accumulibacter abundance as assessed by fish and their metabolic activity have been well established in engineering related ebpr studies acevedo et al 2012 kolakovic et al 2021 oehmen et al 2010a 2007 rubio rincón et al 2019a tu and schuler 2013 zhang et al 2021 whereas similar quantitative correlations have so far been less established when applying other microbial techniques oehmen et al 2010b although different in absolute numbers both the fish analysis and the 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis showed tetrasphaera were dominant in the enriched sbr around the time of the batch test period moreover the dynamics of the microbial community over the operational period was not substantial suggesting that the microbial community of the enriched sbr was in pseudo steady state 2 3 batch test results at different ph levels anaerobic aerobic batch assays using casein hydrolysate as the sole c source were performed at different controlled ph values ranging from 6 0 to 8 0 using the sludge from the enriched sbr to investigate the impact of ph on tetrasphaera and their metabolism from figures s2 s6 during the batch tests cas aa was taken up reflected by the decrease of toc which was accompanied by phosphorus release and a small level of glycogen hydrolysis pha was oxidised in the subsequent aerobic phase supplying the c and energy for biomass growth and replenishing the glycogen and polyphosphate pools in the ph range 6 0 8 0 the p release rate increased linearly from 2 56 0 39 to 8 63 0 79 mgp gvss h table 3 and fig 3 f these values were significantly lower than the rates observed with accumulibacter 61 5 to 88 8 mgp gvss h in ph range from 6 5 to 8 5 oehmen et al 2005 accumulibacter also take up organic carbon much quicker than tetrasphaera table 3 this higher rate of anaerobic activity is consistent with previous suggestions that tetrasphaera possess a lower relative ebpr activity than accumulibacter on a per cell basis fernando et al 2019 the substrate uptake pha production and glycogen degradation rates were independent of ph over the range of 6 0 to 8 0 fig 3d 3b and 3c respectively which agreed with studies on paos fed with acetate filipe et al 2001a smolders et al 1994 liu et al 1996 the resulting p release c uptake ratio has a positive correlation with ph fig 3a which was likely because of additional energy requirements for taking up the negatively charged amino acid ions at higher ph against the negative electrical potential of the cells tetrasphaera are also capable of generating energy from the fermentation of amino acids leading to the lower p release to substrate uptake ratios as compared to accumulibacter metabolism that were observed in this study this lower anaerobic p release also leads to a lower demand for storage compound consumption in the aerobic phase to drive p uptake and achieve successful ebpr the linear increase in p release rate as a function of ph coupled with the slight increase in the ratio of glycogen degradation per substrate uptake as a function of ph shows that the energy for amino acid uptake by tetrasphaera relies more on polyphosphate hydrolysis than glycogen degradation as ph increases the main role of glycogen in tetrasphaera metabolism is likely for generating reducing equivalents in order to close the redox balance of the cell close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 the pha substrate uptake ratio was higher in this work as compared to previous studies on tetrasphaera close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 though lower than that typically observed for accumulibacter table 3 the reasons could be attributed to the higher abundance of accumulibacter in this study according to fish as compared to previous studies close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 the low pha production substrate uptake ratio as compared to accumulibacter suggests that pha is not the sole storage compound within tetrasphaera close et al 2021 found that glutamate and aspartate were important storage polymers during amino acid uptake by tetrasphaera similarly to what was observed in anaerobic conditions in aerobic conditions no clear correlation was observed between pha utilization or glycogen production as a function of ph for tetrasphaera table 3 however the results in fig 3e show a clear linear increase in the p uptake rate as ph increases from 6 0 to 8 0 for the tetrasphaera enriched culture an increase in p uptake at high ph was also observed in acetate and propionate fed accumulibacter paos between ph 6 5 and 7 5 filipe et al 2001c oehmen et al 2005 van veen et al 1993 have previously proposed that the rate of p release or p uptake in acinetobacter johnsonii was limited by the rate of deprotonation of a protein carrier located on the outside or inside of the cell membrane respectively during the transport of p across the cell membrane the rate of deprotonation of this carrier was proposed to be directly related to ph causing higher p release and uptake rates at higher ph levels in e coli and acinetobacter johnsonii van veen et al 1993 1994 van veen et al 1994 suggested that this ph mechanism impacting p release and uptake may be generally applicable to all types of bacteria giving examples of not only gram negative bacteria such as e coli and acinetobacter johnsonii but also gram positive bacteria such as micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus cereus the increased p release and uptake kinetics as a function of ph found in this study enriched in gram positive tetrasphaera also observed in previous studies focussed on gram negative accumulibacter filipe et al 2001c oehmen et al 2005 is consistent with the hypothesis of van veen et al 1994 and suggests that a similar ph impact on p release uptake could be expected for all paos the net p removal from the batch tests was calculated as the difference between p uptake and p release which revealed a significant increase from ph 6 to ph 8 where 2 08 0 12 p mmol l of net p removal was observed at ph 8 and 1 28 0 04 p mmol l of net p removal was observed at ph 6 for comparison the ph 7 tests showed a net p removal of 1 68 0 05 p mmol l where the tests at ph 6 5 and ph 7 5 showed 10 difference as compared to ph 7 as a result reduced net p removal at low ph levels will also reduce the ability of paos to regenerate their polyphosphate pool for substrate uptake under anaerobic conditions and could lead to out competition by other organisms in the system e g gaos 2 4 implications of the study this study demonstrated how the ph affects tetrasphaera metabolism in an enriched culture the p release and uptake kinetics showed a strong dependence on the ph while intracellular pha and glycogen production and carbon source consumption rates were largely independent of ph changes at high ph levels chemical precipitation can potentially be a competing mechanism for p removal however chemical precipitation was considered unlikely to be a significant mechanism of p uptake in this study for two reasons 1 iron and aluminium salts were not present in appreciable quantities within the reactor media iron was only added at micronutrient levels and 2 the p release rate was observed to increase as a function of ph fig 3f as well as the p uptake rate fig 3e whereby a decrease in p release rate at the higher ph level would be expected if chemical precipitation had increased appreciably it is noteworthy that high ph conditions lead to higher rates of p release and uptake in both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter this suggests that high ph can improve the synergistic interaction of tetrasphaera and accumulibacter and enhance ebpr performance while tetrasphaera is capable of contributing to p removal through the anaerobic uptake of sugars and amino acids simultaneously producing fermentation products such as vfa nielsen et al 2019 zhao et al 2022 accumulibacter can survive on these fermentation productions while also contributing to further p removal close et al 2021 marques et al 2017 this promotes functional redundancy decreasing the reliance on only one type of pao to facilitate ebpr which can benefit ebpr process robustness functional redundancy has been previously shown to result in process performance benefits in wastewater treatment in other situations paulo et al 2020 wang et al 2021 high ph has been previously found to benefit paos over gaos filipe et al 2001d oehmen et al 2005 thus a high ph 8 can also lead to multiple benefits to the microbial community composition moreover considering the typical ph profile observed in uncontrolled ebpr processes at lab scale or full scale serafim et al 2002 serralta et al 2004 flores alsina et al 2015 the ph can increase substantially from 7 0 8 0 between the anaerobic and aerobic phases according to the results of this study such a ph profile would result in a nearly optimal aerobic p uptake rate for both pao groups coupled with an anaerobic p release rate that is 30 40 lower than what would have been observed if the ph were maintained at 8 0 anaerobically the typical ph profile in ebpr systems therefore leads to an increased net p removal capacity of the wwtp for both groups of paos further underlying the potential process benefits that can be achieved through selecting both tetrasphaera and accumulibacter overall this study reveals the short term impacts of ph on tetrasphaera kinetics and metabolism high ph can enhance tetrasphaera net p removal and thereby improve ebpr performance maintaining a relatively high ph often achieved without a dedicated ph controller could be a route to ensure efficient p removal however it is still unknown how ph impacts the long term performance and microbial selection of tetrasphaera communities which warrants further study 3 conclusions in this study the effect of ph on anaerobic and aerobic metabolism of an enriched culture of tetrasphaera paos was studied for the first time the p uptake and release rates by the enriched tetrasphaera sludge increased linearly with an increase of ph from 6 to 8 tetrasphaera are capable of taking up different organic carbon sources over a wide range of ph conditions producing fermentation products that can be consumed by accumulibacter high ph improves ebpr effectiveness as tetrasphaera display kinetic advantages at high ph levels similar to accumulibacter the typical ph variations observed in ebpr plants can promote higher net p removal by both groups optimisation of ebpr in wwtps may benefit from strategies that support a robust community of both accumulibacter and tetrasphaera experiencing a positive synergy between the two pao groups 4 materials and methods 4 1 sequencing batch reactor sbr for tetrasphaera enrichment a tetrasphaera pao culture was enriched in a laboratory scale anaerobic aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr with a working volume of 2 l the sbr was

hrt of 16 h and 100 ml sludge was removed from the reactor during 1 min of each day resulting in a sludge retention time srt of 20 d around 0 2 ml min argon was bubbled into the sbr to maintain anaerobic conditions while 0 5 l min air was bubbled during the aerobic phase the reactor temperature was maintained at 20 1 c and the ph was at 7 1 0 1 by dosing 0 1 m hcl the sludge was mixed at 300

community dynamics 4 2 sbr batch experiments to study the impact of ph on tetrasphaera pao metabolism and kinetics under anaerobic and aerobic conditions batch experiments were carried out in duplicate on the sludge enriched in the sbr duplicated batch tests were performed for each ph ranging between 6 and 8 following experimental conditions similar to those applied for the sbr enrichment but at different controlled ph setpoints sludge for the batch experiments was taken from the enriched sbr during a period when high and stable p removal occurred from day 59 to day 93 the sludge was not returned to the parent sbr after finishing each experiment to avoid influencing the parent sbr due to the limitation of the sludge volume of the parent sbr the batch tests were performed sequentially on a weekly basis during this period the average p removal was 80 12 the batch tests were performed with 500 ml of working volume at 20 c for each batch test a 400 ml sample of mixed liquor was taken from the enriched sbr at the end of the aerobic stage when the cells have accumulated most of the phosphate the sludge was centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 rpm and the pellet was resuspended in 250 ml of the aforementioned solution a without cas aa argon was bubbled to ensure anaerobic conditions prior to feeding of the carbon source the pellet was inoculated into the reactor followed by additions of 150 ml of phosphorus solution b and 100 ml of cas aa solution resulting in an initial concentration of 45 ppm of p po4 3 and 5 c mmol l respectively the temperature was maintained by a water bath at 20 1 c with the stirring rate at 300 rpm the ph of the reactor was controlled to the respective fixed setpoint 0 1 ph units by addition of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh when the ph values were above below the targeted ph values respectively the batch reactors were operated with a cycle of 8 h consisting of an anaerobic 4 h followed by a settling decant period 1 h and an aerobic phase 3 h similarly to the parent sbr to prevent any organic carbon entering the aerobic phase the reactor content was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at the end of the anaerobic phases then the pellet was resuspended again in mineral medium i e solution a but without carbon source water and the phosphorus media of solution b with a volume proportion of 2 5 1 1 5 respectively to

19907,hematite as an extensive natural mineral with multiple crystal facets profoundly affects the migration and transformation of pollutants in the natural environment however little is known about the photochemical behavior of microplastics on different facets of hematite in the aquatic environment in this work the photoaging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps on different crystal planes 001 100 and 012 facets and related mechanisms were studied two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis illustrated that the reaction pathways of ps mps photoaging on hematite tended to preferential chemical oxidization the stronger performance of ps mps photoaging expressed by particle size reduction and surface oxidation was observed on the 012 crystal facet under irradiation 012 facet dominated hematite with a narrower bandgap 1 93 ev reinforced the photogenerated charge carrier separation and the lower activation energy barrier 1 41 ev calculated from density functional theory led to effective oh formation from water oxidation these findings elucidate the underlying photoaging mechanism of mps on hematite with different mineralogical phases graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photodegradation hematite crystal facets reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps size 5 mm have become emerging pollutants and attracted worldwide attention nguyen et al 2019 tang et al 2021 due to the small sizes most mps cannot be intercepted with sewage treatment and are therefore released into freshwater novotna et al 2019 it has been estimated that 80 of mps in surface water come from sewage treatment parashar and hait 2022 as a significant sink for pollutants freshwater ecosystems have been contaminated by mps e g taihu 3 4 25 8 items l and poyang lake 5 34 items l in china hu et al 2020 minor et al 2020 su et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 while studies are accumulating reporting the mps occurrence in freshwater the understanding of environmental behavior e g transformation degradation and bioaccumulation of mps in realistic freshwater is limited which holds importance in assessing the comprehensive ecological and health risks associated with mps photoaging is considered a principal process of mps transformation mao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a which is affected by the coexisting components in freshwater e g organic matter inorganic salts and minerals for instance dissolved organic matter dom e g fulvic acid humic acid etc can exhibit promotional or hindering effects on mps photoaging wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 explored the effect of inorganic ions e g no3 hco3 etc on ps mps photoaging however little is known about the mediating role of minerals on mps photoaging although plentiful studies have highlighted the significant impacts of minerals on the fate of environmental pollutants ma et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 among various widespread minerals hematite α fe2o3 shows a wide visible light absorption capacity shen et al 2016 and has been used as a natural photocatalyst for pollutant degradation asif et al 2021 it exhibits vast morphological properties with the exposure of facets possessing distinct structures and properties cornell and schwertmann 2003 thereby impacting ros formation cornell and schwertmann 2003 lv et al 2010 hematite 012 is reported to possess more surface hydroxyl groups than hematite 100 qiu et al 2022 which could impact ros production yu et al 2019 thus we hypothesize that 1 the photochemical activity of hematite differs based on the structure and surface properties of distinct facets and 2 the dominant facet determines the activation barrier for ros generation thus modulating mps photoaging the overarching objective of this study is to reveal the mediating role of hematite facets in ps mps photoaging the most common mps in freshwater lithner et al 2011 liu et al 2019 specifically this study aims to 1 probe the effects of facets of hematite on the photoaging behavior of ps mps 2 unravel the variability of ros generation on different facets and 3 inquire into the structural alterations and molecular characteristics during the ps mps photoaging the findings contribute to an in depth understanding of the effects and mechanisms of the crystallographic surface structures of hematite on the photoaging process of ps mps in freshwater 2 results and discussion 2 1 structural characteristics of hematite with different facets the xrd showed the distinct crystal structure of hematite jcpds no 33 0664 fig s1a and the structural unit cells of each crystal plane based on dft simulations were provided in fig s1b and c the sharp peaks indicated good crystallinity of α fe2o3 all samples represented the adsorption isotherms of type iv and h3 hysteresis loops fig s2a and b 012fec revealed higher sbet 35 44 m2 g than 001feh 28 92 m2 g and 100fer 10 85 m2 g table s2 with more abundant mesoporous structures bardestani et al 2019 li et al 2017 from the fesem analysis 001feh 100fer and 012fec showed regular morphologies with hexagonal nanoplates nanorods and nanocubes respectively fig 1 a c the geometric models inserted into the higher right corner tem images further demonstrated the structure fig 1d f specifically 001feh displayed the geometric model of nanoplates with the length of 233 nm and the thickness of 10 nm nanorods were observed on 100fer with a length of 183 nm and a radius of 43 nm and 012fec showed the shape of nanocubes with a length of 40 nm hrtem and selected area electron diffraction saed were performed to investigate the crystal orientation and crystallinity the lattice distance of 001feh was 0 25 nm with the angle of the two adjacent facets at 117 fig 1g the diffraction spots with hexagonal symmetry presented in the saed pattern indicated that the bottom top surfaces were bound by 001 facets for 100fer the measurable lattice spacing in the top surface was 0 25 nm corresponding to 110 lattice planes fig 1h the saed pattern inserted in fig 1h displayed a single crystalline structure and implied 110 113 and 013 lattice spots according to a previous study lv et al 2018 the side surfaces of the nanorods 100fer might be ascribed to the 100 and equivalent lattice planes as for 012fec the hrtem images showed a lattice spacing of 0 37 nm assigned to the 012 facets and an interfacial angle of 90 fig 1i combined with the structural features of the single crystal in saed inserted in fig 1i the main facets of 012fec could be indexed to 012 facets the surface electronic properties of all samples were probed by xps fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 peaks were located at approximately 710 5 and 724 1 ev respectively and additional satellite peaks were observed at 718 7 and 732 5 ev similar peak areas at fe2p indicated similar fe iii content in all samples fig s2c qiu et al 2022 in the o1s region the lowest peak at approximately 529 4 ev could be assigned to lattice oxygen in the α fe2o3 fe o fig s2d the peaks at approximately 531 0 ev 532 1 ev and 533 5 ev were assigned to lattice hydroxyl groups fe oh lattice hydroxyl groups fe oh adsorbed and water on the surface baltrusaitis et al 2007 the content of different species in the o1s spectrum was calculated in table 1 012fec revealed more surface hydroxyl groups 16 2 than 001feh 9 9 and 100fer 11 6 uv drs was applied to investigate the light absorption of hematite fig 2 a and the bandgap energy was also calculated from the tauc plot all samples exhibited good absorbance of ultraviolet and visible light 012fec displayed stronger light absorption in the uv region with a slightly narrower bandgap 1 93 ev compared to 001feh 1 99 ev and 100fer 1 96 ev in addition pl patterns of all samples with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm revealed emission peaks at approximately 440 nm fig 2b the lower intensity of emission peak on 012fec indicated lower charge carriers recombination furthermore the photocurrent spectra revealed a higher electron density on 012fec than 001feh and 100fer fig 2c eis analysis revealed a smaller arc radius obtained on 012fec corresponding to a smaller impedance and faster migration of carriers fig 2d in general the photochemistry property of hematite samples with different crystalline facets differed and 012fec exhibited lower photogenerated charge carriers recombination higher photoelectron density and the faster migration of carrier 2 2 particle size and functional groups of photoaged ps mps on hematite ps mps photoaging on hematite with different facets was investigated under full wavelength irradiation hematite adsorption under dark condition was conducted for comparison it showed that only 10 wt of the hematite were adsorbed and almost no change of ps mps was found fig s3 indicating the negligible contribution of sorbed hematite to the particle size reduction it was also found no almost particle size reduction in dark control without hematite indicating the negligible effect of stirring on particle size reduction of ps mps however under irradiation all aged ps mps displayed the decreased particle size fig 3 a and enhanced particle size reduction was observed with hematite addition compared to the pure photolysis 12 3 specifically 012fec displayed the highest particle size reduction 52 8 compared to 001feh 20 0 and 100fer 39 1 after 12 h of irradiation pseudo first order kinetics was adopted and the kinetic constants k calculation revealed a faster reduction rate 0 053 on 012fec than 001feh 0 019 and 100fer 0 037 fig 3b these results indicated that hematite especially 012fec could effectively promote particle size reduction of ps mps during irradiation the alterations of functional groups of aged ps mps were also probed by ftir fig s4 which could effectively evaluate the oxidation of ps mps during photoaging duan et al 2022 prominent bands at 2851 1600 1452 756 and 698 cm 1 were observed for pristine ps mps and the assignments were summarized in table s2 all aged ps mps displayed intense c o bands at 1742 cm 1 indicating more oxygen containing group formation the ratio of the c o band to the symmetric stretching band of ch2 at 1452 cm 1 i e the carbonyl index ci was adopted to evaluate the surface oxidation of ps mps dong et al 2022 fig 3c shows that no alteration in dark control and increased ci values in light irradiation it reached the highest on 012fec 0 68 after 12 h irradiation which was 3 6 times greater than photolysis 0 19 in general hematite with different facets promoted the ps mps photoaging with 012 facet exhibiting the strongest promotion of size reduction and surface oxidation further investigation of the functional group was provided by the xps of pristine and aged ps mps fig 3d from the c1s spectra four peaks around 284 7 285 4 289 1 and 291 1 ev were observed assigning to c h c o c o and π π in ps bai et al 2022 the content of oxygen containing functional groups c o c o in all aged ps increased especially in the presence of hematite dominated with 012 facets indicating the surface oxidation of ps mps small oxidized functional groups in virgin ps mps were also observed this was ascribed to the partial oxidation of ps surfaces during the production or and crushing process dong et al 2022 in addition the oxygen to carbon atom ratio o c of pristine ps 0 293 increased to 0 398 0 439 0 636 and 0 491 in ultrapure water 001 012 and 100 facets respectively this result indicated that the hematite especially 012 facets dominated hematite could accelerate the chemical oxidation of ps mps in irradiation which was consistent with ftir analysis results 2 3 2d cos analysis of photoaged ps mps and identification of the released dom one dimensional ftir analysis lacks information on dynamic photoaging and cannot determine the order of functional group variation during ps mps photoaging zhou et al 2017 to determine the sequence of functional group changes two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was applied based on one dimensional ftir spectral data the synchronous map showed seven auto peaks along the diagonal line at 698 756 1030 1493 1600 1666 and 1744 cm 1 fig 4 a positive signs for these peaks were observed in all groups after irradiation implying that all cross peaks were synchronized with the aging process jin et al 2018 the asynchronous maps were obtained based on noda s rules which revealed the sequential order in ps mps photoaging ding et al 2020 as shown in fig 4b and table 2 without hematite participation the chemical bonds of ps mps followed the sequential order of 1493 c c 756 c h 1600 c c 1030 c o 698 c h 1744 o c o 1666 c o under irradiation however with 012fec treatment the order was 1744 o c o 1666 c o 1030 c o 1600 c c 756 c h 1493 c c 698 c h similar results were found on 100 and 001 facets it was found that carbonyl groups were formed rapidly with the presence of hematite which might be ascribed to the rapid ros formation with hematite accelerating the ps mps photoaging and leading to the carbonyl groups formation meanwhile with the presence of hematite especially 012 facet the toc in the solution was higher than photolysis further indicating the promoting effect of hematite on ps mps photoaging decreased toc in the late period was ascribed to the organic s mineralization fig s5a additionally the aromatic structure in the solution was contributed by the monomers from ps mps depolymerization and some aromatic intermediate fig s5b this further indicated that enhanced effect of hematite on ps mps photoaging and the reactivity of various facets differed which could be correlated with ros formation on the surface 2 4 principal mechanisms revealed by ros analysis and dft calculations to further explore the relationship between the possible reaction path and ros formation on the different facets epr spin trapping experiments were performed no signals were observed in the dark control and with no presence of hematite fig 5 a in contrast the signals of oh and 1o2 were detected for 012fec fig 5b and c suggesting that photogenerated carriers could induce ros formation by energy transfer or reaction with o2 and h2o it was previously reported that oh formation could be conducted through the water oxidation or the deformation of o2 hussain et al 2022 luo et al 2020 water oxidation was more possible since the standard potential 2 34 v h2o h vb oh h is more positive than the valence band of hematite chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 however the signal of o2 was hardly observed fig s7d f which can be ascribed to the conduction band potential of α fe2o3 was not sufficient for o2 formation 0 33 v o2 e o2 chen et al 2021 fig s6 in addition the intensity of oh on different facets was compared fig s7a c and the oh amount was also quantified fig s8 the steady state concentration of oh on 012 facets 117 9 um was higher than that on 001 103 2 um and 100 107 8 um facets after 70 min irradiation this was attributed to the lower activation energy barrier 1 41 ev from the dft calculation below of 012 facet dominated hematite which reinforces oh formation from water oxidation meanwhile sufficient surface hydroxyl groups 16 2 from xps analysis may provide more active sites for ps mps photoaging qiu et al 2022 the radical quenching experiment further confirmed the dominant role of oh fig 5d the particle size reduction of ps mps on 012fec decreased by 54 0 after quenching oh and it was also inhibited after eliminating photogenerated holes and electrons suggesting charge carriers in hematite could induce ros generation overall our results showed that oh was the dominant ros in ps mps photoaging considering various surface properties and photochemistry properties on different facets the energy barriers of water oxidation may affect oh generation dft calculations were further conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of water oxidation on different facets models of crystal cells and water oxidation configurations in different reaction states are shown in fig 6 a transition state ts occurred in the reaction of h2o h oh at different facets represented the adsorption site the activation energy of ts on fe2o3 012 1 41 ev was significantly lower than that on fe2o3 100 4 02 ev and fe2o3 001 3 19 ev benefiting the oh formation and thereby facilitating the oh generation combining with the analysis of epr and ros quantitation it was inferred that oh was more easily produced on 012 facet accelerating ps mps photoaging these theoretical calculations revealed that the surface atomic arrangement of iron oxides determined the activation energy barrier of the water oxidation reaction and therefore affected the efficiency of ros generation 3 conclusions reactions on the surface interface of minerals essentially occur at the exposed facets outside the bulk phase of mineral liu et al 2021 the atomic topology and physicochemical properties of different facets influence the fate of pollutants such as mps yanina svetlana and rosso kevin 2008 elucidating the facets effect of minerals on mps photoaging has important environmental and geochemical implications in this work hematite dominated by 001 100 and 012 facets were prepared and applied in ps mps photoaging the structural and photochemical property investigation illustrated that hematite with 012 crystal plane was endowed with faster charge separation and higher electron density which effectively promoted ros generation especially oh meanwhile according to dft calculations oh production was dependent on the activation energy barrier of the exposed facets and 012 facets were found to have a lower activation energy barrier for water oxidation to oh these factors including the photochemical property of hematite and the activation energy barrier of ros formation led to enhanced ps mps photoaging mainly in the form of particle size reduction and elevated surface oxygen containing groups combined with the 2d cos analysis the photoaging route of ps mps tended to preferential surface oxidization on hematite this work has disclosed the key features of ros formation and the mechanism of ps mps photoaging on different crystalline hematite which can help to elucidate the correlation between crystal face mineral characteristics and ros generation and enrich the molecular basis of ps mps photoaging in the presence of hematite with different crystal

19907,hematite as an extensive natural mineral with multiple crystal facets profoundly affects the migration and transformation of pollutants in the natural environment however little is known about the photochemical behavior of microplastics on different facets of hematite in the aquatic environment in this work the photoaging of polystyrene microplastics ps mps on different crystal planes 001 100 and 012 facets and related mechanisms were studied two dimensional correlation spectroscopy analysis illustrated that the reaction pathways of ps mps photoaging on hematite tended to preferential chemical oxidization the stronger performance of ps mps photoaging expressed by particle size reduction and surface oxidation was observed on the 012 crystal facet under irradiation 012 facet dominated hematite with a narrower bandgap 1 93 ev reinforced the photogenerated charge carrier separation and the lower activation energy barrier 1 41 ev calculated from density functional theory led to effective oh formation from water oxidation these findings elucidate the underlying photoaging mechanism of mps on hematite with different mineralogical phases graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics photodegradation hematite crystal facets reactive oxygen species data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction microplastics mps size 5 mm have become emerging pollutants and attracted worldwide attention nguyen et al 2019 tang et al 2021 due to the small sizes most mps cannot be intercepted with sewage treatment and are therefore released into freshwater novotna et al 2019 it has been estimated that 80 of mps in surface water come from sewage treatment parashar and hait 2022 as a significant sink for pollutants freshwater ecosystems have been contaminated by mps e g taihu 3 4 25 8 items l and poyang lake 5 34 items l in china hu et al 2020 minor et al 2020 su et al 2016 yuan et al 2019 while studies are accumulating reporting the mps occurrence in freshwater the understanding of environmental behavior e g transformation degradation and bioaccumulation of mps in realistic freshwater is limited which holds importance in assessing the comprehensive ecological and health risks associated with mps photoaging is considered a principal process of mps transformation mao et al 2020 zhang et al 2022a which is affected by the coexisting components in freshwater e g organic matter inorganic salts and minerals for instance dissolved organic matter dom e g fulvic acid humic acid etc can exhibit promotional or hindering effects on mps photoaging wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2022b zhu et al 2022 explored the effect of inorganic ions e g no3 hco3 etc on ps mps photoaging however little is known about the mediating role of minerals on mps photoaging although plentiful studies have highlighted the significant impacts of minerals on the fate of environmental pollutants ma et al 2020 zhou et al 2012 among various widespread minerals hematite α fe2o3 shows a wide visible light absorption capacity shen et al 2016 and has been used as a natural photocatalyst for pollutant degradation asif et al 2021 it exhibits vast morphological properties with the exposure of facets possessing distinct structures and properties cornell and schwertmann 2003 thereby impacting ros formation cornell and schwertmann 2003 lv et al 2010 hematite 012 is reported to possess more surface hydroxyl groups than hematite 100 qiu et al 2022 which could impact ros production yu et al 2019 thus we hypothesize that 1 the photochemical activity of hematite differs based on the structure and surface properties of distinct facets and 2 the dominant facet determines the activation barrier for ros generation thus modulating mps photoaging the overarching objective of this study is to reveal the mediating role of hematite facets in ps mps photoaging the most common mps in freshwater lithner et al 2011 liu et al 2019 specifically this study aims to 1 probe the effects of facets of hematite on the photoaging behavior of ps mps 2 unravel the variability of ros generation on different facets and 3 inquire into the structural alterations and molecular characteristics during the ps mps photoaging the findings contribute to an in depth understanding of the effects and mechanisms of the crystallographic surface structures of hematite on the photoaging process of ps mps in freshwater 2 results and discussion 2 1 structural characteristics of hematite with different facets the xrd showed the distinct crystal structure of hematite jcpds no 33 0664 fig s1a and the structural unit cells of each crystal plane based on dft simulations were provided in fig s1b and c the sharp peaks indicated good crystallinity of α fe2o3 all samples represented the adsorption isotherms of type iv and h3 hysteresis loops fig s2a and b 012fec revealed higher sbet 35 44 m2 g than 001feh 28 92 m2 g and 100fer 10 85 m2 g table s2 with more abundant mesoporous structures bardestani et al 2019 li et al 2017 from the fesem analysis 001feh 100fer and 012fec showed regular morphologies with hexagonal nanoplates nanorods and nanocubes respectively fig 1 a c the geometric models inserted into the higher right corner tem images further demonstrated the structure fig 1d f specifically 001feh displayed the geometric model of nanoplates with the length of 233 nm and the thickness of 10 nm nanorods were observed on 100fer with a length of 183 nm and a radius of 43 nm and 012fec showed the shape of nanocubes with a length of 40 nm hrtem and selected area electron diffraction saed were performed to investigate the crystal orientation and crystallinity the lattice distance of 001feh was 0 25 nm with the angle of the two adjacent facets at 117 fig 1g the diffraction spots with hexagonal symmetry presented in the saed pattern indicated that the bottom top surfaces were bound by 001 facets for 100fer the measurable lattice spacing in the top surface was 0 25 nm corresponding to 110 lattice planes fig 1h the saed pattern inserted in fig 1h displayed a single crystalline structure and implied 110 113 and 013 lattice spots according to a previous study lv et al 2018 the side surfaces of the nanorods 100fer might be ascribed to the 100 and equivalent lattice planes as for 012fec the hrtem images showed a lattice spacing of 0 37 nm assigned to the 012 facets and an interfacial angle of 90 fig 1i combined with the structural features of the single crystal in saed inserted in fig 1i the main facets of 012fec could be indexed to 012 facets the surface electronic properties of all samples were probed by xps fe2p3 2 and fe2p1 2 peaks were located at approximately 710 5 and 724 1 ev respectively and additional satellite peaks were observed at 718 7 and 732 5 ev similar peak areas at fe2p indicated similar fe iii content in all samples fig s2c qiu et al 2022 in the o1s region the lowest peak at approximately 529 4 ev could be assigned to lattice oxygen in the α fe2o3 fe o fig s2d the peaks at approximately 531 0 ev 532 1 ev and 533 5 ev were assigned to lattice hydroxyl groups fe oh lattice hydroxyl groups fe oh adsorbed and water on the surface baltrusaitis et al 2007 the content of different species in the o1s spectrum was calculated in table 1 012fec revealed more surface hydroxyl groups 16 2 than 001feh 9 9 and 100fer 11 6 uv drs was applied to investigate the light absorption of hematite fig 2 a and the bandgap energy was also calculated from the tauc plot all samples exhibited good absorbance of ultraviolet and visible light 012fec displayed stronger light absorption in the uv region with a slightly narrower bandgap 1 93 ev compared to 001feh 1 99 ev and 100fer 1 96 ev in addition pl patterns of all samples with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm revealed emission peaks at approximately 440 nm fig 2b the lower intensity of emission peak on 012fec indicated lower charge carriers recombination furthermore the photocurrent spectra revealed a higher electron density on 012fec than 001feh and 100fer fig 2c eis analysis revealed a smaller arc radius obtained on 012fec corresponding to a smaller impedance and faster migration of carriers fig 2d in general the photochemistry property of hematite samples with different crystalline facets differed and 012fec exhibited lower photogenerated charge carriers recombination higher photoelectron density and the faster migration of carrier 2 2 particle size and functional groups of photoaged ps mps on hematite ps mps photoaging on hematite with different facets was investigated under full wavelength irradiation hematite adsorption under dark condition was conducted for comparison it showed that only 10 wt of the hematite were adsorbed and almost no change of ps mps was found fig s3 indicating the negligible contribution of sorbed hematite to the particle size reduction it was also found no almost particle size reduction in dark control without hematite indicating the negligible effect of stirring on particle size reduction of ps mps however under irradiation all aged ps mps displayed the decreased particle size fig 3 a and enhanced particle size reduction was observed with hematite addition compared to the pure photolysis 12 3 specifically 012fec displayed the highest particle size reduction 52 8 compared to 001feh 20 0 and 100fer 39 1 after 12 h of irradiation pseudo first order kinetics was adopted and the kinetic constants k calculation revealed a faster reduction rate 0 053 on 012fec than 001feh 0 019 and 100fer 0 037 fig 3b these results indicated that hematite especially 012fec could effectively promote particle size reduction of ps mps during irradiation the alterations of functional groups of aged ps mps were also probed by ftir fig s4 which could effectively evaluate the oxidation of ps mps during photoaging duan et al 2022 prominent bands at 2851 1600 1452 756 and 698 cm 1 were observed for pristine ps mps and the assignments were summarized in table s2 all aged ps mps displayed intense c o bands at 1742 cm 1 indicating more oxygen containing group formation the ratio of the c o band to the symmetric stretching band of ch2 at 1452 cm 1 i e the carbonyl index ci was adopted to evaluate the surface oxidation of ps mps dong et al 2022 fig 3c shows that no alteration in dark control and increased ci values in light irradiation it reached the highest on 012fec 0 68 after 12 h irradiation which was 3 6 times greater than photolysis 0 19 in general hematite with different facets promoted the ps mps photoaging with 012 facet exhibiting the strongest promotion of size reduction and surface oxidation further investigation of the functional group was provided by the xps of pristine and aged ps mps fig 3d from the c1s spectra four peaks around 284 7 285 4 289 1 and 291 1 ev were observed assigning to c h c o c o and π π in ps bai et al 2022 the content of oxygen containing functional groups c o c o in all aged ps increased especially in the presence of hematite dominated with 012 facets indicating the surface oxidation of ps mps small oxidized functional groups in virgin ps mps were also observed this was ascribed to the partial oxidation of ps surfaces during the production or and crushing process dong et al 2022 in addition the oxygen to carbon atom ratio o c of pristine ps 0 293 increased to 0 398 0 439 0 636 and 0 491 in ultrapure water 001 012 and 100 facets respectively this result indicated that the hematite especially 012 facets dominated hematite could accelerate the chemical oxidation of ps mps in irradiation which was consistent with ftir analysis results 2 3 2d cos analysis of photoaged ps mps and identification of the released dom one dimensional ftir analysis lacks information on dynamic photoaging and cannot determine the order of functional group variation during ps mps photoaging zhou et al 2017 to determine the sequence of functional group changes two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was applied based on one dimensional ftir spectral data the synchronous map showed seven auto peaks along the diagonal line at 698 756 1030 1493 1600 1666 and 1744 cm 1 fig 4 a positive signs for these peaks were observed in all groups after irradiation implying that all cross peaks were synchronized with the aging process jin et al 2018 the asynchronous maps were obtained based on noda s rules which revealed the sequential order in ps mps photoaging ding et al 2020 as shown in fig 4b and table 2 without hematite participation the chemical bonds of ps mps followed the sequential order of 1493 c c 756 c h 1600 c c 1030 c o 698 c h 1744 o c o 1666 c o under irradiation however with 012fec treatment the order was 1744 o c o 1666 c o 1030 c o 1600 c c 756 c h 1493 c c 698 c h similar results were found on 100 and 001 facets it was found that carbonyl groups were formed rapidly with the presence of hematite which might be ascribed to the rapid ros formation with hematite accelerating the ps mps photoaging and leading to the carbonyl groups formation meanwhile with the presence of hematite especially 012 facet the toc in the solution was higher than photolysis further indicating the promoting effect of hematite on ps mps photoaging decreased toc in the late period was ascribed to the organic s mineralization fig s5a additionally the aromatic structure in the solution was contributed by the monomers from ps mps depolymerization and some aromatic intermediate fig s5b this further indicated that enhanced effect of hematite on ps mps photoaging and the reactivity of various facets differed which could be correlated with ros formation on the surface 2 4 principal mechanisms revealed by ros analysis and dft calculations to further explore the relationship between the possible reaction path and ros formation on the different facets epr spin trapping experiments were performed no signals were observed in the dark control and with no presence of hematite fig 5 a in contrast the signals of oh and 1o2 were detected for 012fec fig 5b and c suggesting that photogenerated carriers could induce ros formation by energy transfer or reaction with o2 and h2o it was previously reported that oh formation could be conducted through the water oxidation or the deformation of o2 hussain et al 2022 luo et al 2020 water oxidation was more possible since the standard potential 2 34 v h2o h vb oh h is more positive than the valence band of hematite chen et al 2021 zhu et al 2020 however the signal of o2 was hardly observed fig s7d f which can be ascribed to the conduction band potential of α fe2o3 was not sufficient for o2 formation 0 33 v o2 e o2 chen et al 2021 fig s6 in addition the intensity of oh on different facets was compared fig s7a c and the oh amount was also quantified fig s8 the steady state concentration of oh on 012 facets 117 9 um was higher than that on 001 103 2 um and 100 107 8 um facets after 70 min irradiation this was attributed to the lower activation energy barrier 1 41 ev from the dft calculation below of 012 facet dominated hematite which reinforces oh formation from water oxidation meanwhile sufficient surface hydroxyl groups 16 2 from xps analysis may provide more active sites for ps mps photoaging qiu et al 2022 the radical quenching experiment further confirmed the dominant role of oh fig 5d the particle size reduction of ps mps on 012fec decreased by 54 0 after quenching oh and it was also inhibited after eliminating photogenerated holes and electrons suggesting charge carriers in hematite could induce ros generation overall our results showed that oh was the dominant ros in ps mps photoaging considering various surface properties and photochemistry properties on different facets the energy barriers of water oxidation may affect oh generation dft calculations were further conducted to gain insight into the mechanism of water oxidation on different facets models of crystal cells and water oxidation configurations in different reaction states are shown in fig 6 a transition state ts occurred in the reaction of h2o h oh at different facets represented the adsorption site the activation energy of ts on fe2o3 012 1 41 ev was significantly lower than that on fe2o3 100 4 02 ev and fe2o3 001 3 19 ev benefiting the oh formation and thereby facilitating the oh generation combining with the analysis of epr and ros quantitation it was inferred that oh was more easily produced on 012 facet accelerating ps mps photoaging these theoretical calculations revealed that the surface atomic arrangement of iron oxides determined the activation energy barrier of the water oxidation reaction and therefore affected the efficiency of ros generation 3 conclusions reactions on the surface interface of minerals essentially occur at the exposed facets outside the bulk phase of mineral liu et al 2021 the atomic topology and physicochemical properties of different facets influence the fate of pollutants such as mps yanina svetlana and rosso kevin 2008 elucidating the facets effect of minerals on mps photoaging has important environmental and geochemical implications in this work hematite dominated by 001 100 and 012 facets were prepared and applied in ps mps photoaging the structural and photochemical property investigation illustrated that hematite with 012 crystal plane was endowed with faster charge separation and higher electron density which effectively promoted ros generation especially oh meanwhile according to dft calculations oh production was dependent on the activation energy barrier of the exposed facets and 012 facets were found to have a lower activation energy barrier for water oxidation to oh these factors including the photochemical property of hematite and the activation energy barrier of ros formation led to enhanced ps mps photoaging mainly in the form of particle size reduction and elevated surface oxygen containing groups combined with the 2d cos analysis the photoaging route of ps mps tended to preferential surface oxidization on hematite this work has disclosed the key features of ros formation and the mechanism of ps mps photoaging on different crystalline hematite which can help to elucidate the correlation between crystal face mineral characteristics and ros generation and enrich the molecular basis of ps mps photoaging in the presence of hematite with different crystal

19908,widespread implementation of on site water reuse systems is hindered by the limited ability to ensure the level of treatment and protection of human health during operation in this study we tested the ability of five commercially available online sensors free chlorine fc oxidation reduction potential orp ph turbidity uv absorbance at 254 nm to predict the microbial water quality in membrane bioreactors followed by chlorination using logistic regression based and mechanism based models the microbial water quality was assessed in terms of removal of enteric bacteria from the wastewater removal of enteric viruses and regrowth of bacteria in the treated water we found that fc and orp alone could predict the microbial water quality well with orp based models generally performing better we further observed that prediction accuracy did not increase when data from multiple sensors were integrated we propose a methodology to link online sensor measurements to risk based water quality targets providing operation setpoints protective of human health for specific combinations of wastewaters and reuse applications for instance we recommend a minimum orp of 705 mv to ensure a virus log removal of 5 and an orp of 765 mv for a log removal of 6 these setpoints were selected to ensure that the percentage of events where the water is predicted to meet the quality target but it does not remains below 5 such a systematic approach to set sensor setpoints could be used in the development of water reuse guidelines and regulations that aim to cover a range of reuse

is available through eawag s research data institutional collection 1 introduction on site water reuse systems can offer flexible solutions to provide water and protect freshwater resources in water scarce areas the challenge for such systems is that microbial safety must be ensured at all times today membrane bioreactors mbrs are increasingly used as a barrier in on site water reuse systems especially in small scale systems with fewer than 50 people equivalent and are considered a best available technology branch et al 2016 lesjean et al 2011 disinfection of the water is mostly achieved through chlorination due to its broad spectrum efficacy and low cost ikehata et al 2018 the high quality of water treated with mbr based systems has multiplied the applications of reclaimed water beyond traditional reuse in agriculture angelakis et al 2018 chen et al 2013 with novel technologies that allow to reuse water for on site residential uses such as toilet flushing bair et al 2015 showering gassie and engelhardt 2017 or hand washing reynaert et al 2020 in parallel the development of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra frameworks for water reuse has allowed to quantify the human health risk associated with water reuse and to propose systematic approaches to set microbial treatment targets that will keep the human health risk below a certain benchmark zhiteneva et al 2020 differential risks to human health make the definition of treatment targets for water reuse more complex than for drinking water applications as the targets depend on the composition of the wastewater the assumed volume of water ingested for a certain reuse application and the pathogen considered for instance treatment targets will be more stringent for reuse for showering assumed high volume of water ingested compared to reuse for toilet flushing assumed low volume of water ingested to regulate the quality of the reclaimed water many countries have issued legal and regulatory frameworks for water reuse water reuse frameworks wrfs such as guidelines standards regulations and codes of practice reynaert et al 2021 many of these wrfs integrate a fit for purpose approach defining different water quality classes depending on the reuse application with different requirements in terms of treatment technology permissible contaminant concentrations and monitoring to date most wrfs require regular monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria to verify microbial water quality as examples the us epa guidelines for water reuse recommend daily monitoring of fecal coliforms and the spanish regulations for water reuse bi weekly monitoring of e coli ministry of the presidency spain 2007 us epa 2012 frequent monitoring of only fecal indicator bacteria as suggested in wrfs is problematic for two reasons 1 in on site systems laboratory based methods may no longer be suitable due to economic and organizational constraints and will results in delayed action due to low frequency monitoring reynaert et al 2021 2 fecal indicator bacteria do not provide information on virus removal and regrowth of bacteria in the treated water baggi et al 2001 especially for mbr treatment where bacteria are retained by the membrane but viruses may pass finding adequate solutions for the monitoring of the microbial water quality would solve a major bottleneck for the widespread implementation of on site water reuse technologies zhang et al 2020 online sensors and remote monitoring offer an opportunity for the management of on site water reuse technologies to ensure treatment performance and protect public health however most wrfs do not provide quality targets for parameters indicative of microbial water quality that can be measured online in light of increasingly diverse reuse applications there is a need for flexible approaches to link sensor target stringency directly with differential risks to human health online monitoring and control systems based on the oxidation reduction potential orp or free chlorine fc exist for various applications and have been implemented for wastewater effluent chlorination werf 2005 or swimming pool disinfection steininger 1990 for decades the current work expands this concept for online monitoring and control strategies for on site water reuse systems using membrane bioreactor an chlorination treatment mbr chlorine we investigated the relationships between five commercially available and widely used online sensors fc orp ph turbidity and uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 and the water quality using statistical and mechanism based approaches the microbial water quality is assessed in terms of i removal of enteric bacteria from the wastewater ii removal of enteric viruses and iii bacterial regrowth in the treated water 2 materials and methods 2 1 mbr chlorine system the mbr chlorine system used in this study is referred to as water wall reynaert et al 2020 www autarky ch the water wall consists of two main components the core treatment takes place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water is further treated and disinfected using granular activated carbon gac and chlorine in a clean water tank cwt fig 1 the bambi contained a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration was provided directly below the membrane module at a rate of 5 l min the bambi was operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration where the transmembrane pressure is due to the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 water that passed through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it was pumped through a gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the cwt every 13 min in the cwt a concentrated naocl solution 1 750 mg cl2 l was pumped into the tank at regular intervals the pumping intervals were varied during the experiments to achieve a range of free chlorine concentrations in the cwt 0 2 mg l mixing in the cwt was ensured through a submersed pump that was turned on for 30 s every 5 min the tank volumes were 60 l water for the bambi and 25 l for the cwt with an average hydraulic residence time hrt of 5 h in the cwt to study the effect of treating different types of water input two water wall systems were operated in parallel in this testing one with controlled feeding of handwashing greywater and the other with toilet flush water separated from the major part of urine and feces the compositions of the 20x concentrated feed solutions are presented in si 1 supplementary information for each reactor a total of 3 75 l day of concentrated feed was pumped into the bambi in a series of 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day this daily feed represents the loading that would be introduced to a total of 75 l water of real hand washing or source separated toilet flush water the same amount of water was removed from the system to maintain a constant volume other than changes in the chlorination pumping intervals of the chlorine dosing pump to achieve a range of microbial water qualities both water walls were operated under stable conditions throughout the testing 2 2 physicochemical water quality 2 2 1 online monitoring water from the cwt was constantly recirculated through flow cells equipped with a range of online

concentrations for at least three hrt 15 h in the cwt e coli was used as an indicator for the removal of enteric bacteria from the wastewater samples from the concentrated feed and from the cwt were analyzed following the us epa method 1603 e coli in water by membrane filtration e coli was used as an indicator for the removal of enteric bacteria from the wastewater consistent with the use of e coli or other fecal bacteria indicators fecal coliform total coliform enterococci within wrfs e g us epa 2012 in short the water samples were filtered through a membrane s pak filter 0 45 µm millipore sigma burlington usa that was placed on m tec chromoselect agar millipore sigma burlington usa and incubated at 44 c for 24 hours the colony forming units cfu on the plates were then enumerated for the cwt 100 ml of undiluted sample was analyzed while the concentrated wastewater needed prior dilution 1 250 000 to 1 2 500 000 before analysis the bacteriophage ms2 was used as an indicator for the removal of enteric viruses from the wastewater ms2 atcc 15597 b1 and its associated e coli host atcc 700891 were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc ms2 stock solution was prepared by amplifying the initial ms2 stock solution in 1 l of e coli culture the double agar layer assay was used to enumerate infectious bacteriophages as plaque forming units pfu following the us epa method 1602 briefly 100 µl of e coli host were mixed in soft agar 0 7 agar and poured onto a hard agar plate 1 5 agar different from the described protocol the ms2 sample was spotted onto the agar plate rather than mixing it with the soft agar allowing to process multiple dilutions easily the overall log removal value lrv of e coli and ms2 was calculated according to eq 1 1 l r v o v e r a l l l o g 10 n c w t n f e e d f c o n c where n c w t and n f e e d are the microbial indicator concentrations in the cwt and concentrated feed respectively and f c o n c is the concentration factor of the feed 20 when no indicators were detected in the cwt the detection limits 1 cfu 100ml for e coli 10 pfu ml for ms2 were used to calculate the lrvs in this case the reported l r v o v e r a l l is reported as greater than the maximum detectable lrv the intact cell concentration icc was used to indicate bacterial regrowth in the cwt the icc was determined with a flow cytometer cytoflex beckman coulter brea california usa using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and propidium iodide thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa flow cytometry analysis was selected for bacterial quantification because of the simplicity and speed of processing large numbers of samples relative to sequencing or qpcr techniques and the ability to quantify bacteria that are not culturable using heterotrophic plate counts van nevel et al 2017 flow cytometry has also been demonstrated to descriptively quantify changes in cell concentrations in system using chlorination or electrolysis as post treatment ziemba et al 2019 the detection limit of flow cytometry in this study was 29 cells ml 2 4 calculation of sensor target values sensor target values were calculated for a range of log removal targets lrts for e coli and ms2 and of allowable concentrations for icc upper and lower limits determined through the detection limits of the methods and concentrations of indicators in the feed using a statistical approach and a mechanism based approach 2 4 1 logistic regression model to determine sensor target values logistic regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability p of a binary outcome water quality meeting a certain target or not based on one or more independent variables sensor measurements the binary outcome is the dependent variable which is based on a binary classification of whether 1 safe or not 0 unsafe the acceptable microbial target is met for each observation within the dataset the accuracy of prediction was calculated using leave one out cross validation the leave one out cross validation procedure is appropriate for relatively small datasets when an accurate estimate of model performance is required wong 2015 the accuracy obtained with single sensors was compared with the best performing combination of sensor measurements except uv254 computed with the r package mumin 1 43 17 barton 2022 uv254 was excluded as there were significantly fewer data points available for this sensor implemented only in the mbr chlorine system treating toilet flush water the error matrix presented in table 2 was used to evaluate the models the false safe rate fsr and the false unsafe rate fur were calculated as 2 f s r f s f s t u 3 f u r f u f u t s when computing logistic regression models based on only one sensor input required for the calculation of sensor targets the logistic regression equation has two parameters α and β 4 p 1 1 e α β x the goodness of fit was evaluated using mcfadden s pseudo r2 smith and mckenna 2013 bootstrapping r package boot version 1 3 28 100 000 iterations was used to calculate the 90 confidence intervals sensor target values were set to meet a 95 percent probability

from hornstra et al 2011 which shows strong tailing for ms2 disinfection at low concentrations of chlorine dioxide the chick watson model was adapted to account for this time independent disinfection

treating source separated toilet flush water was stable over the four months of experiments with doc concentrations consistently below 3 mgc l and ammonium mostly below the limit of detection of 0 02 mgn l in the permeate see si 3 in contrast doc and ammonium concentrations in the mbr chlorine system treating handwashing water were more variable with increased concentrations up to 13 mgc l doc and 27 mgn l ammonium during the first weeks of operation and another peak towards the end of the experiments during these periods there was no fc in the treated water however there were varying concentrations of combined chlorine the ph measurements ranged between 6 8 and 7 7 for the system treating toilet flush water and between 7 0 and 7 7 for the handwashing water system implying that the speciation of the hypochlorous acid pka 7 5 varied during the experiments the full dataset collected for this study can be found under doi org 10 25678 0007nq 3 2 relationships between sensor measurements and microbial indicators fig 2 presents the fifteen relationships five sensors vs three microbial indicators that were investigated as there were limited systematic differences between the datasets p value of t test 0 05 for all parameters except of ph where p 0 0038 the further data analysis was done on the combined dataset cross correlation plots showing the relationship between all parameters are presented in si 4 e coli was not detected post membrane this means that the maximum detectable lrv was determined by the concentration of e coli in the concentrated feed and the method s limit of detection and was thus not related to any of the sensor measurements in the treated water sensor measurements that were significantly correlated with lrv ms2 and log10icc spearman s rank correlation p 0 001 included orp and fc in contrast the ph value turbidity and uv254 were not significantly correlated with any of the microbial indicators 3 3 logistic regression based sensor target values for a range of microbial water quality targets the dataset was classified into the binary categories 0 water quality does not meet microbial target unsafe and 1 water quality meets microbial target safe logistic regression equations were computed for each microbial target for ms2 logistic regressions were computed for lrvs between 4 and 6 5 for icc logistic regressions were computed for log10 concentrations between 3 5 and 6 see table 3 for selection of relevant ranges table 3 presents the accuracy of prediction percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions for these logistic regression models based on only orp or fc significantly correlated with microbial water quality compared to the best performing combination of sensors using leave one out cross validation with one exception log10 icc 3 5 the largest difference between the better performing single sensor model and the best performing combination of sensors is 4 however it was not always the same sensor orp or fc which had the higher accuracy orp and fc alone can thus predict the microbial water quality nearly as well as the combination of all sensors fig 3 presents the logistic regression models for the four combinations of sensor measurements and microbial indicators that are significantly correlated the pseudo r2 is above 0 4 for all but one microbial target log10icc 6 indicating a very good fit according to louviere et al 2000 for some regressions the sensor measurements could be divided into two perfectly separated clusters resulting in a pseudo r2 of 1 perfect fit a perfect fit implies that the error on the model can no longer be directly calculated due to a lack of data in the transition range bootstrapping was thus used to calculate the 90 confidence intervals as can be seen in fig 3 bootstrapping produces relatively narrow confidence intervals for perfect separation due to the limited data resolution in the transition range for regressions with a good fit pseudo r2 0 4 sensor target values for orp and fc were set to meet a 95 percent probability that the water quality meets the microbial targets using the lower bound of the confidence interval the sensor target values for orp and fc are presented in table 4 a the selected 95 probability reduces the fsr i e model predicts safe water when it is not to a maximum of 5 for the entire data set however this comes at the cost of an elevated fur up to 40 indicating that in some cases the microbial targets are met at lower sensor values than the set sensor target while the recommended sensor targets are consistent for the lrt of ms2 increasing for increasingly stringent quality targets some targets could not be calculated for icc recommended target values exceeding maximum measurements fit of regression too poor one value stands out for icc the orp target of 605 mv range 600 620 mv for a log10icc 4 5 is lower than the recommendation for a log10icc 5 690 mv 605 720 mv however the ranges of orp targets overlap this inconsistency is due to the perfect separation of the data set for the log10icc 4 5 where bootstrapping likely underestimates the 90 confidence interval 3 4 mechanism based sensor target values fig 4 presents the results for the mechanism based disinfection models for ms2 and icc for e coli the model would predict a constant removal independent of the sensor measurements as e coli was consistently removed by the mbr when using orp as a predictor for the microbial indicators the disinfection model predicts a constant lrv of 1 7 for ms2 respectively a constant concentration of intact cells of 5 4 log up to the orp baseline value of 450 mv above this baseline value there is an almost linear relationship between orp and both microbial indicators as the optimal dilution coefficient n in eq 9 is close to 1 when using fc as a predictor the disinfection model predicts a constant lrv of 1 7 for ms2 respectively a constant concentration of intact cells of 5 4 log up to the fcbaseline value of 0 02 mg l above this baseline value the microbial indicators are related to fc fcbaseline 0 3 where 0 3 is the optimal dilution coefficient the mechanism based sensor target values with 90 confidence intervals are presented in table 4 b note the disinfection model implicitly assumes that 18 o r p o r p b a s e l i n e n o r p k f c f c b a s e l i n e n f c where k k o r p k f c this assumption is discussed in si 5 3 5 comparison of recommended sensor target values the sensor target values table 4 were set in a way to minimize the fsr situations where the sensor value would predict safe water when the water is not safe to 5 this comes at the cost of overall accuracy as there are many events where the water is safe even at lower sensor values sensor targets for orp predicting lrv ms2 are generally consistent between the logistic regression models and the mechanism based model with somewhat higher orp targets for the mechanism based models which are thus recommended as target values bold values in table 4 in contrast there are some differences between orp targets predicting log10icc this is mainly due to the inconsistencies of the logistic regression models due to perfect separation of the dataset see section 3 3 for this reason the mechanism based sensor target values are recommended fc sensor target values using the mechanism based models are almost twice as high as those from the logistic regression models for both lrv ms2 and log10icc these higher targets for the mechanism based model can be attributed to the high standard deviation of the fc measurements leading to wide confidence intervals for the mechanism based model here the more conservative target values from the mechanism based models are selected too as they better reflect the variation of fc measurements at low fc values for the logistic regression based models there is a loss of information on the variability of the microbial water quality due to the binary classification 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of e coli removal of enteric bacteria vs ms2 removal of enteric viruses vs icc regrowth in the tested mbr chlorine systems e coli was consistently removed by the mbr the quantifiable lrv was thus limited by the concentration in the feed and the reported lrv has to be interpreted as a maximum detectable lrv this result was expected as the nominal membrane pore size 0 04 µm is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the size of e coli 1 µm while e coli or other enteric bacteria indicators can be used to verify membrane integrity it cannot be used to evaluate the overall performance of a functioning mbr chlorine system inclusive other microbial threats including virus therefore e coli is not useful as the sole indicator for the determination of sensor target values unlike e coli the enteric virus indicator ms2 concentrations in the cwt varied as a function of the operation of the mbr chlorine systems the calculated lrvs are thus meaningful and can be compared with lrts determined through qmra for water reuse systems such lrts are usually calculated for specific combinations between a water source e g greywater and a reuse application e g toilet flushing the presented relationships between sensor measurements and lrvs can then be used to select a sensor target value for specific combinations of wastewater sources treated in a mbr chlorine system and aiming to produce water for a certain reuse application in contrast it is not possible to set concentration targets for icc based on qmra as the icc does not necessarily indicate presence or concentration of pathogens and is thus not directly linked to microbial risk however several studies have suggested that icc can be used to evaluate process performance cheswick et al 2019 van nevel et al 2017 while the icc may vary between water reuse systems there should not be abnormal changes in icc in the same system during normal operation we can thus define sensor target values that will ensure that the typical icc for a specific system is not surpassed 4 2 best performing sensors to predict the microbial water quality our results show that orp and fc are closely linked to the microbial water quality while turbidity and uv254 are not combining information from multiple sensors did not generally improve the prediction accuracy of logistic regression models 4 2 1 orp and fc are closely linked to the microbial water quality orp and fc were the only two sensors that were significantly linked to the microbial water quality with orp based models generally performing better perfect separation of the data for many logistic regression models lower relative standard deviation for mechanism based models this closer relationship for orp compared to fc is supported by three theoretical considerations 1 fc is the sum of hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ocl the speciation between these two compounds is determined by the pka 7 5 and is thus ph dependent hocl is the stronger disinfectant of the two species with a specific lethality for viruses and bacteria that is around 100x higher than for ocl kim and hensley 1997 this ph dependence of the disinfection capacity of the fc is accounted for in the orp measurements as ocl has a lower standard oxidation potential than hocl kim and hensley 1997 2 in the presence of ammonium there is formation of chloramines which also act as disinfectants but are much less efficient than fc kim and hensley 1997 measured free chlorine does not account for the disinfection by chloramines in contrast this increased disinfection capacity is accounted for in the orp measurement as the oxidation capacity of the chloramine is included in the overall orp 3 the response of orp to chlorine is logarithmic nernst equation which allows for an accurate detection of low chlorine concentrations this advantage of orp compared to fc is also visible in fig 3 where a complete separation of the microbial water quality indicators based on orp is possible but not based on fc leading to a higher accuracy of prediction for models using orp as an input to predict the microbial water quality the dataset used in this study captures the variability of the fc disinfection capacity due to changes in the ph and changes in chloramine concentrations as the testing was done under variable ph concentrations above and below the pka and included occurrence of ammonium in the treated water see si 3 the superiority of orp as a measure of disinfection capacity has also been observed and commented in other laboratory studies kim and hensley 1997 victorin et al 1972 for the practical implementation of orp and fc sensors two additional factors become important besides the strength of the link between sensor measurements and the microbial water quality 1 most fc sensors cannot be implemented without an online measurement of the ph to transform hocl concentration into fc which requires regular calibration or are only applicable in a restricted ph range e g 3 electrode sensors typically working for ph 6 9 2 non chlorine based orp may interfere with the orp measurements a study conducted by the water environment and reuse foundation sought to determine whether orp or fc is better suited to control chlorine dosing in wastewater treatment plant effluents werf 2005 the study concludes that for the chlorination of wastewater treatment plant effluents no technology was clearly superior for all criteria considered provide information to meet effluent requirements provide process control system reliability minimize requirements and minimize chemical use however orp had a lower correlation with fecal coliforms in the chlorinated water the main reason stated for the poorer performance of orp were fluctuations of the orp in the wastewater between 200 mv and 500 mv as a result of the weather conditions dry vs wet and of industrial discharge we expect the influent composition of decentralized water reuse systems to be less variable no dependency on the weather no industrial input however this needs confirmation from field campaigns 4 2 2 turbidity and uv254 are not linked to the microbial water quality online monitoring of turbidity is recommended by several wrfs and others have reported strong correlations between turbidity and the total cell concentration determined by flow cytometry intact cells damaged cells hess et al 2021 we assume that the lack of correlation between turbidity and icc is due to the low icc concentrations in the tested mbr chlorine systems compared to concentrations reported by hess et al 2021 1 order of magnitude higher who studied an mbr system without chlorine disinfection similarly online monitoring of uv254 can be used as a proxy for organic matter concentrations van den broeke et al 2006 however the organic carbon contained in the icc represents only a tiny fraction of the total doc 0 01 assuming 107 cells 1 µg doc ziemba et al 2020 natural variations of the doc of the treated water thus by far exceeded changes in doc caused by changes of the icc direct correlations between pathogen contamination and uv vis spectra have not been found to date carré et al 2017 although we demonstrate lack of correlation of turbidity and uv254 with the microbial indicators in the tested mbr chlorine system these sensors can provide information on membrane integrity and may also hold promise for alternative treatment schemes e g ozonation katko and højris 2019 4 3 comparison of logistic regression and a mechanism based models to define sensor targets there is an ongoing debate whether data driven or mechanistic models are better suited for the online monitoring of critical process variables solle et al 2017 the main advantages of logistic regression as a purely statistical approach lies in the low requirements of assumptions that need to be fulfilled and in the straightforward interpretation of results basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include only the independence of errors linearity of independent variables and log odds and the absence of multicollinearity stoltzfus 2011 key assumptions made for linear regression linear relationship between dependent and independent variable normal distribution of residuals and homoscedasticity are not required for the setting of risk based sensor target values where we want to limit the fsr logistic regression allows to transparently select corresponding sensor values in this study a major limitation of the logistic regression was the perfect separation of the water quality classes into two groups due to the small sample size and lack of data in the transition zones bootstrapping was used to estimate the confidence intervals however in the absence of prediction errors these confidence intervals were relatively narrow this led to an overconfident selection of sensor target values that may not capture the real variability in microbial water quality close to the recommended sensor target values bayesian analysis with non informative prior assumption has been recommended for logistic regression with perfect separation gelman et al 2008 however the resulting confidence intervals are very wide due to the relatively small size of the dataset see si 6 furthermore it was not possible to collect data in the transition zone for orp as the orp increased to high values as soon as there were detectable concentrations of fc in the water if the perfect separation also holds at larger sample sizes this would make orp an excellent indicator of the microbial water quality and delineate a clear threshold for sensor targets the mechanism based approach was a more adequate choice for the current dataset as the dataset is relatively small but we have knowledge about the main processes driving the microbial water quality i e retention in the mbr chlorine disinfection regrowth in the stored water while combining these processes follows a mechanistic approach the modelling of the disinfection process itself chick watson is phenomenological data derived such hybrid models building on understanding of mechanisms in combination with data driven methods are increasingly used to model water reuse systems as they combine the advantages of mechanistic interpretability of results and extrapolation power with those of data driven models e g learning unknown relationships schneider et al 2022 4 4 comparison with sensor target values from water reuse frameworks wrfs an inspection of 19 wrfs details presented in si 7 shows that most wrfs define different water quality classes depending on the reuse application setting stricter requirements for acceptable treatment technologies permissible contaminant concentrations and monitoring for higher risk applications some wrfs explicitly link the reuse application to different lrts such as the australian guidelines for water recycling nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 and the western australian code of practice for the reuse of greywater department of health western australia 2010 however the majority of wrfs set requirements in terms of final concentrations in the treated water sometimes combined with higher monitoring frequencies for higher risk applications in terms of chlorine concentration the majority of wrfs set requirements for the total chlorine residual sum of free and combined chlorine depending on the water composition concentration of organics and ammonia the disinfection capacity of the total chlorine is significantly lower than the disinfection capacity of the same concentration of free chlorine kim and hensley 1997 many wrfs set a requirement of 1 mg l for total chlorine usually in combination with a minimum contact time e g 15 min or 30 min assuming all chlorine was present as free chlorine this would correspond to an expected lrv ms2 of 5 and log10icc of 4 5 for the mbr chlorine system in the current study table 4 which is relatively low for many of the reuse applications intended e g toilet flushing using the average sensor targets from table 4 as opposed to the recommended 95 upper confidence level we would predict 6 lrv ms2 and 4 5 log10icc however these predictions do not account for the variability in microbial indicator removal concentrations and sensor measurements and still assume that the 1 mg l of chlorine is present as fc overall it seems that wrf requirements for total chlorine may not be sufficient to ensure adequate virus removal in mbr chlorine systems designed for high quality applications only the californian requirements concentration time ct value of 450 mg min l with a contact time of at least 90 min i e a chlorine concentration of around 5 mg l requiring a lrv ms2 of at least 5 are more conservative than the sensor target values proposed in this study state water resources control board california 2018 however hirani et al 2014 reported that lower ct values of 30 mg min l are sufficient to meet california s title 22 disinfection requirements in mbr effluents currently no wrf sets requirements for the orp of the treated water but the canadian guidelines for domestic reclaimed water for use in toilet and urinal flushing report orp as a proxy to monitor the chlorine residual online health canada 2010 there are however various orp requirements in guidelines for bathing waters for instance the who recommends an orp of at least 720 mv although it is suggested that appropriate values should be determined on a case by case basis the german environment agency requires a minimum orp of 750 770 mv depending on the ph and the new south wales health protection australia requires an orp of 720 mv german environment agency 2006 new south wales health protection 2013 who 2006 these requirements are more protective of human health corresponding to lrv ms2 of 5 5 6 and log10icc of 5 4 5 in the current study compared to the typical 1 mg l total chlorine requirement for reclaimed water 4 5 applicability of sensor targets to other mbr chlorine systems the testing was performed with mbr chlorine systems that treated two different types of wastewaters with similar relationships between sensor measurements and microbial indicators this is an indication that the same phenomena may apply to mbr chlorine systems treating a range of wastewater compositions however measurements from other mbr chlorine systems will be required to validate the presented models and suggested sensor target values as this study does not report model performance on a separate test dataset for ms2 the removal was due to retention in the mbr and inactivation through chlorine for the retention of viruses in the mbr a review on virus removal in full scale submerged mbrs reports lrvs between 1 1 and 7 1 o brien and xagoraraki 2020 the ms2 removal attributed to the mbr in this study lrv of 1 7 is at the low end of the values reported in literature for the disinfection the two mbr chlorine systems used in this testing achieved complete nitrification most of the time with ammonia concentrations in the permeate below 0 2 mgn l resulting in low concentrations of chloramines overall the proposed sensor targets for lrv ms2 are thus conservative as the actual removal of viruses may be higher in other mbr chlorine systems due to higher removal in the mbr and the presence of chloramines during disinfection regrowth can be due to growth of suspended organisms and to detachment of biofilm in the storage tank the concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc nutrients and the temperature have been shown to be important parameters determining regrowth of bacteria after ultrafiltration nguyen et al 2017 nocker et al 2020 in this study we used two different wastewaters thus introducing some variability in the treated water composition aoc nutrients in contrast the temperature was relatively constant throughout the testing if detachment of biofilm is a major contributor the inclusion of a biological activated carbon filter and flow variability are additional relevant parameters that will determine the icc in the treated water hess et al 2021 we thus assume that it will be necessary to recalibrate the icc models for mbr chlorine systems that do not include an activated carbon filter depending on the validation results using other mbr chlorine systems this study offers specific sensor target values for mbr chlorine systems likely for ms2 or approaches to set sensor target values for specific configurations of mbr chlorine systems likely for icc 5 conclusion orp and fc which are both proxies for the efficacy of chlorination are closely related to the microbial quality of reclaimed water treated with mbr chlorine systems while turbidity ph and uv254 are not we propose a mechanism based methodology to set sensor target values that are linked to the microbial water quality in a transparent way for orp and fc we recommend sensor target values for different microbial water quality targets in terms of virus removal and bacterial regrowth that can be linked to different reuse applications for the reclaimed water such a systematic approach to set sensor targets could be used in the development of wrfs that aim to cover a range of reuse applications with different risks to human health credit authorship

19908,widespread implementation of on site water reuse systems is hindered by the limited ability to ensure the level of treatment and protection of human health during operation in this study we tested the ability of five commercially available online sensors free chlorine fc oxidation reduction potential orp ph turbidity uv absorbance at 254 nm to predict the microbial water quality in membrane bioreactors followed by chlorination using logistic regression based and mechanism based models the microbial water quality was assessed in terms of removal of enteric bacteria from the wastewater removal of enteric viruses and regrowth of bacteria in the treated water we found that fc and orp alone could predict the microbial water quality well with orp based models generally performing better we further observed that prediction accuracy did not increase when data from multiple sensors were integrated we propose a methodology to link online sensor measurements to risk based water quality targets providing operation setpoints protective of human health for specific combinations of wastewaters and reuse applications for instance we recommend a minimum orp of 705 mv to ensure a virus log removal of 5 and an orp of 765 mv for a log removal of 6 these setpoints were selected to ensure that the percentage of events where the water is predicted to meet the quality target but it does not remains below 5 such a systematic approach to set sensor setpoints could be used in the development of water reuse guidelines and regulations that aim to cover a range of reuse

scarce areas the challenge for such systems is that microbial safety must be ensured at all times today membrane bioreactors mbrs are increasingly used as a barrier in on site water reuse systems especially in small scale systems with fewer than 50 people equivalent and are considered a best available technology branch et al 2016 lesjean et al 2011 disinfection of the water is mostly achieved through chlorination due to its broad spectrum efficacy and low cost ikehata et al 2018 the high quality of water treated with mbr based systems has multiplied the applications of reclaimed water beyond traditional reuse in agriculture angelakis et al 2018 chen et al 2013 with novel technologies that allow to reuse water for on site residential uses such as toilet flushing bair et al 2015 showering gassie and engelhardt 2017 or hand washing reynaert et al 2020 in parallel the development of quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra frameworks for water reuse has allowed to quantify the human health risk associated with water reuse and to propose systematic approaches to set microbial treatment targets that will keep the human health risk below a certain benchmark zhiteneva et al 2020 differential risks to human health make the definition of treatment targets for water reuse more complex than for drinking water applications as the targets depend on the composition of the wastewater the assumed volume of water ingested for a certain reuse application and the pathogen considered for instance treatment targets will be more stringent for reuse for showering assumed high volume of water ingested compared to reuse for toilet flushing assumed low volume of water ingested to regulate the quality of the reclaimed water many countries have issued legal and regulatory frameworks for water reuse water reuse frameworks wrfs such as guidelines standards regulations and codes of practice reynaert et al 2021 many of these wrfs integrate a fit for purpose approach defining different water quality classes depending on the reuse application with different requirements in terms of treatment technology permissible contaminant concentrations and monitoring to date most wrfs require regular monitoring of fecal indicator bacteria to verify microbial water quality as examples the us epa guidelines for water reuse recommend daily monitoring of fecal coliforms and the spanish regulations for water reuse bi weekly monitoring of e coli ministry of the presidency spain 2007 us epa 2012 frequent monitoring of only fecal indicator bacteria as suggested in wrfs is problematic for two reasons 1 in on site systems laboratory based methods may no longer be suitable due to economic and organizational constraints and will results in delayed action due to low frequency monitoring reynaert et al 2021 2 fecal indicator bacteria do not provide information on virus removal and regrowth of bacteria in the treated water baggi et al 2001 especially for mbr treatment where bacteria are retained by the membrane but viruses may pass finding adequate solutions for the monitoring of the microbial water quality would solve a major bottleneck for the widespread implementation of on site water reuse technologies zhang et al 2020 online sensors and remote monitoring offer an opportunity for the management of on site water reuse technologies to ensure treatment performance and protect public health however most wrfs do not provide quality targets for parameters indicative of microbial water quality that can be measured online in light of increasingly diverse reuse applications there is a need for flexible approaches to link sensor target stringency directly with differential risks to human health online monitoring and control systems based on the oxidation reduction potential orp or free chlorine fc exist for various applications and have been implemented for wastewater effluent chlorination werf 2005 or swimming pool disinfection

consists of two main components the core treatment takes place in a biologically activated membrane bioreactor bambi künzle et al 2015 after which the water is further treated and disinfected using granular activated carbon gac and chlorine in a clean water tank cwt fig 1 the bambi contained a standing sandwich membrane module microclear mcxl newterra langgöns germany featuring a 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany aeration was provided directly below the membrane module at a rate of 5 l min the bambi was operated in a gravity driven membrane gdm configuration where the transmembrane pressure is due to the water head peter varbanets et al 2010 water that passed through the membrane was collected in a permeate reservoir 10 cm polyvinyl chloride pipe connected to the membrane module permeate outlet holding volume of 4 l from where it was pumped through a gac filter norit 830 1 5 mm grain diameter cabot boston usa to the cwt every 13 min in the cwt a concentrated naocl solution 1 750 mg cl2 l was pumped into the tank at regular intervals the pumping intervals were varied during the experiments to achieve a range of free chlorine concentrations in the cwt 0 2 mg l mixing in the cwt was ensured through a submersed pump that was turned on for 30 s every 5 min the tank volumes were 60 l water for the bambi and 25 l for the cwt with an average hydraulic residence time hrt of 5 h in the cwt to study the effect of treating different types of water input two water wall systems were operated in parallel in this testing one with controlled feeding of handwashing greywater and the other with toilet flush water separated from the major part of urine and feces the compositions of the 20x concentrated feed solutions are presented in si 1 supplementary information for each reactor a total of 3 75 l day of concentrated feed was pumped into the bambi in a series of 50 feedings evenly distributed throughout the day this daily feed represents the loading that would be introduced to a total of 75 l water of real hand washing or source separated toilet flush water the same amount of water was removed from the system to maintain a constant volume other than changes in the chlorination pumping intervals of the chlorine dosing pump to achieve a range of microbial water qualities both water walls were operated under

removal of enteric viruses from the wastewater ms2 atcc 15597 b1 and its associated e coli host atcc 700891 were purchased from the american type culture collection atcc ms2 stock solution was

coulter brea california usa using sybr green i stain thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa and propidium iodide thermofisher scientific waltham massachusetts usa flow cytometry analysis was selected for bacterial quantification because of the simplicity and speed of processing large numbers of samples relative to sequencing or qpcr techniques and the ability to quantify bacteria that are not culturable using heterotrophic plate counts van nevel et al 2017 flow cytometry has also been demonstrated to descriptively quantify changes in cell concentrations in system using chlorination

indicators in the feed using a statistical approach and a mechanism based approach 2 4 1 logistic regression model to determine sensor target values logistic regression is a classification algorithm that predicts the probability p of a binary outcome water quality meeting a certain target or not based on one or more independent variables sensor measurements the binary outcome is the dependent variable which is based on a binary classification of whether 1 safe or not 0 unsafe the acceptable microbial target is met for each observation within the dataset the accuracy of prediction was calculated using leave one out cross validation the leave one out cross validation procedure is appropriate for relatively small datasets when an accurate estimate of model performance is required wong 2015 the accuracy obtained with single sensors was compared with the best performing combination of sensor measurements except uv254 computed with the r package mumin 1 43 17 barton 2022 uv254

long contact times results in si 2 this is also in accordance with a study from cheswick et al 2020 which shows that the icc stabilizes at different values for different chlorine concentrations and from hornstra et al 2011 which shows strong tailing for ms2 disinfection at low concentrations of chlorine dioxide the chick watson model was adapted to account for this time independent disinfection

treating source separated toilet flush water was stable over the four months of experiments with doc concentrations consistently below 3 mgc l and ammonium mostly below the limit of detection of 0 02 mgn l in the permeate see si 3 in contrast doc and ammonium concentrations in the mbr chlorine system treating handwashing water were more variable with increased concentrations up to 13 mgc l doc and 27 mgn l ammonium during the first weeks of operation and another peak towards the end of the experiments during these periods there was no fc in the treated water however there were varying concentrations of combined chlorine the ph measurements ranged between 6 8 and 7 7 for the system treating toilet flush water and between 7 0 and 7 7 for the handwashing water system implying that the speciation of the hypochlorous acid pka 7 5 varied during the experiments the full dataset collected for this study can be found under doi org 10 25678 0007nq 3 2 relationships between sensor measurements and microbial indicators fig 2 presents the fifteen relationships five sensors vs three microbial indicators that were investigated as there were limited systematic differences between the datasets p value of t test 0 05 for all parameters except of ph where p 0 0038 the further data analysis was done on the combined dataset cross correlation plots showing the relationship between all parameters are presented in si 4 e coli was not detected post membrane this means that the maximum detectable lrv was determined by the concentration of e coli in the concentrated feed and the method s limit of detection and was thus not related to any of the sensor measurements in the treated water sensor measurements that were significantly correlated with lrv ms2 and log10icc spearman s rank correlation p 0 001 included orp and fc in contrast the ph value turbidity and uv254 were not significantly correlated with any of the microbial indicators 3 3 logistic regression based sensor target values for a range of microbial water quality targets the dataset was classified into the binary categories 0 water quality does not meet microbial target unsafe and 1 water quality meets microbial target safe logistic regression equations were computed for each microbial target for ms2 logistic regressions were computed for lrvs between 4 and 6 5 for icc logistic regressions were computed for log10 concentrations between 3 5 and 6 see table 3 for selection of relevant ranges table 3 presents the accuracy of prediction percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions for these logistic regression models based on only orp or fc significantly correlated with microbial water quality compared to the best performing combination of sensors using leave one out cross validation with one exception log10 icc 3 5 the largest difference between the better performing single sensor model and the best performing combination of sensors is 4 however it was not always the same sensor orp or fc which had the higher accuracy orp and fc alone can thus predict the microbial water quality nearly as well as the combination of all sensors fig 3 presents the logistic regression models for the four combinations of sensor measurements and microbial indicators that are significantly correlated the pseudo r2 is above 0 4 for all but one microbial target log10icc 6 indicating a very good fit according to louviere et al 2000 for some regressions the sensor measurements could be divided into two perfectly separated clusters resulting in a pseudo r2 of 1 perfect fit a perfect fit implies that the error on the model can no longer be directly calculated due to a lack of data in the transition range bootstrapping was thus used to calculate the 90 confidence intervals as can be seen in fig 3 bootstrapping produces relatively narrow confidence intervals for perfect separation due to the limited data resolution in the transition range for regressions with a good fit pseudo r2 0 4 sensor target values for orp and fc were set to meet a 95 percent probability that the water quality meets the microbial targets using the lower bound of the confidence interval the sensor target values for orp and fc are presented in table 4 a the selected 95 probability reduces the fsr i e model predicts safe water when it is not to a maximum of 5 for the entire data set however this comes at the cost of an elevated fur up to 40 indicating that in some cases the microbial targets are met at lower sensor values than the set sensor target while the recommended sensor targets are consistent for the lrt of ms2 increasing for increasingly stringent quality targets some targets could not be calculated for icc recommended target values exceeding maximum measurements fit of regression too poor one value stands out for icc the orp target of 605 mv range 600 620 mv for a log10icc 4 5 is lower than the recommendation for a log10icc 5 690 mv 605 720 mv however the ranges of orp targets overlap this inconsistency is due to the perfect separation of the data set for the log10icc 4 5 where bootstrapping likely underestimates the 90 confidence interval 3 4 mechanism based sensor target values fig 4 presents the results for the mechanism based disinfection models for ms2 and icc for e coli the model would predict a constant removal independent of the sensor measurements as e coli was consistently removed by the mbr when using orp as a predictor for the microbial indicators the disinfection model predicts a constant lrv of 1 7 for ms2 respectively a constant concentration of intact cells of 5 4 log up to the orp baseline value of 450 mv above this baseline value there is an almost linear relationship between orp and both microbial indicators as the optimal dilution coefficient n in eq 9 is close to 1 when using fc as a predictor the disinfection model predicts a constant lrv of 1 7 for ms2 respectively a constant concentration of intact cells of 5 4 log up to the fcbaseline value of 0 02 mg l above this baseline value the microbial indicators are related to fc fcbaseline 0 3 where 0 3 is the optimal dilution coefficient the mechanism based sensor target values with 90 confidence intervals are presented in table 4 b note the disinfection model implicitly assumes that 18 o r p o r p b a s e l i n e n o r p k f c f c b a s e l i n e n f c where k k o r p k f c this assumption is discussed in si 5 3 5 comparison of recommended sensor target values the sensor target values table 4 were set in a way to minimize the fsr situations where the sensor value would predict safe water when the water is not safe to 5 this comes at the cost of overall accuracy as there are many events where the water is safe even at lower sensor values sensor targets for orp predicting lrv ms2 are generally consistent between the logistic regression models and the mechanism based model with somewhat higher orp targets for the mechanism based models which are thus recommended as target values bold values in table 4 in contrast there are some differences between orp targets predicting log10icc this is mainly due to the inconsistencies of the logistic regression models due to perfect separation of the dataset see section 3 3 for this reason the mechanism based sensor target values are recommended fc sensor target values using the mechanism based models are almost twice as high as those from the logistic regression models for both lrv ms2 and log10icc these higher targets for the mechanism based model can be attributed to the high standard deviation of the fc measurements leading to wide confidence intervals for the mechanism based model here the more conservative target values from the mechanism based models are selected too as they better reflect the variation of fc measurements at low fc values for the logistic regression based models there is a loss of information on the variability of the microbial water quality due to the binary classification 4 discussion 4 1 interpretation of e coli removal of enteric bacteria vs ms2 removal of enteric viruses vs icc regrowth in the tested mbr chlorine systems e coli was consistently removed by the mbr the quantifiable lrv was thus limited by the concentration in the feed and the reported lrv has to be interpreted as a maximum detectable lrv this result was expected as the nominal membrane pore size 0 04 µm is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the size of e coli 1 µm while e coli or other enteric bacteria indicators can be used to verify membrane integrity it cannot be used to evaluate the overall performance of a functioning mbr chlorine system inclusive other microbial threats including virus therefore e coli is not useful as the sole indicator for the determination of sensor target values unlike e coli the enteric virus indicator ms2 concentrations in the cwt varied as a function of the operation of the mbr chlorine systems the calculated lrvs are thus meaningful and can be compared with lrts determined through qmra for water reuse systems such lrts are usually calculated for specific combinations between a water source e g greywater and a reuse application e g toilet flushing the presented relationships between sensor measurements and lrvs can then be used to select a sensor target value for specific combinations of wastewater sources treated in a mbr chlorine system and aiming to produce water for a certain reuse application in contrast it is not possible to set concentration targets for icc based on qmra as the icc does not necessarily indicate presence or concentration of pathogens and is thus not directly linked to microbial risk however several studies have suggested that icc can be used to evaluate process performance cheswick et al 2019 van nevel et al 2017 while the icc may vary between water reuse systems there should not be abnormal changes in icc in the same system during normal operation we can thus define sensor target values that will ensure that the typical icc for a specific system is not surpassed 4 2 best performing sensors to predict the microbial water quality our results show that orp and fc are closely linked to the microbial water quality while turbidity and uv254 are not combining information from multiple sensors did not generally improve the prediction accuracy of logistic regression models 4 2 1 orp and fc are closely linked to the microbial water quality orp and fc were the only two sensors that were significantly linked to the microbial water quality with orp based models generally performing better perfect separation of the data for many logistic regression models lower relative standard deviation for mechanism based models this closer relationship for orp compared to fc is supported by three theoretical considerations 1 fc is the sum of hypochlorous acid hocl and hypochlorite ocl the speciation between these two compounds is determined by the pka 7 5 and is thus ph dependent hocl is the stronger disinfectant of the two species with a specific lethality for viruses and bacteria that is around 100x higher than for ocl kim and hensley 1997 this ph dependence of the disinfection capacity of the fc is accounted for in the orp measurements as ocl has a lower standard oxidation potential than hocl kim and hensley 1997 2 in the presence of ammonium there is formation of chloramines which also act as disinfectants but are much less efficient than fc kim and hensley 1997 measured free chlorine does not account for the disinfection by chloramines in contrast this increased disinfection capacity is accounted for in the orp measurement as the oxidation capacity of the chloramine is included in the overall orp 3 the response of orp to chlorine is logarithmic nernst equation which allows for an accurate detection of low chlorine concentrations this advantage of orp compared to fc is also visible in fig 3 where a complete separation of the microbial water quality indicators based on orp is possible but not based on fc leading to a higher accuracy of prediction for models using orp as an input to predict the microbial water quality the dataset used in this study captures the variability of the fc disinfection capacity due to changes in the ph and changes in chloramine concentrations as the testing was done under variable ph concentrations above and below the pka and included occurrence of ammonium in the treated water see si 3 the superiority of orp as a measure of disinfection capacity has also been observed and commented in other laboratory studies kim and hensley 1997 victorin et al 1972 for the practical implementation of orp and fc sensors two additional factors become important besides the strength of the link between sensor measurements and the microbial water quality 1 most fc sensors cannot be implemented without an online measurement of the ph to transform hocl concentration into fc which requires regular calibration or are only applicable in a restricted ph range e g 3 electrode sensors typically working for ph 6 9 2 non chlorine based orp may interfere with the orp measurements a study conducted by the water environment and reuse foundation sought to determine whether orp or fc is better suited to control chlorine dosing in wastewater treatment plant effluents werf 2005 the study concludes that for the chlorination of wastewater treatment plant effluents no technology was clearly superior for all criteria considered provide information to meet effluent requirements provide process control system reliability minimize requirements and minimize chemical use however orp had a lower correlation with fecal coliforms in the chlorinated water the main reason stated for the poorer performance of orp were fluctuations of the orp in the wastewater between 200 mv and 500 mv as a result of the weather conditions dry vs wet and of industrial discharge we expect the influent composition of decentralized water reuse systems to be less variable no dependency on the weather no industrial input however this needs confirmation from field campaigns 4 2 2 turbidity and uv254 are not linked to the microbial water quality online monitoring of turbidity is recommended by several wrfs and others have reported strong correlations between turbidity and the total cell concentration determined by flow cytometry intact cells damaged cells hess et al 2021 we assume that the lack of correlation between turbidity and icc is due to the low icc concentrations in the tested mbr chlorine systems compared to concentrations reported by hess et al 2021 1 order of magnitude higher who studied an mbr system without chlorine disinfection similarly online monitoring of uv254 can be used as a proxy for organic matter concentrations van den broeke et al 2006 however the organic carbon contained in the icc represents only a tiny fraction of the total doc 0 01 assuming 107 cells 1 µg doc ziemba et al 2020 natural variations of the doc of the treated water thus by far exceeded changes in doc caused by changes of the icc direct correlations between pathogen contamination and uv vis spectra have not been found to date carré et al 2017 although we demonstrate lack of correlation of turbidity and uv254 with the microbial indicators in the tested mbr chlorine system these sensors can provide information on membrane integrity and may also hold promise for alternative treatment schemes e g ozonation katko and højris 2019 4 3 comparison of logistic regression and a mechanism based models to define sensor targets there is an ongoing debate whether data driven or mechanistic models are better suited for the online monitoring of critical process variables solle et al 2017 the main advantages of logistic regression as a purely statistical approach lies in the low requirements of assumptions that need to be fulfilled and in the straightforward interpretation of results basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include only the independence of errors linearity of independent variables and log odds and the absence of multicollinearity stoltzfus 2011 key assumptions made for linear regression linear relationship between dependent and independent variable normal distribution of residuals and homoscedasticity are not required for the setting of risk based sensor target values where we want to limit the fsr logistic regression allows to transparently select corresponding sensor values in this study a major limitation of the logistic regression was the perfect separation of the water quality classes into two groups due to the small sample size and lack of data in the transition zones bootstrapping was used to estimate the confidence intervals however in the absence of prediction errors these confidence intervals were relatively narrow this led to an overconfident selection of sensor target values that may not capture the real variability in microbial water quality close to the recommended sensor target values bayesian analysis with non informative prior assumption has been recommended for logistic regression with perfect separation gelman et al 2008 however the resulting confidence intervals are very wide due to the relatively small size of the dataset see si 6 furthermore it was not possible to collect data in the transition zone for orp as the orp increased to high values as soon as there were detectable concentrations of fc in the water if the perfect separation also holds at larger sample sizes this would make orp an excellent indicator of the microbial water quality and delineate a clear threshold for sensor targets the mechanism based approach was a more adequate choice for the current dataset as the dataset is relatively small but we have knowledge about the main processes driving the microbial water quality i e retention in the mbr chlorine disinfection regrowth in the stored water while combining these processes follows a mechanistic approach the modelling of the disinfection process itself chick watson is phenomenological data derived such hybrid models building on understanding of mechanisms in combination with data driven methods are increasingly used to model water reuse systems as they combine the advantages of mechanistic interpretability of results and extrapolation power with those of data driven models e g learning unknown relationships schneider et al 2022 4 4 comparison with sensor target values from water reuse frameworks wrfs an inspection of 19 wrfs details presented in si 7 shows that most wrfs define different water quality classes depending on the reuse application setting stricter requirements for acceptable treatment technologies permissible contaminant concentrations and monitoring for higher risk applications some wrfs explicitly link the reuse application to different lrts such as the australian guidelines for water recycling nrmmc ephc ahmc 2006 and the western australian code of practice for the reuse of greywater department of health western australia 2010 however the majority of wrfs set requirements in terms of final concentrations in the treated water sometimes combined with higher monitoring frequencies for higher risk applications in terms of chlorine concentration the majority of wrfs set requirements for the total chlorine residual sum of free and combined chlorine depending on the water composition concentration of organics and ammonia the disinfection capacity of the total chlorine is significantly lower than the disinfection capacity of the same concentration of free chlorine kim and hensley 1997 many wrfs set a requirement of 1 mg l for total chlorine usually in combination with a minimum contact time e g 15 min or 30 min assuming all chlorine was present as free chlorine this would correspond to an expected lrv ms2 of 5 and log10icc of 4 5 for the mbr chlorine system in the current study table 4 which is relatively low for many of the reuse applications intended e g toilet flushing using the average sensor targets from table 4 as opposed to the recommended 95 upper confidence level we would predict 6 lrv ms2 and 4 5 log10icc however these predictions do not account for the variability in microbial indicator removal concentrations and sensor measurements and still assume that the 1 mg l of chlorine is present as fc overall it seems that wrf requirements for total chlorine may not be sufficient to ensure adequate virus removal in mbr chlorine systems designed for high quality applications only the californian requirements concentration time ct value of 450 mg min l with a contact time of at least 90 min i e a chlorine concentration of around 5 mg l requiring a lrv ms2 of at least 5 are more conservative than the sensor target values proposed in this study state water resources control board california 2018 however hirani et al 2014 reported that lower ct values of 30 mg min l are sufficient to meet california s title 22 disinfection requirements in mbr effluents currently no wrf sets requirements for the orp of the treated water but the canadian guidelines for domestic reclaimed water for use in toilet and urinal flushing report orp as a proxy to monitor the chlorine residual online health canada 2010 there are however various orp requirements in guidelines for bathing waters for instance the who recommends an orp of at least 720 mv although it is suggested that appropriate values should be determined on a case by case basis the german environment agency requires a minimum orp of 750 770 mv depending on the ph and the new south wales health protection australia requires an orp of 720 mv german environment agency 2006 new south wales health protection 2013 who 2006 these requirements are more protective of human health corresponding to lrv ms2 of 5 5 6 and log10icc of 5 4 5 in the current study compared to the typical 1 mg l total chlorine requirement for reclaimed water 4 5 applicability of sensor targets to other mbr chlorine systems the testing was performed with mbr chlorine systems that treated two different types of wastewaters with similar relationships between sensor measurements and microbial indicators this is an indication that the same phenomena may apply to mbr chlorine systems treating a range of wastewater compositions however measurements from other mbr chlorine systems will be required to validate the presented models and suggested sensor target values as this study does not report model performance on a separate test dataset for ms2 the removal was due to retention in the mbr and inactivation through chlorine for the retention of viruses in the mbr a review on virus removal in full scale submerged mbrs reports lrvs between 1 1 and 7 1 o brien and xagoraraki 2020 the ms2 removal attributed to the mbr in this study lrv of 1 7 is at the low end of the values reported in literature for the disinfection the two mbr chlorine systems used in this testing achieved complete nitrification most of the time with ammonia concentrations in the permeate below 0 2 mgn l resulting in low concentrations of chloramines overall the proposed sensor targets for lrv ms2 are thus conservative as the actual removal of viruses may be higher in other mbr chlorine systems due to higher removal in the mbr and the presence of chloramines during disinfection regrowth can be due to growth of suspended organisms and to detachment of biofilm in the storage tank the concentration of assimilable organic carbon aoc nutrients and the temperature have been shown to be important parameters determining regrowth of bacteria after ultrafiltration nguyen et al 2017 nocker et al 2020 in this study we used two different wastewaters thus introducing some variability in the treated water composition aoc nutrients in contrast the temperature was relatively constant throughout the testing if detachment of biofilm is a major contributor the inclusion of a biological activated carbon filter and flow variability are additional relevant parameters that will determine the icc in the treated water hess et al 2021 we thus assume that it will be necessary to recalibrate the icc models for mbr chlorine systems that do not include an activated carbon filter depending on the validation results using other mbr chlorine systems this study offers specific sensor target values for mbr chlorine systems likely for ms2 or approaches to set sensor target values for specific configurations of mbr chlorine systems likely for icc 5 conclusion orp and fc which are both proxies for the efficacy of chlorination are closely related to the microbial quality of reclaimed water treated with mbr chlorine systems while turbidity ph and uv254 are not we propose a mechanism based methodology to set sensor target values that are linked to the microbial water quality in a transparent way for orp and fc we recommend sensor target values for different microbial water quality targets in terms of virus removal and bacterial regrowth that can be linked to different reuse applications for the reclaimed water such a systematic approach to set sensor targets could be used in the development of wrfs that aim to cover a range of reuse applications with different risks to human health credit authorship

derived feedstock the present study therefore investigates to what extent a simple continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr represents a relevant alternative to ansbr to this end we operated two selection reactors cstr vs sbr on filtered primary sludge fermentate while performing a detailed analysis of the microbial communities and monitoring pha storage over long term 150 days and during accumulation batches our study demonstrates that a simple cstr is as effective as an sbr in selecting biomass with high pha storage capacity up to 0 65 gpha gvss 1 while being 50 more efficient in terms of substrate to biomass conversion yields we also show that such selection can occur on vfa rich feedstock containing nitrogen n and phosphorus p in excess whereas previously selection of pha storing organisms in a single cstr has only been studied under p limitation we further found that microbial competition was mostly affected by nutrient availability n and p rather than by the reactor operation mode cstr vs sbr similar microbial communities therefore developed in both selection reactors while microbial communities were very different depending on n availability rhodobacteraceae gen were most abundant when growth conditions were stable and n limited whereas dynamic n and p excess conditions favoured the selection of the known pha storer comamonas and led to the highest observed pha storage capacity overall we demonstrate that biomass with high storage capacity can be selected in a simple cstr on a wider range of feedstock than just p limited ones graphical abstract image

provided on an online repository and can be found under the doi provided in the manuscript 1 introduction the recovery of organic carbon c from municipal wastewater mww in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas bioplastics is more sustainable than its conversion into energy via biogas production hao et al 2022 a crucial step is however to select a biomass with a high pha storage capacity selection step after the capture of the organic c of the mww and its conversion into volatile fatty acids vfas via fermentation alloul et al 2018 the state of the art approach is to perform this selection step in a sequencing batch reactor sbr discontinuous operation estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 while wastewater treatment plants wwtps mostly operate in a continuous flow mode e g anaerobic fermenters the discontinuous nature of the sbr brings inconveniences such as steep gradients in oxygen requirements throughout the cycle as well as the need for high buffer volumes which could be avoided by using continuous systems marang et al 2015 a relevant opportunity to facilitate the implementation of pha production units at wwtps is therefore to perform the selection step a single continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr that could be integrated more easily to existing facilities already operating in a continuous flow mode however to date the selection of pha storing biomass in a single cstr remains poorly understood while it has never been demonstrated for mww derived feedstock the selection of pha storing biomass on waste derived feedstock is usually performed in sbrs operated in an aerobic feast famine mode sbr approach estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 where the biomass is sequentially exposed to presence absence of exogenous c substrate a main competitive advantage of pha storing organisms pha storers over non storing organisms is their ability to store pha under feast conditions and then to utilize such c source for growth during the following famine period reis et al 2011 it is therefore key that growth essential nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p are available during the famine period so that pha storers can use the stored pha for growth feedstocks characterized by an excess of these nutrients are thus particularly suitable for the selection of pha storers based on the sbr approach on the contrary a limited availability of those nutrients will inevitably hamper the selection of pha storers albuquerque et al 2007 johnson et al 2010 korkakaki et al 2017 while the availability of n and p greatly varies in mww derived feedstock dissolved cod n cod chemical oxygen demand and cod p ratios in the range of 5 70 gcod gn 1 and 38 1000 gcod gp 1 are reported in literature brison et al 2022b conca et al 2020 da ros et al 2020 soares et al 2010 ucisik and henze 2008 whereas nutrient limitation potentially starts at cod n and cod p ratios 25 gcod gn 1 and or 140 gcod gp 1 respectively tchobanoglous et al 2013 1 1 cod n cod p ratios at which growth can start to be n p limited the values were estimated by assuming typical cellular n and p contents of 85 mgn gcodcell 1 and 14 mgp gcodcell 1 and substrate to biomass conversion yields of 0 5 gcodcell gcodsubstrate 1 while such feedstock composition might be detrimental to the selection process in a sbr nutrient limitation might actually offer a relevant opportunity to select pha storing biomass in a single cstr in natural aquatic environments associated with nutrient limited conditions pha storage provides a competitive advantage to storing microorganisms ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 in engineered systems pha storage has for example been observed for high cod n p ratios in the influent anderson and dawes 1990 paul et al 2020 using a simple synthetic influent 100 acetate cavaille et al 2016 reported a pha content increase from 0 2 to 0 8 gpha gvss 1 in the biomass of a cstr exposed to a dynamic increase of the influent cod p ratio 400 3000 gcod gp 1 and srt 1 2 days further brison et al 2022a were able to select a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers at a constant influent cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 while using a synthetic influent more representative of mww derived feedstocks 50 acetate propionate but our current knowledge in selecting pha storers in continuous systems is limited to the use of synthetic influents with acetate propionate as the sole c substrates while mww derived feedstock often contains a complex mix of vfas acetate propionate iso butyrate iso valerate as well as non vfa substrate which can make up to 50 of the soluble cod morgan sagastume et al 2011 2014 also investigations were limited to high influent cod p ratios while nutrients other than p e g n can be limiting in mww derived feedstock brison et al 2022b da ros et al 2020 finally the composition of mww derived feedstock e g the cod n p ratio might be subject to natural temporal dynamics while dynamic environmental growth conditions such as in wwtps tend to provide ecological niches to pha storers pei et al 2022 while previous studies using synthetic wastewater provided strong evidence that a simple cstr can be used to select pha storers it is now essential to evaluate to what extent such reactor operation mode also works on real municipal ww the present study aims for the first time at investigating to what extent a simple cstr can be successfully used to select a biomass with a high pha storage capacity on a mww derived feedstock as opposed to a state of the art sbr the specific following questions were addressed i how does the reactor operation mode sbr vs cstr influence the selected microbial communities and in turn the pha storage capacity of the biomass and ii to what extent is microbial competition and the selection of pha storers influenced by nutrient n and p availability when using real mww derived feedstock to answer these questions an sbr aerobic feast famine mode and a cstr were fed with the filtered effluent of a primary sludge fermenter microbial communities pha storage substrate to biomass conversion yields as well as growth conditions with respect to nh4 n and po4 3 p were monitored over long term 150 srts in addition several pha accumulation tests were carried out with the selected biomasses 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall experimental approach two reactors an sbr aerobic feast famine mode and a cstr were operated in parallel as selection reactors over an extended period of 150 days and fed with mww derived feedstock both reactors had a working volume of 11 l several accumulation tests were performed to assess the pha storage capacity of the selected biomasses the overall experimental approach thus consisted of three sub systems i production of mww derived feedstock ii selection of pha storing biomass and iii testing the pha storage capacity of the selected biomass fig 1 2 2 detailed set up and reactor operating conditions 2 2 1 production of mww derived feedstock a continuously mixed 450 l fermenter 35 c 7 days srt hrt was fed with primary sludge from the eawag municipal wwtp to produce the mww derived feedstock the fermenter effluent was pre settled in a secondary clarifier and then filtered through a membrane module microclear mcxl newterra germany consisting of 9 double sided layers of 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes microdyn nadir germany and operated in outside inside mode the total membrane surface of the module was 3 m2 peristaltic pumps 530 ip31 watson marlow switzerland were connected at both outlets of the membrane module filtration was performed in six daily cycles of 2 h at an average flow of 1 5 l m 2 h 1 the membrane was backwashed twice a day for 15 min with the filtered permeate at a similar flux the filtered permeate was temporarily stored in a buffer tank before being fed to the selection reactors the storage time in the buffer tank was maximum 1 d while oxygen transfer was prevented with floating balls 2 2 2 selection of pha storing biomass double wall glass reactors with a working volume of 11 l were operated in sbr or cstr mode at an srt hrt of 1 day in order to maximize the substrate to biomass conversion yield the sbr was operated in aerobic feast famine mode the cycle duration and volume exchange ratio were 4 h and 0 17 respectively the cycle consisted of 3 phases i 5 min of feeding flow rate 0 37 l min 1 ii 230 min of reaction at constant volume and iii 5 min of withdrawal aeration and mixing were active during all 3 phases srt was controlled by purging mixed liquor at the end of the cycle i e 1 83 l without prior sedimentation nor supernatant decanting the cstr was fed at an average flow rate of 7 ml min 1 both selection reactors were equipped with temperature dissolved oxygen do and ph sensors endress hauser switzerland sensors were connected to a programmable logic controller plc and monitored by a supervisory control and data acquisition scada system in both reactors temperature was controlled at 25 1 c while do was controlled at a set point of 3 mg l 1 a mechanical stirrer ensured fully mixed conditions rotation speed 160 rpm the reactors were cleaned 2 3 times a week to remove biofilm from the walls the mww derived feedstock was supplied to the selection reactors from the buffer tank using peristaltic pumps 300 series pumpheads watson marlow switzerland the reactors were inoculated with high rate activated sludge since such systems select microorganisms i with a high affinity towards intracellular storage of organic c and ii at similarly low srts 0 1 2 days than the one applied in our experiment jimenez et al 2015 nogaj et al 2019 sancho et al 2019 samples for the analysis of the microbial communities chemical parameters cod n and p species and biomass pha content were taken twice a week sbr samples were collected at the end of the feast phase all parameters and at the end of the cycle only cod and pha the pha content of sbr biomass is subject to dynamics throughout the cycle and maximum pha content is observed at the end of the feast phase when all of the external c substrate is depleted in contrast the pha content observed in a cstr is always at its maximum since no substrate gradients occur therefore when comparing both selection reactors in terms of pha storage we considered the sbr samples from the end of the feast phase the end of the feast phase was deduced from the do and ph profiles as explained in si fig a1 the feast phase lasted on average for 35 15 of the cycle duration 2 2 3 pha accumulation tests pha accumulation tests were conducted in double wall glass reactors 5 l schmizo ag switzerland the reactors were equipped with ph temperature and do sensors all connected to a plc and monitored by a scada system mixing was ensured through magnetic stirrers the same temperature and do control was applied as for the selection reactors in addition ph was controlled at the average value observed in the selection reactors 8 2 through automated addition of a 3 m hcl solution pha accumulation tests were conducted on biomass from both selection reactors on days 108 115 136 and 143 the accumulation tests consisted of 3 l batches with a single initial pulse of soluble c substrate 2 l of mixed liquor from the selection reactor were mixed with 1 l of mww derived feedstock same influent than for the selection reactors to establish a similar bulk matrix e g in terms of trace elements to which the biomass was acclimatised in order

this study did not allow for a holistic estimation of the fraction of pha storers as performed by brison et al 2022a 2 5 calculations the selection reactors were compared in terms of biomass pha

microbial community the microbial communities in both selection reactors were monitored throughout the experiment fig 2 overall the reactor operation mode had little to no influence on the microbial community composition the cstr and the sbr were therefore characterised by similar microbial communities as shown by the analysis of both their composition and diversity fig 3 a si fig a2 comamonadaceae gen rhodobacteraceae gen and rhodocyclaceae gen were the most abundant taxa in both reactors accounting on average for 57 27 and 50 26 of the sequences in the sbr and cstr respectively the microbial communities selected in both reactors were very different from the microbial communities in the influent feedstock fig 3a indicating that the similar microbial communities observed in the sbr and cstr did not result from a process of microbial immigration from the influent in terms of dynamics a clear shift in the microbial community composition was observed in both selection reactors at around day 75 of the experiment fig 3b the microbial communities were indeed dominated by rhodobacteraceae gen in the 1st half days 75 of the experiment whereas commamonadaceae gen dominated in the 2nd half days 75 of the experiment the relative abundances of comamonadaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen therefor significantly changed between the 1st and the 2nd half of the experiment the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae gen decreased from 26 10 sbr and 20 15 cstr in the 1st half of the experiment to 8 8 sbr and 6 6 cstr in the 2nd half of the experiment in contrast the relative abundance of comamonadaceae gen increased from 9 13 sbr and 9 11 cstr in the 1st half of the experiment to 43 16 sbr and 36 10 cstr in the 2nd half of the experiment in contrast the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae gen did not significantly change between the 1st and 2nd half of the experiment and was on average 13 10 sbr and 14 14 cstr considering the genus taxonomic level the most dominant taxa among the selected comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen were comamonas sp zoogloea sp and an unknown rhodobacteraceae sp respectively si fig a3 comamonas sp accounted on average for 35 21 sbr and 31 12 cstr of the sequences during the 2nd half of the experiment the relative abundance of zoogloea sp was 2 2 sbr and 9 12 cstr during the 1st half of the experiment and 13 9 sbr and 11 8 cstr during the 2nd half of the experiment the unknown rhodobacteraceae sp accounted on average for 24 11 sbr and 16 16 cstr of the sequences during the 1st half of the experiment 3 2 how does reactor operation mode influence pha storage and substrate to biomass conversion yields in the selection reactors since similar microbial communities were selected in the cstr and sbr an important question is to what extent both selection reactors differed in terms of biomass pha content pha composition and substrate to biomass conversion yields figs 4 a c and 5 a c over the entire experiment the cstr was more efficient than the sbr in terms of substrate to active biomass conversion while no difference was observed between both reactors in terms of pha storage fig 4a c similar mean pha contents of 0 29 0 18 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 25 0 15 gpha gvss 1 and of 0 31 0 14 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 26 0 11 gpha gvss 1 were measured over the whole experiment for the cstr and for the sbr respectively also no statistically significant difference was observed between the mean hv hb ratio in the cstr 1 0 0 7 and the one in the sbr 1 4 1 2 however substrate to biomass conversion yields were much higher in the cstr as opposed to the sbr 0 26 0 09 vs 0 17 0 06 gcodxact gscodremoved 1 respectively similarily to the microbial community composition the pha storage also changed significantly over the course of the experiment in both selection reactors the pha content was thus significantly higher in the 2nd half days 75 compared to the 1st half days 75 of the experiment fig 5a more specifically the pha content varied around an average value of 0 2 gcodpha gpcod 1 during the 1st half of the experiment but then gradually increased up to 0 7 gcodpha gpcod 1 0 65 gpha gvss 1 and 0 6 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 54 gpha gvss 1 in the cstr and sbr respectively during the 2nd half of the experiment further the hv hb ratios gently increased throughout the experiment from 1 0 to 1 5 and from 0 5 to 2 0 in the cstr and the sbr respectively fig 5b finally substrate to biomass conversion yields remained relatively stable throughout the experiment as indicated by local regression and kendall s tau coefficients fig 5c 3 3 how does nutrient availability influence microbial selection and pha storage in the selection reactors nutrient availability was monitored in the influent and in both selection reactors throughout the experiment fig 6 a d si fig a4 a b the influent n availability relative to p and c substrate scod increased throughout the experiment fig 6a si fig a4 a the nh4 n po4 3 p ratio in particular tripled from 1 to 3 gn gp 1 as n availability increased in the influent n availability in the selection reactors also underwent similar temporal dynamics for both cstr and sbr fig 6b nh4 n bulk concentrations remained mostly 0 1 mgn l 1 during the 1st half of the experiment but then significantly increased to 40 mgn l 1 during the 2nd half of the experiment while nh4 n bulk concentrations increased by more than two orders of magnitude during the 2nd half of the experiment po4 3 p bulk concentrations remained relatively stable between 1 and 2 mgp l 1 fig 6c consequently nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk followed the same temporal pattern than nh4 n concentrations very low and stable values 0 1 gn gp 1 in the 1st half of the experiment followed by a gradual increase in the 2nd half of the experiment to values between 25 and 40 gn gp 1 fig 6d in terms of growth conditions nh4 n concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 together with nh4 n po4 3 p ratios 0 1 gn gp 1 suggest n was the limiting nutrient during the 1st half of the experiment during the 2nd half of the experiment neither n nor p may have limited growth as nh4 n concentrations increased dramatically and po4 3 p concentrations ranged between 1 and 2 mgp l 1 however the increasing nh4 n po4 3 p ratio in the bulk means that the availability of p relative to n was decreasing statistical relationships between i influent nutrient availability ii nutrient availability in the reactors iii microbial community composition and iv pha storage were studied for a combined data set due to the similarity between cstr and sbr with respect to the above mentioned variables fig 7 si fig a5 si table a1 the influent nh4 n po4 3 p ratio showed a strong positive correlation with nh4 n concentrations and nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk si fig a5 these three variables all correlated i positively with comamonadaceae gen and ii negatively with rhodobacteraceae gen fig 7 si table a1 in contrast the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae gen was only weakly influenced by nh4 n concentrations and nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk fig 7 finally nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk as well as comamonadaceae gen both had a strong positive correlation with the biomass pha content p 0 001 for the correlation between nh4 n po4 3 p and the pha content fig 7 si fig a5 3 4 to what extent does the reactor operation mode influence the pha storage response during accumulation batches previous results indicated a similar relationship between n availability and pha storage in both selection reactors an important question is thus to what extent a similar pha storage response towards the availability of n is triggered in both biomasses during pha accumulation batches pha content nh4 n concentrations and vfa removal were monitored during pha accumulation batches fig 8 si fig a6 representative examples of an accumulation batch i under n limited conditions left hand panels or ii in excess of n right hand panels are shown on fig 8 growth conditions were considered n limited at nh4 n bulk concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 the cstr biomass accumulated pha 2 2 accumulating pha is used here to describe an increase of the biomass pha content during the batch under n limited conditions only while the sbr biomass was able to accumulate pha whether n was limiting or in excess in contrast nh4 n bulk concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 suggested growth conditions with n in excess in the batch with n limited conditions both the cstr and sbr biomasses increased their pha content from 0 30 to 0 55 gcodpha gpcod 1 within 6 8 h the sbr biomass accumulated pha under n excess conditions also within 7 h the sbr biomass doubled its pha content from 0 24 to 0 49 gcodpha gpcod 1 in contrast the cstr biomass did not accumulate any pha during all 3 batches under n excess conditions si fig a6 overall pha accumulation was observed in 3 out of 4 batches for the sbr biomass but only in 1 out of 4 batches for the cstr biomass si table a2 the maximum pha content observed during an accumulation batch was similar for the cstr biomass 0 58 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 53 gpha gvss 1 compared to the sbr biomass 0 62 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 56 gpha gvss 1 si table a2 the average maximum pha content observed during the accumulation batches was 0 47 0 13 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 41 0 12 gpha gvss 1 and 0 55 0 08 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 49 0 08 gpha gvss 1 for the cstr biomass and the sbr biomass respectively during individual batches pha yields up to 0 5 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 were observed for both cstr and sbr biomass on average however pha yields were considerably lower for the cstr biomass 0 26 0 16 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 compared to the sbr biomass 0 41 0 14 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 also lower specific storage rates and hv hb ratios during the batches were observed for the cstr biomass as opposed to the sbr biomass si table a2 4 discussion 4 1 cstr as effective as an sbr in selecting pha storing biomass on a feedstock derived from mww the main objective of this study was to evaluate to what extent pha storing biomass can be successfully selected on mww derived feedstock in a single cstr as opposed to in a conventional sbr feast famine based selection process our results demonstrate that a single cstr can be as effective as an sbr in selecting biomass with a high pha storage capacity on mww derived feedstock indeed the maximum pha content observed during accumulation batches was similar for the cstr 0 58 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 53 gpha gvss 1 and the sbr biomasses 0 62 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 56 gpha gvss 1 si table a2 also the pha content measured in the selection cstr indicated that the maximum storage capacity of the cstr biomass was temporarily at least as high as 0 60 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 corresponding to 0 55 0 65 gpha gvss 1 fig 5a those values are comparable to the maximum storage capacities quantified via accumulation tests 0 4 0 8 gpha gvss 1 for biomasses selected in sbrs on real waste derived feedstock estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 apart from selecting a biomass with a high pha storage capacity the selection step should be as efficient as possible in converting c substrate into active biomass i e high substrate to biomass conversion yield our results demonstrate the cstr is significantly more efficient than the sbr in terms of biomass production with observed yields of 0 26 0 09 as opposed to 0 17 0 06 gcodxact gscodremoved 1 respectively fig 4c we hypothesize the low observed yields in the sbr resulted from the feast famine regime indeed the transient availability of external substrate in sbrs encourages bacteria to maximize their substrate uptake rate over their growth rate paul et al 2020 reis et al 2011 the larger the substrate uptake rate compared to the growth rate the more substrate is available as excess energy to the cell low and chase 1999 while part of the excess energy can be conserved in form of storage compounds e g phas the remaining excess energy is lost as heat generated by catabolic reactions low and chase 1999 thus by maximizing substrate uptake over growth the amount of substrate lost through catabolic reactions increases ultimately resulting in low substrate to biomass conversion yields in contrast substrate uptake rates in a cstr are limited by the low substrate concentrations maintained in the bulk liquid thus minimizing the imbalance between substrate uptake and growth rates consequently less substrate is lost through catabolic reactions in a cstr and higher substrate to biomass conversion yields are in turn observed compared to in an sbr overall our results clearly demonstrate that a simple cstr is i as effective as a feast famine sbr in selecting biomass with a high pha storage capacity on mww derived feedstock and also ii more efficient than the sbr in terms of c substrate utilization finally the pha contents observed in our selection cstr during the last 10 days of the experiment were 0 4 gpha gvss 1 which is the identified threshold value for a commercially viable recovery of phas from the biomass bengtsson et al 2017 further research should investigate whether and under which conditions such high pha contents can be maintained in the long term so that a subsequent accumulation step can be omitted and the entire pha production is simplified 4 2 similar microbial communities in cstr and sbr our results also indicate that the similar pha storage capacities of the cstr and sbr biomasses actually resulted from the selection of similar microbial communities fig 3a an important aspect to discuss is then i which and how many known pha storers figured among the dominant taxa in the cstr and sbr selection reactors and ii why similar pha storers have been selected in both systems comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen were the dominant families in our systems fig 2 taxa belonging to those families are often reported as the dominant pha storers in selection sbrs fed with waste derived feedstock albuquerque et al 2013 carvalhol et al 2014 chen et al 2014 janarthanan et al 2016 valentino et al 2018 the comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen observed in our study were mostly affiliated to comamonas sp zoogloea sp and an unknown rhodobacteraceae sp respectively si fig a3 both comamonas sp and zoogloea sp are known pha storers oshiki et al 2008 therefore the minimum average fraction of pha storers comamonas sp zooglea sp was 42 and 48 in the biomass of the cstr and sbr respectively during the 2nd half of the experiment when comamonas sp proliferated the pha storer fraction in sbr biomass selected on real waste derived feedstock typically ranges from 56 to 84 albuquerque et al 2013 jiang et al 2012 because on average 25 of the sequences could not be affiliated at the genus level we limited ourselves to estimate a minimum fraction of pha storers therefore one may be careful in comparing our apparent low numbers with other values reported in literature the rhodobacteraceae family enriched in the 1st half of the experiment contains many taxa endowed with pha metabolism e g paracoccus sp amaricoccus sp and rhodobacter sp morgan sagastume 2016 thus the unknown rhodobacteraceae sp found in our systems could be a putative pha storer however to avoid speculation no minimum pha fraction was estimated for the 1st half of the experiment in theory one would expect that different microbial communities are selected in a cstr as opposed to in the state of the art sbr as a result of the different growth conditions created in each system i e a constant famine vs a feast famine regime respectively accordingly marang et al 2018 observed the selection of different pha storers under constant famine conditions zoogloea in a continuously fed sbr than under feast famine conditions plasticicumulans in a pulse fed sbr surprisingly a key observation in our study was the selection of similar microbial communities and thus pha storers in the cstr and sbr a potential explanation might be the absence of a true feast famine regime in our sbr as indicated by the high feast famine ratio 0 54 0 23 in a true feast famine regime i e feast famine ratio 0 25 a stringent famine phase ensures that the biomass undergoes a physiological adaptation where substrate uptake capacity is maximized over growth capacity reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 consequently microorganisms with the highest maximum substrate uptake rates have a competitive advantage during the subsequent feast phase reis et al 2011 feast famine ratios 0 25 such as in our study however indicate that the famine phase is not long stringent enough to ensure the targeted physiological adaptation reis et al 2011 valentino et al 2017 consequently microbial competition might then be driven by maximum growth rate at given bulk concentrations rather than maximum substrate uptake rate reis et al 2011 since microbial competition in a cstr is also based on maximum growth rate and similar microbial communities were selected in both cstr and sbr our results highlight that when a true feast famine regime cannot be imposed the sbr approach creates a similar selective environment than the use of a simple cstr while reactor operation mode did not influence microbial competition in our study different microbial communities were selected in the 1st and in the 2nd half of the experiment fig 3b an important question is then what factor caused a change in selective pressure over time and therefore governed microbial competition in our systems 4 3 nutrient availability drives microbial community composition while reactor operation mode drives physiological state of the biomass our results indicate that the influent nutrient availability n in particular governed microbial selection in our systems during our experiment and in both selection reactors the constant increase in n availability in the influent caused significant variations of growth conditions in the two systems from stable n limited conditions before day 75 1st half of the experiment to a gradual increase in the n availability after 2nd half of the experiment fig 6a b this change in growth conditions in turn resulted in a major switch in the microbial community composition fig 3b more specifically n limited conditions favoured the selection of rhodobacteraceae gen unknown sp while comamonadaceae gen comamonas sp proliferated in the 2nd half of the experiment as n availability increased significantly over time figs 2 6b 7 taxa belonging to the rhodobacteraceae gen are characterised by a high transcript abundancies of nh4 transporters under n limited conditions indicative of a high affinity towards nh4 aanderud et al 2019 pfreundt et al 2016 which could potentially explain why rhodobacteraceae gen unknown sp were primarily selected under n limited conditions during the 1st half of the experiment nh4 n 0 1 mgn l 1 in turn representatives of the comamonas sp have a genetic predisposition to be very efficient in responding to environmental changes notably with respect to the regulation of nh4 n assimilation ma et al 2009 wu et al 2018 the long term dynamics over several weeks of n availability in the 2nd half of the experiment might thus have provided a competitive advantage to comamonas sp ultimately translating in the dominance of comamonadaceae gen in our systems another main result of our study is that pha accumulation was triggered more easily for the sbr biomass than for the cstr biomass indeed pha accumulation by the sbr biomass was observed during most batches independently of the n availability si table a2 in contrast pha accumulation in the cstr biomass was only observed in 1 out of 4 batches when growth was limited by the availability of n an important question is then why the response of the sbr and cstr biomass in terms of pha accumulation was different although associated with similar microbial communities we hypothesize the reactor operation mode had an influence on the physiological state of the biomass ultimately with implications on the pha accumulation response biomass selected in the sbr is typically in a state of internal growth limitation at the end of the cycle because microorganisms slow down synthesis of growth material enzymes rna after a prolonged absence of external c substrate reis et al 2011 this internal growth limitation stimulates excessive pha storage during the subsequent feast phase even though nutrients might not be limiting an accumulation batch very much resembles the feast phase of a regular cycle and pha accumulation under nutrient excess has previously been reported for sbr biomass korkakaki et al 2016a in contrast the cstr biomass is continuously exposed to low substrate nutrient concentrations and has no history with cyclic environmental changes when transferred to the accumulation reactor and therefore exposed to high substrate nutrient concentrations the biomass selected in the cstr might not be able to increase its substrate uptake rate relative to its growth rate after sudden exposure to high substrate and nutrient concentrations if there is no relative increase of substrate uptake rate compared to growth rate during the accumulation step the same relative amount of c substrate will be directed towards pha storage than in the selection reactor thus preventing a further increase of the pha content key for triggering pha accumulation with a biomass selected in a cstr is therefore to impose a lower nutrient availability than the one imposed during the selection step since our accumulation batches were performed with a certain level of nutrients resulting from the variable composition of the mww derived feedstock the maximum pha storage capacity of the biomasses especially the cstr one was presumably underestimated in order to correctly evaluate the maximum pha storage capacity of cstr biomass in particular accumulation batches should be performed under starvation of a nutrient e g n or p finally a main weakness of our study is the lack of accumulation batches during the 1st half of the experiment when growth was n limited consequently our results do not allow to conclude on the extent to which selection was successful under n limited conditions 4 4 cstr can select pha storing biomass in absence of p or n limitation so far the selection of biomass with high pha storage capacity in a single cstr up to 0 77 gpha gvss 1 and 90 pha storers has been studied under p limitation only and using acetate propionate as sole c substrates brison et al 2022a cavaille et al 2016 our results demonstrate for the first time that a single cstr can be successfully used for the selection of a biomass with a high pha storage capacity also in the absence of p limitation and on real mww derived feedstock i e on a more complex c substrate composition in particular the highest pha storage capacity of our cstr biomass up to 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 65 gpha gvss 1 was observed in the 2nd half of our experiment when neither p nor n were limiting growth figs 5a and 6b c an important question is then what were the potential drivers for this selection several possible mechanisms could explain the selection of pha storers in absence of n or p limitation i dynamic environmental growth conditions pei et al 2022 reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 ii the limited availability of a nutrient other than n or p such as iron sulfur etc steinbuchel and schlegel 1989 thingstad et al 2005 and iii the composition of the feedstock in terms of organic substrates i e the large fraction of vfas in the influent korkakaki et al 2016b pei et al 2022 dynamic environmental growth conditions such as in selection sbrs or in wwtps are known to provide a competitive advantage to pha storers pei et al 2022 reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 in the feast famine sbr approach transient availability of c substrate during the cycle favours the selection of pha storers reis et al 2011 in full scale wwtps the development of ecological niches favorable to pha storers results from the sequential exposure of the biomass to changing c substrate availability and or redox conditions along the treatment chain pei et al 2022 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 in both the selection sbrs or the wwtps the characteristic time of the dynamic growth conditions is therefore few hours however the cstr biomass in our study was neither exposed to a transient availability of c substrate nor to changing redox conditions over such short periods instead a gradual increase in the n availability was observed over several days weeks and it is unclear if how such conditions could provide a competitive advantage to pha storers another mechanism that could have triggered the selection of pha storers is a limitation of a nutrient other than n and p increasing cell size surface through storage of c substrate e g in form of pha allows bacteria to maintain high diffusive transport across the cell membrane and ultimately to improve their affinity towards a limiting nutrient ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 therefore a competitive advantage for pha storers could have resulted from any other nutrient limitation that triggers pha storage such as sulfate potassium magnesium or iron limitation steinbuchel and schlegel 1989 unfortunately our experimental design did not allow to pin point if and which specific nutrients might have been limiting growth in the 2nd half of the experiment finally a key aspect for the selection of pha storers is the composition of the c substrate pha storage requires readily biodegradable c substrate therefore the higher the fraction of readily biodegradable c substrate in the influent the more pha storage can be used as a competitive advantage by storing organisms in wwtps primary treatment removes slowly biodegradable particulate c substrate from the mww and in turn increases the fraction of readily biodegradable c substrate in the influent to biological treatment accordingly full scale wwtps equipped with primary treatment are associated with a higher fraction of pha storers than wwtps without pei et al 2022 our mww derived feedstock consisted of 80 readily biodegradable c substrate in form of vfas which serve as direct pre cursors to phas and are the preferred substrate for microbial pha storage korkakaki et al 2016b pei et al 2022 overall our results thus suggest that the use of mww derived feedstock where vfas represent a major fraction of the c substrate might be sufficient for the selection of a biomass with a high pha storage capacity in a cstr yet brison et al 2022a demonstrated that selection of pha storers on such favourable c substrate composition can be enhanced via p limitation i e nutrient limitation future research should now aim to better understand i which nutrients n p iron sulfate etc might be naturally limiting in mww derived feedstock and ii to what extent the limited availability of such nutrients other than p benefits the selection process 4 5 practical implications our results demonstrate that dynamics in the nutrient availability of mww derived feedstock may result in significant changes in growth conditions e g from n limited to n excess which in turn can cause a major switch of the microbial community composition and ultimately of pha storage capacity a robust selection process should however be able to maintain a stable microbial community over time in order to ensure a steady pha storage capacity a key aspect for practice an important question is therefore how to avoid fluctuations in the feedstock composition to better control the selection process over long term in our study the vfa rich feedstock was derived from the fermentation of primary sludge only from a primary clarifier the fermentation of primary sludge from primary clarifiers or micro sieves results in the production of a fermented broth associated with a low nitrogen availability brison et al 2022b in practice however a mixture of primary sludge and excess sludge from biological processes will be directed towards anaerobic fermentation brison et al 2022b as opposed to the fermentation of primary sludge only brison et al 2022b the fermentation of a blend excess sludge results in a vfa rich feedstock with a much higher n and p availability ucisik and henze 2008 yuan et al 2010 we therefore expect that the fermentation of a blend sludge should result in a more steady excess of n and p in the selection reactor thus preventing shifts of microbial communities as a result of fluctuating growth conditions further especially growth conditions with n and p excess led to a high pha content of 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 in the selection cstr we therefore suggest that not only a successful and robust selection but even the production of pha in single cstr might be possible under real conditions yet until it has been demonstrated that a pha content 0 4 gpha gvss 1 can be consistently maintained over long term in a selection cstr pha production will rely on an accumulation step following the selection step in that context our results suggest the cstr biomass must be exposed to stringent nutrient limitation starvation to achieve successful pha accumulation therefore industrial wastewaters containing too little nutrients to sustain growth in a selection reactor should be considered as feedstock for the pha accumulation step tamis et al 2014 2018 this is for example the case for effluents from potato starch factory morgan sagastume et al 2020 sugar factory anterrieu et al 2014 brewery ince et al 2000 or palm oil mill chin et al 1996 3 3 assuming threshold values of 25gcod gn 1 and 140 gcod gp 1 above which cell growth might be nutrient limited those threshold values were estimated by

recovery new york ny mcgraw hill professional and substrate to biomass conversion yields of 0 5 gcodcell gcodsubstrate 1 in return mww derived feedstock could then be entirely directed towards the selection step 5 conclusions a biomass with high pha storage capacity of up to 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 65 gpha gvss 1 was successfully selected in a cstr fed with mww derived feedstock the storage capacity of the biomass selected in such a system was similar to the one of the biomass selected in a state of the art feast famine sbr yet the simple cstr was 50 more efficient than the sbr in terms of substrate to biomass conversion yields the cstr selected biomass with high pha storage capacity in absence of p and n limitations meanwhile the exact mechanisms driving this selection remain unidentified but could potentially result from i the limitation of a nutrient other than n or p and or ii a favourable influent composition in terms of c substrate i e rich in vfas nutrient availability combined with the absence of a true feast famine regime in thesbr drove the microbial community composition as a consequence similar microbial communities were selected in the cstr and in the sbr stable n limiting conditions resulted in a microbial community where rhodobacteraceae gen was the most abundant taxon in contrast dynamic n excess conditions coincided with the selection of the known pha storer comamonas reactor operation mode however influences the physiological state of the biomass and ultimately the pha storage response during accumulation batches pha accumulation in the cstr biomass was triggered only when n was fully removed from the bulk while pha accumulation in the sbr biomass occurred also with n in excess declaration of competing interest the authors

19909,a key step for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas from organic waste streams is the selection of a biomass with a high pha storage capacity selection step which is usually performed in sequencing batch reactors sbr a major advancement would be to perform such selection in continuous reactors to facilitate the full scale implementation of pha production from municipal wastewater mww derived feedstock the present study therefore investigates to what extent a simple continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr represents a relevant alternative to ansbr to this end we operated two selection reactors cstr vs sbr on filtered primary sludge fermentate while performing a detailed analysis of the microbial communities and monitoring pha storage over long term 150 days and during accumulation batches our study demonstrates that a simple cstr is as effective as an sbr in selecting biomass with high pha storage capacity up to 0 65 gpha gvss 1 while being 50 more efficient in terms of substrate to biomass conversion yields we also show that such selection can occur on vfa rich feedstock containing nitrogen n and phosphorus p in excess whereas previously selection of pha storing organisms in a single cstr has only been studied under p limitation we further found that microbial competition was mostly affected by nutrient availability n and p rather than by the reactor operation mode cstr vs sbr similar microbial communities therefore developed in both selection reactors while microbial communities were very different depending on n availability rhodobacteraceae gen were most abundant when growth conditions were stable and n limited whereas dynamic n and p excess conditions favoured the selection of the known pha storer comamonas and led to the highest observed pha storage capacity overall we demonstrate that biomass with high storage capacity can be selected in a simple cstr on a wider range of feedstock than just p limited ones graphical abstract image

polyhydroxyalkanoates phas bioplastics is more sustainable than its conversion into energy via biogas production hao et al 2022 a crucial step is however to select a biomass with a high pha storage capacity selection step after the capture of the organic c of the mww and its conversion into volatile fatty acids vfas via fermentation alloul et al 2018 the state of the art approach is to perform this selection step in a sequencing batch reactor sbr discontinuous operation estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 while wastewater treatment plants wwtps mostly operate in a continuous flow mode e g anaerobic fermenters the discontinuous nature of the sbr brings inconveniences such as steep gradients in oxygen requirements throughout the cycle as well as the need for high buffer volumes which could be avoided by using continuous systems marang et al 2015 a relevant opportunity to facilitate the implementation of pha production units at wwtps is therefore to perform the selection step a single continuous flow stirred tank reactor cstr that could be integrated more easily to existing facilities already operating in a continuous flow mode however to date the selection of pha storing biomass in a single cstr remains poorly understood while it has never been demonstrated for mww derived feedstock the selection of pha storing biomass on waste derived feedstock is usually performed in sbrs operated in an aerobic feast famine mode sbr approach estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 where the biomass is sequentially exposed to presence absence of exogenous c substrate a main competitive advantage of pha storing organisms pha storers over non storing organisms is their ability to store pha under feast conditions and then to utilize such c source for growth during the following famine period reis et al 2011 it is therefore key that growth essential nutrients such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p are available during the famine period so that pha storers can use the stored pha for growth feedstocks characterized by an excess of these nutrients are thus particularly suitable for the selection of pha storers based on the sbr approach on the contrary a limited availability of those nutrients will inevitably hamper the selection of pha storers albuquerque et al 2007 johnson et al 2010 korkakaki et al 2017 while the availability of n and p greatly varies in mww derived feedstock dissolved cod n cod chemical oxygen demand and cod p ratios in the range of 5 70 gcod gn 1 and 38 1000 gcod gp 1 are reported in literature brison et al 2022b conca et al 2020 da ros et al 2020 soares et al 2010 ucisik and henze 2008 whereas nutrient limitation potentially starts at cod n and cod p ratios 25 gcod gn 1 and or 140 gcod gp 1 respectively tchobanoglous et al 2013 1 1 cod n cod p ratios at which growth can start to be n p limited the values were estimated by assuming typical cellular n and p contents of 85 mgn gcodcell 1 and 14 mgp gcodcell 1 and substrate to biomass conversion yields of 0 5 gcodcell gcodsubstrate 1 while such feedstock composition might be detrimental to the selection process in a sbr nutrient limitation might actually offer a relevant opportunity to select pha storing biomass in a single cstr in natural aquatic environments associated with nutrient limited conditions pha storage provides a competitive advantage to storing microorganisms ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 in engineered systems pha storage has for example been observed for high cod n p ratios in the influent anderson and dawes 1990 paul et al 2020 using a simple synthetic influent 100 acetate cavaille et al 2016 reported a pha content increase from 0 2 to 0 8 gpha gvss 1 in the biomass of a cstr exposed to a dynamic increase of the influent cod p ratio 400 3000 gcod gp 1 and srt 1 2 days further brison et al 2022a were able to select a stable microbial community consisting of 90 pha storers at a constant influent cod p ratio of 800 gcod gp 1 while using a synthetic influent more representative of mww derived feedstocks 50 acetate propionate but our current knowledge in selecting pha storers in continuous systems is limited to the use of synthetic influents with acetate propionate as the sole c substrates while mww derived feedstock often contains a complex mix of vfas acetate propionate iso butyrate iso valerate as well as non vfa substrate which can make up to 50 of the soluble cod morgan sagastume et al 2011 2014 also investigations were limited to high influent cod p ratios while nutrients other than p e g n can be limiting in mww derived feedstock brison et al 2022b da ros et al 2020 finally the composition of mww derived feedstock e g the cod n p ratio might be subject to natural temporal dynamics while dynamic environmental growth conditions such as in wwtps tend to provide ecological niches to pha storers pei et al 2022 while previous studies using synthetic wastewater provided strong evidence that a simple cstr can be used to select pha storers it is now essential to evaluate to what extent such reactor operation mode also works on real municipal ww the present study aims for the first time at investigating to what extent a simple cstr can be successfully used to select a biomass with a high pha storage capacity on a mww derived feedstock as opposed to a state of the art sbr the specific following questions were addressed i how does the reactor operation mode sbr vs cstr influence the selected microbial communities and in turn the pha storage capacity of the biomass and ii to what extent is microbial competition and the selection of pha storers influenced by nutrient n and p availability when using real mww derived feedstock to answer these questions an sbr aerobic feast famine mode and a cstr were fed with the filtered effluent of a primary sludge fermenter microbial communities pha storage substrate to biomass conversion yields as well as growth conditions with respect to nh4 n and po4 3 p were monitored over long term 150 srts in addition several pha accumulation tests were carried out with the selected biomasses 2 materials and methods 2 1 overall experimental approach two reactors an sbr aerobic feast famine mode and a cstr were operated in parallel as selection reactors over an extended period of 150 days and fed with mww derived feedstock both reactors had a working volume of 11 l several accumulation tests were performed to assess the pha storage capacity of the selected biomasses the overall experimental approach thus consisted of three sub systems i production of mww derived feedstock ii selection of pha storing biomass and iii testing the pha storage capacity of the selected biomass fig 1 2 2 detailed set up and reactor operating conditions 2 2 1 production of mww derived feedstock a continuously mixed 450 l fermenter 35 c 7 days srt hrt was fed with primary sludge from the eawag municipal wwtp to produce the mww derived feedstock the fermenter effluent was pre settled in a secondary clarifier and then filtered through a membrane module microclear mcxl newterra germany consisting of 9 double sided layers of 150 kda polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membranes microdyn nadir germany and operated in outside inside mode the total membrane surface of the module was 3 m2 peristaltic pumps 530 ip31 watson marlow switzerland were connected at both outlets of the membrane module filtration was performed in six daily cycles of 2 h at an average flow of 1 5 l m 2 h 1 the membrane was backwashed twice a day for 15 min with the filtered permeate at a similar flux the filtered permeate was temporarily stored in a buffer tank before being fed to the selection reactors the storage time in the buffer tank was maximum 1 d while oxygen transfer was prevented with floating balls 2 2 2 selection of pha storing biomass double wall glass reactors with a working volume of 11 l were operated in sbr or cstr mode at an srt hrt of 1 day in order to maximize the substrate to biomass conversion yield the sbr was operated in aerobic feast famine mode the cycle duration and volume exchange ratio were 4 h and 0 17

3 phases srt was controlled by purging mixed liquor at the end of the cycle i e 1 83 l without prior sedimentation nor supernatant decanting the cstr was fed at an average flow rate of 7 ml min 1 both

conditions rotation speed 160 rpm the reactors were cleaned 2 3 times a week to remove biofilm from the walls the mww derived feedstock was supplied to the selection reactors from the buffer tank using peristaltic pumps 300 series pumpheads watson marlow switzerland the reactors were inoculated with high rate activated sludge since such systems select microorganisms i with a high affinity towards intracellular storage of organic c and ii at similarly low srts 0 1 2 days than the one applied in our experiment jimenez et al 2015 nogaj et al 2019 sancho et al 2019 samples for the analysis of the microbial communities chemical parameters cod n and p species and biomass pha content were taken twice a week sbr samples were collected at the end of the feast phase all parameters and at the end of the cycle only cod and pha the pha content of sbr biomass is subject to dynamics throughout the cycle and maximum pha content is observed at the end of the feast phase when all of the external c substrate is depleted in contrast the pha content observed in a cstr is always at its maximum since no substrate gradients occur therefore when comparing both selection reactors in terms of pha storage we considered the sbr samples from the end of the feast phase the end of the feast phase was deduced from the do and ph profiles as explained in si fig a1 the feast phase lasted on average for 35 15 of the cycle duration 2 2 3 pha accumulation tests pha accumulation tests were conducted in double wall glass reactors 5 l schmizo ag switzerland the reactors were equipped with ph temperature

addition ph was controlled at the average value observed in the selection reactors 8 2 through automated addition of a 3 m hcl solution pha accumulation tests were conducted on biomass from both selection reactors on days 108 115 136 and 143 the accumulation tests consisted of 3 l batches with a single initial pulse of soluble c substrate 2 l of mixed liquor from the selection reactor were

microbial community the microbial communities in both selection reactors were monitored throughout the experiment fig 2 overall the reactor operation mode had little to no influence on the microbial community composition the cstr and the sbr were therefore characterised by similar microbial communities as shown by the analysis of both their composition and diversity fig 3 a si fig a2 comamonadaceae gen rhodobacteraceae gen and rhodocyclaceae gen were the most abundant taxa in both reactors accounting on average for 57 27 and 50 26 of the sequences in the sbr and cstr respectively the microbial communities selected in both reactors were very different from the microbial communities in the influent feedstock fig 3a indicating that the similar microbial communities observed in the sbr and cstr did not result from a process of microbial immigration from the influent in terms of dynamics a clear shift in the microbial community composition was observed in both selection reactors at around day 75 of the experiment fig 3b the microbial communities were indeed dominated by rhodobacteraceae gen in the 1st half days 75 of the experiment whereas commamonadaceae gen dominated in the 2nd half days 75 of the experiment the relative abundances of comamonadaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen therefor significantly changed between the 1st and the 2nd half of the experiment the relative abundance of rhodobacteraceae gen decreased from 26 10 sbr and 20 15 cstr in the 1st half of the experiment to 8 8 sbr and 6 6 cstr in the 2nd half of the experiment in contrast the relative abundance of comamonadaceae gen increased from 9 13 sbr and 9 11 cstr in the 1st half of the experiment to 43 16 sbr and 36 10 cstr in the 2nd half of the experiment in contrast the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae gen did not significantly change between the 1st and 2nd half of the experiment and was on average 13 10 sbr and 14 14 cstr considering the genus taxonomic level the most dominant taxa among the selected comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen were comamonas sp zoogloea sp and an unknown rhodobacteraceae sp respectively si fig a3 comamonas sp accounted on average for 35 21 sbr and 31 12 cstr of the sequences during the 2nd half of the experiment the relative abundance of zoogloea sp was 2 2 sbr and 9 12 cstr during the 1st half of the experiment and 13 9 sbr and 11 8 cstr during the 2nd half of the experiment the unknown rhodobacteraceae sp accounted on average for 24 11 sbr and 16 16 cstr of the sequences during the 1st half of the experiment 3 2 how does reactor operation mode influence pha storage and substrate to biomass conversion yields in the selection reactors since similar microbial communities were selected in the cstr and sbr an important question is to what extent both selection reactors differed in terms of biomass pha content pha composition and substrate to biomass conversion yields figs 4 a c and 5 a c over the entire experiment the cstr was more efficient than the sbr in terms of substrate to active biomass conversion while no difference was observed between both reactors in terms of pha storage fig 4a c similar mean pha contents of 0 29 0 18 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 25 0 15 gpha gvss 1 and of 0 31 0 14 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 26 0 11 gpha gvss 1 were measured over the whole experiment for the cstr and for the sbr respectively also no statistically significant difference was observed between the mean hv hb ratio in the cstr 1 0 0 7 and the one in the sbr 1 4 1 2 however substrate to biomass conversion yields were much higher in the cstr as opposed to the sbr 0 26 0 09 vs 0 17 0 06 gcodxact gscodremoved 1 respectively similarily to the microbial community composition the pha storage also changed significantly over the course of the experiment in both selection reactors the pha content was thus significantly higher in the 2nd half days 75 compared to the 1st half days 75 of the experiment fig 5a more specifically the pha content varied around an average value of 0 2 gcodpha gpcod 1 during the 1st half of the experiment but then gradually increased up to 0 7 gcodpha gpcod 1 0 65 gpha gvss 1 and 0 6 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 54 gpha gvss 1 in the cstr and sbr respectively during the 2nd half of the experiment further the hv hb ratios gently increased throughout the experiment from 1 0 to 1 5 and from 0 5 to 2 0 in the cstr and the sbr respectively fig 5b finally substrate to biomass conversion yields remained relatively stable throughout the experiment as indicated by local regression and kendall s tau coefficients fig 5c 3 3 how does nutrient availability influence microbial selection and pha storage in the selection reactors nutrient availability was monitored in the influent and in both selection reactors throughout the experiment fig 6 a d si fig a4 a b the influent n availability relative to p and c substrate scod increased throughout the experiment fig 6a si fig a4 a the nh4 n po4 3 p ratio in particular tripled from 1 to 3 gn gp 1 as n availability increased in the influent n availability in the selection reactors also underwent similar temporal dynamics for both cstr and sbr fig 6b nh4 n bulk concentrations remained mostly 0 1 mgn l 1 during the 1st half of the experiment but then significantly increased to 40 mgn l 1 during the 2nd half of the experiment while nh4 n bulk concentrations increased by more than two orders of magnitude during the 2nd half of the experiment po4 3 p bulk concentrations remained relatively stable between 1 and 2 mgp l 1 fig 6c consequently nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk followed the same temporal pattern than nh4 n concentrations very low and stable values 0 1 gn gp 1 in the 1st half of the experiment followed by a gradual increase in the 2nd half of the experiment to values between 25 and 40 gn gp 1 fig 6d in terms of growth conditions nh4 n concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 together with nh4 n po4 3 p ratios 0 1 gn gp 1 suggest n was the limiting nutrient during the 1st half of the experiment during the 2nd half of the experiment neither n nor p may have limited growth as nh4 n concentrations increased dramatically and po4 3 p concentrations ranged between 1 and 2 mgp l 1 however the increasing nh4 n po4 3 p ratio in the bulk means that the availability of p relative to n was decreasing statistical relationships between i influent nutrient availability ii nutrient availability in the reactors iii microbial community composition and iv pha storage were studied for a combined data set due to the similarity between cstr and sbr with respect to the above mentioned variables fig 7 si fig a5 si table a1 the influent nh4 n po4 3 p ratio showed a strong positive correlation with nh4 n concentrations and nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk si fig a5 these three variables all correlated i positively with comamonadaceae gen and ii negatively with rhodobacteraceae gen fig 7 si table a1 in contrast the relative abundance of rhodocyclaceae gen was only weakly influenced by nh4 n concentrations and nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk fig 7 finally nh4 n po4 3 p ratios in the bulk as well as comamonadaceae gen both had a strong positive correlation with the biomass pha content p 0 001 for the correlation between nh4 n po4 3 p and the pha content fig 7 si fig a5 3 4 to what extent does the reactor operation mode influence the pha storage response during accumulation batches previous results indicated a similar relationship between n availability and pha storage in both selection reactors an important question is thus to what extent a similar pha storage response towards the availability of n is triggered in both biomasses during pha accumulation batches pha content nh4 n concentrations and vfa removal were monitored during pha accumulation batches fig 8 si fig a6 representative examples of an accumulation batch i under n limited conditions left hand panels or ii in excess of n right hand panels are shown on fig 8 growth conditions were considered n limited at nh4 n bulk concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 the cstr biomass accumulated pha 2 2 accumulating pha is used here to describe an increase of the biomass pha content during the batch under n limited conditions only while the sbr biomass was able to accumulate pha whether n was limiting or in excess in contrast nh4 n bulk concentrations 0 1 mgn l 1 suggested growth conditions with n in excess in the batch with n limited conditions both the cstr and sbr biomasses increased their pha content from 0 30 to 0 55 gcodpha gpcod 1 within 6 8 h the sbr biomass accumulated pha under n excess conditions also within 7 h the sbr biomass doubled its pha content from 0 24 to 0 49 gcodpha gpcod 1 in contrast the cstr biomass did not accumulate any pha during all 3 batches under n excess conditions si fig a6 overall pha accumulation was observed in 3 out of 4 batches for the sbr biomass but only in 1 out of 4 batches for the cstr biomass si table a2 the maximum pha content observed during an accumulation batch was similar for the cstr biomass 0 58 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 53 gpha gvss 1 compared to the sbr biomass 0 62 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 56 gpha gvss 1 si table a2 the average maximum pha content observed during the accumulation batches was 0 47 0 13 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 41 0 12 gpha gvss 1 and 0 55 0 08 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 49 0 08 gpha gvss 1 for the cstr biomass and the sbr biomass respectively during individual batches pha yields up to 0 5 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 were observed for both cstr and sbr biomass on average however pha yields were considerably lower for the cstr biomass 0 26 0 16 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 compared to the sbr biomass 0 41 0 14 gcodpha gcodvfa 1 also lower specific storage rates and hv hb ratios during the batches were observed for the cstr biomass as opposed to the sbr biomass si table a2 4 discussion 4 1 cstr as effective as an sbr in selecting pha storing biomass on a feedstock derived from mww the main objective of this study was to evaluate to what extent pha storing biomass can be successfully selected on mww derived feedstock in a single cstr as opposed to in a conventional sbr feast famine based selection process our results demonstrate that a single cstr can be as effective as an sbr in selecting biomass with a high pha storage capacity on mww derived feedstock indeed the maximum pha content observed during accumulation batches was similar for the cstr 0 58 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 53 gpha gvss 1 and the sbr biomasses 0 62 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 56 gpha gvss 1 si table a2 also the pha content measured in the selection cstr indicated that the maximum storage capacity of the cstr biomass was temporarily at least as high as 0 60 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 corresponding to 0 55 0 65 gpha gvss 1 fig 5a those values are comparable to the maximum storage capacities quantified via accumulation tests 0 4 0 8 gpha gvss 1 for biomasses selected in sbrs on real waste derived feedstock estévez alonso et al 2021 valentino et al 2017 apart from selecting a biomass with a high pha storage capacity the selection step should be as efficient as possible in converting c substrate into active biomass i e high substrate to biomass conversion yield our results demonstrate the cstr is significantly more efficient than the sbr in terms of biomass production with observed yields of 0 26 0 09 as opposed to 0 17 0 06 gcodxact gscodremoved 1 respectively fig 4c we hypothesize the low observed yields in the sbr resulted from the feast famine regime indeed the transient availability of external substrate in sbrs encourages bacteria to maximize their substrate uptake rate over their growth rate paul et al 2020 reis et al 2011 the larger the substrate uptake rate compared to the growth rate the more substrate is available as excess energy to the cell low and chase 1999 while part of the excess energy can be conserved in form of storage compounds e g phas the remaining excess energy is lost as heat generated by catabolic reactions low and chase 1999 thus by maximizing substrate uptake over growth the amount of substrate lost through catabolic reactions increases ultimately resulting in low substrate to biomass conversion yields in contrast substrate uptake rates in a cstr are limited by the low substrate concentrations maintained in the bulk liquid thus minimizing the imbalance between substrate uptake and growth rates consequently less substrate is lost through catabolic reactions in a cstr and higher substrate to biomass conversion yields are in turn observed compared to in an sbr overall our results clearly demonstrate that a simple cstr is i as effective as a feast famine sbr in selecting biomass with a high pha storage capacity on mww derived feedstock and also ii more efficient than the sbr in terms of c substrate utilization finally the pha contents observed in our selection cstr during the last 10 days of the experiment were 0 4 gpha gvss 1 which is the identified threshold value for a commercially viable recovery of phas from the biomass bengtsson et al 2017 further research should investigate whether and under which conditions such high pha contents can be maintained in the long term so that a subsequent accumulation step can be omitted and the entire pha production is simplified 4 2 similar microbial communities in cstr and sbr our results also indicate that the similar pha storage capacities of the cstr and sbr biomasses actually resulted from the selection of similar microbial communities fig 3a an important aspect to discuss is then i which and how many known pha storers figured among the dominant taxa in the cstr and sbr selection reactors and ii why similar pha storers have been selected in both systems comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen were the dominant families in our systems fig 2 taxa belonging to those families are often reported as the dominant pha storers in selection sbrs fed with waste derived feedstock albuquerque et al 2013 carvalhol et al 2014 chen et al 2014 janarthanan et al 2016 valentino et al 2018 the comamonadaceae gen rhodocyclaceae gen and rhodobacteraceae gen observed in our study were mostly affiliated to comamonas sp zoogloea sp and an unknown rhodobacteraceae sp respectively si fig a3 both comamonas sp and zoogloea sp are known pha storers oshiki et al 2008 therefore the minimum average fraction of pha storers comamonas sp zooglea sp was 42 and 48 in the biomass of the cstr and sbr respectively during the 2nd half of the experiment when comamonas sp proliferated the pha storer fraction in sbr biomass selected on real waste derived feedstock typically ranges from 56 to 84 albuquerque et al 2013 jiang et al 2012 because on average 25 of the sequences could not be affiliated at the genus level we limited ourselves to estimate a minimum fraction of pha storers therefore one may be careful in comparing our apparent low numbers with other values reported in literature the rhodobacteraceae family enriched in the 1st half of the experiment contains many taxa endowed with pha metabolism e g paracoccus sp amaricoccus sp and rhodobacter sp morgan sagastume 2016 thus the unknown rhodobacteraceae sp found in our systems could be a putative pha storer however to avoid speculation no minimum pha fraction was estimated for the 1st half of the experiment in theory one would expect that different microbial communities are selected in a cstr as opposed to in the state of the art sbr as a result of the different growth conditions created in each system i e a constant famine vs a feast famine regime respectively accordingly marang et al 2018 observed the selection of different pha storers under constant famine conditions zoogloea in a continuously fed sbr than under feast famine conditions plasticicumulans in a pulse fed sbr surprisingly a key observation in our study was the selection of similar microbial communities and thus pha storers in the cstr and sbr a potential explanation might be the absence of a true feast famine regime in our sbr as indicated by the high feast famine ratio 0 54 0 23 in a true feast famine regime i e feast famine ratio 0 25 a stringent famine phase ensures that the biomass undergoes a physiological adaptation where substrate uptake capacity is maximized over growth capacity reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 consequently microorganisms with the highest maximum substrate uptake rates have a competitive advantage during the subsequent feast phase reis et al 2011 feast famine ratios 0 25 such as in our study however indicate that the famine phase is not long stringent enough to ensure the targeted physiological adaptation reis et al 2011 valentino et al 2017 consequently microbial competition might then be driven by maximum growth rate at given bulk concentrations rather than maximum substrate uptake rate reis et al 2011 since microbial competition in a cstr is also based on maximum growth rate and similar microbial communities were selected in both cstr and sbr our results highlight that when a true feast famine regime cannot be imposed the sbr approach creates a similar selective environment than the use of a simple cstr while reactor operation mode did not influence microbial competition in our study different microbial communities were selected in the 1st and in the 2nd half of the experiment fig 3b an important question is then what factor caused a change in selective pressure over time and therefore governed microbial competition in our systems 4 3 nutrient availability drives microbial community composition while reactor operation mode drives physiological state of the biomass our results indicate that the influent nutrient availability n in particular governed microbial selection in our systems during our experiment and in both selection reactors the constant increase in n availability in the influent caused significant variations of growth conditions in the two systems from stable n limited conditions before day 75 1st half of the experiment to a gradual increase in the n availability after 2nd half of the experiment fig 6a b this change in growth conditions in turn resulted in a major switch in the microbial community composition fig 3b more specifically n limited conditions favoured the selection of rhodobacteraceae gen unknown sp while comamonadaceae gen comamonas sp proliferated in the 2nd half of the experiment as n availability increased significantly over time figs 2 6b 7 taxa belonging to the rhodobacteraceae gen are characterised by a high transcript abundancies of nh4 transporters under n limited conditions indicative of a high affinity towards nh4 aanderud et al 2019 pfreundt et al 2016 which could potentially explain why rhodobacteraceae gen unknown sp were primarily selected under n limited conditions during the 1st half of the experiment nh4 n 0 1 mgn l 1 in turn representatives of the comamonas sp have a genetic predisposition to be very efficient in responding to environmental changes notably with respect to the regulation of nh4 n assimilation ma et al 2009 wu et al 2018 the long term dynamics over several weeks of n availability in the 2nd half of the experiment might thus have provided a competitive advantage to comamonas sp ultimately translating in the dominance of comamonadaceae gen in our systems another main result of our study is that pha accumulation was triggered more easily for the sbr biomass than for the cstr biomass indeed pha accumulation by the sbr biomass was observed during most batches independently of the n availability si table a2 in contrast pha accumulation in the cstr biomass was only observed in 1 out of 4 batches when growth was limited by the availability of n an important question is then why the response of the sbr and cstr biomass in terms of pha accumulation was different although associated with similar microbial communities we hypothesize the reactor operation mode had an influence on the physiological state of the biomass ultimately with implications on the pha accumulation response biomass selected in the sbr is typically in a state of internal growth limitation at the end of the cycle because microorganisms slow down synthesis of growth material enzymes rna after a prolonged absence of external c substrate reis et al 2011 this internal growth limitation stimulates excessive pha storage during the subsequent feast phase even though nutrients might not be limiting an accumulation batch very much resembles the feast phase of a regular cycle and pha accumulation under nutrient excess has previously been reported for sbr biomass korkakaki et al 2016a in contrast the cstr biomass is continuously exposed to low substrate nutrient concentrations and has no history with cyclic environmental changes when transferred to the accumulation reactor and therefore exposed to high substrate nutrient concentrations the biomass selected in the cstr might not be able to increase its substrate uptake rate relative to its growth rate after sudden exposure to high substrate and nutrient concentrations if there is no relative increase of substrate uptake rate compared to growth rate during the accumulation step the same relative amount of c substrate will be directed towards pha storage than in the selection reactor thus preventing a further increase of the pha content key for triggering pha accumulation with a biomass selected in a cstr is therefore to impose a lower nutrient availability than the one imposed during the selection step since our accumulation batches were performed with a certain level of nutrients resulting from the variable composition of the mww derived feedstock the maximum pha storage capacity of the biomasses especially the cstr one was presumably underestimated in order to correctly evaluate the maximum pha storage capacity of cstr biomass in particular accumulation batches should be performed under starvation of a nutrient e g n or p finally a main weakness of our study is the lack of accumulation batches during the 1st half of the experiment when growth was n limited consequently our results do not allow to conclude on the extent to which selection was successful under n limited conditions 4 4 cstr can select pha storing biomass in absence of p or n limitation so far the selection of biomass with high pha storage capacity in a single cstr up to 0 77 gpha gvss 1 and 90 pha storers has been studied under p limitation only and using acetate propionate as sole c substrates brison et al 2022a cavaille et al 2016 our results demonstrate for the first time that a single cstr can be successfully used for the selection of a biomass with a high pha storage capacity also in the absence of p limitation and on real mww derived feedstock i e on a more complex c substrate composition in particular the highest pha storage capacity of our cstr biomass up to 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 65 gpha gvss 1 was observed in the 2nd half of our experiment when neither p nor n were limiting growth figs 5a and 6b c an important question is then what were the potential drivers for this selection several possible mechanisms could explain the selection of pha storers in absence of n or p limitation i dynamic environmental growth conditions pei et al 2022 reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 ii the limited availability of a nutrient other than n or p such as iron sulfur etc steinbuchel and schlegel 1989 thingstad et al 2005 and iii the composition of the feedstock in terms of organic substrates i e the large fraction of vfas in the influent korkakaki et al 2016b pei et al 2022 dynamic environmental growth conditions such as in selection sbrs or in wwtps are known to provide a competitive advantage to pha storers pei et al 2022 reis et al 2011 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 in the feast famine sbr approach transient availability of c substrate during the cycle favours the selection of pha storers reis et al 2011 in full scale wwtps the development of ecological niches favorable to pha storers results from the sequential exposure of the biomass to changing c substrate availability and or redox conditions along the treatment chain pei et al 2022 vanloosdrecht et al 1997 in both the selection sbrs or the wwtps the characteristic time of the dynamic growth conditions is therefore few hours however the cstr biomass in our study was neither exposed to a transient availability of c substrate nor to changing redox conditions over such short periods instead a gradual increase in the n availability was observed over several days weeks and it is unclear if how such conditions could provide a competitive advantage to pha storers another mechanism that could have triggered the selection of pha storers is a limitation of a nutrient other than n and p increasing cell size surface through storage of c substrate e g in form of pha allows bacteria to maintain high diffusive transport across the cell membrane and ultimately to improve their affinity towards a limiting nutrient ovreas et al 2003 thingstad et al 2005 therefore a competitive advantage for pha storers could have resulted from any other nutrient limitation that triggers pha storage such as sulfate potassium magnesium or iron limitation steinbuchel and schlegel 1989 unfortunately our experimental design did not allow to pin point if and which specific nutrients might have been limiting growth in the 2nd half of the experiment finally a key aspect for the selection of pha storers is the composition of the c substrate pha storage requires readily biodegradable c substrate therefore the higher the fraction of readily biodegradable c substrate in the influent the more pha storage can be used as a competitive advantage by storing organisms in wwtps primary treatment removes slowly biodegradable particulate c substrate from the mww and in turn increases the fraction of readily biodegradable c substrate in the influent to biological treatment accordingly full scale wwtps equipped with primary treatment are associated with a higher fraction of pha storers than wwtps without pei et al 2022 our mww derived feedstock consisted of 80 readily biodegradable c substrate in form of vfas which serve as direct pre cursors to phas and are the preferred substrate for microbial pha storage korkakaki et al 2016b pei et al 2022 overall our results thus suggest that the use of mww derived feedstock where vfas represent a major fraction of the c substrate might be sufficient for the selection of a biomass with a high pha storage capacity in a cstr yet brison et al 2022a demonstrated that selection of pha storers on such favourable c substrate composition can be enhanced via p limitation i e nutrient limitation future research should now aim to better understand i which nutrients n p iron sulfate etc might be naturally limiting in mww derived feedstock and ii to what extent the limited availability of such nutrients other than p benefits the selection process 4 5 practical implications our results demonstrate that dynamics in the nutrient availability of mww derived feedstock may result in significant changes in growth conditions e g from n limited to n excess which in turn can cause a major switch of the microbial community composition and ultimately of pha storage capacity a robust selection process should however be able to maintain a stable microbial community over time in order to ensure a steady pha storage capacity a key aspect for practice an important question is therefore how to avoid fluctuations in the feedstock composition to better control the selection process over long term in our study the vfa rich feedstock was derived from the fermentation of primary sludge only from a primary clarifier the fermentation of primary sludge from primary clarifiers or micro sieves results in the production of a fermented broth associated with a low nitrogen availability brison et al 2022b in practice however a mixture of primary sludge and excess sludge from biological processes will be directed towards anaerobic fermentation brison et al 2022b as opposed to the fermentation of primary sludge only brison et al 2022b the fermentation of a blend excess sludge results in a vfa rich feedstock with a much higher n and p availability ucisik and henze 2008 yuan et al 2010 we therefore expect that the fermentation of a blend sludge should result in a more steady excess of n and p in the selection reactor thus preventing shifts of microbial communities as a result of fluctuating growth conditions further especially growth conditions with n and p excess led to a high pha content of 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 in the selection cstr we therefore suggest that not only a successful and robust selection but even the production of pha in single cstr might be possible under real conditions yet until it has been demonstrated that a pha content 0 4 gpha gvss 1 can be consistently maintained over long term in a selection cstr pha production will rely on an accumulation step following the selection step in that context our results suggest the cstr biomass must be exposed to stringent nutrient limitation starvation to achieve successful pha accumulation therefore industrial wastewaters containing too little nutrients to sustain growth in a selection reactor should be considered as feedstock for the pha accumulation step tamis et al 2014 2018 this is for example the case for effluents from potato starch factory morgan sagastume et al 2020 sugar factory anterrieu et al 2014 brewery ince et al 2000 or palm oil mill chin et al 1996 3 3 assuming threshold values of 25gcod gn 1 and 140 gcod gp 1 above which cell growth might be nutrient limited those threshold values were estimated by assuming typical cellular n and p contents of 85 mgn gcodcell 1 and 14 mgp gcodcell 1 tchobanoglous g l b burton r tsuchihashi and h d stensel 2013 wastewater engineering treatment and resource recovery new york ny mcgraw hill professional and substrate to biomass conversion yields of 0 5 gcodcell gcodsubstrate 1 in return mww derived feedstock could then be entirely directed towards the selection step 5 conclusions a biomass with high pha storage capacity of up to 0 70 gcodpha gpcod 1 resp 0 65 gpha gvss 1 was successfully selected in a cstr fed with mww derived feedstock the storage capacity of the biomass selected in such a system was similar to the one of the biomass selected in a state of the art feast famine sbr yet the simple cstr was 50 more efficient than the sbr in terms of substrate to biomass conversion yields the cstr selected biomass with high pha storage capacity in absence of p and n limitations meanwhile the exact mechanisms driving this selection remain unidentified but could potentially result from i the limitation of a nutrient other than n or p and or ii a favourable influent composition in terms of c substrate i e rich in vfas nutrient availability combined with the absence of a true feast famine regime in thesbr drove the microbial community composition as a consequence similar microbial communities were selected in the cstr and in the sbr stable n limiting conditions resulted in a microbial community where rhodobacteraceae gen was the most abundant taxon in contrast dynamic n excess conditions coincided with the selection of the known pha storer comamonas reactor operation mode however influences the physiological state of the biomass and ultimately the pha storage response during accumulation batches pha accumulation in the cstr biomass was triggered only when n was fully removed from the bulk while pha accumulation in the sbr biomass occurred also with n in excess declaration of competing interest the authors
