23670,the current damage stability criteria for ships are mainly based on the characteristics of the righting lever curve the related calculations for different intermediate stages during the flooding process and for the final equilibrium condition are generally considered trivial however with the increased computing capacity the regulations are developing towards a more realistic assessment of the intermediate stages of flooding most notably time domain flooding simulation has become a viable option consequently the practices and assumptions related to the calculation of the righting lever curve for a damaged ship need to be addressed this paper presents these challenges from different perspectives and reviews available numerical methods for assessment of damage stability sample calculation results with different methods are presented for various damage scenarios and the results are thoroughly analyzed and discussed finally some recommendations on using the different methods are given keywords damage stability lost buoyancy added weight progressive flooding simulation time dependency 1 background safety of life at sea has had an increasing priority in the maritime industry ever since the catastrophic rms titanic accident in 1912 and the development of the regulations has been mainly accident driven in this publication we are focusing on practical methods of assessing the safety of a ship after the hull has been breached i e the residual or damage stability the number of passengers in modern cruise vessels is of thousands levander 2011 and thus the society wants to ensure the safety of people in the case of a flooding accident regulatory or statutory requirements for the computational methods of assessment of the damage stability need to be clear and concise for the fair comparison of alternative designs consequently the numerical methods for damage stability analyses are of special interest the righting lever curve or simply stability curve for an intact ship was introduced in the pioneering work of atwood and de clairbois 1798 yet the first criteria for intact ships were developed much later by rahola 1939 since then the righting lever curve and its characteristics have been applied to determine the safety level of ships in various regulations initially this concerned only intact stability but later the righting lever curve has been adopted also for damage stability regulations a detailed overview of this development is presented in francescutto and papanikolaou 2011 the first safety of life at sea solas regulation in 1914 concerned only the subdivision and ensuring sufficient reserve buoyancy after a breach in the hull but the later upgrades of solas in 1948 and 1960 introduced requirements for a minimum metacentric height gm and maximum heel angle in damaged conditions eventually the solas 1990 introduced criteria for various properties of the righting lever curve in the current solas regulations the s factor that represents the survivability level is calculated from the properties of the righting lever gz curve in addition alternative methods for measuring the survivability have been presented recently e g within the goalds project papanikolaou et al 2013 and by cichowicz et al 2016 even these new approaches are based on the characteristics of the gz curve and consequently the calculation procedure for obtaining this curve is of special interest the real sequence of flooding progression can only be calculated with a time domain simulation of progressive flooding a review of this development has been presented in papanikolaou 2007 since then time domain flooding simulation has proven to be a useful tool also for accident analyses krüger 2016 with the increased computing capacity simulation has become a viable option for regulatory damage stability calculations especially for cross flooding analyses ruponen et al 2012 but also for a more realistic assessment of progressive flooding inside the flooded compartments ruponen and lindroth 2016 recently an advanced approach for combining time domain simulation results and the traditional s factor into a survivability performance index spi was introduced by dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in addition simulation can be used onboard a damaged ship for a rapid assessment of progressive flooding and the development of stability ruponen et al 2017 despite the fact that the recent development allows for a more realistic assessment of the flooding process the stability criteria in the regulations still mainly rely on the characteristics of the stability curve the calculation of this curve is generally considered trivial but the treatment of floodwater especially in the intermediate filling phases leaves room for different interpretations in this paper the concept of the righting lever curve is revisited with a review of alternative approaches for evaluating the progress of flooding in a damaged ship finally case studies are presented with discussion and analyses of the results 2 calculation of the righting lever curve the righting lever curve represents a ship s ability to withstand external heeling moments e g due to wind and waves when a ship heels to an angle ϕ the center of buoyancy is shifted from the point b0 to the point b ϕ the center of gravity g may also shift if there are liquid loads the lifting force of buoyancy δ is equal to the weight of the ship w but the directions of these forces are opposite this pair of forces results in the righting moment and the righting lever gz is the lateral distance between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy in the global coordinate system as illustrated in fig 1 this is evaluated numerically by fixing the heel angle and balancing the trim angle free trim and the draft so that the buoyancy equals the weight and reaching an equilibrium between the trimming moments in practice iterative procedures are needed but the required calculations are rapidly performed with modern computers by repeating this procedure for a range of heel angles the righting lever curve is obtained by fitting a smoothed curve to the set of evaluated points for an intact ship this procedure is trivial but for a damaged ship with flooded compartments the evaluation of the righting lever curve becomes more complex especially for a damaged ship it is essential that also the trim angle is balanced in the calculation of the gz curve in order to avoid overoptimistic results as pointed out by pawlowski 2016 for ships the assumption of a constant heeling direction is quite realistic but for floating offshore structures the evaluation of the gz curve even in intact condition should allow for free twisting of the structure as described in van santen 2011 in principle the gz curve for a damaged ship is evaluated with the same procedure but the floodwater needs to be considered in the evaluation of the center of gravity and or the center of buoyancy in literature two different methods for analysis of damage stability are presented the method of lost buoyancy and the method of added weight the basics of both approaches are well known to naval architects and are described in most of the distinguished text books such as nickum 1988 tupper 2013 and biran and lópez pulido 2014 for convenience a short description of both approaches is given in the following in the lost buoyancy method the flooded compartments are reduced from the buoyant hull with the permeability taken into account the situation is illustrated in fig 2 the mass and the center of gravity of the ship are unchanged unless there were liquid loads in flooded tanks that may have flown out thus the flooded compartments are in free communication with the sea meaning that the floodwater can freely flow between the flooded compartments and the sea if the ship moves e g due to an external heeling moment this assumption implies that the time available for equalizing the water levels in flooded compartments is infinite as the water levels are in hydrostatic balance with the sea furthermore the method cannot account for accumulated water above the sea level such as firefighting water or water on a ro ro deck in the added weight method the floodwater is treated as additional liquid cargo for compartments that are connected to the sea this method requires iterations for evaluation of the final equilibrium condition for example the accumulated water on the vehicle deck must be treated as an added weight since the method of lost buoyancy would result in an immediate draining of the water back to the sea if the floodwater level is above the sea level the same applies also for firefighting water for the final equilibrium after flooding both methods result in exactly the same floating position and static righting moment but the actual gm in damaged condition and the righting lever curve are different in principle with the added weight method subscript aw the static righting moment at heel angle ϕ is 1 m s t ϕ g z a w ϕ w w where w is the total weight of the intact ship and w is the total weight of floodwater with the lost buoyancy method subscript lb the righting moment is 2 m s t ϕ g z l b ϕ w since the displacement is constant in this approach consequently the following relation between the two calculation methods can be presented by combining the equations 1 and 2 3 g z l b g z a w w w w for extensive flooding cases the difference between the methods is considerable since w is large however the treatment of the amount of floodwater with different heeling angles can even have a bigger impact the lost buoyancy method limits the floodwater to the sea level in all flooded compartments but with the added weight method such a limitation is not usually applied and e g vermeer et al 1994 have used fixed amounts of floodwater at each intermediate phase time step of flooding 3 time dependency the flooding of a damaged ship is a time dependent process and subject to the case the time scale can vary from a couple of minutes to even several days this time dependency makes it difficult to provide a unique interpretation for the gz curve during the flooding process the time dependency of the flooding process has been noted already in the early research on damage stability welch 1916 however in practice the time dimension was introduced much later through the simplified method for estimation of the cross flooding time by solda 1961 eventually a time based sequential flooding analysis was presented by sen and konstantinidis 1987 but only recently the increased computing capacity has enabled true time domain flooding simulation also for ships with complex internal subdivision during the past decades several simulation tools have been developed e g spanos and papanikolaou 2001 jasionowski 2001 santos et al 2002 van t veer et al 2002 2004 ruponen 2007 2014 ypma and turner 2010 schreuder et al 2011 dankowski 2013 lee 2015 rodrigues and guedes soares 2015 and kim et al 2017 recently focus has also been on the dynamics of transient flooding manderbacka et al 2015a and acanfora and cirillo 2017 in general these methods use bernoulli s equation for calculation of the water flow through the openings also computational fluid dynamics cfd has been applied to flooding analyses e g gao et al 2011 hashimoto et al 2013 2017 and sadat hosseini et al 2016 but the slow computation time makes them unsuitable for practical applications in ship design and operation especially for larger numbers of cases in general the flooding process can be divided into three separate stages with different characteristics as presented e g in ruponen 2014 transient flooding progressive flooding steady state these stages are illustrated in fig 3 naturally the later stages can only occur if the ship survives the previous stage without capsizing or sinking the transient flooding stage involves complex dynamics and fluid structure interaction manderbacka et al 2015a usually this stage lasts only a couple of roll cycles about a minute and it is followed by progressive flooding through internal openings to other rooms this process can last from a couple of minutes to even several days depending on the damage case especially the non watertight doors inside the watertight wt compartments have a significant effect on this ruponen 2017 eventually if the ship does not sink or capsize a steady equilibrium is reached if the flooding does not take place in calm water this is more a quasi steady condition this behavior is evident from results of various model tests in waves e g papanikolaou et al 2000 the conventional approach is to calculate the righting lever curves for certain predefined intermediate stages based on an assumed progress of flooding a schematic example of such results is shown in fig 4 time domain flooding simulation can be used to calculate the development of flooding more realistically usually the main result of such an analysis is the time history of heel roll motion as illustrated in fig 5 for the damage cases that end up in capsizing or foundering of the ship the results will provide the time to sink however time domain simulations do not provide information on the residual stability of the ship during the flooding process unless the analysis is quasi stationary and the gz curve is calculated for the individual time steps the definition of the gz curve during the flooding process is not obvious and this problem has previously been discussed by dankowski 2013 the conventional approach is to consider various filling degrees for the flooded compartments in the intermediate stages however in order to evaluate the gz curve along the flooding process the time needs to be frozen while the ship is heeled to different angles and the righting moment lever is calculated based on the centers of buoyancy and mass thus during the progressive flooding each gz curve is associated to a frozen snapshot in time whereas the real situation is a continuous process fig 6 this assumption indicates that the heeling of the ship is done extremely fast when calculating the gz values consequently it would be reasonable to assume that there is no flow between the flooded compartments and the sea it should be noted that figs 4 6 actually represent the same example results from different perspectives the internal structures in the flooded compartments will restrict the free flow of water if the ship is heeled very rapidly the volumes of water will remain practically unchanged since there is no time for water to flow to other rooms through the openings on the other hand if the heeling is an extremely slow process the water levels in all flooded compartments will eventually be in hydrostatic balance with the sea i e part of the lost buoyancy these interpretations are illustrated in fig 7 the new revised explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 reg 7 imo 2017 state that for each phase of a flooding stage except the final full phase the instantaneous transverse moment of this floodwater is calculated by assuming a constant volume of water at each heeling angle the gz curve is calculated with a constant intact displacement at all stages of flooding only one free surface needs to be assumed for water in spaces flooded during the current stage this implies that the heeling of the ship is done extremely fast for the intermediate flooding phases and extremely slowly after the flooding process has finished consequently the recommended interpretation is not consistent moreover the explanatory notes do not contain any background information for the selected approaches the present study and the calculation examples intend to clarify the differences between the alternative methods for treatment of floodwater in the gz calculation and their suitability for various flooding scenarios 4 calculation of intermediate stages of flooding 4 1 background a crucial part of a damage stability analysis is to define the intermediate stages of flooding that will be calculated the explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 imo 2017 state that for each damage scenario the damage extent and location determine the initial stage of flooding calculations should be performed in stages each stage comprising of at least two intermediate filling phases in addition to the full phase per flooded space unrestricted spaces in way of damage should be considered as flooded immediately every subsequent stage involves all connected spaces being flooded simultaneously until an impermeable boundary or final equilibrium is reached furthermore it is assumed that the non watertight divisions considered in the calculations are limited to a class fire rated bulkheads and decks and do not apply to b class fire rated bulkheads normally used in accommodation areas e g cabins and corridors the current industry practice is to calculate all possible combinations of progression through a class fireproof boundaries as presented in ruponen and lindroth 2016 the drawback with this approach is that with complex a class arrangements the number of alternative intermediate stages can become enormous for a large passenger ship there can be several hundreds of a class stages in extensive damage cases even if some simplifications are done in the modelling the a class structures are a challenge for designers of passenger ships spigno et al 2015 lemoine et al 2013 have presented an alternative sequential flooding analysis method without actual simulation instead they have applied the simplified cross flooding time analysis for all subsequent flooding stages the main disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a lot of manual definitions and it cannot handle simultaneous flooding to different compartments in the present study three alternative methods are used conventional method conv time domain flooding simulation with damaged compartments treated as lost buoyancy sim ots and simulation with the breach modelled as openings sim breach the details of these methods are presented in the following sections 4 2 conventional approach conv in the conventional approach the sequential flooding is divided into different stages and phases a new stage includes flooding of a new room s and each stage is divided into a number of phases with different filling levels in the newly flooded room s a common free surface is applied for the set of fully flooded rooms the lost buoyancy method is used for the final phase of each stage and for all rooms that are flooded during the previous stages this approach is fully in line with the recommendations in the revised explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 imo 2017 the next intermediate phase is defined based on the difference between the sea level height and the water level height from the previous phase this height difference is divided by the number of remaining intermediate phases for the flooding stage if a stage with a total of n phases is considered the water level height in the i 1 th phase is evaluated from the following equation 4 h w i 1 h w i 1 n 1 i h s e a i h w i where h w i is the floodwater level and h sea i is the sea level at the floating position of the i th phase the principle idea is illustrated in fig 8 an alternative approach could be to apply steps with a constant volume change but the height steps are considered to provide better coverage of the intermediate flooding conditions also for the rooms where the free surface area changes significantly as a function of height in addition the height step approach is in line with the solas explanatory notes cross flooding is considered to commence first before the a class bulkheads collapse the simplified method of imo 2013 is used this is followed by all alternative a class stages denoted by n in the final stage all a class bulkheads are considered collapsed and all rooms within the damaged zones are treated as lost buoyancy the principle is described in ruponen and lindroth 2016 4 3 time domain flooding simulation sim ots sim breach in the present study the time domain flooding simulation tool in the napa software is used this method is based on the application of bernoulli s equation and semi empirical discharge coefficients for the openings a detailed description of the numerical method is given in ruponen 2007 2014 but for convenience a short presentation is given in this section the method has been successfully validated against both model tests ruponen et al 2007 and full scale flooding tests ruponen et al 2010 the applied method is based on implicit time integration with a pressure correction algorithm this has proven to be an efficient and accurate approach especially for damage cases that involve extensive progressive flooding to several compartments at each time step the conservation of mass must be satisfied in each flooded room 5 ω ρ t d ω s ρ v d s where ρ is density v is the velocity vector and s is the surface that bounds the control volume ω the normal vector of the surface points outwards from the control volume the velocities in the openings are calculated by applying bernoulli s equation for a streamline from point a that is in the middle of a flooded room to point b in the opening 6 a b d p ρ 1 2 u b 2 u a 2 g h b h a 1 2 k l u b 2 0 where p is air pressure u is flow velocity g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the water height from the common reference level all losses in the opening are represented by the non dimensional pressure loss coefficient k l consequently by assuming that u a 0 the flow through an opening with area ds is 7 d q c d 2 g h a h b d s where the semi empirical discharge coefficient is 8 c d 1 1 k l for cross flooding ducts and pipes the pressure loss coefficient k l is equal to the k sum used in regulations imo 2013 for openings such as open collapsed doors the industry standard discharge coefficient c d 0 6 is used this corresponds to k l 1 78 in this study the air compression effects are ignored and the air pressure p in all rooms are assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure the calculation within a single time step is iterative and the algorithm changes the pressures in the flooded rooms until both bernoulli s equation for each opening and the conservation of mass for each flooded room are satisfied with sufficient accuracy the floating position of the ship is then calculated based on the volumes of floodwater in the compartments the leakage and collapse characteristics of closed non watertight doors are accounted for by using the full scale test results of the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 whereas in the conventional approach different intermediate stages are calculated by assuming the internal structures to be either practically watertight or to collapse immediately both approaches are described in detail by ruponen and lindroth 2016 for progressive flooding through the openings the floodwater volumes at each time step are kept constant in the calculation of the righting lever curve thus assuming rapid heeling also in the final stage of flooding 4 4 modelling of the damage in flooding simulation sim ots sim breach there are two alternative approaches for modelling the damage in time domain flooding simulation as illustrated in fig 9 the current solas chapter ii 1 regulation imo 2017 assumes that the breached compartments are instantly flooded i e open to sea ots the same approach can also be used in simulation the approach to flood compartments instantly before simulation commences is denoted by sim ots alternatively the breach in the hull can be considered as openings connecting the damaged compartments to the sea simulation with openings representing the initial breach is denoted by sim breach this method has been widely used in flooding simulations e g dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in the present study the breach extents are taken from the subdivision used for solas so that the results are comparable to the conventional calculations however it is noteworthy that with large breaches the dynamic motions in the transient flooding phase can be significant manderbacka and ruponen 2016 consequently in the solas chapter ii 1 calculations the sim breach method can result in unrealistically large breaches that will overestimate the effects of the transient flooding stage in the present study both approaches are used and the results are compared and discussed 4 5 summary of applied calculation methods in this study three alternative methods are applied the conventional method conv normally used in statutory calculations is used as a reference in addition time domain flooding simulation is used with two different approaches for modelling the damage sim ots and sim breach a summary of the applied methods is presented in table 1 in all methods the righting lever is calculated using constant intact displacement the applied range of heeling angles covers both sides all calculations were performed with the napa software 5 case studies 5 1 case a cross flooding the first case study concentrates on a simple cross flooding scenario a large u shaped void is damaged on the port side and there is a cross flooding duct in the double bottom that enables equalizing flooding to the undamaged side of the void fig 10 the damage is limited both vertically and transversally so that the upper decks remain intact and consequently only the u void is flooded the gz curves for the final stage of flooding with different calculation methods are presented in fig 11 as expected all methods give exactly the same final floating position however simulation with a constant amount of floodwater results in larger righting lever values the reasons for this are illustrated in fig 12 when the ship is heeled towards the damage positive angles the additional floodwater above the sea level on the intact side of the ship increases the righting moment on the other hand when the ship is heeled away from the damage negative angles the righting lever is increased since the amount of water on the intact side is not increased these effects are more notable when the initial breach is modelled as an opening sim breach 5 2 case b longitudinal bulkheads the second studied scenario is a large collision damage to a single zone there is cross flooding in the double bottom and the two upper decks are divided by longitudinal a class bulkheads fig 13 there are four hinged a class fire doors denoted by d1 d4 that connect the rooms as illustrated in fig 13 all these doors are considered to be closed the leakage and collapse parameters from the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 are used the conventional approach to a class structures does not recognize the doors as the routes for progressive flooding instead all possible combinations of either fully watertight or collapsed bulkheads are calculated for this damage case it means five alternative intermediate stages as well as the final stage with all a class bulkheads collapsed all the flooding stages are illustrated in fig 14 the so called a class stages are denoted with n a constant time step of 5 0 s is used in the simulations the closed fire doors on the lower deck d1 and d2 in fig 13 collapse within 90 s but the doors on the upper deck d3 and d4 only leak since the pressure head does not reach the collapse threshold consequently the time to flood is quite long about 35 min the development of the heeling angle from the simulation results is shown in fig 15 and for different stages and phases of flooding with the conventional approach in fig 16 the modelling of the damage either as damaged rooms open to sea sim ots or with the breach as an opening sim breach affects only the initial phases of flooding and after the first minute the simulation results with both approaches for damage modelling are practically identical this case demonstrates the problem of simultaneous cross flooding and leakage collapse of non watertight structures time domain simulation is evidently the only realistic approach to calculate the intermediate stages of flooding for this kind of damage scenarios the revised explanatory notes to solas imo 2017 recommends that if both passive cross flooding devices and collapsing structures are faced at the same time cross flooding should be calculated first this is reasonable since these devices are designed to allow for a fast equalizing flooding whereas the leakage collapse of non watertight structures can take a much longer time ruponen 2017 righting lever curves for the different calculation methods are shown in fig 17 for the final equilibrium condition modelling the damage as a breach results in much larger righting moment levers especially at larger heel angles this is caused by the large damaged room car deck above the sea level at the final equilibrium fig 18 the breach to this room is large and consequently free communication with the sea is a realistic approach since the car deck would be rapidly flooded if the breach was temporary submerged due to an external heeling moment 5 3 case c extensive progressive flooding the third studied scenario is an extensive three compartment damage to the aft part of a large passenger ship fig 19 the studied ship design is a slightly modified version of the floodstand sample ship a kujanpää and routi 2009 the damaged compartments contain various store areas and there are several a class fire rated steel bulkheads providing non watertight subdivision inside the watertight compartments the damage considered is one similar to the ones defined for the probabilistic damage stability calculations in solas based on the wt subdivision limits for this particular case the damage length is 44 m and the penetration is 8 7 m the damage extends vertically from the base line up to the upper limit of the buoyant hull the time domain simulations were done with a constant time step of 5 0 s based on ruponen and lindroth 2016 a shorter time step would not significantly improve the accuracy in similar flooding cases the applied leakage and collapse characteristics are based on the floodstand results jalonen et al 2017 furthermore all doors are assumed closed the final stable equilibrium floating position is reached in about 2 h 40 min the development of the heel angle from the simulation results is shown in fig 20 for both approaches of modelling the damage the results are nearly identical in addition in both simulations the same eight non watertight doors collapse and the remaining 13 doors are only leaking most of the collapsed doors seven are located on deck 2 whereas most of the doors that do not collapse are on deck 3 the doors collapse within 2 min but due to the slow leakage the overall time to flood is very long a similar observation was made in a previous study ruponen 2017 where the status open closed of the non watertight doors was found to be a key parameter affecting the flooding time the conventional approach with all possible combinations of collapsing a class structures on the other hand becomes significantly more complex compared to the simulation the total number of stages generated exceeds 1000 even with minor simplifications in the arrangement where some adjacent rooms are considered to flood simultaneously the heeling angles for all calculated phases of all stages are presented in fig 21 the initial heel quickly drops during the cross flooding stage similar to the simulations this is followed by the stages representing the alternative combinations of flooding through the collapsing a class boundaries a wider spread of heeling angles is obtained as the asymmetry of flooding varies between different stages all the heel angles in fig 21 are between the maximum and minimum heel angles in the simulation results fig 20 at the final equilibrium stage all internal structures have collapsed and the rooms damaged are open to sea lost buoyancy the number of phases calculated in the simulation about 2000 with a time step of 5 s are far less than the number of phases in the conventional calculation 1000 stages with 3 phases each from a performance point of view it is noteworthy that the generation of a damage case with 1000 alternative stages also takes a considerable time the gz curves for the final equilibrium stage after flooding with the different calculation methods are shown in fig 22 similarly to the previous cases the modelling of the breach as openings in flooding simulation results in larger righting lever values especially at larger heeling angles the differences between the two methods for modelling the damage in flooding simulation are much smaller than in case b the reason for this is that the damaged rooms above the bulkhead deck are also smaller considering the fact that only one of the 13 closed non watertight doors on deck 3 collapses in this case the assumption of free communication with the sea seems to be quite unrealistic at least for the rooms above deck 2 6 discussion stability reserves in the form of a range and area in the gz curve are needed to provide a restoring force against time dependent external loads mainly waves and wind however the response of the ship e g roll motion under such loads is dependent on the inertia of the ship which in a damaged case is generally increased by the floodwater the time to roll the ship to the maximum heel angle is thus related to the roll period of the damaged ship manderbacka et al 2015b which in turn relates to the restoring force i e the gz curve as has been pointed out earlier the definition of the gz curve depends among other things on the assumptions made on the height of the internal floodwater surfaces and volumes either the surfaces are assumed to be equalized or alternatively not allowing any exchange of floodwater at all the time to equalize the floodwater surfaces is dependent on the proportion of the opening size with respect to the room volume this matter was pointed out by manderbacka and ruponen 2016 and the consequences were studied with time domain flooding simulations accounting for the dynamics moreover due to the complicated matter of dynamic interactions the floodwater motions namely sloshing may be important for wide rooms where the time needed to equalize the internal surface is dependent on the natural period of sloshing in the room it is nearly impossible to define this period for a damaged room with a varying amount of floodwater such effects should be separately studied with an aid of designated numerical simulation tools fonfach et al 2016 the dynamic effects are however beyond the scope of the presented research addressing and providing recommendations of practical means of estimating the residual stability of a damaged ship flooding simulation has several advantages when compared to the conventional calculation methods for example previous research on survivability of damaged passenger ships vassalos et al 2005 has brought up multiple free surfaces as a dangerous failure mode for ships with several decks below the bulkhead deck this phenomenon cannot be captured by the conventional approach with the lost buoyancy method applied to all flooded rooms however time domain simulation with the breach modelled as openings can model this condition realistically in reality the breach shapes are arbitrary with petalling of the hull plating li et al 2014 the extreme damage extent is used in statistics and regulatory calculations are normally based on the assumption that the whole wt zone is damaged resulting in a much larger breach size compared to reality as illustrated in fig 23 this should be considered when selecting how the damage in flooding simulation is modelled based on the presented examples the use of a constant amount of floodwater for the final stage results in larger righting levers than the conventional approach with the lost buoyancy method especially at large heel angles however the effects on the solas calculations might be smaller since the immersion of unprotected openings limits the applied range of the gz curve further studies on these effects are still needed the results from the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 demonstrate that non watertight doors can withstand pressure heads up to 3 5 m before they collapse the presented case studies and previous research e g ruponen 2017 show that several closed non watertight doors may not even collapse during the flooding however leakage through doors results in a slow progressive flooding this indicates that the assumption of free communication with the sea method of lost buoyancy is not always realistic hybrid methods where a heeling velocity s is associated with the gz calculation in flooding simulation could also be applied as suggested by dankowski 2013 however this approach makes the calculations more complicated and the suitable heeling velocity is difficult to define in addition the result should be independent of the set of heeling angles where the righting levers are calculated therefore the lost buoyancy and constant volume methods are considered more suitable especially for regulatory calculations 7 conclusions the righting lever curve and its properties are essential for damage stability assessments according to the current solas regulations with the increasing computational capacity the amount of analyses has expanded allowing for more realistic investigations of the intermediate stages of flooding especially in passenger ships the conventional approach to calculate all possible intermediate stages due to the non watertight internal structures can be computationally challenging time domain flooding simulation has been recognized as the best option to study the residual stability of a damaged ship during the intermediate stages of flooding several simulation tools have been developed and successfully validated the next step in this development is to extend the use of time domain analyses in damage stability assessment within the regulatory framework also for such studies the righting lever curve can be used to evaluate the stability characteristics in addition further studies on the effects of the calculation method on the s factors and the attained subdivision index are needed after all the thresholds for the current s factors were derived based on calculations for sample ships with the conventional approach tagg and tuzcu 2003 in general it can be concluded that the method of lost buoyancy is suitable for the final stage of flooding in damage cases without internal structures that significantly restrict the free flow of water in the flooded compartments this applies to tanks voids cargo holds and possibly even to large engine rooms however for the accommodation and store areas this assumption is often not realistic since the non watertight structures can significantly restrict the free flow of floodwater when the ship is heeled instead the use of constant volumes of floodwater for evaluation of the righting lever curve is considered to be more realistic in these cases based on the presented results it is recommended to model the damaged compartments as lost buoyancy in regulatory analyses this approach ensures that also the damaged rooms on the upper decks are flooded at large heel angles if the actual breach is modelled as openings the damaged rooms that are not flooded at the equilibrium floating position are considered empty also in the calculation of the gz curve this assumption can provide overly optimistic results in the damage cases that involve large rooms above the sea level such as a car deck however if the real breach extents are known as in accident analyses krüger 2016 or monte carlo methods dankowski and krüger 2013 the breach should be modelled as openings since this approach can accurately capture also the initial stages of the flooding process regulatory calculations are based on simplified breach sizes that are derived from damage statistics on the other hand in operative damage stability assessment the breaches can be estimated based on measured inflow of floodwater and visual observations here the exact damage extent is unknown but the breach size can still be estimated as presented in ruponen et al 2017 this approach is considered to provide more realistic prediction of progressive flooding than the assumption of lost buoyancy for the damaged rooms considering the increased computational capacity also damage stability calculations are developing towards more realistic approaches that properly account for the internal structures and progressive flooding in time domain therefore an explicit requirement for using the lost buoyancy method in the regulations should be avoided a more relevant issue is to specify the treatment of floodwater in the evaluation of the righting lever curve the most realistic approach depends on the studied case and the regulations should have enough room for interpretations in order to allow for feasible yet safe design and operation of ships 
23670,the current damage stability criteria for ships are mainly based on the characteristics of the righting lever curve the related calculations for different intermediate stages during the flooding process and for the final equilibrium condition are generally considered trivial however with the increased computing capacity the regulations are developing towards a more realistic assessment of the intermediate stages of flooding most notably time domain flooding simulation has become a viable option consequently the practices and assumptions related to the calculation of the righting lever curve for a damaged ship need to be addressed this paper presents these challenges from different perspectives and reviews available numerical methods for assessment of damage stability sample calculation results with different methods are presented for various damage scenarios and the results are thoroughly analyzed and discussed finally some recommendations on using the different methods are given keywords damage stability lost buoyancy added weight progressive flooding simulation time dependency 1 background safety of life at sea has had an increasing priority in the maritime industry ever since the catastrophic rms titanic accident in 1912 and the development of the regulations has been mainly accident driven in this publication we are focusing on practical methods of assessing the safety of a ship after the hull has been breached i e the residual or damage stability the number of passengers in modern cruise vessels is of thousands levander 2011 and thus the society wants to ensure the safety of people in the case of a flooding accident regulatory or statutory requirements for the computational methods of assessment of the damage stability need to be clear and concise for the fair comparison of alternative designs consequently the numerical methods for damage stability analyses are of special interest the righting lever curve or simply stability curve for an intact ship was introduced in the pioneering work of atwood and de clairbois 1798 yet the first criteria for intact ships were developed much later by rahola 1939 since then the righting lever curve and its characteristics have been applied to determine the safety level of ships in various regulations initially this concerned only intact stability but later the righting lever curve has been adopted also for damage stability regulations a detailed overview of this development is presented in francescutto and papanikolaou 2011 the first safety of life at sea solas regulation in 1914 concerned only the subdivision and ensuring sufficient reserve buoyancy after a breach in the hull but the later upgrades of solas in 1948 and 1960 introduced requirements for a minimum metacentric height gm and maximum heel angle in damaged conditions eventually the solas 1990 introduced criteria for various properties of the righting lever curve in the current solas regulations the s factor that represents the survivability level is calculated from the properties of the righting lever gz curve in addition alternative methods for measuring the survivability have been presented recently e g within the goalds project papanikolaou et al 2013 and by cichowicz et al 2016 even these new approaches are based on the characteristics of the gz curve and consequently the calculation procedure for obtaining this curve is of special interest the real sequence of flooding progression can only be calculated with a time domain simulation of progressive flooding a review of this development has been presented in papanikolaou 2007 since then time domain flooding simulation has proven to be a useful tool also for accident analyses krüger 2016 with the increased computing capacity simulation has become a viable option for regulatory damage stability calculations especially for cross flooding analyses ruponen et al 2012 but also for a more realistic assessment of progressive flooding inside the flooded compartments ruponen and lindroth 2016 recently an advanced approach for combining time domain simulation results and the traditional s factor into a survivability performance index spi was introduced by dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in addition simulation can be used onboard a damaged ship for a rapid assessment of progressive flooding and the development of stability ruponen et al 2017 despite the fact that the recent development allows for a more realistic assessment of the flooding process the stability criteria in the regulations still mainly rely on the characteristics of the stability curve the calculation of this curve is generally considered trivial but the treatment of floodwater especially in the intermediate filling phases leaves room for different interpretations in this paper the concept of the righting lever curve is revisited with a review of alternative approaches for evaluating the progress of flooding in a damaged ship finally case studies are presented with discussion and analyses of the results 2 calculation of the righting lever curve the righting lever curve represents a ship s ability to withstand external heeling moments e g due to wind and waves when a ship heels to an angle ϕ the center of buoyancy is shifted from the point b0 to the point b ϕ the center of gravity g may also shift if there are liquid loads the lifting force of buoyancy δ is equal to the weight of the ship w but the directions of these forces are opposite this pair of forces results in the righting moment and the righting lever gz is the lateral distance between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy in the global coordinate system as illustrated in fig 1 this is evaluated numerically by fixing the heel angle and balancing the trim angle free trim and the draft so that the buoyancy equals the weight and reaching an equilibrium between the trimming moments in practice iterative procedures are needed but the required calculations are rapidly performed with modern computers by repeating this procedure for a range of heel angles the righting lever curve is obtained by fitting a smoothed curve to the set of evaluated points for an intact ship this procedure is trivial but for a damaged ship with flooded compartments the evaluation of the righting lever curve becomes more complex especially for a damaged ship it is essential that also the trim angle is balanced in the calculation of the gz curve in order to avoid overoptimistic results as pointed out by pawlowski 2016 for ships the assumption of a constant heeling direction is quite realistic but for floating offshore structures the evaluation of the gz curve even in intact condition should allow for free twisting of the structure as described in van santen 2011 in principle the gz curve for a damaged ship is evaluated with the same procedure but the floodwater needs to be considered in the evaluation of the center of gravity and or the center of buoyancy in literature two different methods for analysis of damage stability are presented the method of lost buoyancy and the method of added weight the basics of both approaches are well known to naval architects and are described in most of the distinguished text books such as nickum 1988 tupper 2013 and biran and lópez pulido 2014 for convenience a short description of both approaches is given in the following in the lost buoyancy method the flooded compartments are reduced from the buoyant hull with the permeability taken into account the situation is illustrated in fig 2 the mass and the center of gravity of the ship are unchanged unless there were liquid loads in flooded tanks that may have flown out thus the flooded compartments are in free communication with the sea meaning that the floodwater can freely flow between the flooded compartments and the sea if the ship moves e g due to an external heeling moment this assumption implies that the time available for equalizing the water levels in flooded compartments is infinite as the water levels are in hydrostatic balance with the sea furthermore the method cannot account for accumulated water above the sea level such as firefighting water or water on a ro ro deck in the added weight method the floodwater is treated as additional liquid cargo for compartments that are connected to the sea this method requires iterations for evaluation of the final equilibrium condition for example the accumulated water on the vehicle deck must be treated as an added weight since the method of lost buoyancy would result in an immediate draining of the water back to the sea if the floodwater level is above the sea level the same applies also for firefighting water for the final equilibrium after flooding both methods result in exactly the same floating position and static righting moment but the actual gm in damaged condition and the righting lever curve are different in principle with the added weight method subscript aw the static righting moment at heel angle ϕ is 1 m s t ϕ g z a w ϕ w w where w is the total weight of the intact ship and w is the total weight of floodwater with the lost buoyancy method subscript lb the righting moment is 2 m s t ϕ g z l b ϕ w since the displacement is constant in this approach consequently the following relation between the two calculation methods can be presented by combining the equations 1 and 2 3 g z l b g z a w w w w for extensive flooding cases the difference between the methods is considerable since w is large however the treatment of the amount of floodwater with different heeling angles can even have a bigger impact the lost buoyancy method limits the floodwater to the sea level in all flooded compartments but with the added weight method such a limitation is not usually applied and e g vermeer et al 1994 have used fixed amounts of floodwater at each intermediate phase time step of flooding 3 time dependency the flooding of a damaged ship is a time dependent process and subject to the case the time scale can vary from a couple of minutes to even several days this time dependency makes it difficult to provide a unique interpretation for the gz curve during the flooding process the time dependency of the flooding process has been noted already in the early research on damage stability welch 1916 however in practice the time dimension was introduced much later through the simplified method for estimation of the cross flooding time by solda 1961 eventually a time based sequential flooding analysis was presented by sen and konstantinidis 1987 but only recently the increased computing capacity has enabled true time domain flooding simulation also for ships with complex internal subdivision during the past decades several simulation tools have been developed e g spanos and papanikolaou 2001 jasionowski 2001 santos et al 2002 van t veer et al 2002 2004 ruponen 2007 2014 ypma and turner 2010 schreuder et al 2011 dankowski 2013 lee 2015 rodrigues and guedes soares 2015 and kim et al 2017 recently focus has also been on the dynamics of transient flooding manderbacka et al 2015a and acanfora and cirillo 2017 in general these methods use bernoulli s equation for calculation of the water flow through the openings also computational fluid dynamics cfd has been applied to flooding analyses e g gao et al 2011 hashimoto et al 2013 2017 and sadat hosseini et al 2016 but the slow computation time makes them unsuitable for practical applications in ship design and operation especially for larger numbers of cases in general the flooding process can be divided into three separate stages with different characteristics as presented e g in ruponen 2014 transient flooding progressive flooding steady state these stages are illustrated in fig 3 naturally the later stages can only occur if the ship survives the previous stage without capsizing or sinking the transient flooding stage involves complex dynamics and fluid structure interaction manderbacka et al 2015a usually this stage lasts only a couple of roll cycles about a minute and it is followed by progressive flooding through internal openings to other rooms this process can last from a couple of minutes to even several days depending on the damage case especially the non watertight doors inside the watertight wt compartments have a significant effect on this ruponen 2017 eventually if the ship does not sink or capsize a steady equilibrium is reached if the flooding does not take place in calm water this is more a quasi steady condition this behavior is evident from results of various model tests in waves e g papanikolaou et al 2000 the conventional approach is to calculate the righting lever curves for certain predefined intermediate stages based on an assumed progress of flooding a schematic example of such results is shown in fig 4 time domain flooding simulation can be used to calculate the development of flooding more realistically usually the main result of such an analysis is the time history of heel roll motion as illustrated in fig 5 for the damage cases that end up in capsizing or foundering of the ship the results will provide the time to sink however time domain simulations do not provide information on the residual stability of the ship during the flooding process unless the analysis is quasi stationary and the gz curve is calculated for the individual time steps the definition of the gz curve during the flooding process is not obvious and this problem has previously been discussed by dankowski 2013 the conventional approach is to consider various filling degrees for the flooded compartments in the intermediate stages however in order to evaluate the gz curve along the flooding process the time needs to be frozen while the ship is heeled to different angles and the righting moment lever is calculated based on the centers of buoyancy and mass thus during the progressive flooding each gz curve is associated to a frozen snapshot in time whereas the real situation is a continuous process fig 6 this assumption indicates that the heeling of the ship is done extremely fast when calculating the gz values consequently it would be reasonable to assume that there is no flow between the flooded compartments and the sea it should be noted that figs 4 6 actually represent the same example results from different perspectives the internal structures in the flooded compartments will restrict the free flow of water if the ship is heeled very rapidly the volumes of water will remain practically unchanged since there is no time for water to flow to other rooms through the openings on the other hand if the heeling is an extremely slow process the water levels in all flooded compartments will eventually be in hydrostatic balance with the sea i e part of the lost buoyancy these interpretations are illustrated in fig 7 the new revised explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 reg 7 imo 2017 state that for each phase of a flooding stage except the final full phase the instantaneous transverse moment of this floodwater is calculated by assuming a constant volume of water at each heeling angle the gz curve is calculated with a constant intact displacement at all stages of flooding only one free surface needs to be assumed for water in spaces flooded during the current stage this implies that the heeling of the ship is done extremely fast for the intermediate flooding phases and extremely slowly after the flooding process has finished consequently the recommended interpretation is not consistent moreover the explanatory notes do not contain any background information for the selected approaches the present study and the calculation examples intend to clarify the differences between the alternative methods for treatment of floodwater in the gz calculation and their suitability for various flooding scenarios 4 calculation of intermediate stages of flooding 4 1 background a crucial part of a damage stability analysis is to define the intermediate stages of flooding that will be calculated the explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 imo 2017 state that for each damage scenario the damage extent and location determine the initial stage of flooding calculations should be performed in stages each stage comprising of at least two intermediate filling phases in addition to the full phase per flooded space unrestricted spaces in way of damage should be considered as flooded immediately every subsequent stage involves all connected spaces being flooded simultaneously until an impermeable boundary or final equilibrium is reached furthermore it is assumed that the non watertight divisions considered in the calculations are limited to a class fire rated bulkheads and decks and do not apply to b class fire rated bulkheads normally used in accommodation areas e g cabins and corridors the current industry practice is to calculate all possible combinations of progression through a class fireproof boundaries as presented in ruponen and lindroth 2016 the drawback with this approach is that with complex a class arrangements the number of alternative intermediate stages can become enormous for a large passenger ship there can be several hundreds of a class stages in extensive damage cases even if some simplifications are done in the modelling the a class structures are a challenge for designers of passenger ships spigno et al 2015 lemoine et al 2013 have presented an alternative sequential flooding analysis method without actual simulation instead they have applied the simplified cross flooding time analysis for all subsequent flooding stages the main disadvantage of this approach is that it requires a lot of manual definitions and it cannot handle simultaneous flooding to different compartments in the present study three alternative methods are used conventional method conv time domain flooding simulation with damaged compartments treated as lost buoyancy sim ots and simulation with the breach modelled as openings sim breach the details of these methods are presented in the following sections 4 2 conventional approach conv in the conventional approach the sequential flooding is divided into different stages and phases a new stage includes flooding of a new room s and each stage is divided into a number of phases with different filling levels in the newly flooded room s a common free surface is applied for the set of fully flooded rooms the lost buoyancy method is used for the final phase of each stage and for all rooms that are flooded during the previous stages this approach is fully in line with the recommendations in the revised explanatory notes for solas chapter ii 1 imo 2017 the next intermediate phase is defined based on the difference between the sea level height and the water level height from the previous phase this height difference is divided by the number of remaining intermediate phases for the flooding stage if a stage with a total of n phases is considered the water level height in the i 1 th phase is evaluated from the following equation 4 h w i 1 h w i 1 n 1 i h s e a i h w i where h w i is the floodwater level and h sea i is the sea level at the floating position of the i th phase the principle idea is illustrated in fig 8 an alternative approach could be to apply steps with a constant volume change but the height steps are considered to provide better coverage of the intermediate flooding conditions also for the rooms where the free surface area changes significantly as a function of height in addition the height step approach is in line with the solas explanatory notes cross flooding is considered to commence first before the a class bulkheads collapse the simplified method of imo 2013 is used this is followed by all alternative a class stages denoted by n in the final stage all a class bulkheads are considered collapsed and all rooms within the damaged zones are treated as lost buoyancy the principle is described in ruponen and lindroth 2016 4 3 time domain flooding simulation sim ots sim breach in the present study the time domain flooding simulation tool in the napa software is used this method is based on the application of bernoulli s equation and semi empirical discharge coefficients for the openings a detailed description of the numerical method is given in ruponen 2007 2014 but for convenience a short presentation is given in this section the method has been successfully validated against both model tests ruponen et al 2007 and full scale flooding tests ruponen et al 2010 the applied method is based on implicit time integration with a pressure correction algorithm this has proven to be an efficient and accurate approach especially for damage cases that involve extensive progressive flooding to several compartments at each time step the conservation of mass must be satisfied in each flooded room 5 ω ρ t d ω s ρ v d s where ρ is density v is the velocity vector and s is the surface that bounds the control volume ω the normal vector of the surface points outwards from the control volume the velocities in the openings are calculated by applying bernoulli s equation for a streamline from point a that is in the middle of a flooded room to point b in the opening 6 a b d p ρ 1 2 u b 2 u a 2 g h b h a 1 2 k l u b 2 0 where p is air pressure u is flow velocity g is acceleration due to gravity and h is the water height from the common reference level all losses in the opening are represented by the non dimensional pressure loss coefficient k l consequently by assuming that u a 0 the flow through an opening with area ds is 7 d q c d 2 g h a h b d s where the semi empirical discharge coefficient is 8 c d 1 1 k l for cross flooding ducts and pipes the pressure loss coefficient k l is equal to the k sum used in regulations imo 2013 for openings such as open collapsed doors the industry standard discharge coefficient c d 0 6 is used this corresponds to k l 1 78 in this study the air compression effects are ignored and the air pressure p in all rooms are assumed to be equal to the atmospheric pressure the calculation within a single time step is iterative and the algorithm changes the pressures in the flooded rooms until both bernoulli s equation for each opening and the conservation of mass for each flooded room are satisfied with sufficient accuracy the floating position of the ship is then calculated based on the volumes of floodwater in the compartments the leakage and collapse characteristics of closed non watertight doors are accounted for by using the full scale test results of the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 whereas in the conventional approach different intermediate stages are calculated by assuming the internal structures to be either practically watertight or to collapse immediately both approaches are described in detail by ruponen and lindroth 2016 for progressive flooding through the openings the floodwater volumes at each time step are kept constant in the calculation of the righting lever curve thus assuming rapid heeling also in the final stage of flooding 4 4 modelling of the damage in flooding simulation sim ots sim breach there are two alternative approaches for modelling the damage in time domain flooding simulation as illustrated in fig 9 the current solas chapter ii 1 regulation imo 2017 assumes that the breached compartments are instantly flooded i e open to sea ots the same approach can also be used in simulation the approach to flood compartments instantly before simulation commences is denoted by sim ots alternatively the breach in the hull can be considered as openings connecting the damaged compartments to the sea simulation with openings representing the initial breach is denoted by sim breach this method has been widely used in flooding simulations e g dafermos and papanikolaou 2016 in the present study the breach extents are taken from the subdivision used for solas so that the results are comparable to the conventional calculations however it is noteworthy that with large breaches the dynamic motions in the transient flooding phase can be significant manderbacka and ruponen 2016 consequently in the solas chapter ii 1 calculations the sim breach method can result in unrealistically large breaches that will overestimate the effects of the transient flooding stage in the present study both approaches are used and the results are compared and discussed 4 5 summary of applied calculation methods in this study three alternative methods are applied the conventional method conv normally used in statutory calculations is used as a reference in addition time domain flooding simulation is used with two different approaches for modelling the damage sim ots and sim breach a summary of the applied methods is presented in table 1 in all methods the righting lever is calculated using constant intact displacement the applied range of heeling angles covers both sides all calculations were performed with the napa software 5 case studies 5 1 case a cross flooding the first case study concentrates on a simple cross flooding scenario a large u shaped void is damaged on the port side and there is a cross flooding duct in the double bottom that enables equalizing flooding to the undamaged side of the void fig 10 the damage is limited both vertically and transversally so that the upper decks remain intact and consequently only the u void is flooded the gz curves for the final stage of flooding with different calculation methods are presented in fig 11 as expected all methods give exactly the same final floating position however simulation with a constant amount of floodwater results in larger righting lever values the reasons for this are illustrated in fig 12 when the ship is heeled towards the damage positive angles the additional floodwater above the sea level on the intact side of the ship increases the righting moment on the other hand when the ship is heeled away from the damage negative angles the righting lever is increased since the amount of water on the intact side is not increased these effects are more notable when the initial breach is modelled as an opening sim breach 5 2 case b longitudinal bulkheads the second studied scenario is a large collision damage to a single zone there is cross flooding in the double bottom and the two upper decks are divided by longitudinal a class bulkheads fig 13 there are four hinged a class fire doors denoted by d1 d4 that connect the rooms as illustrated in fig 13 all these doors are considered to be closed the leakage and collapse parameters from the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 are used the conventional approach to a class structures does not recognize the doors as the routes for progressive flooding instead all possible combinations of either fully watertight or collapsed bulkheads are calculated for this damage case it means five alternative intermediate stages as well as the final stage with all a class bulkheads collapsed all the flooding stages are illustrated in fig 14 the so called a class stages are denoted with n a constant time step of 5 0 s is used in the simulations the closed fire doors on the lower deck d1 and d2 in fig 13 collapse within 90 s but the doors on the upper deck d3 and d4 only leak since the pressure head does not reach the collapse threshold consequently the time to flood is quite long about 35 min the development of the heeling angle from the simulation results is shown in fig 15 and for different stages and phases of flooding with the conventional approach in fig 16 the modelling of the damage either as damaged rooms open to sea sim ots or with the breach as an opening sim breach affects only the initial phases of flooding and after the first minute the simulation results with both approaches for damage modelling are practically identical this case demonstrates the problem of simultaneous cross flooding and leakage collapse of non watertight structures time domain simulation is evidently the only realistic approach to calculate the intermediate stages of flooding for this kind of damage scenarios the revised explanatory notes to solas imo 2017 recommends that if both passive cross flooding devices and collapsing structures are faced at the same time cross flooding should be calculated first this is reasonable since these devices are designed to allow for a fast equalizing flooding whereas the leakage collapse of non watertight structures can take a much longer time ruponen 2017 righting lever curves for the different calculation methods are shown in fig 17 for the final equilibrium condition modelling the damage as a breach results in much larger righting moment levers especially at larger heel angles this is caused by the large damaged room car deck above the sea level at the final equilibrium fig 18 the breach to this room is large and consequently free communication with the sea is a realistic approach since the car deck would be rapidly flooded if the breach was temporary submerged due to an external heeling moment 5 3 case c extensive progressive flooding the third studied scenario is an extensive three compartment damage to the aft part of a large passenger ship fig 19 the studied ship design is a slightly modified version of the floodstand sample ship a kujanpää and routi 2009 the damaged compartments contain various store areas and there are several a class fire rated steel bulkheads providing non watertight subdivision inside the watertight compartments the damage considered is one similar to the ones defined for the probabilistic damage stability calculations in solas based on the wt subdivision limits for this particular case the damage length is 44 m and the penetration is 8 7 m the damage extends vertically from the base line up to the upper limit of the buoyant hull the time domain simulations were done with a constant time step of 5 0 s based on ruponen and lindroth 2016 a shorter time step would not significantly improve the accuracy in similar flooding cases the applied leakage and collapse characteristics are based on the floodstand results jalonen et al 2017 furthermore all doors are assumed closed the final stable equilibrium floating position is reached in about 2 h 40 min the development of the heel angle from the simulation results is shown in fig 20 for both approaches of modelling the damage the results are nearly identical in addition in both simulations the same eight non watertight doors collapse and the remaining 13 doors are only leaking most of the collapsed doors seven are located on deck 2 whereas most of the doors that do not collapse are on deck 3 the doors collapse within 2 min but due to the slow leakage the overall time to flood is very long a similar observation was made in a previous study ruponen 2017 where the status open closed of the non watertight doors was found to be a key parameter affecting the flooding time the conventional approach with all possible combinations of collapsing a class structures on the other hand becomes significantly more complex compared to the simulation the total number of stages generated exceeds 1000 even with minor simplifications in the arrangement where some adjacent rooms are considered to flood simultaneously the heeling angles for all calculated phases of all stages are presented in fig 21 the initial heel quickly drops during the cross flooding stage similar to the simulations this is followed by the stages representing the alternative combinations of flooding through the collapsing a class boundaries a wider spread of heeling angles is obtained as the asymmetry of flooding varies between different stages all the heel angles in fig 21 are between the maximum and minimum heel angles in the simulation results fig 20 at the final equilibrium stage all internal structures have collapsed and the rooms damaged are open to sea lost buoyancy the number of phases calculated in the simulation about 2000 with a time step of 5 s are far less than the number of phases in the conventional calculation 1000 stages with 3 phases each from a performance point of view it is noteworthy that the generation of a damage case with 1000 alternative stages also takes a considerable time the gz curves for the final equilibrium stage after flooding with the different calculation methods are shown in fig 22 similarly to the previous cases the modelling of the breach as openings in flooding simulation results in larger righting lever values especially at larger heeling angles the differences between the two methods for modelling the damage in flooding simulation are much smaller than in case b the reason for this is that the damaged rooms above the bulkhead deck are also smaller considering the fact that only one of the 13 closed non watertight doors on deck 3 collapses in this case the assumption of free communication with the sea seems to be quite unrealistic at least for the rooms above deck 2 6 discussion stability reserves in the form of a range and area in the gz curve are needed to provide a restoring force against time dependent external loads mainly waves and wind however the response of the ship e g roll motion under such loads is dependent on the inertia of the ship which in a damaged case is generally increased by the floodwater the time to roll the ship to the maximum heel angle is thus related to the roll period of the damaged ship manderbacka et al 2015b which in turn relates to the restoring force i e the gz curve as has been pointed out earlier the definition of the gz curve depends among other things on the assumptions made on the height of the internal floodwater surfaces and volumes either the surfaces are assumed to be equalized or alternatively not allowing any exchange of floodwater at all the time to equalize the floodwater surfaces is dependent on the proportion of the opening size with respect to the room volume this matter was pointed out by manderbacka and ruponen 2016 and the consequences were studied with time domain flooding simulations accounting for the dynamics moreover due to the complicated matter of dynamic interactions the floodwater motions namely sloshing may be important for wide rooms where the time needed to equalize the internal surface is dependent on the natural period of sloshing in the room it is nearly impossible to define this period for a damaged room with a varying amount of floodwater such effects should be separately studied with an aid of designated numerical simulation tools fonfach et al 2016 the dynamic effects are however beyond the scope of the presented research addressing and providing recommendations of practical means of estimating the residual stability of a damaged ship flooding simulation has several advantages when compared to the conventional calculation methods for example previous research on survivability of damaged passenger ships vassalos et al 2005 has brought up multiple free surfaces as a dangerous failure mode for ships with several decks below the bulkhead deck this phenomenon cannot be captured by the conventional approach with the lost buoyancy method applied to all flooded rooms however time domain simulation with the breach modelled as openings can model this condition realistically in reality the breach shapes are arbitrary with petalling of the hull plating li et al 2014 the extreme damage extent is used in statistics and regulatory calculations are normally based on the assumption that the whole wt zone is damaged resulting in a much larger breach size compared to reality as illustrated in fig 23 this should be considered when selecting how the damage in flooding simulation is modelled based on the presented examples the use of a constant amount of floodwater for the final stage results in larger righting levers than the conventional approach with the lost buoyancy method especially at large heel angles however the effects on the solas calculations might be smaller since the immersion of unprotected openings limits the applied range of the gz curve further studies on these effects are still needed the results from the floodstand project jalonen et al 2017 demonstrate that non watertight doors can withstand pressure heads up to 3 5 m before they collapse the presented case studies and previous research e g ruponen 2017 show that several closed non watertight doors may not even collapse during the flooding however leakage through doors results in a slow progressive flooding this indicates that the assumption of free communication with the sea method of lost buoyancy is not always realistic hybrid methods where a heeling velocity s is associated with the gz calculation in flooding simulation could also be applied as suggested by dankowski 2013 however this approach makes the calculations more complicated and the suitable heeling velocity is difficult to define in addition the result should be independent of the set of heeling angles where the righting levers are calculated therefore the lost buoyancy and constant volume methods are considered more suitable especially for regulatory calculations 7 conclusions the righting lever curve and its properties are essential for damage stability assessments according to the current solas regulations with the increasing computational capacity the amount of analyses has expanded allowing for more realistic investigations of the intermediate stages of flooding especially in passenger ships the conventional approach to calculate all possible intermediate stages due to the non watertight internal structures can be computationally challenging time domain flooding simulation has been recognized as the best option to study the residual stability of a damaged ship during the intermediate stages of flooding several simulation tools have been developed and successfully validated the next step in this development is to extend the use of time domain analyses in damage stability assessment within the regulatory framework also for such studies the righting lever curve can be used to evaluate the stability characteristics in addition further studies on the effects of the calculation method on the s factors and the attained subdivision index are needed after all the thresholds for the current s factors were derived based on calculations for sample ships with the conventional approach tagg and tuzcu 2003 in general it can be concluded that the method of lost buoyancy is suitable for the final stage of flooding in damage cases without internal structures that significantly restrict the free flow of water in the flooded compartments this applies to tanks voids cargo holds and possibly even to large engine rooms however for the accommodation and store areas this assumption is often not realistic since the non watertight structures can significantly restrict the free flow of floodwater when the ship is heeled instead the use of constant volumes of floodwater for evaluation of the righting lever curve is considered to be more realistic in these cases based on the presented results it is recommended to model the damaged compartments as lost buoyancy in regulatory analyses this approach ensures that also the damaged rooms on the upper decks are flooded at large heel angles if the actual breach is modelled as openings the damaged rooms that are not flooded at the equilibrium floating position are considered empty also in the calculation of the gz curve this assumption can provide overly optimistic results in the damage cases that involve large rooms above the sea level such as a car deck however if the real breach extents are known as in accident analyses krüger 2016 or monte carlo methods dankowski and krüger 2013 the breach should be modelled as openings since this approach can accurately capture also the initial stages of the flooding process regulatory calculations are based on simplified breach sizes that are derived from damage statistics on the other hand in operative damage stability assessment the breaches can be estimated based on measured inflow of floodwater and visual observations here the exact damage extent is unknown but the breach size can still be estimated as presented in ruponen et al 2017 this approach is considered to provide more realistic prediction of progressive flooding than the assumption of lost buoyancy for the damaged rooms considering the increased computational capacity also damage stability calculations are developing towards more realistic approaches that properly account for the internal structures and progressive flooding in time domain therefore an explicit requirement for using the lost buoyancy method in the regulations should be avoided a more relevant issue is to specify the treatment of floodwater in the evaluation of the righting lever curve the most realistic approach depends on the studied case and the regulations should have enough room for interpretations in order to allow for feasible yet safe design and operation of ships 
23671,when high order numerical approximation method is applied to model the propagation of shock wave or discontinuity it usually creates unstable unreal numerical oscillations around the discontinuous regions in this research we propose a non oscillation meshfree scheme based on reproducing kernel particle method rkpm which can maintain the accuracy and minimize the oscillation in the modeling of shock wave propagation in the proposed method the original influence domain of high order rk approximation is divided into several subdomains then we apply low order rk approximation within each subdomain instead of directly using the discrete particles to build the numerical approximation we consider that the high order approximation is constructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function by adjusting these local weights with the smoothness indicator we can determine the effect of the corresponding subdomain and the discrete particles inside this subdomain therefore the subdomain containing discontinuity would not participate in the high order approximation and the numerical oscillation is automatically suppressed the proposed method does not need artificial viscosity or numerical damping to stabilize the solution several benchmark problems with shock wave propagation are tested the results show that the proposed method can maintain high order accuracy without numerical oscillation keywords shock capturing non oscillating method meshfree methods high order approximation reproducing kernel particle method 1 introduction the modeling of shock wave propagation is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computational hydrodynamics to solve general ordinary differential equation o d e and partial differential equation p d e certain level of continuity from the approximation functions which depends on the degree of differentiation in the governing equations is required however when solving problems involving shock or discontinuity approximation scheme with high continuity would have oscillating response around the discontinuity region which is called the gibbs phenomenon carslaw 1925 especially in problems with shock wave propagation this non physical oscillation would increase the numerical error when the solution evolves with time in 1950 von neumann and richtmyer 1950 proposed to use artificial viscosity to minimize the numerical oscillation the mechanism of artificial viscosity involves the introduction of a dissipative term into the governing equation as an additional pressure this artificial term would create a layer surrounding the shock front where physical fields change rapidly and the oscillation would be damped out around the shock to regularize the solution however these artificial terms would also dissipate the physical energy and decrease the accuracy around the discontinuous region when simulation time increases another way to suppress the oscillation is by using the flux limiter liu et al 2015 instead of adding the artificial terms in the governing equations the flux limiter calculates the spatial derivatives in front of and behind the flux boundary the limiter function which is based on the derivatives can decide the order of approximation in the discontinuous region a low order approximation is applied to avoid the oscillation although this method does not change the governing equations the approximation near the smoothed extrema would degenerate to a low order approximation with low accuracy shu 1997 harten et al 1997 proposed the essentially non oscillation eno scheme for the simulation of discontinuous field in the eno scheme the discretized domains are separated into several candidate stencils and the stencil with the smoothest approximation would be chosen therefore the discontinuous region is not involved in the higher order approximation through the eno scheme high order approximation without numerical oscillation is achieved however eno method requires more computing time to achieve the same order of approximation in addition even a small perturbation like round off error would change the decision of the smoothest stencil liu et al 1994 the weighted eno weno scheme was proposed by liu et al 1994 this method improves the computational efficiency and accuracy of the eno scheme similar to the framework of eno weno separates the discretized domains into several stencils however unlike eno in which only one stencil would be chosen weno scheme would utilize all the stencils to construct the high order approximations by introducing a weight function this weight function is controlled by a smoothness indicator which is used to calculate the smoothness of the stencils for the discontinuous region the indicator would become very large and the weight function would approach zero therefore the discontinuous regions would be removed from the high order approximation through the weno scheme for the same computing time it can obtain a higher order of approximation and the stencil pattern would always be the same in the smooth region notice that both eno and weno schemes are developed based on the so called mesh based methods and they can be applied to the most popular computational methods such as finite difference method fdm grant and hydon 2013 finite volume method fvm shu 1998 and discontinuous galerkin dg method liu et al 2016 qiu and shu 2005 zhu et al 2016 the mesh based methods have the longest development with the advantage of stability robustness and easiness for coding on the other hand meshfree methods are well known for the abilities of easily adapting to non uniform discretization and adjusting the order of approximation meshfree methods such as the smoothed particles method sph monaghan and gingold 1983 moving particle method mpm moving least squares mls approximation meshless petrov galerkin method mpgm lin and atluri 2001 and reproducing kernel particle method rkpm liu et al 1997 are more suitable for the lagrangian framework by liberating the need for a mesh therefore meshfree methods have the potential for application in hydrodynamic problems with multi surface free surface and moving boundaries moreover for the fluid solid interaction fsi problems the meshfree methods can be easily adapted for the coupling of solid and fluid the rkpm was proposed by liu et al 1995 rkpm is a kernel based approximation it improves the completeness of the sph method by introducing a correction function into the construction of shape function the rk approximation can achieve high order accuracy by selecting appropriate support size and order of correction function this advantage makes rkpm become more popular in the field of computational mechanics unlike conventional mesh based methods which require proper mesh orientation to satisfy the need of complex geometry rkpm has the flexibility of dynamically discretizing the domain with desired number of nodes and order of approximation without complex re meshing process however for meshfree methods the non physical oscillations would still occur when higher order approximation is applied for the discontinuous domain unlike the mesh based methods the shape functions of the meshfree method are smooth and the influence area of every shape function would be overlapping with each other therefore it is difficult to define specific boundaries or interfaces at the discontinuous location generally artificial viscosity based on rankine hugoniot jump condition is applied for the shock wave problems monaghan 1994 where the dissipation term would transform the shock front into an artificial smooth layer the objective of this paper is to develop a reproducing kernel particle method rkpm based numerical framework for solving problems involving shock propagation we introduce the concept of eno and weno coupled with flux splitting scheme to correct the numerical flux at the interface of a control volume a smoothness indicator is proposed to capture the optimum stencil for the local approximation and to avoid numerical oscillation here is the organization of this paper first we introduce the general rkpm framework and some enrichments of rkpm for dealing with discontinuities then the concept of non oscillating weighted reconstructing rkpm will be discussed and the properties of approximation achieved by the proposed scheme are tested through a series of convergence tests after the numerical approximation method is presented we introduce the scalar conservation equation to verify the reliability of the proposed method for different dynamic problems the numerical flux and time integration are also presented next we discuss the governing equations for hydrodynamics problem and their discrete form lastly several famous benchmark fluid dynamics problems with high order solution and shock wave are tested using the proposed scheme and solution results are discussed 2 basic formulation 2 1 reproducing kernel particle method the reproducing kernel particle method is an advanced meshfree method which possesses both the smoothness and flexibility of general meshfree methods and polynomial reconstruction property of mesh based methods assume that a one dimensional problem domain is defined by an internal domain ω and a boundary ω using reproducing kernel particle method both ω and ω are discretized with a set of reproducing kernel points np then the unknown vector function u x is approximated by introducing the reproducing kernel shape functions 1 u h x i 1 n p ψ x x i d i where u h x is the approximation of u x ψ x x i is the reproducing kernel shape function x i is the nodal coordinate for node i and d i is the generalized nodal coefficient vector of the approximation u h x for node i the shape function ψ x x i is constructed by multiplying the correction function c x x i by the kernel function ϕ x x i 2 ψ x x i c x x i ϕ x x i the correction function c x x i is a polynomial function which is defined as 3 c x x i h t m 1 h 0 where the polynomial vector h of n th order and the moment matrix m are defined as 4 h t 1 x x i x x i 2 x x i n 5 m j n p h x x j h t x x j ϕ x x j notice that the correction function not only plays the important role of maintaining the accuracy of the approximation but also contains the information of neighboring nodes which is very important when we construct the non oscillating reproducing kernel approximation in subsequent process when discontinuities start to develop the kernel functions ϕ x x i in eq 2 control the continuity and smoothness of the approximation they also affect the influence domain of each generalized coefficient vector d i to maintain the smoothness of the approximation we introduce the cubic b spline function as the kernel function which has the third order continuity the cubic b spline function is as follows 6 ϕ x x i 2 3 4 z 2 4 z 3 for 0 z 0 5 4 3 4 z 4 z 2 4 3 z 3 for 0 5 z 1 0 for z 1 in which z x x i a the variable a is the support size used to define the influence domain of the shape function of i th particle it is important to realize that the influence domain is associated with how we can prevent the approximation function from going across the shock front and the generation of numerical oscillation substituting eqs 3 5 into eq 1 the approximation can be presented as 7 u x i n p h t j n p h x x j h t x x j ϕ x x j h 0 ϕ x x i d i fig 1 shows the effect of support size by plotting the first order and second order rk shape functions against distance with support sizes equal to one two and three times the nodal distance when a larger support size is used more rk particles would be involved in the approximation which would decrease the weight of each influencing particle therefore the shape function becomes smoother this property will also smoothen the oscillation during calculation however overly increasing the support size would not only increase the time of calculation but also increase the error of approximation this error comes from the lack of kronecker delta property of rk approximation chen et al 1996 as shown in fig 1 b the oscillatory shape functions show up when the order of shape function increases from first order as shown in fig 1 a to second order this phenomenon continues when the order increases but the approximation can be smoothened by increasing the support size in order to reduce the effect of support size in this research the support size a is set to be three times the initial distance between rk particles to avoid the singularity of moment matrix and thus achieve a more accurate solution 2 2 meshfree approximation of discontinuity and gibbs phenomenon the rkpm approximation functions are smooth and continuous functions in the spatial domain as mentioned previously the influence domain of the shape functions usually overlaps with each other to form the interaction between neighboring particles as shown in fig 2 on the other hand the influence zone of mesh based shape function is conforming to the adjacent elements mesh grid therefore it is difficult to define specific boundaries or interfaces under the meshfree framework while the mesh based method can use the boundary of the element or control volume as the boundary of the shape functions the smoothening characteristics of rk approximation and adjustable influence area become a drawback when dealing with problems involving discontinuities in addition using high order meshfree shape function would lead to numerical oscillation close to the discontinuous region which is called the gibbs phenomenon regular rk shape functions of different orders and support sizes are shown in fig 3 we can observe that higher order rk shape functions and smaller support sizes would cause more severe oscillation one alternative way to avoid non physical oscillation is to apply a discontinuous shape function belytschko et al 1996 shown in fig 4 at the discontinuous location the simplest way to construct a discontinuous shape function is to use a visibility criterion by using the visibility criterion the discontinuous region is treated as an opaque wall the support of the meshfree shape functions is truncated at the opaque wall therefore only particles on the same side of the wall would participate in the construction of shape function as shown in fig 5 by applying the discontinuous shape function we can obtain results with high accuracy and a discontinuous region that is free of oscillation this discontinuous rk shape function can be well adapted for crack problems or contact problems in which there is region separated by the cracks or different objects in between the contact surfaces for the modeling of these mechanical problems the discontinuous region is usually predefined and assumed to be stationary however in most cases it is very difficult to detect the locations of discontinuities the most famous and widely used benchmark problem of moving discontinuity is the shock tube problem the shock tube is a one dimensional tube filled with two different types of gases which are separated by a diaphragm these two separated gases have different initial states such as pressure density and total energy see fig 6 both ends of the tube are assumed to be very far from the interface at the initial state the gases in both sides are static after the diaphragm is removed the gas with higher initial pressure would start to push the low pressure gas and the compressed gas would then generate a high speed wave shock wave which would propagate from the contact surface to the low pressure side the gas with higher pressure also tends to expand therefore the expansion wave is generated in the high pressure region the process of the propagation of expansion wave is called the expansion fan the region of expansion wave would grow with time the shock tube problem is illustrated in fig 6 for the modeling of shock tube the approximation of the spatial domain needs to have the capability of describing the moving discontinuous regions during the simulation without introducing any numerical instability generally for problems with arbitrary discontinuities artificial viscosities are applied therefore the discontinuous region is replaced by smoother solution and the gibbs phenomenon can be removed by using a certain form of damping especially for meshfree type of methods because of the use of very high order shape functions or over smoothed interpolation either the gibbs phenomenon or large numerical damping are found here we use sod s shock tube problem as an example the comparison of numerical results with and without artificial viscosity is shown in fig 7 the theoretical background and implementation of the artificial viscosity in this example can be found from monaghan 1994 as shown in fig 7 when the coefficients of artificial viscosity increase the oscillation around the discontinuous region is significantly suppressed but the artificial dissipation would also create a smooth layer also the viscosity coefficients need to be adjusted when we change the order and support size of the shape functions note that the flexibility to adjust the order and support size is a key advantage of meshfree methods over mesh based methods because of the drawbacks of using artifical viscosity we propose a special approximation method in this paper which uses a weighted approximation to suppress the effect of discontinuous region and well describes the discontinuous region without any artificial viscosity 2 3 weighted reconstruction of rk shape function for the rk shape function a higher order approximation usually requires a larger influence domain therefore more particles would be involved in the approximation and the discontinuous regions may locate inside the support domain and cause numerical oscillation in order to isolate these discontinuous regions from the domain with high order approximation we first divide the original influence domain into several subdomains then we apply regular low order rk approximation for these subdomains the high order approximations are later reconstructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function by adjusting the local weights we can minimize the effect of the subdomains containing the discontinuous regions therefore the discrete particles around the discontinuous regions are removed from the high order approximation the basic idea of calculating the local weight function for a subdomain follows the weno method liu et al 1994 for a high order approximation the original influence domain is divided into several subdomains which are illustrated in fig 8 by selecting subdomains with different sizes we can build several different local approximations at position x in each subdomain we can construct a series of lower order approximations of any function f x by applying eq 1 at position x i 1 2 8 f j h x i 1 2 k n p l ψ x i 1 2 x i n p l k j f i n p l k j where the subscript j is the j th subdomain of the lower order approximation and npl is the number of particles in the j th subdomain therefore we can use a set of weight function to adjust the lower order approximations and rebuild a higher order approximation 9 f h x i 1 2 j n s w j f j h x i 1 2 where w j is the weight function of the j th subdomain and ns is the total number of subdomains for the lower order approximation substituting eq 8 into eq 9 we can obtain 10 j n s w j k n p l ψ k j f k j l n p h ψ l f l for convenience we use the superscript j and subscript k to represent the k th particles in the j th subdomain the shape functions ψ and ψ are the lower order and higher order rk shape functions respectively npl is the total number of discrete particles in the j th subdomain nph is the total number of discrete particles of the original influence domain for the higher order approximation in order to find the weight function we rewrite eq 10 in matrix form as follows 11 φ w φ where 12 φ ψ 1 s 1 0 0 ψ 2 s 1 ψ 1 s 2 0 ψ 2 s 2 ψ 1 s 3 ψ n p 1 s 1 ψ 2 s 3 0 ψ n p i s 2 0 0 ψ n p n s n s w w 1 w 2 w n s φ ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n p h then the weight vector w is defined as 13 w φ t φ 1 φ t φ we need to apply the smoothness indicators in the calculation of weight function in order to avoid explicitly finding those regions with discontinuities then only the continuous regions would participate in the reconstruction of the higher order approximation the smoothness indicators are presented as 14 β j k 1 n δ x k d k d x k f j h x 2 where n is the order of approximation and the initial length between rk particles δ x is used to eliminate the effect of nodal distance the smoothness indicators are used to detect which subdomain contains the discontinuities by applying eq 8 for f j h x the discrete form of the smoothness indicators can be written as 15 β j k 1 n δ x k i n p l d k ψ i d x k f i 2 when the subdomain contains the discontinuous region the indicator β would approach infinity and the reciprocal of β would approach zero therefore we can use the smoothness indicators to calculate the adjusted weight function w i and reduce the influence of the discontinuous region 16 w i α i k n s α k 17 α i w i ε β i 2 where ɛ is a small value used to prevent singularity in this paper ɛ is set as ε 0 01 a 2 where a is the support size which is mentioned before finally the higher order approximation of eq 9 would be adjusted by eq 16 such that 18 f h j n s w j k n p l ψ k j f k j 2 4 convergence test in order to verify the accuracy of the reconstructed rk shape function we perform two convergence rate analyses one of the analyses is to exam the approximation of a high order continuous smooth function with the reconstructed rk shape functions this numerical test can be used to analyze the convergence rate of the proposed method and to compare the linear and third order rk approximations another analysis is about the approximation of a step function this step function has a discontinuity at the location x 0 through the use of a discontinuous function we can compare the convergence rate of the reconstructed rk approximation with the original rk approximation of the same order for the first convergence analysis the function u x is a combination of two trigonometric functions 19 u x sin x cos x x π π we apply the maximum absolute error to evaluate the rate of convergence the error is defined as 20 error max u h u in this analysis we use uniform discretization with 21 31 41 51 and 61 rk nodes with the initial distance between particles as δ x we test three kinds of numerical approximation schemes to reconstruct the third order approximation 1 first order rk shape function with support size a δ x 2 third order rk shape function with support size a 2 δ x 3 first order rk shape function with support size a 2 δ x the numerical results for 21 point discretization are shown in fig 9 the reconstructed higher order rk approximation has better accuracy than the lower order rk approximation the convergence analysis result is presented in fig 10 from the convergence analysis it can be observed that the reconstructed third order rk approximation has the same accuracy and convergence rate as the original third order rk approximation the second analysis is to demonstrate the performance of the smoothness indicator coupling with the reconstructed rk shape function we introduce a simple step function 21 u x 1 x 0 1 x 0 x 1 1 in this analysis the total numbers of rk nodes are 20 30 40 50 and 60 and we apply a uniform discretization the first order and third order rk approximations as well as the reconstructed higher order rk approximation are compared to show how low high and modified approximations model the discontinuity the support sizes of the first order and third order rk shape functions are both a 2 δ x we also use the first order rk shape function to reconstruct the third order approximation in this analysis as shown in fig 11 the total number of discrete points is 20 and the result of the reconstructed higher order rk approximation has better accuracy than the others by separating the approximation in each subdomain the weight function of eq 16 in the discontinuous region becomes zero therefore the points on different sides of the discontinuous region would not be involved in the reconstructed rk shape function on the other hand the third order rk approximation shows there would be gibbs phenomenon near the discontinuous region while the first order rk approximation tends to smoothen the solution in the same region the error from the third order rk approximation is mainly caused by the oscillation instead of the approximation error we can also observe the oscillation phenomenon in the convergence analysis fig 12 only the reconstructed rk approximation can still maintain a high convergent rate 3 waves propagating problems in order to test the applicability of smoothness indicator in the dynamics problem we use the scalar conservation equation with two types of initial conditions both cases have many discontinuous sections the scalar conservation equation is given by 22 u x t t c u x t x 0 where c is the wave velocity and we choose c 1 in this analysis for the finite volume scheme the entire spatial domain is divided into several cells then we take the integrated form of eq 22 and perform integration in each cell therefore for i th cell the conservation equation becomes 23 1 δ x i ω i u x t t d ω i 1 δ x i ω i u x t x d ω i 0 where δ x i is the length of the i th cell and ω i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 is the i th cell domain by introducing the divergence theory the one dimensional conservation equation becomes 24 u i t 1 δ x u x i 1 2 t u x i 1 2 t 0 where 25 u i 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u x t d ω i for convenience the values of function u on the right and left boundaries of the i th cell are denoted as u i and u i in eq 24 the continuity at x i 1 2 should be enforced by the approximation for both i 1 th and i 1 th cells which means the physical quantities u i should be equal to u i 1 however the approximation for the i th cell is inconsistent with the approximation for the i 1 th cell which leads to inconsistency of physical quantities at the cell boundary x i 1 2 the dash line in fig 13 this is because the cell average is used for the spatial discretization the approximation of physical quantities at point x i 1 2 would also be different when approaching from the right side and from the left side in order to ensure the consistency at the boundary of the control volume numerical flux is applied in this paper we apply the lax friedrichs flux because it is simple computationally inexpensive and has the same accuracy as the other numerical flux methods for the higher order approximation shu 1998 the lax friedrichs flux is defined as 26 h i u i 1 u i 1 2 u i 1 u i u i 1 u i by applying the numerical flux above into eq 24 we obtain 27 u i t 1 δ x h i h i 0 the integration of eq 25 leads to two different approximations of u first by nodal integration u i would be equal to the value at the center of the i th cell therefore the approximate function u x for each cell becomes 28 u x u i x i th cell moreover the shape functions of the approximation of u x are simply the general rk shape function calculated by eq 2 second with the cell average concept we can assume that the numerical approximation of the arbitrary function u x would become the summation of the cell average multiplying by a modified rk shape function which can be presented as 29 u h x k n p a φ k u k where φ is the modified rk shape function and npa is the total number of particles involving in the approximation in order to calculate the modified shape functions we first define a primitive function of u x which is given by 30 v x x u ξ d ξ through eq 25 the value of the primitive function on the right boundary of the i th cell v x i 1 2 is presented as 31 v x i 1 2 k i u k δ x k introducing eq 1 the approximation of the primitive function v x becomes 32 v h x i n p ψ i v i where v i is the cell boundary value which is equal to v x i 1 2 in eq 32 we subtract v 1 from both sides of the equation due to consistency of the rk shape function we can get 33 v h v 1 i n p ψ i v i v 1 where 34 v i v 1 m 2 i u m δ x m therefore we obtain 35 v h v 1 j 2 n p m 2 j u m δ x m ψ j because v x is the primitive function of u x the derivative of the left side of eq 35 would be the approximation of u x which can be written as 36 u h x j 2 n p m 2 j u m δ x m ψ j therefore the modified shape functions in eq 29 can be calculated as 37 φ m j m n p ψ j δ x m then eq 29 becomes 38 u h x m 2 n p j m n p u m δ x m ψ j in this paper both nodal integration and cell average integration methods are applied first we use eq 38 for the approximation of scalar fields in the conservation equation to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method however in the remaining problems the approximation of physical fields are based on eq 28 which is the nodal integration method 3 1 time integration to solve the semi discrete eq 24 we use the total variation diminishing tvd runge kutta method for time discretization the time discretization of eq 24 with the third order tvd runge kutta scheme can be written as 39 u i n 1 3 u i n δ t δ x u i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n u i n 2 3 3 4 u i n 1 4 u i n 1 3 δ t δ x u i 1 2 n 1 3 u i 1 2 n 1 3 u i n 1 1 3 u i n 2 3 u i n 2 3 δ t δ x u i 1 2 n 2 3 u i 1 2 n 2 3 where the superscript n represents the n th step and δ t is the incremental time in this paper we apply uniform time discretization 3 2 wave propagating problem with step wave as the first problem of wave propagation we use a square wave shown in fig 14 and the initial state of u is presented as 40 u x 0 0 1 x 0 25 2 0 25 x 0 25 0 0 25 x 1 in this case the square wave has two discontinuous edges these two edges would propagate with the wave and maintain the shape of a square wave except for the discontinuous regions the scalar function remains constant therefore in eq 15 the value of the smoothness indicator becomes zero in the regions with constant solution value and is dominated by the first order derivative of the scalar function around the two discontinuous edges the total number of rk nodes is 400 and the time increment is δ t 5 e 3 in this case we apply eq 38 for the approximation of the scalar function the original influence domain includes six particles from i 2 th cell to i 3 th cell and is divided into three subdomains these three subdomains all contain four particles from i k 3 th cell to i k th cell where k represents the k th subdomain and k 1 2 3 we use the third order rk shape function to re construct the fifth order approximation for the subdomain in addition for the original influence domain and subdomains the support size a is set to be three times of the initial distance between particles the numerical results at different time instants are presented in fig 15 from the numerical results we can observe that the smoothness indicators can well detect the discontinuous regions during the wave propagation therefore only the smoothed regions would participate in the reconstruction of the high order rk approximation and the numerical oscillation can be eliminated during the wave propagation 3 3 wave propagating problems with complex wave shape as the second case a more complex waveform is considered we use the example from harten and osher 1987 the wave shape is shown in fig 16 the initial state of this wave is given by 41 u x 0 x sin 3 π x 2 2 sin 2 π x 2 x 1 1 6 sin 3 π x 1 x 1 3 x 1 3 1 3 x 1 unlike the first case the wave has c 0 continuity at certain positions therefore the smoothness indicator does not only detect the discontinuous regions but also the locations of c 0 continuity the time and spatial discretization schemes are the same as those in case one the time increment is δ t 5 e 3 for the k th subdomain it contains four particles from i k 3 th cell to i k th cell and there are totally six particles inside the original influence domain the third order rk shape function is applied to the subdomain to re construct the fifth order rk approximation both the low order and high order rk shape functions have support size a which is set to be three times of the initial distance between particles the numerical results at different time instants are shown in fig 17 in this case the indicator can both capture the discontinuous regions and the low continuity regions c 0 continuity in this case therefore only the smoothed regions would participate in the reconstruction of high order rk approximation and the numerical oscillation can be eliminated during the wave propagation based on the smoothness indicator we can detect not only the discontinuous regions but also the critical points by choosing the appropriate order n in eq 15 the order n depends on the low order approximation which can be adjusted according to the requirements of different problems as long as it is not greater than the order of approximation for the first case the approximation in the subdomain is of third order but the wave is highly continuous except for the two discontinuous regions therefore the order n in the smoothness indicator can simply set as n 1 4 hydrodynamic analyses with shock waves the governing equations for most hydrodynamics problem include continuity momentum and energy equations in addition the fluid is assumed inviscid and the gravity is neglected the governing equations are 42 ρ t ρ v 43 v t 1 ρ p v v 44 e t p ρ v v e where ρ v p and e are the fluid density velocity pressure and initial specific energy respectively in the velocity vector v u v w the terms u v and w are the components of the velocity vector in the x y and z directions in the cartesian coordinate system there are several methods developed for solving the pressure distribution for compressible and incompressible flows for smoothed particle method sph the flow can be assumed to be slight compressible flow sph is a meshfree method introduced by gingold and monaghan 1977 the equation of state for slightly compressible fluid to calculate the pressure of particle which was developed by monaghan 1994 can be expressed using the following equation 45 p p ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 is the density of the initial state and p γ are the pressure coefficients for compressible flow such as ideal gas the pressure is obtained by introducing the equation of state defined as follows 46 p ρ e γ 1 where γ 1 4 is the adiabatic index for an ideal gas and e is the internal energy per unit mass the governing equation of hydrodynamic in the conservative form for a one dimensional domain is given by 47 u t f u x 0 where 48 u ρ ρ u e f ρ u ρ u 2 p e p u and e ρ e u 2 2 is the total energy the one dimensional discrete form of the governing equation can be written as 49 u i t 1 δ x f u i 1 2 f u i 1 2 0 where 50 u i 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u d ω i by applying the lax friedrichs flux the vector form of the numerical flux can be presented as 51 f i u i 1 u i 1 2 f u i 1 f u i 1 2 a u i 1 u i here the superscripts and represent the left and right boundaries of the cell in order to calculate matrix a we first rewrite eq 47 as 52 u t r λ r 1 u x 0 where r and λ are the eigenvectors and diagonal eigenvalues respectively which are equal to 53 r 1 1 c 2 1 c 2 0 1 ρ c 1 ρ c 0 1 1 λ u 0 0 0 u c 0 0 0 u c matrix a can be defined as 54 a r λ r 1 if we use λ i i to denote the i th diagonal term of λ it can be calculated as 55 λ i i max λ i i i 1 λ i i i under the numerical flux scheme eq 49 would become 56 u i t 1 δ x f i f i in this paper we apply the third order tvd runge kutta scheme for time discretization 4 1 shock tube problem the modeling of shock wave propagation is a benchmark problem to test the robustness of a numerical method due to the complexity of physical behavior and numerical restriction around the shock front in practical applications shock wave is an important phenomenon in explosion fluid mixture interface and super sonic motion the shock tube problem can be seen as the riemann problems it is a one dimensional simulation to test the accuracy of the developed numerical scheme for the discontinuous regions the initial condition of the riemann problem is presented as 57 u u l if x 0 u r if x 0 where x is the position of the tube and the diaphragm is located at x 0 in this paper we test two different sets of initial conditions 4 1 1 sod s shock tube the first standard problem is called the sod s 1978 shock tube problem the setting of the sod s problem is as follows the whole tube is filled with ideal gas the left region of the gas has higher density and pressure which are equal to ρ l 1 and p l 1 and in the right region the density and pressure are equal to ρ r 0 25 and p r 0 2154 the gas at both sides of the tube is initially at rest and the spatial domain ranges from x 1 to x 1 the boundary conditions at both sides are treated as infinite boundary the proposed method is compared with the weno scheme which has the same order of approximation and number of discrete particles the fourth order approximation is applied for the original influence domain and second order approximation is used for the subdomains the original influence domain of the rk shape function contains five discrete particles form i 2 th to i 2 th cell and it is divided into three subdomains for k th subdomain there are three cells form i 3 k th to i 1 k th the support sizes of the high order and low order shape functions are set to be equal to three times the nodal distance the numerical results with 100 200 300 and 400 discrete particles at 0 3 s are shown in fig 18 the proposed method can easily adapt to non uniform discretization for non uniform discretization a random perturbation ε is applied to every particle in this example the perturbation is set to be ε 0 3 δ x with the same arrangement of subdomains the numerical results for 400 particles at 0 2 and 0 3 s are presented in fig 19 in order to test the effect of approximation order we apply the first order and second order rk approximations for the subdomain to reconstruct the third order and fourth order approximations respectively the original influence domain of the third order shape function contains four discrete particles form i 1 th to i 2 th cell and there are three cells form i 2 k th to i 1 k th in the k th subdomain for convenience the support sizes of all shape functions are set to be equal to three times of the nodal distance the comparison of different orders of approximation with 400 discrete particles is shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 18 the proposed method can capture the shock front and the contact surface without any numerical oscillation even when low number of discrete particles is used in addition the simulation by the proposed method has the same accuracy as the weno scheme also as shown in fig 20 both simulations can well describe the density field including the shock front and the contact surface 4 1 2 lax s shock tube the other riemann problem is called the lax s 1954 shock tube in this numerical test the jumps of the density field at the contact surface and the shock front are extremely high the initial conditions of lax s problem are ρ l u l p l 0 445 0 698 3 528 and ρ r u r p r 0 5 0 0 571 the spatial domain and the boundary conditions are the same as those for sod s shock tube as shown in fig 21 discrete particles with four different nodal densities are applied and the numerical results along with those from weno scheme are presented for non uniform discretization perturbation of nodal position same as in sod s shock tube problem is applied the numerical results with 400 particles at 0 2 and 0 3 s are presented in fig 22 the comparison of different orders first order approximation to reconstruct third order function and second order approximation to reconstruct fourth order function of weighted reconstructing rk approximations both with 400 discrete particles is shown in fig 23 unlike the sod s shock tube the lax s shock tube has two strong discontinuous surfaces therefore in fig 21 there exists small dissipation when coarse discretization is used when the density of discretization increases this small dissipation would be suppressed in addition there are no numerical oscillations around the shock front and the contact surface as shown in fig 23 the higher order approximation fourth order approximation has better accuracy 4 2 entropy wave problem this problem is called the shu osher problem 1989 which is similar to lux s shock tube problem the tube is filled with ideal gas which has different pressures and densities on two sides of the diaphragm however the density on the right side follows a spatial sine wave function the shock wave would propagate to the right after the diaphragm has been removed behind the shock front two kinds of perturbed fields with different spatial frequencies would be generated one of the frequencies is equal to the initial setting of the right side of tube the other frequency is equal to twice of the first one and the perturbed field with higher frequency is closer to the shock therefore this problem can test the ability of a numerical scheme to capture the shock and the high order solution behind the shock in this problem the initial conditions of the gas are as follows 58 ρ l 3 85714 u l 2 62937 p l 10 33333 for x 0 8 ρ r 1 0 2 sin 5 x u r 0 p r 1 for x 0 8 for this problem the spatial discretization is uniform with 400 particles in the domain x 1 1 the boundary conditions at both ends of the tube are treated as infinite boundaries this problem is a non linear problem and the exact solution is not available therefore the solution based on weno scheme with 2000 particles is regarded as the reference solution for comparison purpose the numerical results with 400 discrete particles based on our proposed method are compared with those from weno scheme at 0 18 and 0 4 s which are shown in fig 24 in fig 24 numerical results based on different orders of approximations with 400 discrete particles at 0 4 s are shown as observed in fig 24 the two perturbations with different frequencies in the density field are all captured by the proposed scheme without any oscillation in addition the dissipation at the tip of the wave with higher frequency is due to the lack of particles in the sharp region as shown in fig 25 the numerical results based on the proposed numerical scheme can accurately describe the density field in the lower frequency region but only the fourth order approximation can capture the higher frequency perturbation 4 3 two interacting blast waves in this problem there are two blast points at both ends of the tube woodward and colella 1984 which is shown in fig 26 in the beginning blast sources on both sides would create strong shocks towards the center of the tube and there would be strong rarefactions towards the walls that immediately reflect back toward the center shown in fig 27 because the process is very complex due to the strong discontinuities created by the shocks at the contact surfaces the multiple interactions between the shock and rarefactions may amplify the numerical oscillation which can pollute the solution the tube is filled with the same ideal gas the density of the gas is ρ 1 and the gas is at rest with initial pressure of 0 01 for the left source the pressure is set to be 1000 while pressure is assumed to be 100 for the right source therefore the entire problem can be separated into three regions 59 u u l if x 0 8 u c if 0 8 x 0 8 u r if x 0 8 where u l u r and u c are the vectors of the state variables in the high blast low blast and regular regions respectively the spatial discretization is uniform and the total number of discrete particles in the spatial domain x 1 1 is 400 the boundary conditions on both ends are reflective boundaries the two initial shocks would influence each other in the middle section of the tube the interaction of the reflecting waves would also affect the process in fig 28 the numerical results with 400 discrete particles are compared with those based on weno scheme with 1000 particles at 0 076 s the proposed method has the same accuracy as the weno scheme and both results can well describe the discontinuous surfaces without any numerical oscillations in fig 29 results from different orders of approximations all with 400 discrete particles are compared as seen in the comparison the higher order approximation has better accuracy in the complex and discontinuous regions in addition the proposed method has more flexibility in the usage of order of approximation this property is the main advantage of our proposed meshfree method 5 conclusions in this paper we have developed a weighted reconstructing rkpm for solving problems involving shock wave propagation the reconstructing high order approximation has the same convergence rate as the regular high order approximation moreover for the physical field with discontinuities the proposed method can still maintain the convergence rate and accuracy in the proposed method the original influence domain of high order rk approximation is divided into several subdomains then we apply low order rk approximation within each subdomain instead of directly using the discrete particles to build the numerical approximation we consider that the high order approximation is constructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function the reconstructed shape functions in those subdomains would still have the same values as the high order shape functions as implied by eq 11 therefore the proposed method can maintain the same accuracy as the high order approximation in the smooth regions which is confirmed by the first example of the convergence test for the discontinuous regions the smoothness indicator can detect the location of subdomain and the reconstructed shape function would approach zero due to the adjusted weight function eq 16 in this way a lot of cpu time can be saved comparing with the method of directly calculating the location of discontinuous regions and adaptively placing the discontinuous shape function in our proposed numerical scheme the least square method is used to calculate the weight function however the linear system of equations defined in eq 11 is an over determined system sometimes we may not be able to perfectly reconstruct the high order rk shape function in some cases a small perturbation of the influence domain such as round off error or different support size would affect the stability during simulation therefore how to obtain a generic and stable weight function requires further study in the future as mentioned before there are two methods of domain integration that can be used for integrating eq 25 only the nodal integration is applied for the hydrodynamic problems in current study the cell average method may have the potential for higher accuracy and flexibility of approximation order in this paper we demonstrate the proposed numerical scheme without further enrichments and special treatments there are various enrichments such as roth et al 2016 which can potentially applied with the proposed method to increase the accuracy and decrease the energy dissipation phenomenon around the discontinuous regions

23671,when high order numerical approximation method is applied to model the propagation of shock wave or discontinuity it usually creates unstable unreal numerical oscillations around the discontinuous regions in this research we propose a non oscillation meshfree scheme based on reproducing kernel particle method rkpm which can maintain the accuracy and minimize the oscillation in the modeling of shock wave propagation in the proposed method the original influence domain of high order rk approximation is divided into several subdomains then we apply low order rk approximation within each subdomain instead of directly using the discrete particles to build the numerical approximation we consider that the high order approximation is constructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function by adjusting these local weights with the smoothness indicator we can determine the effect of the corresponding subdomain and the discrete particles inside this subdomain therefore the subdomain containing discontinuity would not participate in the high order approximation and the numerical oscillation is automatically suppressed the proposed method does not need artificial viscosity or numerical damping to stabilize the solution several benchmark problems with shock wave propagation are tested the results show that the proposed method can maintain high order accuracy without numerical oscillation keywords shock capturing non oscillating method meshfree methods high order approximation reproducing kernel particle method 1 introduction the modeling of shock wave propagation is one of the most challenging tasks in the field of computational hydrodynamics to solve general ordinary differential equation o d e and partial differential equation p d e certain level of continuity from the approximation functions which depends on the degree of differentiation in the governing equations is required however when solving problems involving shock or discontinuity approximation scheme with high continuity would have oscillating response around the discontinuity region which is called the gibbs phenomenon carslaw 1925 especially in problems with shock wave propagation this non physical oscillation would increase the numerical error when the solution evolves with time in 1950 von neumann and richtmyer 1950 proposed to use artificial viscosity to minimize the numerical oscillation the mechanism of artificial viscosity involves the introduction of a dissipative term into the governing equation as an additional pressure this artificial term would create a layer surrounding the shock front where physical fields change rapidly and the oscillation would be damped out around the shock to regularize the solution however these artificial terms would also dissipate the physical energy and decrease the accuracy around the discontinuous region when simulation time increases another way to suppress the oscillation is by using the flux limiter liu et al 2015 instead of adding the artificial terms in the governing equations the flux limiter calculates the spatial derivatives in front of and behind the flux boundary the limiter function which is based on the derivatives can decide the order of approximation in the discontinuous region a low order approximation is applied to avoid the oscillation although this method does not change the governing equations the approximation near the smoothed extrema would degenerate to a low order approximation with low accuracy shu 1997 harten et al 1997 proposed the essentially non oscillation eno scheme for the simulation of discontinuous field in the eno scheme the discretized domains are separated into several candidate stencils and the stencil with the smoothest approximation would be chosen therefore the discontinuous region is not involved in the higher order approximation through the eno scheme high order approximation without numerical oscillation is achieved however eno method requires more computing time to achieve the same order of approximation in addition even a small perturbation like round off error would change the decision of the smoothest stencil liu et al 1994 the weighted eno weno scheme was proposed by liu et al 1994 this method improves the computational efficiency and accuracy of the eno scheme similar to the framework of eno weno separates the discretized domains into several stencils however unlike eno in which only one stencil would be chosen weno scheme would utilize all the stencils to construct the high order approximations by introducing a weight function this weight function is controlled by a smoothness indicator which is used to calculate the smoothness of the stencils for the discontinuous region the indicator would become very large and the weight function would approach zero therefore the discontinuous regions would be removed from the high order approximation through the weno scheme for the same computing time it can obtain a higher order of approximation and the stencil pattern would always be the same in the smooth region notice that both eno and weno schemes are developed based on the so called mesh based methods and they can be applied to the most popular computational methods such as finite difference method fdm grant and hydon 2013 finite volume method fvm shu 1998 and discontinuous galerkin dg method liu et al 2016 qiu and shu 2005 zhu et al 2016 the mesh based methods have the longest development with the advantage of stability robustness and easiness for coding on the other hand meshfree methods are well known for the abilities of easily adapting to non uniform discretization and adjusting the order of approximation meshfree methods such as the smoothed particles method sph monaghan and gingold 1983 moving particle method mpm moving least squares mls approximation meshless petrov galerkin method mpgm lin and atluri 2001 and reproducing kernel particle method rkpm liu et al 1997 are more suitable for the lagrangian framework by liberating the need for a mesh therefore meshfree methods have the potential for application in hydrodynamic problems with multi surface free surface and moving boundaries moreover for the fluid solid interaction fsi problems the meshfree methods can be easily adapted for the coupling of solid and fluid the rkpm was proposed by liu et al 1995 rkpm is a kernel based approximation it improves the completeness of the sph method by introducing a correction function into the construction of shape function the rk approximation can achieve high order accuracy by selecting appropriate support size and order of correction function this advantage makes rkpm become more popular in the field of computational mechanics unlike conventional mesh based methods which require proper mesh orientation to satisfy the need of complex geometry rkpm has the flexibility of dynamically discretizing the domain with desired number of nodes and order of approximation without complex re meshing process however for meshfree methods the non physical oscillations would still occur when higher order approximation is applied for the discontinuous domain unlike the mesh based methods the shape functions of the meshfree method are smooth and the influence area of every shape function would be overlapping with each other therefore it is difficult to define specific boundaries or interfaces at the discontinuous location generally artificial viscosity based on rankine hugoniot jump condition is applied for the shock wave problems monaghan 1994 where the dissipation term would transform the shock front into an artificial smooth layer the objective of this paper is to develop a reproducing kernel particle method rkpm based numerical framework for solving problems involving shock propagation we introduce the concept of eno and weno coupled with flux splitting scheme to correct the numerical flux at the interface of a control volume a smoothness indicator is proposed to capture the optimum stencil for the local approximation and to avoid numerical oscillation here is the organization of this paper first we introduce the general rkpm framework and some enrichments of rkpm for dealing with discontinuities then the concept of non oscillating weighted reconstructing rkpm will be discussed and the properties of approximation achieved by the proposed scheme are tested through a series of convergence tests after the numerical approximation method is presented we introduce the scalar conservation equation to verify the reliability of the proposed method for different dynamic problems the numerical flux and time integration are also presented next we discuss the governing equations for hydrodynamics problem and their discrete form lastly several famous benchmark fluid dynamics problems with high order solution and shock wave are tested using the proposed scheme and solution results are discussed 2 basic formulation 2 1 reproducing kernel particle method the reproducing kernel particle method is an advanced meshfree method which possesses both the smoothness and flexibility of general meshfree methods and polynomial reconstruction property of mesh based methods assume that a one dimensional problem domain is defined by an internal domain ω and a boundary ω using reproducing kernel particle method both ω and ω are discretized with a set of reproducing kernel points np then the unknown vector function u x is approximated by introducing the reproducing kernel shape functions 1 u h x i 1 n p ψ x x i d i where u h x is the approximation of u x ψ x x i is the reproducing kernel shape function x i is the nodal coordinate for node i and d i is the generalized nodal coefficient vector of the approximation u h x for node i the shape function ψ x x i is constructed by multiplying the correction function c x x i by the kernel function ϕ x x i 2 ψ x x i c x x i ϕ x x i the correction function c x x i is a polynomial function which is defined as 3 c x x i h t m 1 h 0 where the polynomial vector h of n th order and the moment matrix m are defined as 4 h t 1 x x i x x i 2 x x i n 5 m j n p h x x j h t x x j ϕ x x j notice that the correction function not only plays the important role of maintaining the accuracy of the approximation but also contains the information of neighboring nodes which is very important when we construct the non oscillating reproducing kernel approximation in subsequent process when discontinuities start to develop the kernel functions ϕ x x i in eq 2 control the continuity and smoothness of the approximation they also affect the influence domain of each generalized coefficient vector d i to maintain the smoothness of the approximation we introduce the cubic b spline function as the kernel function which has the third order continuity the cubic b spline function is as follows 6 ϕ x x i 2 3 4 z 2 4 z 3 for 0 z 0 5 4 3 4 z 4 z 2 4 3 z 3 for 0 5 z 1 0 for z 1 in which z x x i a the variable a is the support size used to define the influence domain of the shape function of i th particle it is important to realize that the influence domain is associated with how we can prevent the approximation function from going across the shock front and the generation of numerical oscillation substituting eqs 3 5 into eq 1 the approximation can be presented as 7 u x i n p h t j n p h x x j h t x x j ϕ x x j h 0 ϕ x x i d i fig 1 shows the effect of support size by plotting the first order and second order rk shape functions against distance with support sizes equal to one two and three times the nodal distance when a larger support size is used more rk particles would be involved in the approximation which would decrease the weight of each influencing particle therefore the shape function becomes smoother this property will also smoothen the oscillation during calculation however overly increasing the support size would not only increase the time of calculation but also increase the error of approximation this error comes from the lack of kronecker delta property of rk approximation chen et al 1996 as shown in fig 1 b the oscillatory shape functions show up when the order of shape function increases from first order as shown in fig 1 a to second order this phenomenon continues when the order increases but the approximation can be smoothened by increasing the support size in order to reduce the effect of support size in this research the support size a is set to be three times the initial distance between rk particles to avoid the singularity of moment matrix and thus achieve a more accurate solution 2 2 meshfree approximation of discontinuity and gibbs phenomenon the rkpm approximation functions are smooth and continuous functions in the spatial domain as mentioned previously the influence domain of the shape functions usually overlaps with each other to form the interaction between neighboring particles as shown in fig 2 on the other hand the influence zone of mesh based shape function is conforming to the adjacent elements mesh grid therefore it is difficult to define specific boundaries or interfaces under the meshfree framework while the mesh based method can use the boundary of the element or control volume as the boundary of the shape functions the smoothening characteristics of rk approximation and adjustable influence area become a drawback when dealing with problems involving discontinuities in addition using high order meshfree shape function would lead to numerical oscillation close to the discontinuous region which is called the gibbs phenomenon regular rk shape functions of different orders and support sizes are shown in fig 3 we can observe that higher order rk shape functions and smaller support sizes would cause more severe oscillation one alternative way to avoid non physical oscillation is to apply a discontinuous shape function belytschko et al 1996 shown in fig 4 at the discontinuous location the simplest way to construct a discontinuous shape function is to use a visibility criterion by using the visibility criterion the discontinuous region is treated as an opaque wall the support of the meshfree shape functions is truncated at the opaque wall therefore only particles on the same side of the wall would participate in the construction of shape function as shown in fig 5 by applying the discontinuous shape function we can obtain results with high accuracy and a discontinuous region that is free of oscillation this discontinuous rk shape function can be well adapted for crack problems or contact problems in which there is region separated by the cracks or different objects in between the contact surfaces for the modeling of these mechanical problems the discontinuous region is usually predefined and assumed to be stationary however in most cases it is very difficult to detect the locations of discontinuities the most famous and widely used benchmark problem of moving discontinuity is the shock tube problem the shock tube is a one dimensional tube filled with two different types of gases which are separated by a diaphragm these two separated gases have different initial states such as pressure density and total energy see fig 6 both ends of the tube are assumed to be very far from the interface at the initial state the gases in both sides are static after the diaphragm is removed the gas with higher initial pressure would start to push the low pressure gas and the compressed gas would then generate a high speed wave shock wave which would propagate from the contact surface to the low pressure side the gas with higher pressure also tends to expand therefore the expansion wave is generated in the high pressure region the process of the propagation of expansion wave is called the expansion fan the region of expansion wave would grow with time the shock tube problem is illustrated in fig 6 for the modeling of shock tube the approximation of the spatial domain needs to have the capability of describing the moving discontinuous regions during the simulation without introducing any numerical instability generally for problems with arbitrary discontinuities artificial viscosities are applied therefore the discontinuous region is replaced by smoother solution and the gibbs phenomenon can be removed by using a certain form of damping especially for meshfree type of methods because of the use of very high order shape functions or over smoothed interpolation either the gibbs phenomenon or large numerical damping are found here we use sod s shock tube problem as an example the comparison of numerical results with and without artificial viscosity is shown in fig 7 the theoretical background and implementation of the artificial viscosity in this example can be found from monaghan 1994 as shown in fig 7 when the coefficients of artificial viscosity increase the oscillation around the discontinuous region is significantly suppressed but the artificial dissipation would also create a smooth layer also the viscosity coefficients need to be adjusted when we change the order and support size of the shape functions note that the flexibility to adjust the order and support size is a key advantage of meshfree methods over mesh based methods because of the drawbacks of using artifical viscosity we propose a special approximation method in this paper which uses a weighted approximation to suppress the effect of discontinuous region and well describes the discontinuous region without any artificial viscosity 2 3 weighted reconstruction of rk shape function for the rk shape function a higher order approximation usually requires a larger influence domain therefore more particles would be involved in the approximation and the discontinuous regions may locate inside the support domain and cause numerical oscillation in order to isolate these discontinuous regions from the domain with high order approximation we first divide the original influence domain into several subdomains then we apply regular low order rk approximation for these subdomains the high order approximations are later reconstructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function by adjusting the local weights we can minimize the effect of the subdomains containing the discontinuous regions therefore the discrete particles around the discontinuous regions are removed from the high order approximation the basic idea of calculating the local weight function for a subdomain follows the weno method liu et al 1994 for a high order approximation the original influence domain is divided into several subdomains which are illustrated in fig 8 by selecting subdomains with different sizes we can build several different local approximations at position x in each subdomain we can construct a series of lower order approximations of any function f x by applying eq 1 at position x i 1 2 8 f j h x i 1 2 k n p l ψ x i 1 2 x i n p l k j f i n p l k j where the subscript j is the j th subdomain of the lower order approximation and npl is the number of particles in the j th subdomain therefore we can use a set of weight function to adjust the lower order approximations and rebuild a higher order approximation 9 f h x i 1 2 j n s w j f j h x i 1 2 where w j is the weight function of the j th subdomain and ns is the total number of subdomains for the lower order approximation substituting eq 8 into eq 9 we can obtain 10 j n s w j k n p l ψ k j f k j l n p h ψ l f l for convenience we use the superscript j and subscript k to represent the k th particles in the j th subdomain the shape functions ψ and ψ are the lower order and higher order rk shape functions respectively npl is the total number of discrete particles in the j th subdomain nph is the total number of discrete particles of the original influence domain for the higher order approximation in order to find the weight function we rewrite eq 10 in matrix form as follows 11 φ w φ where 12 φ ψ 1 s 1 0 0 ψ 2 s 1 ψ 1 s 2 0 ψ 2 s 2 ψ 1 s 3 ψ n p 1 s 1 ψ 2 s 3 0 ψ n p i s 2 0 0 ψ n p n s n s w w 1 w 2 w n s φ ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n p h then the weight vector w is defined as 13 w φ t φ 1 φ t φ we need to apply the smoothness indicators in the calculation of weight function in order to avoid explicitly finding those regions with discontinuities then only the continuous regions would participate in the reconstruction of the higher order approximation the smoothness indicators are presented as 14 β j k 1 n δ x k d k d x k f j h x 2 where n is the order of approximation and the initial length between rk particles δ x is used to eliminate the effect of nodal distance the smoothness indicators are used to detect which subdomain contains the discontinuities by applying eq 8 for f j h x the discrete form of the smoothness indicators can be written as 15 β j k 1 n δ x k i n p l d k ψ i d x k f i 2 when the subdomain contains the discontinuous region the indicator β would approach infinity and the reciprocal of β would approach zero therefore we can use the smoothness indicators to calculate the adjusted weight function w i and reduce the influence of the discontinuous region 16 w i α i k n s α k 17 α i w i ε β i 2 where ɛ is a small value used to prevent singularity in this paper ɛ is set as ε 0 01 a 2 where a is the support size which is mentioned before finally the higher order approximation of eq 9 would be adjusted by eq 16 such that 18 f h j n s w j k n p l ψ k j f k j 2 4 convergence test in order to verify the accuracy of the reconstructed rk shape function we perform two convergence rate analyses one of the analyses is to exam the approximation of a high order continuous smooth function with the reconstructed rk shape functions this numerical test can be used to analyze the convergence rate of the proposed method and to compare the linear and third order rk approximations another analysis is about the approximation of a step function this step function has a discontinuity at the location x 0 through the use of a discontinuous function we can compare the convergence rate of the reconstructed rk approximation with the original rk approximation of the same order for the first convergence analysis the function u x is a combination of two trigonometric functions 19 u x sin x cos x x π π we apply the maximum absolute error to evaluate the rate of convergence the error is defined as 20 error max u h u in this analysis we use uniform discretization with 21 31 41 51 and 61 rk nodes with the initial distance between particles as δ x we test three kinds of numerical approximation schemes to reconstruct the third order approximation 1 first order rk shape function with support size a δ x 2 third order rk shape function with support size a 2 δ x 3 first order rk shape function with support size a 2 δ x the numerical results for 21 point discretization are shown in fig 9 the reconstructed higher order rk approximation has better accuracy than the lower order rk approximation the convergence analysis result is presented in fig 10 from the convergence analysis it can be observed that the reconstructed third order rk approximation has the same accuracy and convergence rate as the original third order rk approximation the second analysis is to demonstrate the performance of the smoothness indicator coupling with the reconstructed rk shape function we introduce a simple step function 21 u x 1 x 0 1 x 0 x 1 1 in this analysis the total numbers of rk nodes are 20 30 40 50 and 60 and we apply a uniform discretization the first order and third order rk approximations as well as the reconstructed higher order rk approximation are compared to show how low high and modified approximations model the discontinuity the support sizes of the first order and third order rk shape functions are both a 2 δ x we also use the first order rk shape function to reconstruct the third order approximation in this analysis as shown in fig 11 the total number of discrete points is 20 and the result of the reconstructed higher order rk approximation has better accuracy than the others by separating the approximation in each subdomain the weight function of eq 16 in the discontinuous region becomes zero therefore the points on different sides of the discontinuous region would not be involved in the reconstructed rk shape function on the other hand the third order rk approximation shows there would be gibbs phenomenon near the discontinuous region while the first order rk approximation tends to smoothen the solution in the same region the error from the third order rk approximation is mainly caused by the oscillation instead of the approximation error we can also observe the oscillation phenomenon in the convergence analysis fig 12 only the reconstructed rk approximation can still maintain a high convergent rate 3 waves propagating problems in order to test the applicability of smoothness indicator in the dynamics problem we use the scalar conservation equation with two types of initial conditions both cases have many discontinuous sections the scalar conservation equation is given by 22 u x t t c u x t x 0 where c is the wave velocity and we choose c 1 in this analysis for the finite volume scheme the entire spatial domain is divided into several cells then we take the integrated form of eq 22 and perform integration in each cell therefore for i th cell the conservation equation becomes 23 1 δ x i ω i u x t t d ω i 1 δ x i ω i u x t x d ω i 0 where δ x i is the length of the i th cell and ω i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 is the i th cell domain by introducing the divergence theory the one dimensional conservation equation becomes 24 u i t 1 δ x u x i 1 2 t u x i 1 2 t 0 where 25 u i 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u x t d ω i for convenience the values of function u on the right and left boundaries of the i th cell are denoted as u i and u i in eq 24 the continuity at x i 1 2 should be enforced by the approximation for both i 1 th and i 1 th cells which means the physical quantities u i should be equal to u i 1 however the approximation for the i th cell is inconsistent with the approximation for the i 1 th cell which leads to inconsistency of physical quantities at the cell boundary x i 1 2 the dash line in fig 13 this is because the cell average is used for the spatial discretization the approximation of physical quantities at point x i 1 2 would also be different when approaching from the right side and from the left side in order to ensure the consistency at the boundary of the control volume numerical flux is applied in this paper we apply the lax friedrichs flux because it is simple computationally inexpensive and has the same accuracy as the other numerical flux methods for the higher order approximation shu 1998 the lax friedrichs flux is defined as 26 h i u i 1 u i 1 2 u i 1 u i u i 1 u i by applying the numerical flux above into eq 24 we obtain 27 u i t 1 δ x h i h i 0 the integration of eq 25 leads to two different approximations of u first by nodal integration u i would be equal to the value at the center of the i th cell therefore the approximate function u x for each cell becomes 28 u x u i x i th cell moreover the shape functions of the approximation of u x are simply the general rk shape function calculated by eq 2 second with the cell average concept we can assume that the numerical approximation of the arbitrary function u x would become the summation of the cell average multiplying by a modified rk shape function which can be presented as 29 u h x k n p a φ k u k where φ is the modified rk shape function and npa is the total number of particles involving in the approximation in order to calculate the modified shape functions we first define a primitive function of u x which is given by 30 v x x u ξ d ξ through eq 25 the value of the primitive function on the right boundary of the i th cell v x i 1 2 is presented as 31 v x i 1 2 k i u k δ x k introducing eq 1 the approximation of the primitive function v x becomes 32 v h x i n p ψ i v i where v i is the cell boundary value which is equal to v x i 1 2 in eq 32 we subtract v 1 from both sides of the equation due to consistency of the rk shape function we can get 33 v h v 1 i n p ψ i v i v 1 where 34 v i v 1 m 2 i u m δ x m therefore we obtain 35 v h v 1 j 2 n p m 2 j u m δ x m ψ j because v x is the primitive function of u x the derivative of the left side of eq 35 would be the approximation of u x which can be written as 36 u h x j 2 n p m 2 j u m δ x m ψ j therefore the modified shape functions in eq 29 can be calculated as 37 φ m j m n p ψ j δ x m then eq 29 becomes 38 u h x m 2 n p j m n p u m δ x m ψ j in this paper both nodal integration and cell average integration methods are applied first we use eq 38 for the approximation of scalar fields in the conservation equation to demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method however in the remaining problems the approximation of physical fields are based on eq 28 which is the nodal integration method 3 1 time integration to solve the semi discrete eq 24 we use the total variation diminishing tvd runge kutta method for time discretization the time discretization of eq 24 with the third order tvd runge kutta scheme can be written as 39 u i n 1 3 u i n δ t δ x u i 1 2 n u i 1 2 n u i n 2 3 3 4 u i n 1 4 u i n 1 3 δ t δ x u i 1 2 n 1 3 u i 1 2 n 1 3 u i n 1 1 3 u i n 2 3 u i n 2 3 δ t δ x u i 1 2 n 2 3 u i 1 2 n 2 3 where the superscript n represents the n th step and δ t is the incremental time in this paper we apply uniform time discretization 3 2 wave propagating problem with step wave as the first problem of wave propagation we use a square wave shown in fig 14 and the initial state of u is presented as 40 u x 0 0 1 x 0 25 2 0 25 x 0 25 0 0 25 x 1 in this case the square wave has two discontinuous edges these two edges would propagate with the wave and maintain the shape of a square wave except for the discontinuous regions the scalar function remains constant therefore in eq 15 the value of the smoothness indicator becomes zero in the regions with constant solution value and is dominated by the first order derivative of the scalar function around the two discontinuous edges the total number of rk nodes is 400 and the time increment is δ t 5 e 3 in this case we apply eq 38 for the approximation of the scalar function the original influence domain includes six particles from i 2 th cell to i 3 th cell and is divided into three subdomains these three subdomains all contain four particles from i k 3 th cell to i k th cell where k represents the k th subdomain and k 1 2 3 we use the third order rk shape function to re construct the fifth order approximation for the subdomain in addition for the original influence domain and subdomains the support size a is set to be three times of the initial distance between particles the numerical results at different time instants are presented in fig 15 from the numerical results we can observe that the smoothness indicators can well detect the discontinuous regions during the wave propagation therefore only the smoothed regions would participate in the reconstruction of the high order rk approximation and the numerical oscillation can be eliminated during the wave propagation 3 3 wave propagating problems with complex wave shape as the second case a more complex waveform is considered we use the example from harten and osher 1987 the wave shape is shown in fig 16 the initial state of this wave is given by 41 u x 0 x sin 3 π x 2 2 sin 2 π x 2 x 1 1 6 sin 3 π x 1 x 1 3 x 1 3 1 3 x 1 unlike the first case the wave has c 0 continuity at certain positions therefore the smoothness indicator does not only detect the discontinuous regions but also the locations of c 0 continuity the time and spatial discretization schemes are the same as those in case one the time increment is δ t 5 e 3 for the k th subdomain it contains four particles from i k 3 th cell to i k th cell and there are totally six particles inside the original influence domain the third order rk shape function is applied to the subdomain to re construct the fifth order rk approximation both the low order and high order rk shape functions have support size a which is set to be three times of the initial distance between particles the numerical results at different time instants are shown in fig 17 in this case the indicator can both capture the discontinuous regions and the low continuity regions c 0 continuity in this case therefore only the smoothed regions would participate in the reconstruction of high order rk approximation and the numerical oscillation can be eliminated during the wave propagation based on the smoothness indicator we can detect not only the discontinuous regions but also the critical points by choosing the appropriate order n in eq 15 the order n depends on the low order approximation which can be adjusted according to the requirements of different problems as long as it is not greater than the order of approximation for the first case the approximation in the subdomain is of third order but the wave is highly continuous except for the two discontinuous regions therefore the order n in the smoothness indicator can simply set as n 1 4 hydrodynamic analyses with shock waves the governing equations for most hydrodynamics problem include continuity momentum and energy equations in addition the fluid is assumed inviscid and the gravity is neglected the governing equations are 42 ρ t ρ v 43 v t 1 ρ p v v 44 e t p ρ v v e where ρ v p and e are the fluid density velocity pressure and initial specific energy respectively in the velocity vector v u v w the terms u v and w are the components of the velocity vector in the x y and z directions in the cartesian coordinate system there are several methods developed for solving the pressure distribution for compressible and incompressible flows for smoothed particle method sph the flow can be assumed to be slight compressible flow sph is a meshfree method introduced by gingold and monaghan 1977 the equation of state for slightly compressible fluid to calculate the pressure of particle which was developed by monaghan 1994 can be expressed using the following equation 45 p p ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where ρ 0 is the density of the initial state and p γ are the pressure coefficients for compressible flow such as ideal gas the pressure is obtained by introducing the equation of state defined as follows 46 p ρ e γ 1 where γ 1 4 is the adiabatic index for an ideal gas and e is the internal energy per unit mass the governing equation of hydrodynamic in the conservative form for a one dimensional domain is given by 47 u t f u x 0 where 48 u ρ ρ u e f ρ u ρ u 2 p e p u and e ρ e u 2 2 is the total energy the one dimensional discrete form of the governing equation can be written as 49 u i t 1 δ x f u i 1 2 f u i 1 2 0 where 50 u i 1 δ x i x i 1 2 x i 1 2 u d ω i by applying the lax friedrichs flux the vector form of the numerical flux can be presented as 51 f i u i 1 u i 1 2 f u i 1 f u i 1 2 a u i 1 u i here the superscripts and represent the left and right boundaries of the cell in order to calculate matrix a we first rewrite eq 47 as 52 u t r λ r 1 u x 0 where r and λ are the eigenvectors and diagonal eigenvalues respectively which are equal to 53 r 1 1 c 2 1 c 2 0 1 ρ c 1 ρ c 0 1 1 λ u 0 0 0 u c 0 0 0 u c matrix a can be defined as 54 a r λ r 1 if we use λ i i to denote the i th diagonal term of λ it can be calculated as 55 λ i i max λ i i i 1 λ i i i under the numerical flux scheme eq 49 would become 56 u i t 1 δ x f i f i in this paper we apply the third order tvd runge kutta scheme for time discretization 4 1 shock tube problem the modeling of shock wave propagation is a benchmark problem to test the robustness of a numerical method due to the complexity of physical behavior and numerical restriction around the shock front in practical applications shock wave is an important phenomenon in explosion fluid mixture interface and super sonic motion the shock tube problem can be seen as the riemann problems it is a one dimensional simulation to test the accuracy of the developed numerical scheme for the discontinuous regions the initial condition of the riemann problem is presented as 57 u u l if x 0 u r if x 0 where x is the position of the tube and the diaphragm is located at x 0 in this paper we test two different sets of initial conditions 4 1 1 sod s shock tube the first standard problem is called the sod s 1978 shock tube problem the setting of the sod s problem is as follows the whole tube is filled with ideal gas the left region of the gas has higher density and pressure which are equal to ρ l 1 and p l 1 and in the right region the density and pressure are equal to ρ r 0 25 and p r 0 2154 the gas at both sides of the tube is initially at rest and the spatial domain ranges from x 1 to x 1 the boundary conditions at both sides are treated as infinite boundary the proposed method is compared with the weno scheme which has the same order of approximation and number of discrete particles the fourth order approximation is applied for the original influence domain and second order approximation is used for the subdomains the original influence domain of the rk shape function contains five discrete particles form i 2 th to i 2 th cell and it is divided into three subdomains for k th subdomain there are three cells form i 3 k th to i 1 k th the support sizes of the high order and low order shape functions are set to be equal to three times the nodal distance the numerical results with 100 200 300 and 400 discrete particles at 0 3 s are shown in fig 18 the proposed method can easily adapt to non uniform discretization for non uniform discretization a random perturbation ε is applied to every particle in this example the perturbation is set to be ε 0 3 δ x with the same arrangement of subdomains the numerical results for 400 particles at 0 2 and 0 3 s are presented in fig 19 in order to test the effect of approximation order we apply the first order and second order rk approximations for the subdomain to reconstruct the third order and fourth order approximations respectively the original influence domain of the third order shape function contains four discrete particles form i 1 th to i 2 th cell and there are three cells form i 2 k th to i 1 k th in the k th subdomain for convenience the support sizes of all shape functions are set to be equal to three times of the nodal distance the comparison of different orders of approximation with 400 discrete particles is shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 18 the proposed method can capture the shock front and the contact surface without any numerical oscillation even when low number of discrete particles is used in addition the simulation by the proposed method has the same accuracy as the weno scheme also as shown in fig 20 both simulations can well describe the density field including the shock front and the contact surface 4 1 2 lax s shock tube the other riemann problem is called the lax s 1954 shock tube in this numerical test the jumps of the density field at the contact surface and the shock front are extremely high the initial conditions of lax s problem are ρ l u l p l 0 445 0 698 3 528 and ρ r u r p r 0 5 0 0 571 the spatial domain and the boundary conditions are the same as those for sod s shock tube as shown in fig 21 discrete particles with four different nodal densities are applied and the numerical results along with those from weno scheme are presented for non uniform discretization perturbation of nodal position same as in sod s shock tube problem is applied the numerical results with 400 particles at 0 2 and 0 3 s are presented in fig 22 the comparison of different orders first order approximation to reconstruct third order function and second order approximation to reconstruct fourth order function of weighted reconstructing rk approximations both with 400 discrete particles is shown in fig 23 unlike the sod s shock tube the lax s shock tube has two strong discontinuous surfaces therefore in fig 21 there exists small dissipation when coarse discretization is used when the density of discretization increases this small dissipation would be suppressed in addition there are no numerical oscillations around the shock front and the contact surface as shown in fig 23 the higher order approximation fourth order approximation has better accuracy 4 2 entropy wave problem this problem is called the shu osher problem 1989 which is similar to lux s shock tube problem the tube is filled with ideal gas which has different pressures and densities on two sides of the diaphragm however the density on the right side follows a spatial sine wave function the shock wave would propagate to the right after the diaphragm has been removed behind the shock front two kinds of perturbed fields with different spatial frequencies would be generated one of the frequencies is equal to the initial setting of the right side of tube the other frequency is equal to twice of the first one and the perturbed field with higher frequency is closer to the shock therefore this problem can test the ability of a numerical scheme to capture the shock and the high order solution behind the shock in this problem the initial conditions of the gas are as follows 58 ρ l 3 85714 u l 2 62937 p l 10 33333 for x 0 8 ρ r 1 0 2 sin 5 x u r 0 p r 1 for x 0 8 for this problem the spatial discretization is uniform with 400 particles in the domain x 1 1 the boundary conditions at both ends of the tube are treated as infinite boundaries this problem is a non linear problem and the exact solution is not available therefore the solution based on weno scheme with 2000 particles is regarded as the reference solution for comparison purpose the numerical results with 400 discrete particles based on our proposed method are compared with those from weno scheme at 0 18 and 0 4 s which are shown in fig 24 in fig 24 numerical results based on different orders of approximations with 400 discrete particles at 0 4 s are shown as observed in fig 24 the two perturbations with different frequencies in the density field are all captured by the proposed scheme without any oscillation in addition the dissipation at the tip of the wave with higher frequency is due to the lack of particles in the sharp region as shown in fig 25 the numerical results based on the proposed numerical scheme can accurately describe the density field in the lower frequency region but only the fourth order approximation can capture the higher frequency perturbation 4 3 two interacting blast waves in this problem there are two blast points at both ends of the tube woodward and colella 1984 which is shown in fig 26 in the beginning blast sources on both sides would create strong shocks towards the center of the tube and there would be strong rarefactions towards the walls that immediately reflect back toward the center shown in fig 27 because the process is very complex due to the strong discontinuities created by the shocks at the contact surfaces the multiple interactions between the shock and rarefactions may amplify the numerical oscillation which can pollute the solution the tube is filled with the same ideal gas the density of the gas is ρ 1 and the gas is at rest with initial pressure of 0 01 for the left source the pressure is set to be 1000 while pressure is assumed to be 100 for the right source therefore the entire problem can be separated into three regions 59 u u l if x 0 8 u c if 0 8 x 0 8 u r if x 0 8 where u l u r and u c are the vectors of the state variables in the high blast low blast and regular regions respectively the spatial discretization is uniform and the total number of discrete particles in the spatial domain x 1 1 is 400 the boundary conditions on both ends are reflective boundaries the two initial shocks would influence each other in the middle section of the tube the interaction of the reflecting waves would also affect the process in fig 28 the numerical results with 400 discrete particles are compared with those based on weno scheme with 1000 particles at 0 076 s the proposed method has the same accuracy as the weno scheme and both results can well describe the discontinuous surfaces without any numerical oscillations in fig 29 results from different orders of approximations all with 400 discrete particles are compared as seen in the comparison the higher order approximation has better accuracy in the complex and discontinuous regions in addition the proposed method has more flexibility in the usage of order of approximation this property is the main advantage of our proposed meshfree method 5 conclusions in this paper we have developed a weighted reconstructing rkpm for solving problems involving shock wave propagation the reconstructing high order approximation has the same convergence rate as the regular high order approximation moreover for the physical field with discontinuities the proposed method can still maintain the convergence rate and accuracy in the proposed method the original influence domain of high order rk approximation is divided into several subdomains then we apply low order rk approximation within each subdomain instead of directly using the discrete particles to build the numerical approximation we consider that the high order approximation is constructed by the summation of those low order approximations multiplied by a local weight function the reconstructed shape functions in those subdomains would still have the same values as the high order shape functions as implied by eq 11 therefore the proposed method can maintain the same accuracy as the high order approximation in the smooth regions which is confirmed by the first example of the convergence test for the discontinuous regions the smoothness indicator can detect the location of subdomain and the reconstructed shape function would approach zero due to the adjusted weight function eq 16 in this way a lot of cpu time can be saved comparing with the method of directly calculating the location of discontinuous regions and adaptively placing the discontinuous shape function in our proposed numerical scheme the least square method is used to calculate the weight function however the linear system of equations defined in eq 11 is an over determined system sometimes we may not be able to perfectly reconstruct the high order rk shape function in some cases a small perturbation of the influence domain such as round off error or different support size would affect the stability during simulation therefore how to obtain a generic and stable weight function requires further study in the future as mentioned before there are two methods of domain integration that can be used for integrating eq 25 only the nodal integration is applied for the hydrodynamic problems in current study the cell average method may have the potential for higher accuracy and flexibility of approximation order in this paper we demonstrate the proposed numerical scheme without further enrichments and special treatments there are various enrichments such as roth et al 2016 which can potentially applied with the proposed method to increase the accuracy and decrease the energy dissipation phenomenon around the discontinuous regions

23672,as an important equipment gangway and its safety are crucial during offshore operation and its dynamic response raises concerns especially when gangway is deployed between two free floating structures in this paper the response of a passive telescopic gangway between monohull flotel and fpso in nonparallel side by side configuration is investigated numerically and experimentally the numerical model is established within the frequency domain where the hydrodynamics are solved by 3d potential flow theory the nonlinear factor roll damping is treated by using stochastic linearization the connection between gangway and vessel is assumed to be an ideal joint subsequently gangway responses are derived by properly taking into account various motions of flotel and fpso gangway responses such as its extension and rotation are presented in simulation as well as measurement to interpret physics firstly vessel global motions in single body and multi body cases are compared then relative motions between gangway points at flotel and fpso ends are illustrated notably the impact of multi body hydrodynamic interaction is analyzed the interaction triggers two types of couplings i e coupling between two vessels as well as coupling within one vessel such as coupled sway and pitch which does not exist in the single body case therefore the contribution of respective degree of freedom dof of flotel and fpso to gangway response are detailedly discussed the simulation has generally good agreement with the model test most extra peaks or troughs observed in results those reflect hydrodynamic and mechanical couplings are well captured keywords multi body hydrodynamics gangway side by side flotel accommodation vessel roll damping stochastic linearization 1 introduction during the past decade a number of accommodation vessels i e flotel of monohull type were built thanks to the huge demand from offshore oil and gas industry the flotel is able to offer quality accommodation for over several hundred people and provide onsite construction commissioning or maintenance services for offshore engineering activities the flotel market may keep expanding in the future because of new recent needs such as offshore wind farm as well as its installation and maintenance compared to traditional accommodation unit i e semi submersible monohull units are cheaper to build maintain and relocate in short time because of the own propulsion system moreover some newly built monohull flotel are equipped with dynamic positioning dp system which makes it a more attractive solution pérez et al 2014 nevertheless uncertainties exist for monohull flotel when it services another ship shaped floating unit in side by side configuration on one hand project owner pursues the operability and push to maximize the uptime on the other hand the multi body scenario gives rise to more complicated circumstance than access to the fixed platform one main concern is the failure of accessibility of telescopic gangway which is limited by rigorous criteria such as gangway extension gangway rotation etc actually due to lack of investigation the gangway operation between flotel and other ship shaped vessel is rarely implemented in reality so far therefore our study is urgent and we aim at predicting and understanding the physics of gangway response hopefully the outcome is useful to design and optimization in practical operation all time independent environment loads like wind current and second order mean drift wave load are handled by dp system and so are those low frequency time dependent loads such as second order wave slow drift force as a result the dynamic gangway response is contributed by wave frequency excitation only basically this paper involves two main issues i e multi body hydrodynamic problem and various motions including the relative motion of vessels as well as gangway response in terms of hydrodynamics our problem is similar with one of recent popular research topics i e side by side offloading between flng lng carrier kim et al 2003 chen 2005 hong et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 fournier et al 2006 pauw et al 2007 pessoa et al 2015 these researchers made an effort to investigate novel improvements in potential flow theory nonlinear load or dissipation of gap resonance on the free surface however the gap resonance due to lack of viscosity in potential flow theory in the present case doesn t exist because the gap width is typically over 30 m depending on gangway length while it is about 4 m for flng offloading this paper will be focusing on numerical modeling of two side by side ship shape vessels in unique nonparallel configuration as well as analysis of operability criteria e g gangway response in fact relevant research is rarely exposed though some similar subjects regarding multi body has been reported ócatháin et al 2008 sun et al 2012 feng and bai 2017 in 2005 morandini et al 2005 computed some basic gangway responses such as extension under tandem offloading configuration nevertheless the hydrodynamic interaction in the tandem case is much less than it is in the side by side case moreover the calculations didn t include criteria those complicated response e g angle between gangway and top base plate of gangway tower guanche et al 2016 carried out a numerical simulation of walkability between supply vessels and floating wind turbine of semi sub type by employing fender or gangway but they emphasized the weather window and gangway response was just analyzed qualitatively through vessel global motions in addition the vessel roll damping which should be of significant importance was treated roughly that a percentage of critical damping was specified in light of above we establish a numerical model for nonparallel side by side connection configuration between a 180 m long flotel and suezmax size fpso to investigate their relative motion and the passive gangway response all computations are conducted in the frequency domain because the linear wave frequency response is the only source while non linear load and motion are absent as mentioned above obvious advantages are that firstly the calculation is much more efficient and appropriate for weather window or operability study where numerous sea states need to be considered secondly linear superposition enables to analyze respective contributions of components which form the final result like gangway extension the multi body hydrodynamics are solved by potential flow based boundary element method incorporating the free surface green function which is briefly described in section 3 1 the coupling effect is solved in radiation calculation and taken into account in motion equation later on attention should be paid on roll damping which may cause unreasonable response around natural period and consequently affect the accuracy of other results due to the nonlinear character of roll damping we adopt the stochastic linearization method based on the minimum mean square deviation of linearization error regarding the mechanical link between gangway and vessel an ideal articulation is assumed on both ends so that the gangway is able to freely rotate while the three displacements are totally restrained the numerical model of gangway response is derived in section 3 2 a comprehensive experiment had been conducted in marintek trondheim norway where we carried out a series tests for 1 50 scaled physical models the relevant descriptions are summarized in section 4 for comparison purpose we measured both results in single body and multi body scenarios respectively results are interpreted in section 5 in different steps firstly the global motion of both vessels in the single body case is presented in section 5 1 and which is followed by global motions again in section 5 2 while in multi body case then in section 5 3 the three relative motions between two gangway ends on each vessel are illustrated finally the gangway response is demonstrated in section 5 4 the comparison indicates that good agreement of measurement and simulation has been achieved in general results also reveal that physics of vessel vessel interaction and gangway response have been correctly understood and appropriately taken into account in the numerical model some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 engineering background in our study the flotel is 180 m long in overall and 24 3 m width as shown in fig 1 the unit provides floating accommodation facilities to comfortably house a complement of 450 persons including its own crew and catering staff working platform and logistics support the unit is a diesel electric dp2 vessel uniquely designed and equipped to provide extensive accommodation and workshop facilities to support and service offshore projects in deep water areas the telescopic gangway located at portside of ship stern has an average length of 38 5 m 8 00 m telescopic the gangway doesn t include any motion compensation facility the proposed landing point is on the starboard of fpso where is close to stern as well according to operator s experience rather than the parallel side by side an angle between flotel and fpso is preferred because it s able to gain faster reaction in terms of thruster propulsion the station keeping of fpso is provided by internal turret mooring system due to weathervane the yaw angle may still vary in a small range even after fpso achieves its mean yaw angle under a specific sea state therefore the assumption is that the dp system is capable of reacting and maintaining the original configuration i e angle between and the distance between vessels then the frequency domain method which is geometrically based on mean position is valid the characteristics of both flotel and fpso are summarized in table 1 the water depth of target operation site is 784 m 3 theoretical background 3 1 multi body hydrodynamics we consider a floating body without forward speed on the surface of perfect fluid in the presence of an incident propagative wave the fluid motion is assumed to be harmonic in time with the circular frequency ω in such a way that we can write the velocity potential 1 φ p t ℜ ϕ p e i ω t in which ℜ stands for taking the real part the boundary value problem for the velocity potential ϕ is expressed as 2 2 ϕ 0 in the fluid domain 3 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z 0 at z 0 4 ϕ z 0 at z h 5 lim r r ϕ r i k 0 ϕ 0 in the far field where h denotes the water depth the time harmonic potential is further expressed as the sum of various components 6 ϕ n i ω m 1 m j 1 6 a j m ϕ j n m a 0 ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 n m the superscript j denotes the j th degree of freedom dof of the body the superscript n denotes the n th body the superscript m denotes the m th body m denotes the number of bodies thus ϕ j n m is the radiation potential corresponding to j th dof oscillations of the m th body and a j m are amplitude of corresponding motions j th dof of body m a 0 and ϕ 0 are the amplitude and potential of incoming wave ϕ j n m is the potential on the n th body due to diffracted waves by m th body 7 ϕ 0 g ω cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x cos β y sin β where β k 0 and h are the wave heading wave number and water depth the radiation potentials ϕ j n m satisfies the boundary condition on bodies hull 8 ϕ j n m p n n j n p h n 0 e l s e w h e r e the diffraction potential ϕ 7 satisfied the boundary condition on bodies hull 9 ϕ 7 n m n ϕ 0 n n m 0 e l s e w h e r e besides the boundary conditions on the body hull as described in eq 8 and eq 9 the radiation and diffraction potentials satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the boundary conditions on the free surface on the sea bed and a radiation condition at infinity these boundary value problems are solved by the boundary element method bem implemented in software hydrostar chen 2004 in which the boundary integral equation incorporating the green function is established on the body surface only once the radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained by bem the added mass matrices a k j n m and radiation damping matrices b k j n m and the first order wave loads f k n are given by 10 ω 2 a k j n m i ω b k j n m ω 2 ρ h n d s ϕ j m n k a n d f k n i ω ρ a 0 h n d s ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 n m n k with h n the hull of the n th body finally the motion equations for multiple bodies m being the number of bodies are given by 11 m 1 m j 1 6 ω 2 δ n m m k j n m a k j n m i ω b k j n m b e q m δ n m c k j n m a j m f k n for n 1 2 m and k 1 2 6 in eq 11 δ n m is the kroneker symbol while m k j n m and c k j n m are the inertia and hydrostatic matrices of the m th body note b e q m is equivalent linear damping for roll of each vessel which is expressed in calculation as follows based on stochastic linearization 12 b e q m b l i n m 8 3 π ω a 4 m b q u a d m where b l i n m and b q u a d m are additional roll linear and quadratic damping coefficients they are captured from free decay test a 4 m is amplitude of roll angle since a 4 m is unknown an iterated calculation is implemented between eq 11 and 12 and which stops till a 4 m converges and an initial a 4 m needs to be given to launch the iteration it converges quickly within several iterations saying less than 10 this method better reflects the nonlinear physics of ship roll damping than a given constant linear damping the equivalent damping changes in different wave heights 3 2 gangway response there are as many as more than ten different criteria related to gangway response to be checked in a real project in this paper we just investigate most typical and complicated ones basically there are three coordinate systems in our methodology to represent fpso flotel and gangway respectively as shown in fig 2 as for vessel coordinate system x y and z axes are positive towards to bow portside and upward all rotations are defined according to right hand screw rule the environmental directions are defined based on fpso coordinate system 0 and 90 denote that waves propagate from stern and starboard of fpso and so on 3 2 1 gangway extension firstly we need to define relative motions because two vessels are in different coordinate system it s either fine to compute based on flotel or fpso coordinate system so we chose fpso in this case then three translation displacements of any point of the vessel in the local coordinate system can be expressed in below according to rigid body dynamics 13 x y z a 1 a 2 a 3 0 z g w y g w z g w 0 x g w y g w x g w 0 a 4 a 5 a 6 where a i i 1 6 denote surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions x g w y g w z g w are location of interested point i e gangway point in our case to transfer flotel s displacement to fpso coordinate the following conversion is required 14 x y z cos θ f sin θ f 0 sin θ f cos θ f 0 0 0 1 x y z finally relative motions written as δ x δ y and δ z in fpso coordinate can be easily obtained by subtraction of respective displacement as eq 13 and eq 14 relative motions in fpso coordinate are further converted to gangway coordinate system 15 δ x g w δ y g w δ z g w cos θ g w sin θ g w 0 sin θ g w cos θ g w 0 0 0 1 δ x δ y δ z gangway extension is directly relevant to motions at two ends of gangway on each vessel it s able to be obtained by the formula below 16 d e x t l 0 1 1 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 l 0 1 1 cos arctan δ x g w l 0 δ y g w cos arctan δ x g w l 0 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 where l 0 is gangway original length the three terms of above formula are contributions of δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w respectively 3 2 2 gangway rotation one criterion α z i e angle between gangway and gangway top base plate is computed as illustrated in fig 3 to compute α z we consider the angle between gangway and gangway tower φ z as follows according to geometry 17 φ z 90 β z γ z where β z and γ z are angle between gangway and horizontal plane as well as angle between gangway tower and vertical plane β z is straightforward which is determined by vertical relative motion of both gangway ends zero degree of gangway and horizontal plane in static equilibrium position 18 β z δ z g w l 0 γ z is generated by flotel s roll and pitch motion i e a 4 f l o t e l and a 5 f l o t e l however these rotations need to be converted to gangway coordinate system by following equation 19 γ z a 4 f l o t e l sin θ f g w a 5 f l o t e l cos θ f g w then α z is able to be obtained by 20 α z 90 φ z another criterion we are discussing in this paper is α h the gangway horizontal angle α h is comprised of two components 21 α h β h γ h where β h and γ h are the gangway horizontal angle due to relative motion as well as the gangway horizontal angle due to gangway column rotation β h is delivered by using formula below 22 β h arctan l 0 sin α h 0 δ x g w l 0 cos α h 0 α h 0 where and α h 0 is the angle equilibrium position as shown in fig 2 as for γ h its calculation is similar with previously mentioned parameter γ z 23 γ h h l 0 a 4 f l o t e l cos θ f g w a 5 f l o t e l sin θ f g w where h is height from gangway end of flotel to its centre of gravity actually as we can realize all gangway responses we derived above are essentially determined by relative motions between two vessels the interesting issue is which relative motion is governing factor 4 model test after all the numerical simulations had been finished except updating results by using measured roll damping a model test was carried out in marintek s ocean basin facility as shown in fig 4 the basin is 80 m long and 50 m wide and two sets of wave makers are installed in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively the model scale is 1 50 and water depth in wave basin is 5 m the flotel model is 3 374 m long lpp the length between perpendiculars 0 486 m breath and 0 128 m for its draught the fpso to be used in this experiment is a typical suezmax size vessel which is 6 1 m lpp length 1 108 m breath and 0 182 m for the draught in model scale the dynamic positioning system was deployed on flotel for station keeping purpose i e the resistance of drift horizontal motion and yaw motion the dp system was performed by expertise from kongsberg maritime as mentioned previously dp is employed to maintain the relative position and especially the yaw angle with fpso table 2 lists the statistics of yaw angle for both vessels in a typical irregular wave test the mean angle between vessels is well kept as expected the variation of flotel is obviously larger than that of moored fpso nevertheless which is still acceptable by considering such a complex operation in laboratory as for fpso a simplified equivalent turret comprised of 4 mooring lines was manufactured and installed because the water depth of the full scale system is larger than the water depth used in the experiment the anchor lines have been truncated the comparison of restoring forces along 0 and 90 between full and truncated models are illustrated in fig 5 a slight difference of the mean level exists due to asymmetry in the full system however the slopes which represent the stiffness show very good agreement and therefore the accuracy of dynamic motion are guaranteed conductance type wave probes were used to measure the wave elevations all specified wave conditions were calibrated prior to the testing without the model in the basin the motions in 6 dofs of the models were measured by the oqus system which is an optical electronic tracking system using four light emitting diodes on the model and onshore cameras as for comparison purpose three phases of experiments are proposed i e two phases of single body including flotel alone and fpso alone as well as the multi body phase of flotel and fpso side by side most of the wave conditions in the model test are irregular waves of pink noise spectrum in order to obtain rao response amplitude operator conveniently fig 6 shows the spectrum of wave elevations for the typical pink noise test under significant wave height of 2 5 m in single body tests the selected wave headings are 90 beam sea and 135 oblique wave relative to vessel because which are most severe wave conditions in terms of relative motions of vessels and gangway motions in multi body tests the flotel is 15 apart from fpso and the average distance between gangway tower point on flotel and landing point on fpso is 36 5 m therefore 75 and 90 are chosen as wave headings because which are exact beam sea conditions in terms of flotel and fpso respectively waves propagated from flotel side so that this smaller unit is exposed to weather and the relative motions are consequently large before the formal wave test some calibration and measurement in calm water were carried out and the most important is capturing roll damping coefficients according to free decay test as shown in fig 7 the linear and quadratic damping coefficients were determined by fitting of a straight line with intercept and slope according to peaks and troughs of decay curve faltinsen 1993 which are summarized in table 3 although the free decay curve seems good a small error may exist during fitting because scattered data are inevitable near the tail moreover the roll natural period can be obtained as well and compared with the simulated result as shown in table 4 the difference may arise from fabrication error of scaled model 5 results and discussion in this section various results e g vessel global motions and gangway response are presented and interpreted all experiment related results have been converted to full scale by using froude law first of all vessel global motions in the single body scenario are given in section 5 1 and only the most relevant motions in vertical plane i e heave pitch and heave are presented then global motions of vessels in the multi body scenario are discussed in section 5 2 and sway motions are added because which could contribute to gangway response such as its extension meanwhile the most important relative motions between vessels are investigated finally the gangway responses are computed by using the previous formula in section 3 2 note all global motions are with respect to centre of gravity of each vessel while relative motions are determined by motions at gangway top base plate of flotel as well as motions at landing point of fpso 5 1 single body case figs 8 and 9 illustrate the comparison of flotels global motions between simulation and measurements basically excellent agreements are reached for heave and pitch motions in 135 theoretically the pitch under beam sea 90 is nearly zero in most frequencies and which actually was failed to be collected due to sensor accuracy in laboratory as shown in fig 8 b as for roll the peak values at resonant period match well for both headings and 90 in particular it indicates the damping coefficients extracted from free decay test are reasonable as shown in table 3 nevertheless a small shift of resonant period is observed because of the slight discrepancy on the natural period between numerical and physical models fpso global motions are demonstrated in figs 10 and 11 similarly the simulated heave and pitch motions are good compared to measurement the measured roll natural period is a bit longer than simulation due to the error of the physical model in addition the resonant peak response doesn t match well which implies the damping coefficients are overestimated for fpso basically all motion raos vary smoothly with wave frequency for both vessels in single body cases 5 2 multi body case fig 12 shows flotel s motions in 90 global heading while 105 in local coordinate system extra computed raos of 105 local heading in the single body case is complemented for comparison purpose fig 13 demonstrates fpso motions together with corresponding results of single body case only sway heave and roll motions are shown because rest dofs are relatively less important under this wave heading results show clearly that flotel motions are completely different from those in the single body case during a typical wave period range e g 5 12 s and strong hydrodynamic interactions occur taking heave motion around 8 1 s for instance the rao value is over 1 5 which is nearly twice of itself in single body case however the ratio could also drop as low as one quarter when period increases to 9 7 s on the contrary fpso motions remain the smooth varying with frequency and no obvious alterations exist comparing to those in the single body case within the entire frequency range it implies the hydrodynamic interactions are not strong enough to affect fpso mainly because of its 7 6 times displaced volume of flotel thus the focus is put on flotel s motions rather than fpsos nevertheless the analysis is not straightforward and interim results need to be introduced to acquire correct interpretation basically a number of additional peaks and troughs are found for all wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients between 5 12 s wave periods according to simulation in terms of the motions such as sway although the corresponding dof sway itself still plays as the main contributor other dofs of flotel e g heave and pitch also couple with sway although this phenomenon doesnt exist in the single body case it should attribute to nearby fpso which breaks the geometrical symmetry of x z plane of flotel and consequently generates extra pressure on transverse y direction when considering a forced heave or pitch motion of flotel fig 14 demonstrates wave sway excitation force f y and hydrodynamic coefficients of sway due to heave moreover the contribution from fpso is comparable to the corresponding dof of flotel or even larger in a specific period when wave period is around 9 7 s as for sway motion again the amplitude of sway dof itself is 0 68 only while contributions of heave dofs of flotel and fpso are 0 24 and 0 43 respectively these heave dofs are nearly both in phase with sway dof of flotel therefore the total sway motion is doubled and reaches 1 2 m s contrarily the amplitude of heave dof is 0 89 initially however the heave motion of flotel eventually reduces to 0 22 m s mainly due to fpsos heave dof with an amplitude of 0 61 and 180 phase difference from flotels heave dof the roll motion encounters a trough around this wave period too because of the same reason with heave when wave period goes to 10 9 s heave and sway motions of flotel are still affected by heave dof of fpso however the in phase and out of phase effects are inverse compared to these in a period of 9 7 s in addition to flotels heave motion the contribution of fpsos roll increases to 0 41 of amplitude due to its violent resonance in this wave period and contributes even more than heave dof itself which is 0 32 figs 15 and 16 show motions of flotel and fpso in 75 global heading and corresponding results in single body cases are drawn together regarding fpso the same with the previous discussion no major difference can be observed as for flotel under 90 heading in local coordinate system in this case the interaction still exists in short periods while it looks not as strong as that in the previous wave heading the reason is the number of spikes of wave excitation force reduces based on the simulation in particular pitch motion is presented in fig 15 c because it shows completely different characteristics from that in the single body case which was supposed to be nearly zero under beam sea basically we notice the wave pitch moments in multi body and single body cases are totally not in the same magnitude as compared in fig 17 moreover computation indicates fpsos pitch and heave dofs can affect massively as well since they are able to amplify or depress flotel s pitch depending on synchronization of their phases or not 5 3 relative motion in this section we discuss relative motions between gangway point of flotel and landing point of fpso and analyze contributions of various components figs 18 and 19 present δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w under 90 and 75 heading in gangway coordinate system as given in eq 15 simulation and measurement are in expectedly good agreement although rao curves seem a bit irregular in 90 heading δ x g w is mainly controlled by flotel because x motion of fpso end defined in eq 13 is negligible in this beam sea case however θ f is 15 both x and y motions of flotel gangway point in local coordinate system are able to contribute to x according to eq 14 it is noted that both gangway ends of two vessels locate near stern longitudinally and portside or starboard transversely where is far from the centre of gravity centre of rotation consequently rotation such as roll pitch or even yaw plays a significant role in respective dominant periods when period is below 7 s x is governed while y impacts after 7 s because roll and yaw increase and a few spikes occur as for δ y g w flotels y motion is the main component as shown in fig 18 b the peak between 8 10 s is because sway reaches its peak while the peak around 14 15 s is due to the roll resonance in terms of δ z g w the first two spikes around 5 and 7 s are contributed from z of flotel however the largest peak appears around 10 11 s is due to fpsos roll resonant response in 75 heading general trends of δ y g w and δ z g w are similar with those in the previous heading which has been detailed analyzed δ x g w is in this case mostly taken controlled by flotel s y motion because x motion is minimized in this beam sea the largest peak occurs around 14 s due to rolls resonant motion of the flotel which reaches its maximum value in this beam sea case 5 4 gangway responses the gangway extension is shown in fig 20 its easy to observe the contribution is totally governed by δ y g w because their raos are almost the same actually the first two items of eq 16 which represent contributions of δ z g w and δ x g w trends to be zero because the δ z g w and δ x g w are relatively small compared to gangway initial length l 0 in this study as for angle of gangway and gangway top base plate as well as gangway horizontal angle only simulations are presented since experiment is not able to capture fig 21 shows α z and its two components i e β z and γ z eqs 17 and 19 curves clearly indicate that the general trend of α z follows β z and thus the shape of α z is similar to δ z g w eq 18 only minor disturbance occurs on α z when γ z reach a spike in particular period γ z doesn t attract attention because the important roll motion of flotel in our case multiplies a small sin θ f g w which equals to 15 according to eq 19 however less important pitch multiplies a large cos θ f g w fig 22 illustrates gangway horizontal angle α h and two sources i e β h and γ h when wave period is less than 10 s the contribution of β h to α h is comparable to γ h and even larger in the case of 90 heading because δ x g w eq 22 illustrated in fig 18 trends to be more aggressive than flotel s roll shown in fig 12 the main contributor of γ h eq 22 however as period increases γ h is absolutely dominant because of roll resonance 6 conclusion the numerical approach and model for gangway response between nonparallel side by side flotel and fpso are established the objective is to predict and better understand the physics of various gangway responses such as its extension and rotation in order to validate model tests were conducted in wave basin and vessel s non linear roll damping was acquired through the free decay test vessel s motion and relative motion were recorded and linear transfer function rao was obtained after performing beam and near beam sea tests under irregular waves by comparing single body to multi body cases flotel s wave force and hydrodynamic coefficient become obvious fluctuating during short period range around 5 12s where strong hydrodynamic interaction happens in the multi body case spikes are observed in flotel s motion while fpso s doesn t change compared to the single body case due to the presence of fpso the geometrical symmetry of flotel is no longer valid an example is flotel s sway motion is coupled and affected by heave and pitch and vice versa flotel s sway and heave motions are influenced by other coupled dofs as well as fpso motion especially the heave and roll in particular period the contribution of other dofs could be larger than dof itself motion is also able to be amplified if other dofs contribution is synchronized with dof itself when flotel encounters beam sea in multi body case notable pitch motion is induced however which is considered neglectable in single body case the relative motion between these gangway point of flotel and landing point of fpso possesses several peak periods where different dofs may take control nevertheless it also implies dynamic motion can be excited by waves in wide period range and which increases the difficulty in operation though gangway extension is jointly contributed by δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w the governing term is δ y g w the vertical angle α z is dominated by β z and consequently controlled by δ z g w the contribution of γ z is limited because sin θ f g w is relatively a small value even roll motion can be significant in particular period as for horizontal angle α h two components β h and γ h contribute fairly when the period is less than 10 s as the increase of wave period γ h takes lead because of roll resonance in general numerical simulation and measurement reach pretty good agreement the established physical model properly represent physics of gangway response notably most extra peaks or troughs of various response due to hydrodynamic interaction are well captured 
23672,as an important equipment gangway and its safety are crucial during offshore operation and its dynamic response raises concerns especially when gangway is deployed between two free floating structures in this paper the response of a passive telescopic gangway between monohull flotel and fpso in nonparallel side by side configuration is investigated numerically and experimentally the numerical model is established within the frequency domain where the hydrodynamics are solved by 3d potential flow theory the nonlinear factor roll damping is treated by using stochastic linearization the connection between gangway and vessel is assumed to be an ideal joint subsequently gangway responses are derived by properly taking into account various motions of flotel and fpso gangway responses such as its extension and rotation are presented in simulation as well as measurement to interpret physics firstly vessel global motions in single body and multi body cases are compared then relative motions between gangway points at flotel and fpso ends are illustrated notably the impact of multi body hydrodynamic interaction is analyzed the interaction triggers two types of couplings i e coupling between two vessels as well as coupling within one vessel such as coupled sway and pitch which does not exist in the single body case therefore the contribution of respective degree of freedom dof of flotel and fpso to gangway response are detailedly discussed the simulation has generally good agreement with the model test most extra peaks or troughs observed in results those reflect hydrodynamic and mechanical couplings are well captured keywords multi body hydrodynamics gangway side by side flotel accommodation vessel roll damping stochastic linearization 1 introduction during the past decade a number of accommodation vessels i e flotel of monohull type were built thanks to the huge demand from offshore oil and gas industry the flotel is able to offer quality accommodation for over several hundred people and provide onsite construction commissioning or maintenance services for offshore engineering activities the flotel market may keep expanding in the future because of new recent needs such as offshore wind farm as well as its installation and maintenance compared to traditional accommodation unit i e semi submersible monohull units are cheaper to build maintain and relocate in short time because of the own propulsion system moreover some newly built monohull flotel are equipped with dynamic positioning dp system which makes it a more attractive solution pérez et al 2014 nevertheless uncertainties exist for monohull flotel when it services another ship shaped floating unit in side by side configuration on one hand project owner pursues the operability and push to maximize the uptime on the other hand the multi body scenario gives rise to more complicated circumstance than access to the fixed platform one main concern is the failure of accessibility of telescopic gangway which is limited by rigorous criteria such as gangway extension gangway rotation etc actually due to lack of investigation the gangway operation between flotel and other ship shaped vessel is rarely implemented in reality so far therefore our study is urgent and we aim at predicting and understanding the physics of gangway response hopefully the outcome is useful to design and optimization in practical operation all time independent environment loads like wind current and second order mean drift wave load are handled by dp system and so are those low frequency time dependent loads such as second order wave slow drift force as a result the dynamic gangway response is contributed by wave frequency excitation only basically this paper involves two main issues i e multi body hydrodynamic problem and various motions including the relative motion of vessels as well as gangway response in terms of hydrodynamics our problem is similar with one of recent popular research topics i e side by side offloading between flng lng carrier kim et al 2003 chen 2005 hong et al 2005 koo and kim 2005 fournier et al 2006 pauw et al 2007 pessoa et al 2015 these researchers made an effort to investigate novel improvements in potential flow theory nonlinear load or dissipation of gap resonance on the free surface however the gap resonance due to lack of viscosity in potential flow theory in the present case doesn t exist because the gap width is typically over 30 m depending on gangway length while it is about 4 m for flng offloading this paper will be focusing on numerical modeling of two side by side ship shape vessels in unique nonparallel configuration as well as analysis of operability criteria e g gangway response in fact relevant research is rarely exposed though some similar subjects regarding multi body has been reported ócatháin et al 2008 sun et al 2012 feng and bai 2017 in 2005 morandini et al 2005 computed some basic gangway responses such as extension under tandem offloading configuration nevertheless the hydrodynamic interaction in the tandem case is much less than it is in the side by side case moreover the calculations didn t include criteria those complicated response e g angle between gangway and top base plate of gangway tower guanche et al 2016 carried out a numerical simulation of walkability between supply vessels and floating wind turbine of semi sub type by employing fender or gangway but they emphasized the weather window and gangway response was just analyzed qualitatively through vessel global motions in addition the vessel roll damping which should be of significant importance was treated roughly that a percentage of critical damping was specified in light of above we establish a numerical model for nonparallel side by side connection configuration between a 180 m long flotel and suezmax size fpso to investigate their relative motion and the passive gangway response all computations are conducted in the frequency domain because the linear wave frequency response is the only source while non linear load and motion are absent as mentioned above obvious advantages are that firstly the calculation is much more efficient and appropriate for weather window or operability study where numerous sea states need to be considered secondly linear superposition enables to analyze respective contributions of components which form the final result like gangway extension the multi body hydrodynamics are solved by potential flow based boundary element method incorporating the free surface green function which is briefly described in section 3 1 the coupling effect is solved in radiation calculation and taken into account in motion equation later on attention should be paid on roll damping which may cause unreasonable response around natural period and consequently affect the accuracy of other results due to the nonlinear character of roll damping we adopt the stochastic linearization method based on the minimum mean square deviation of linearization error regarding the mechanical link between gangway and vessel an ideal articulation is assumed on both ends so that the gangway is able to freely rotate while the three displacements are totally restrained the numerical model of gangway response is derived in section 3 2 a comprehensive experiment had been conducted in marintek trondheim norway where we carried out a series tests for 1 50 scaled physical models the relevant descriptions are summarized in section 4 for comparison purpose we measured both results in single body and multi body scenarios respectively results are interpreted in section 5 in different steps firstly the global motion of both vessels in the single body case is presented in section 5 1 and which is followed by global motions again in section 5 2 while in multi body case then in section 5 3 the three relative motions between two gangway ends on each vessel are illustrated finally the gangway response is demonstrated in section 5 4 the comparison indicates that good agreement of measurement and simulation has been achieved in general results also reveal that physics of vessel vessel interaction and gangway response have been correctly understood and appropriately taken into account in the numerical model some conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 engineering background in our study the flotel is 180 m long in overall and 24 3 m width as shown in fig 1 the unit provides floating accommodation facilities to comfortably house a complement of 450 persons including its own crew and catering staff working platform and logistics support the unit is a diesel electric dp2 vessel uniquely designed and equipped to provide extensive accommodation and workshop facilities to support and service offshore projects in deep water areas the telescopic gangway located at portside of ship stern has an average length of 38 5 m 8 00 m telescopic the gangway doesn t include any motion compensation facility the proposed landing point is on the starboard of fpso where is close to stern as well according to operator s experience rather than the parallel side by side an angle between flotel and fpso is preferred because it s able to gain faster reaction in terms of thruster propulsion the station keeping of fpso is provided by internal turret mooring system due to weathervane the yaw angle may still vary in a small range even after fpso achieves its mean yaw angle under a specific sea state therefore the assumption is that the dp system is capable of reacting and maintaining the original configuration i e angle between and the distance between vessels then the frequency domain method which is geometrically based on mean position is valid the characteristics of both flotel and fpso are summarized in table 1 the water depth of target operation site is 784 m 3 theoretical background 3 1 multi body hydrodynamics we consider a floating body without forward speed on the surface of perfect fluid in the presence of an incident propagative wave the fluid motion is assumed to be harmonic in time with the circular frequency ω in such a way that we can write the velocity potential 1 φ p t ℜ ϕ p e i ω t in which ℜ stands for taking the real part the boundary value problem for the velocity potential ϕ is expressed as 2 2 ϕ 0 in the fluid domain 3 ω 2 ϕ g ϕ z 0 at z 0 4 ϕ z 0 at z h 5 lim r r ϕ r i k 0 ϕ 0 in the far field where h denotes the water depth the time harmonic potential is further expressed as the sum of various components 6 ϕ n i ω m 1 m j 1 6 a j m ϕ j n m a 0 ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 n m the superscript j denotes the j th degree of freedom dof of the body the superscript n denotes the n th body the superscript m denotes the m th body m denotes the number of bodies thus ϕ j n m is the radiation potential corresponding to j th dof oscillations of the m th body and a j m are amplitude of corresponding motions j th dof of body m a 0 and ϕ 0 are the amplitude and potential of incoming wave ϕ j n m is the potential on the n th body due to diffracted waves by m th body 7 ϕ 0 g ω cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x cos β y sin β where β k 0 and h are the wave heading wave number and water depth the radiation potentials ϕ j n m satisfies the boundary condition on bodies hull 8 ϕ j n m p n n j n p h n 0 e l s e w h e r e the diffraction potential ϕ 7 satisfied the boundary condition on bodies hull 9 ϕ 7 n m n ϕ 0 n n m 0 e l s e w h e r e besides the boundary conditions on the body hull as described in eq 8 and eq 9 the radiation and diffraction potentials satisfy the laplace equation in the fluid domain and the boundary conditions on the free surface on the sea bed and a radiation condition at infinity these boundary value problems are solved by the boundary element method bem implemented in software hydrostar chen 2004 in which the boundary integral equation incorporating the green function is established on the body surface only once the radiation and diffraction potentials are obtained by bem the added mass matrices a k j n m and radiation damping matrices b k j n m and the first order wave loads f k n are given by 10 ω 2 a k j n m i ω b k j n m ω 2 ρ h n d s ϕ j m n k a n d f k n i ω ρ a 0 h n d s ϕ 0 m 1 m ϕ 7 n m n k with h n the hull of the n th body finally the motion equations for multiple bodies m being the number of bodies are given by 11 m 1 m j 1 6 ω 2 δ n m m k j n m a k j n m i ω b k j n m b e q m δ n m c k j n m a j m f k n for n 1 2 m and k 1 2 6 in eq 11 δ n m is the kroneker symbol while m k j n m and c k j n m are the inertia and hydrostatic matrices of the m th body note b e q m is equivalent linear damping for roll of each vessel which is expressed in calculation as follows based on stochastic linearization 12 b e q m b l i n m 8 3 π ω a 4 m b q u a d m where b l i n m and b q u a d m are additional roll linear and quadratic damping coefficients they are captured from free decay test a 4 m is amplitude of roll angle since a 4 m is unknown an iterated calculation is implemented between eq 11 and 12 and which stops till a 4 m converges and an initial a 4 m needs to be given to launch the iteration it converges quickly within several iterations saying less than 10 this method better reflects the nonlinear physics of ship roll damping than a given constant linear damping the equivalent damping changes in different wave heights 3 2 gangway response there are as many as more than ten different criteria related to gangway response to be checked in a real project in this paper we just investigate most typical and complicated ones basically there are three coordinate systems in our methodology to represent fpso flotel and gangway respectively as shown in fig 2 as for vessel coordinate system x y and z axes are positive towards to bow portside and upward all rotations are defined according to right hand screw rule the environmental directions are defined based on fpso coordinate system 0 and 90 denote that waves propagate from stern and starboard of fpso and so on 3 2 1 gangway extension firstly we need to define relative motions because two vessels are in different coordinate system it s either fine to compute based on flotel or fpso coordinate system so we chose fpso in this case then three translation displacements of any point of the vessel in the local coordinate system can be expressed in below according to rigid body dynamics 13 x y z a 1 a 2 a 3 0 z g w y g w z g w 0 x g w y g w x g w 0 a 4 a 5 a 6 where a i i 1 6 denote surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw motions x g w y g w z g w are location of interested point i e gangway point in our case to transfer flotel s displacement to fpso coordinate the following conversion is required 14 x y z cos θ f sin θ f 0 sin θ f cos θ f 0 0 0 1 x y z finally relative motions written as δ x δ y and δ z in fpso coordinate can be easily obtained by subtraction of respective displacement as eq 13 and eq 14 relative motions in fpso coordinate are further converted to gangway coordinate system 15 δ x g w δ y g w δ z g w cos θ g w sin θ g w 0 sin θ g w cos θ g w 0 0 0 1 δ x δ y δ z gangway extension is directly relevant to motions at two ends of gangway on each vessel it s able to be obtained by the formula below 16 d e x t l 0 1 1 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 l 0 1 1 cos arctan δ x g w l 0 δ y g w cos arctan δ x g w l 0 cos arctan δ z g w l 0 where l 0 is gangway original length the three terms of above formula are contributions of δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w respectively 3 2 2 gangway rotation one criterion α z i e angle between gangway and gangway top base plate is computed as illustrated in fig 3 to compute α z we consider the angle between gangway and gangway tower φ z as follows according to geometry 17 φ z 90 β z γ z where β z and γ z are angle between gangway and horizontal plane as well as angle between gangway tower and vertical plane β z is straightforward which is determined by vertical relative motion of both gangway ends zero degree of gangway and horizontal plane in static equilibrium position 18 β z δ z g w l 0 γ z is generated by flotel s roll and pitch motion i e a 4 f l o t e l and a 5 f l o t e l however these rotations need to be converted to gangway coordinate system by following equation 19 γ z a 4 f l o t e l sin θ f g w a 5 f l o t e l cos θ f g w then α z is able to be obtained by 20 α z 90 φ z another criterion we are discussing in this paper is α h the gangway horizontal angle α h is comprised of two components 21 α h β h γ h where β h and γ h are the gangway horizontal angle due to relative motion as well as the gangway horizontal angle due to gangway column rotation β h is delivered by using formula below 22 β h arctan l 0 sin α h 0 δ x g w l 0 cos α h 0 α h 0 where and α h 0 is the angle equilibrium position as shown in fig 2 as for γ h its calculation is similar with previously mentioned parameter γ z 23 γ h h l 0 a 4 f l o t e l cos θ f g w a 5 f l o t e l sin θ f g w where h is height from gangway end of flotel to its centre of gravity actually as we can realize all gangway responses we derived above are essentially determined by relative motions between two vessels the interesting issue is which relative motion is governing factor 4 model test after all the numerical simulations had been finished except updating results by using measured roll damping a model test was carried out in marintek s ocean basin facility as shown in fig 4 the basin is 80 m long and 50 m wide and two sets of wave makers are installed in longitudinal and transverse directions respectively the model scale is 1 50 and water depth in wave basin is 5 m the flotel model is 3 374 m long lpp the length between perpendiculars 0 486 m breath and 0 128 m for its draught the fpso to be used in this experiment is a typical suezmax size vessel which is 6 1 m lpp length 1 108 m breath and 0 182 m for the draught in model scale the dynamic positioning system was deployed on flotel for station keeping purpose i e the resistance of drift horizontal motion and yaw motion the dp system was performed by expertise from kongsberg maritime as mentioned previously dp is employed to maintain the relative position and especially the yaw angle with fpso table 2 lists the statistics of yaw angle for both vessels in a typical irregular wave test the mean angle between vessels is well kept as expected the variation of flotel is obviously larger than that of moored fpso nevertheless which is still acceptable by considering such a complex operation in laboratory as for fpso a simplified equivalent turret comprised of 4 mooring lines was manufactured and installed because the water depth of the full scale system is larger than the water depth used in the experiment the anchor lines have been truncated the comparison of restoring forces along 0 and 90 between full and truncated models are illustrated in fig 5 a slight difference of the mean level exists due to asymmetry in the full system however the slopes which represent the stiffness show very good agreement and therefore the accuracy of dynamic motion are guaranteed conductance type wave probes were used to measure the wave elevations all specified wave conditions were calibrated prior to the testing without the model in the basin the motions in 6 dofs of the models were measured by the oqus system which is an optical electronic tracking system using four light emitting diodes on the model and onshore cameras as for comparison purpose three phases of experiments are proposed i e two phases of single body including flotel alone and fpso alone as well as the multi body phase of flotel and fpso side by side most of the wave conditions in the model test are irregular waves of pink noise spectrum in order to obtain rao response amplitude operator conveniently fig 6 shows the spectrum of wave elevations for the typical pink noise test under significant wave height of 2 5 m in single body tests the selected wave headings are 90 beam sea and 135 oblique wave relative to vessel because which are most severe wave conditions in terms of relative motions of vessels and gangway motions in multi body tests the flotel is 15 apart from fpso and the average distance between gangway tower point on flotel and landing point on fpso is 36 5 m therefore 75 and 90 are chosen as wave headings because which are exact beam sea conditions in terms of flotel and fpso respectively waves propagated from flotel side so that this smaller unit is exposed to weather and the relative motions are consequently large before the formal wave test some calibration and measurement in calm water were carried out and the most important is capturing roll damping coefficients according to free decay test as shown in fig 7 the linear and quadratic damping coefficients were determined by fitting of a straight line with intercept and slope according to peaks and troughs of decay curve faltinsen 1993 which are summarized in table 3 although the free decay curve seems good a small error may exist during fitting because scattered data are inevitable near the tail moreover the roll natural period can be obtained as well and compared with the simulated result as shown in table 4 the difference may arise from fabrication error of scaled model 5 results and discussion in this section various results e g vessel global motions and gangway response are presented and interpreted all experiment related results have been converted to full scale by using froude law first of all vessel global motions in the single body scenario are given in section 5 1 and only the most relevant motions in vertical plane i e heave pitch and heave are presented then global motions of vessels in the multi body scenario are discussed in section 5 2 and sway motions are added because which could contribute to gangway response such as its extension meanwhile the most important relative motions between vessels are investigated finally the gangway responses are computed by using the previous formula in section 3 2 note all global motions are with respect to centre of gravity of each vessel while relative motions are determined by motions at gangway top base plate of flotel as well as motions at landing point of fpso 5 1 single body case figs 8 and 9 illustrate the comparison of flotels global motions between simulation and measurements basically excellent agreements are reached for heave and pitch motions in 135 theoretically the pitch under beam sea 90 is nearly zero in most frequencies and which actually was failed to be collected due to sensor accuracy in laboratory as shown in fig 8 b as for roll the peak values at resonant period match well for both headings and 90 in particular it indicates the damping coefficients extracted from free decay test are reasonable as shown in table 3 nevertheless a small shift of resonant period is observed because of the slight discrepancy on the natural period between numerical and physical models fpso global motions are demonstrated in figs 10 and 11 similarly the simulated heave and pitch motions are good compared to measurement the measured roll natural period is a bit longer than simulation due to the error of the physical model in addition the resonant peak response doesn t match well which implies the damping coefficients are overestimated for fpso basically all motion raos vary smoothly with wave frequency for both vessels in single body cases 5 2 multi body case fig 12 shows flotel s motions in 90 global heading while 105 in local coordinate system extra computed raos of 105 local heading in the single body case is complemented for comparison purpose fig 13 demonstrates fpso motions together with corresponding results of single body case only sway heave and roll motions are shown because rest dofs are relatively less important under this wave heading results show clearly that flotel motions are completely different from those in the single body case during a typical wave period range e g 5 12 s and strong hydrodynamic interactions occur taking heave motion around 8 1 s for instance the rao value is over 1 5 which is nearly twice of itself in single body case however the ratio could also drop as low as one quarter when period increases to 9 7 s on the contrary fpso motions remain the smooth varying with frequency and no obvious alterations exist comparing to those in the single body case within the entire frequency range it implies the hydrodynamic interactions are not strong enough to affect fpso mainly because of its 7 6 times displaced volume of flotel thus the focus is put on flotel s motions rather than fpsos nevertheless the analysis is not straightforward and interim results need to be introduced to acquire correct interpretation basically a number of additional peaks and troughs are found for all wave forces and hydrodynamic coefficients between 5 12 s wave periods according to simulation in terms of the motions such as sway although the corresponding dof sway itself still plays as the main contributor other dofs of flotel e g heave and pitch also couple with sway although this phenomenon doesnt exist in the single body case it should attribute to nearby fpso which breaks the geometrical symmetry of x z plane of flotel and consequently generates extra pressure on transverse y direction when considering a forced heave or pitch motion of flotel fig 14 demonstrates wave sway excitation force f y and hydrodynamic coefficients of sway due to heave moreover the contribution from fpso is comparable to the corresponding dof of flotel or even larger in a specific period when wave period is around 9 7 s as for sway motion again the amplitude of sway dof itself is 0 68 only while contributions of heave dofs of flotel and fpso are 0 24 and 0 43 respectively these heave dofs are nearly both in phase with sway dof of flotel therefore the total sway motion is doubled and reaches 1 2 m s contrarily the amplitude of heave dof is 0 89 initially however the heave motion of flotel eventually reduces to 0 22 m s mainly due to fpsos heave dof with an amplitude of 0 61 and 180 phase difference from flotels heave dof the roll motion encounters a trough around this wave period too because of the same reason with heave when wave period goes to 10 9 s heave and sway motions of flotel are still affected by heave dof of fpso however the in phase and out of phase effects are inverse compared to these in a period of 9 7 s in addition to flotels heave motion the contribution of fpsos roll increases to 0 41 of amplitude due to its violent resonance in this wave period and contributes even more than heave dof itself which is 0 32 figs 15 and 16 show motions of flotel and fpso in 75 global heading and corresponding results in single body cases are drawn together regarding fpso the same with the previous discussion no major difference can be observed as for flotel under 90 heading in local coordinate system in this case the interaction still exists in short periods while it looks not as strong as that in the previous wave heading the reason is the number of spikes of wave excitation force reduces based on the simulation in particular pitch motion is presented in fig 15 c because it shows completely different characteristics from that in the single body case which was supposed to be nearly zero under beam sea basically we notice the wave pitch moments in multi body and single body cases are totally not in the same magnitude as compared in fig 17 moreover computation indicates fpsos pitch and heave dofs can affect massively as well since they are able to amplify or depress flotel s pitch depending on synchronization of their phases or not 5 3 relative motion in this section we discuss relative motions between gangway point of flotel and landing point of fpso and analyze contributions of various components figs 18 and 19 present δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w under 90 and 75 heading in gangway coordinate system as given in eq 15 simulation and measurement are in expectedly good agreement although rao curves seem a bit irregular in 90 heading δ x g w is mainly controlled by flotel because x motion of fpso end defined in eq 13 is negligible in this beam sea case however θ f is 15 both x and y motions of flotel gangway point in local coordinate system are able to contribute to x according to eq 14 it is noted that both gangway ends of two vessels locate near stern longitudinally and portside or starboard transversely where is far from the centre of gravity centre of rotation consequently rotation such as roll pitch or even yaw plays a significant role in respective dominant periods when period is below 7 s x is governed while y impacts after 7 s because roll and yaw increase and a few spikes occur as for δ y g w flotels y motion is the main component as shown in fig 18 b the peak between 8 10 s is because sway reaches its peak while the peak around 14 15 s is due to the roll resonance in terms of δ z g w the first two spikes around 5 and 7 s are contributed from z of flotel however the largest peak appears around 10 11 s is due to fpsos roll resonant response in 75 heading general trends of δ y g w and δ z g w are similar with those in the previous heading which has been detailed analyzed δ x g w is in this case mostly taken controlled by flotel s y motion because x motion is minimized in this beam sea the largest peak occurs around 14 s due to rolls resonant motion of the flotel which reaches its maximum value in this beam sea case 5 4 gangway responses the gangway extension is shown in fig 20 its easy to observe the contribution is totally governed by δ y g w because their raos are almost the same actually the first two items of eq 16 which represent contributions of δ z g w and δ x g w trends to be zero because the δ z g w and δ x g w are relatively small compared to gangway initial length l 0 in this study as for angle of gangway and gangway top base plate as well as gangway horizontal angle only simulations are presented since experiment is not able to capture fig 21 shows α z and its two components i e β z and γ z eqs 17 and 19 curves clearly indicate that the general trend of α z follows β z and thus the shape of α z is similar to δ z g w eq 18 only minor disturbance occurs on α z when γ z reach a spike in particular period γ z doesn t attract attention because the important roll motion of flotel in our case multiplies a small sin θ f g w which equals to 15 according to eq 19 however less important pitch multiplies a large cos θ f g w fig 22 illustrates gangway horizontal angle α h and two sources i e β h and γ h when wave period is less than 10 s the contribution of β h to α h is comparable to γ h and even larger in the case of 90 heading because δ x g w eq 22 illustrated in fig 18 trends to be more aggressive than flotel s roll shown in fig 12 the main contributor of γ h eq 22 however as period increases γ h is absolutely dominant because of roll resonance 6 conclusion the numerical approach and model for gangway response between nonparallel side by side flotel and fpso are established the objective is to predict and better understand the physics of various gangway responses such as its extension and rotation in order to validate model tests were conducted in wave basin and vessel s non linear roll damping was acquired through the free decay test vessel s motion and relative motion were recorded and linear transfer function rao was obtained after performing beam and near beam sea tests under irregular waves by comparing single body to multi body cases flotel s wave force and hydrodynamic coefficient become obvious fluctuating during short period range around 5 12s where strong hydrodynamic interaction happens in the multi body case spikes are observed in flotel s motion while fpso s doesn t change compared to the single body case due to the presence of fpso the geometrical symmetry of flotel is no longer valid an example is flotel s sway motion is coupled and affected by heave and pitch and vice versa flotel s sway and heave motions are influenced by other coupled dofs as well as fpso motion especially the heave and roll in particular period the contribution of other dofs could be larger than dof itself motion is also able to be amplified if other dofs contribution is synchronized with dof itself when flotel encounters beam sea in multi body case notable pitch motion is induced however which is considered neglectable in single body case the relative motion between these gangway point of flotel and landing point of fpso possesses several peak periods where different dofs may take control nevertheless it also implies dynamic motion can be excited by waves in wide period range and which increases the difficulty in operation though gangway extension is jointly contributed by δ x g w δ y g w and δ z g w the governing term is δ y g w the vertical angle α z is dominated by β z and consequently controlled by δ z g w the contribution of γ z is limited because sin θ f g w is relatively a small value even roll motion can be significant in particular period as for horizontal angle α h two components β h and γ h contribute fairly when the period is less than 10 s as the increase of wave period γ h takes lead because of roll resonance in general numerical simulation and measurement reach pretty good agreement the established physical model properly represent physics of gangway response notably most extra peaks or troughs of various response due to hydrodynamic interaction are well captured 
23673,this work presents nonlinear multivariable control strategies based on backstepping methodology and control lyapunov function clf for trajectory tracking problem of a hybrid remotely operated vehicle hrov which is under development at the federal university of abc ufabc since 2012 the main objective of the vehicle is to inspect underwater structures by measuring plates thickness the design control for underactuated hrov presents some limitations in the vehicle trajectory the control consists on the combination of two methodologies which are the backstepping and the clf it also makes robustness study of controllers consider disturbance acting on the vehicle the proposed control responded appropriately to the trajectories selected as reference and presents robustness for non modeled external disturbances keywords underactuated control mimo nonlinear control backstepping control lyapunov function clf remotely operated vehicle rov 1 introduction there are applications of remotely operated vehicles rov s in a variety of areas such as biology for marine habitat monitoring archeology for flooded site investigation and engineering for submerged structures inspection and underwater mining the vehicle was named hrov hybrid remotely operated vehicle and the term hybrid installed due to its locomotion feature which can use thrusters for a navigation on the water or a pair of motorized tracks for movement over the structure the brazilian navy regulates that the release for operation of vessels has to be in national waters this must be made through a complete dry deck inspection in addition to a technical assessment of the thickness plates in the case of metallic vessels with more than fifteen years of operation dpc 2013 among the naval applications we can highlight a niche in the petroleum area that in addition to using large ships in transportation have floating production storing and offloading fpso structures for the production and storage in the offshore oil and oil products these structures are designed to work in the same lease for up to 25 years and the withdrawal of a vessel in operation influences financial loss whitcomb 2000 the inspection of the structure in place is necessary for this type of application in this scenario in the federal university of abc ufabc we developed a project with the objective of developing a hrov named proteo for inspection of underwater metallic structures in their normal operating environment performing plate thickness measurements by ultrasonic sensor the project considers a control station which is nearby the structure to be inspected or in a location that allows the remote activation of the hrov with the umbilical communication the vehicle is placed in the water and positioned by the operator using the thrusters at the initial point of inspection the hrov performs a rotation maneuver to keep the motorized tracks in contact with the structure and to do this is necessary that the vertical thrusters maintain a normal force to the inspection plane causing the motorized tracks to have sufficient friction to maneuver the vehicle by performing the thickness measurements for the trajectory tracking problem several control techniques are being used in order to control an actuated rov in srisamosorn et al 2013 was developed a robust adaptive control algorithm and used two lyapunov candidate function to demonstrate the stability and to determine adaptive laws the performance is verified with numerical simulation in encarnacao and pascoal 2000 it was proposed a methodology utilizing a nonlinear dynamic inversion and applying backstepping techniques in zhu and gu 2011a it was proposed a combining of two controllers an adaptive backstepping technique and a sliding control in patompak and nilkhamhang 2012 it was developed an adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller in fernandes et al 2015 it was proposed a motion control system which is an output feedback control composed of a mimo pid controller feedforward and high gain observer for the control of an underactuated rov in raygosa barahona et al 2011 it was applied a combining of two controllers a backstepping and a second order integral sliding modes controls in do 2010 it was proposed a control design based on several nonlinear coordinate changes the transverse function approach the backstepping technique the lyapunov direct method and utilization of the ship dynamics in khadhraoui et al 2014 it was developed the design control on the vertical plane with a backstepping methodology this article aims to give the next step of the project which is the development of a navigation control for this hrov which is underactuated i e the direction sway y is not actuated because of this it was necessary to combine two control techniques the idea is to divide the vehicle model into two parts the first part is considered fully actuated and is controlled with a backstepping control this part of movement is provided by the four thrusters positioned in the vertical the second part where the underactuated occurs the movement is provided by two thrusters positioned in the horizontal in order to control the sub actuated part it was used the ideas proposed in fierro and lewis 1995 zidani et al 2015 in which were developed a kinematic torque control law for a wheeled mobile robot utilizing backstepping the control lyapunov function was used due to the need for a bottleneck thus the underactuated model is very similar of a ship model liu et al 2016 jiang 2002 do 2010 the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proteo architecture section 3 shows the vehicle mathematical model section 4 presents the control design section 5 concerns the numerical simulation and section 6 conclusions 2 proteo hardware architecture the main function of the vehicle is the inspection of ship hulls by means of ultrasonic transducers to check the thickness of the plate and look for cracks it has two operating modes free flight and crawling in the first mode of operation the vehicle uses six thrusters 4 vertical and 2 horizontal for its displacement through the water and in the second mode uses two motorized mats for its locomotion on the surface of the hull of the ship and 4 vertical thrusters to apply a normal force in the hull avoiding the use of complex electromagnetic devices 2 1 mechanical designed the structure of hrov consists in a polypropylene plates and its divided in 5 parts two lateral and three horizontal plates the top horizontal plate of the structure contains the float and four thrusters with their vertically oriented axes the middle plate contains a pressure vessel for the control of the electronics and the lower part of the structure contains two thrusters with their axes oriented horizontally as motorized tracks in the initial design the float should be a block fig 1 but due to the weight of the motorized tracks tubes were used fig 2 an umbilical cable is used for an electrical signal and a signal transmission which can be seen in figs 2 and 1 it is noted that the general structure can be approximated being symmetrical in the longitudinal and transverse planes which will influence the simplifications that will be made in the mathematical modeling section 3 2 2 computer sensors and actuators tiger board is a high performance computer manufactured by versalogic corporation that supports other pc 104 and pc 104 plus expansion cards and features an intel atom z5xx processor tiger is compatible with windows windows embedded linux vxworks and qnx in this work we used the debian 6 0 0 operating system squeeze stable versa logic corporation the fig 3 shows schematically the architecture adopted for the project it has a surface computer from which the vehicle is remotely controlled and an embedded where the program that processes the data of the sensors receives the desired trajectory and locally controls the actuators to keep the vehicle in the trajectory sensors used in the hrov were chosen to provide information capable of giving orientation position speed and acceleration of the vehicle the altimeter model pa500 6 ps manufactured by tritech international limited provides underwater distance measurements in this design the sensor is used to measure the distance between the vehicle and the inspected surface tritech international ltd velocity log doppler sensor navquest 600 manufactured by linkquest inc provides the speed of the vehicle in the surge sway and pitch directions linkquest inc the depth meter model tw pi manufactured by iope ltd provides the vehicle depth is the only analog sensor the embedded sensors are listed in table 1 proteo has 8 actuators for locomotion manufactured by tecnadyne inc six thrusters model 1020 and two motors model 40 all of them are controlled by a power controller called isomod from the same manufacturer which receives by a serial input the commands indicating the level of voltage to be placed at the output of each actuator the main supply of the actuators is 150 v dc for the activation of the board and sensors other sources have been installed whose function is to reduce the voltage level to 24 vdc 12 vdc or 5 vdc depending on the devices tecnadyne 2040 tecnadyne 1020 at ferreira et al 2014a the

identification of the hrov parameters tests were carried out in the test tank being reported in the work ferreira et al 2014b 4 control design for the under actuated system the plant was divided in two parts one controlled for the movement in the xy plane and another for the other degrees of freedom the diagram of the controllers can be seen in fig 5 the control in the plane was divided in two stages kinematic and dynamic controller we chose the control lyapunov function clf associated with backstepping 4 1 control lyapunov function the equations of motion that will be adopted for the xy plane were obtained from equation 7 considering that the hrov is maintained in the xy plane with ϕ 0 and θ 0 that way the position and velocity vectors are ν u v r t and η x y ψ t the system of xy

previously mentioned the hrov equations of motion were separated to treat the problem of under actuated the same approach is used in vehicles with differential wheels for this purpose the development of this controller is based on the control proposals adopted by fierro and lewis 1995 zidani et al 2015 basically the idea of the controller is to propose the tracking of the desired trajectory the problem is to converge to zero the position errors in a given instant considering the under actuated of the vehicle the trajectories that it performs are not arbitrary it has some restrictions as indicated by do and pan 2009 the desired velocity u d and r d satisfy 8 u d x d 2 y d 2 r d x d y d y d x d x d 2 y d 2 the desired trajectory has to be a continuous function if the intention is to perform a trajectory that is not regular it becomes necessary to separate the trajectories in regular parts the desired velocity should not be zero it is not a control to stabilize the vehicle at one point but rather to track a desired trajectory another imposed condition is that the vehicle acceleration is limited and the velocity variations are slowly which is reasonable considering the inertia of the vehicle in the water the surge velocity is always higher than a possible sway velocity which is justifiable because the vehicle is under actuated in a practical application the most common trajectories for the vehicle are met such as straight curved and sinusoidal lines always having the surge direction as the direction of the trajectory the problem becomes to converge to zero the position errors between the hrov and the desired trajectory the definition of the trajectory error 9 e 1 e 2 e 3 cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 x d x y d y ψ d ψ we will replace the notation u by u

actuated of the hrov doesn t allow the direct control of the heave velocity according to do 2010 an angular deviation δ is necessary to create a component of the surge velocity in the sway direction

where k a and k c are positive real constants although the intention to make the control outputs make equation 12 negative defined it is negative semidefinite since it can present null values for entries other than zero considering only integer multiples of π the controller does not guarantee the asymptotic global stability of the vehicle being able to have oscillations around the desired equilibrium point however as will be shown later in the simulations the oscillations are not significant which guarantees a good performance to the control before starting the design of the dynamic controller it is necessary to create two new variables 15 z 1 u 1 u z 2 r 1 r with this new variables it was chosen two new lyapunov function candidates 16 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 v 1 z 1 u 1 u 17 v 2 1 2 z 2 2

is an identity matrix with size three by three the desired trajectory chosen for simulation can be seen in fig 6 the error curve of the angle ψ shown in fig 9 appears to present a large error between the simulations with original parameters and with parameter error plus a load of 20 of the original weight in fact after 50s both errors are almost the same the only difference is that the system with parameter error performed an extra turn around the z axis and after 50s has stabilized and started the tracking the desired trajectory the control effort was required more in the case of the vehicle with parameterization error as can be observed in fig 10 saturating the actuators this occurs because the initial position of the vehicle is displaced from the trajectory and the vehicle is carrying an unplanned load in the control design 6 conclusions in this paper we design nonlinear multivariable controllers to the tracking problem of the build hrov as well as it was considered the underactuated model vehicle subjected to nonlinear controllers unknown disturbances and parameter identification errors with a load of the 28 4 kg in all simulations it was considered sinusoidal

as can be observed in fig 7 and 8 as well as the controller shows robustness under parameter identification errors designed backstepping controllers guaranteed the global asymptotic stability their design is simple and the tuning of their parameters is done in a trail and error way the design of the clf controller is not a simple task because the lyapunov function candidate is not a trivial

23673,this work presents nonlinear multivariable control strategies based on backstepping methodology and control lyapunov function clf for trajectory tracking problem of a hybrid remotely operated vehicle hrov which is under development at the federal university of abc ufabc since 2012 the main objective of the vehicle is to inspect underwater structures by measuring plates thickness the design control for underactuated hrov presents some limitations in the vehicle trajectory the control consists on the combination of two methodologies which are the backstepping and the clf it also makes robustness study of controllers consider disturbance acting on the vehicle the proposed control responded appropriately to the trajectories selected as reference and presents robustness for non modeled external disturbances keywords underactuated control mimo nonlinear control backstepping control lyapunov function clf remotely operated vehicle rov 1 introduction there are applications of remotely operated vehicles rov s in a variety of areas such as biology for marine habitat monitoring archeology for flooded site investigation and engineering for submerged structures inspection and underwater mining the vehicle was named hrov hybrid remotely operated vehicle and the term hybrid installed due to its locomotion feature which can use thrusters for a navigation on the water or a pair of motorized tracks for movement over the structure the brazilian navy regulates that the release for operation of vessels has to be in national waters this must be made through a complete dry deck inspection in addition to a technical assessment of the thickness plates in the case of metallic vessels with more than fifteen years of operation dpc 2013 among the naval applications we can highlight a niche in the petroleum area that in addition to using large ships in transportation have floating production storing and offloading fpso structures for the production and storage in the offshore oil and oil products these structures are designed to work in the same lease for up to 25 years and the withdrawal of a vessel in operation influences financial loss whitcomb 2000 the inspection of the structure in place is necessary for this type of application in this scenario in the federal university of abc ufabc we developed a project with the objective of developing a hrov named proteo for inspection of underwater metallic structures in their normal operating environment performing plate thickness measurements by ultrasonic sensor the project considers a control station which is nearby the structure to be inspected or in a location that allows the remote activation of the hrov with the umbilical communication the vehicle is placed in the water and positioned by the operator using the thrusters at the initial point of inspection the hrov performs a rotation maneuver to keep the motorized tracks in contact with the structure and to do this is necessary that the vertical thrusters maintain a normal force to the inspection plane causing the motorized tracks to have sufficient friction to maneuver the vehicle by performing the thickness measurements for the trajectory tracking problem several control techniques are being used in order to control an actuated rov in srisamosorn et al 2013 was developed a robust adaptive control algorithm and used two lyapunov candidate function to demonstrate the stability and to determine adaptive laws the performance is verified with numerical simulation in encarnacao and pascoal 2000 it was proposed a methodology utilizing a nonlinear dynamic inversion and applying backstepping techniques in zhu and gu 2011a it was proposed a combining of two controllers an adaptive backstepping technique and a sliding control in patompak and nilkhamhang 2012 it was developed an adaptive backstepping sliding mode controller in fernandes et al 2015 it was proposed a motion control system which is an output feedback control composed of a mimo pid controller feedforward and high gain observer for the control of an underactuated rov in raygosa barahona et al 2011 it was applied a combining of two controllers a backstepping and a second order integral sliding modes controls in do 2010 it was proposed a control design based on several nonlinear coordinate changes the transverse function approach the backstepping technique the lyapunov direct method and utilization of the ship dynamics in khadhraoui et al 2014 it was developed the design control on the vertical plane with a backstepping methodology this article aims to give the next step of the project which is the development of a navigation control for this hrov which is underactuated i e the direction sway y is not actuated because of this it was necessary to combine two control techniques the idea is to divide the vehicle model into two parts the first part is considered fully actuated and is controlled with a backstepping control this part of movement is provided by the four thrusters positioned in the vertical the second part where the underactuated occurs the movement is provided by two thrusters positioned in the horizontal in order to control the sub actuated part it was used the ideas proposed in fierro and lewis 1995 zidani et al 2015 in which were developed a kinematic torque control law for a wheeled mobile robot utilizing backstepping the control lyapunov function was used due to the need for a bottleneck thus the underactuated model is very similar of a ship model liu et al 2016 jiang 2002 do 2010 the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the proteo architecture section 3 shows the vehicle mathematical model section 4 presents the control design section 5 concerns the numerical simulation and section 6 conclusions 2 proteo hardware architecture the main function of the vehicle is the inspection of ship hulls by means of ultrasonic transducers to check the thickness of the plate and look for cracks it has two operating modes free flight and crawling in the first mode of operation the vehicle uses six thrusters 4 vertical and 2 horizontal for its displacement through the water and in the second mode uses two motorized mats for its locomotion on the surface of the hull of the ship and 4 vertical thrusters to apply a normal force in the hull avoiding the use of complex electromagnetic devices 2 1 mechanical designed the structure of hrov consists in a polypropylene plates and its divided in 5 parts two lateral and three horizontal plates the top horizontal plate of the structure contains the float and four thrusters with their vertically oriented axes the middle plate contains a pressure vessel for the control of the electronics and the lower part of the structure contains two thrusters with their axes oriented horizontally as motorized tracks in the initial design the float should be a block fig 1 but due to the weight of the motorized tracks tubes were used fig 2 an umbilical cable is used for an electrical signal and a signal transmission which can be seen in figs 2 and 1 it is noted that the general structure can be approximated being symmetrical in the longitudinal and transverse planes which will influence the simplifications that will be made in the mathematical modeling section 3 2 2 computer sensors and

is compatible with windows windows embedded linux vxworks and qnx in this work we used the debian 6 0 0 operating system squeeze stable versa logic corporation the fig 3 shows schematically the architecture adopted for the project it has a surface computer from which the vehicle is remotely controlled and an embedded where the program that processes the data of the sensors receives the desired trajectory and locally controls the actuators to keep the vehicle in the trajectory sensors used in the hrov were chosen to provide information capable of giving orientation position speed and acceleration of the vehicle the altimeter model pa500 6 ps manufactured by tritech international limited provides underwater distance measurements in this design the sensor is used to measure the distance between the vehicle and the inspected surface tritech international ltd velocity log doppler sensor navquest 600 manufactured by linkquest inc provides the speed of the vehicle in the surge sway and pitch directions linkquest inc the depth meter model tw pi manufactured by iope ltd provides the vehicle depth is the only analog sensor the embedded sensors are listed in table 1 proteo has 8 actuators for locomotion manufactured by tecnadyne inc six thrusters model 1020 and two motors model 40 all of them are controlled by a power controller called isomod from the same manufacturer which receives by a serial input the commands indicating the level of voltage to be placed at the output of each actuator the main supply of the actuators is 150 v dc for the activation of the board and sensors other sources have been installed whose function is to reduce the voltage level to 24 vdc 12 vdc or 5 vdc depending on the devices tecnadyne 2040 tecnadyne 1020 at ferreira et al 2014a the

identification of the hrov parameters tests were carried out in the test tank being reported in the work ferreira et al 2014b 4 control design for the under actuated system the plant was divided in two parts one controlled for the movement in the xy plane and another for the other degrees of freedom the diagram of the controllers can be seen in fig 5 the control in the plane was divided in two stages kinematic and dynamic controller we chose the control lyapunov function clf associated with backstepping 4 1 control lyapunov function the equations of motion that will be adopted for the xy plane were obtained from equation 7 considering that the hrov is maintained in the xy plane with ϕ 0 and θ 0 that way the position and velocity vectors are ν u v r t and η x y ψ t the system of xy

previously mentioned the hrov equations of motion were separated to treat the problem of under actuated the same approach is used in vehicles with differential wheels for this purpose the development of this controller is based on the control proposals adopted by fierro and lewis 1995 zidani et al 2015 basically the idea of the controller is to propose the tracking of the desired trajectory the problem is to converge to zero the position errors in a given instant considering the under actuated of the vehicle the trajectories that it performs are not arbitrary it has some restrictions as indicated by do and pan 2009 the desired velocity u d and r d satisfy 8 u d x d 2 y d 2 r d x d y d y d x d x d 2 y d 2 the desired trajectory has to be a continuous function if the intention is to perform a trajectory that is not regular it becomes necessary to separate the trajectories in regular parts the desired velocity should not be zero it is not a control to stabilize the vehicle at one point but rather to track a desired trajectory another imposed condition is that the vehicle acceleration is limited and the velocity variations are slowly which is reasonable considering the inertia of the vehicle in the water the surge velocity is always higher than a possible sway velocity which is justifiable because the vehicle is under actuated in a practical application the most common trajectories for the vehicle are met such as straight curved and sinusoidal lines always having the surge direction as the direction of the trajectory the problem becomes to converge to zero the position errors between the hrov and the desired trajectory the definition of the trajectory error 9 e 1 e 2 e 3 cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 x d x y d y ψ d ψ we will replace the notation u by u

actuated of the hrov doesn t allow the direct control of the heave velocity according to do 2010 an angular deviation δ is necessary to create a component of the surge velocity in the sway direction

where k a and k c are positive real constants although the intention to make the control outputs make equation 12 negative defined it is negative semidefinite since it can present null values for entries other than zero considering only integer multiples of π the controller does not guarantee the asymptotic global stability of the vehicle being able to have oscillations around the desired equilibrium point however as will be shown later in the simulations the oscillations are not significant which guarantees a good performance to the control before starting the design of the dynamic controller it is necessary to create two new variables 15 z 1 u 1 u z 2 r 1 r with this new variables it was chosen two new lyapunov function candidates 16 v 1 1 2 z 1 2 v 1 z 1 u 1 u 17 v 2 1 2 z 2 2

like a disturbances the first variable of the coordinate change is given by 20 z 1 z η z η d z where η d z is the vector desired the second variable of the coordinate change is 21 z 2 z ν 2 ν v z ν 2 z 2 z ν v z where ν v z virtual control is stabilization function of the z 1 z differentiating equation 20 and combination with equation 21 and equation 19 22 z 1 z j z η z z 2 z ν v z η d z the

consequently the matrix j z η z becomes diagonal and the last two terms of equation 30 cancel each other 31 v 2 z z 1 z t k f z 1 z z 2 z t k g z 2 z that way the equation is defined negative 5 simulation for the simulation it was considered the scenario with perturbations in all degrees of freedom of the vehicle represented by sinusoidal forces torques as the basis for the definition of

is an identity matrix with size three by three the desired trajectory chosen for simulation can be seen in fig 6 the error curve of the angle ψ shown in fig 9 appears to present a large error between the simulations with original parameters and with parameter error plus a load of 20 of the original weight in fact after 50s both errors are almost the same the only difference is that the system with

23674,this paper presents a new approach to the structural availability quantification of a slender beam element affected by external random loads with a special focus on yield strength the proposed method introduces the concept of structural availability which is intrinsically identical to the concept of operational availability in system reliability engineering structural availability is formulated with structural failure and repair models the failure model is determined based on failure probability and the poisson approximation in applying the structural availability method to design it is possible to quantitatively measure features related to the operation and maintenance of structures and to identify cost effective design options to understand feasibility levels of structural availability two cases based on actual design data are examined using the proposed method the case study results illustrate not only processes of quantifying the structural availability of a beam element but also the cost effectiveness evaluations on specific design options keywords structural availability probability of failure poisson approximation cost effectiveness risk based design 1 introduction ship structural design methods have been considerably improved through a number of studies and improvements in structural safety have in turn been achieved beghin 2013 mcnatt et al 2013 one representative method is the structural rules of the classification society which manages the majority of structural design variables in a deterministic manner this deterministic method i e rule based method mainly proposes the minimum requirements that each design case must satisfy in recent years in the interest of further design optimization the risk based design papanikolaou 2009 approach has been studied and related research is actively underway regarding risk based design a probabilistic approach to managing uncertainties of design variables is essential structural reliability analysis methods have been developed since the 1950s freudenthal 1956 and through such methods structural safety can be calculated in a probabilistic manner from structural reliability values it is possible to quantitatively consider variations in structural safety levels followed by design changes nevertheless the method still presents shortcomings in terms of risk based design it is difficult to account for probable effects of the maintenance of failure repair systems and cost effectiveness issues in a quantitative manner recently several studies on the risk based design of hull girder structures have been conducted using the failure probability derived from structural reliability analysis e g skjong and bitner gregersen 2002 imo 2006 however such studies still use the rule based design framework as they are based on partial safety factors and don t consider the effects of structural maintenance further existing research on the risk based design of local members of ship structures is currently insufficient in the petrochemical chemical and power plant industries production or operational availability has been used to show the extent to which a system approaches stable operations without production loss by using the availability more practical design optimizations based on estimations of production levels and evaluations of maintenance policies are achievable in turn the availability concept is applicable to the risk based design of ship structures and thus structural maintenance effects can be quantitatively considered throughout the design process juan et al 2011 examined the structural availability of a small truss structure by assuming that the failure model of a truss element follows a weibull distribution without failure probability calculations hess 2003 and knight et al 2015 also examined the structural availability related to fatigue cracks in naval ship structures whereby a failure model based not on failure probability but on a binomial distribution assumption was applied regarding the yield strength of a slender beam element subjected to random external loads this study proposes a method of structural availability quantification based on a new perspective the new method presented in this article first shows that it is possible to define the probabilistic failure model of a structural member based on the probability of failure derived from structural reliability analysis and the poisson approximation second this study specifies how to quantify the structural availability of a member by means of the failure model defined together with a structural repair model the structural availability calculations in this study follow current theories on the operational availability of typical failure repair systems kumamoto and henley 1996 two examples are included at the end of this paper one concerns a simple beam case and the other concerns a longitudinal stiffener case based on actual ship design data the feasibility and advantages of the method proposed can be understood well from these examples 2 structural availability quantification method this paper presents a means of quantifying the structural availability of a slender beam element on which external random loads are repeatedly applied for a long period a slender beam is considered an ordinary element of various structures for typical beam elements affected by external loads several failure modes such as yielding buckling and fatigue can result when loads are excessive of the various failure modes the yield strength against lateral bending deflection is addressed in this paper as it is a typical and fundamental mode considered in structural design a given beam element is continuously exposed to repeated random loads from the natural environment e g waves and winds when a single random load that is virtual and typically covers the probabilistic features of every load throughout a beam s design life is considered it can be assumed that the beam element should experience the single random load one by one in sequential order at a specific frequency over its lifetime the distribution of the single random load can be determined from a specific probability function based on the load s stochastic properties in this study the event that a beam experiences the single random load is defined as a single load event sle accordingly the situation that a beam element is affected by a broad range of loads over a long period can be simplified as a series of numerous individual sles once a beam element undergoes a sle one of two outcomes can result in terms of yield strength success or failure here success occurs when the bending stress in the beam is not greater than the nominal yield stress of the material used while failure implies that the bending stress is greater for this reason it is possible to apply the bernoulli trial assumption and the poisson approximation to a series of numerous sles the probability of beam failure for one sle is estimated from structural reliability analysis and the corresponding failure model is defined from the failure probability this study simply assumes that the repair model for beams should have an exponential distribution ultimately the structural availability of a beam is calculated quantitatively based on the failure and repair models fig 1 depicts an outline of the structural availability method a detailed description of the method is provided in subsequent parts of this section 2 1 bernoulli trial assumption essential assumptions on the environmental loads on a beam element are made in this study as follows random loads the magnitude of each load is fully random independent loads all loads are independent of one another periodic loads each load occurs repeatedly over a certain time interval without a break e g a random load is subjected to a beam every 10 s throughout a structure s lifetime based on the assumptions listed above the situation that a slender beam element experiences large numbers of external loads for a long time is simplified as a periodic and sequential series of numerous sles with respect to a slender beam and its yield strength a random variable y can have a value of one when the outcome of the sle is a success or zero when it is a failure thus the probability of y is given by 1 p y 1 1 p f 2 p y 0 p f here the probability of failure p f for the sle has a value from zero to one important features of the sle are summarized as follows one sle is statistically independent of the others one sle is statistically identical to the others an outcome from one sle is either a success or failure for the yielding failure of a beam element and the two outcomes from one sle are mutually exclusive consequently the sle becomes a bernoulli trial and the random variable y is a bernoulli random variable 2 2 poisson approximation as noted above the situation in which a slender beam element continuously and periodically experiences numerous random external loads throughout its lifetime t l can be simplified such that an sle occurs n times over a time period of t l i e a series of bernoulli trials the number of sle occurrences over a lifetime n is generally considered to be sufficiently large according to statistical theory a series of numerous bernoulli trials follows a binomial distribution let us define a random variable x as the number of failures occurring when sles occur n times over a period of t l 3 x b n p f the probability of k occurrences of failure or the probability when x k is as follows 4 p x k c n k p f k 1 p f n k n n k k p f k 1 p f n k the expected value of the random variable x becomes 5 e x λ 0 n p f here λ 0 denotes the expected number of failure events over the given period which is usually referred to as the arrival rate equation 4 is rewritten with λ 0 as follows 6 p x k n n k k λ 0 n k 1 λ 0 n n k the sle generally occurs very many times such that n can be considered to be a large number furthermore p f can be considered to be a significantly small value provided that the beam concerned complies with existing standards or rules based on these two considerations i e n is very large and p f is very small and assuming that the expected value of the random variable x i e λ 0 is kept constant equation 6 is equivalent to equation 7 7 p x k λ 0 k e λ 0 k w h e r e k 0 this probability function is identical to the poisson distribution with a constant arrival rate λ 0 consequently the probability that structural failure events occur k times when sles occur n times follows the poisson distribution the arrival rate λ 0 is presented as the combination of n and p f as the poisson distribution applies for rare events wackerly et al 2008 this result is deemed reasonable 2 3 structural failure modelling when the sle is assumed to occur a total of n t times over a period of 0 t the average number of failures occurring per unit time λ is defined as equation 8 8 λ λ 0 t n t p f t the number of failure event k t obeys the poisson distribution with an arrival rate of λt and hence it can be deemed a type of hpp homogeneous poisson process 9 k t p o s λ t 10 p k t k λ t k e λ t k w h e r e k 0 when t is defined as the elapsed time from time zero to the occurrence of the first failure event the probability that a failure event occurs for the first time during the time interval of t t dt is set as follows a failure occurring during t t dt is independent of previous event results for 0 t 11 p t t t d t λ e λ t d t 12 p t t t d t d t f t t λ e λ t here the probabilistic density function of t f t t is identical to the exponential distribution with a parameter of λ eventually the yielding failure of the beam can be modelled from the exponential distribution with parameter λ as follows 13 failure function f t 1 e λ t w h e r e t 0 14 reliability function r t e λ t 15 failure density function f t λ e λ t 16 mean time to failure m t t f 1 λ 17 failure rate z t λ 2 4 structural repair modelling in most cases the repair of a failed beam element would not be complicated e g simply replacing the failed beam with a new one it is expected that replacement work requires an almost identical amount of time and cost at any place and any time due to its simplicity thus the repair of a failed beam can be modelled using the exponential distribution with a constant repair rate μ in this study the repair density function g t is modelled as equation 18 18 g t μ e μ t 2 5 structural availability derivation structural availability is derived based on the failure and repair density functions shown in sections 2 3 and 2 4 kumamoto and henley 1996 for the yielding failure and subsequent repair of a slender beam element the intensity functions of failure and repair w t and v t are formulated using density functions f t and g t the failure intensity function means the unconditional probability that a structural element fails at time t and the repair intensity function does the unconditional probability that an element is repaired per unit time at time t in formulating the intensity functions it is possible to define the expected number of failures from time zero to time t w 0 t and the expected number of repairs to time t v 0 t the difference between the two expected numbers corresponds to the unavailability q t measured over the time interval t the availability value a t is determined based on the unavailability through equation 19 19 a t 1 q t assuming that a beam is initially not defective its behaviour over time can be classified into three types as shown in fig 2 in the case of type 1 the probability of failure is estimated as equation 20 20 f t d t the probability for type 2 is shown in equation 21 where the first term denotes the probability that the element is repaired during u u du and the second term denotes the probability that the element has been normal until time t and fails during t t dt given that it was repaired at time u 21 v u d u f t u d t the probability that the element fails during t t dt is defined as w t dt and it is identical to the sum of probabilities for type 1 and 2 hence the sum of equations 20 and 21 generates equation 22 22 w t d t f t d t d t 0 t f t u v u d u on the other hand the probability of failure for type 3 becomes equation 23 23 w u d u g t u d t thus the probability that the failed element is repaired during t t dt is written as follows 24 v t d t d t 0 t g t u w u d u equations 22 and 24 lead to the following simultaneous identities 25 w t f t 0 t f t u v u d u 26 v t 0 t g t u w u d u the unconditional failure intensity w t and the repair intensity v t are calculated via the iterative numerical integration of the above two equations when f t and g t are known for an analytical solution the laplace transform can be used provided that the density functions have constant failure and repair rates as a result the unconditional intensities are derived as follows 27 w t λ μ λ μ λ 2 λ μ e λ μ t 28 v t λ μ λ μ λ μ λ μ e λ μ t the expected numbers of failures and repairs occurring during time interval t w 0 t and v 0 t are obtained as

stationary steady state values of unavailability and availability are written as follows 33 q λ λ μ 1 μ 1 λ 1 μ m t t r m t t f m t t r 34 a μ λ μ 1 λ 1 λ 1 μ m t t f m t t f m t t r structural availability of this article is defined by the probability that a structural element under loads is fully functional at any specific time for a given time period given that it is as good as a new one at time zero 2 6 cost effectiveness based on structural availability with the help of structural availability the actual income made from the structure s operation which is the potential earnings for a given period can be estimated that is by multiplying ideal earnings based on an assumption of no failures and repairs occurring for a given period by the calculated structural availability it is possible to predict real earnings based on potential failures and repairs as structural availability is interpreted as the actual utilization rate of a structure for a given period accordingly for a certain design option more reasonable cost effectiveness can be understood by comparing costs of fabrication with earnings based on structural availability 2 7 applications to ship structural design while sailing across the ocean a ship encounters numerous irregular waves that vary continuously with time a range of studies have shown that the ocean waves follow a random process and that the characteristics of ocean waves can only be expressed in a probabilistic manner the responses of a ship to waves which result from dynamic interactions between waves and the vessel are random as well in this regard ship s responses to waves e g local dynamic pressure and hull girder moment can be approximated as a probabilistic function based on characteristic values of random waves through statistical theory chowdhury 2007 assuming that an ocean going ship experiences a single random wave that covers the probabilistic features of every ocean wave over a long period one by one in sequential order and with a specific frequency throughout its lifetime the conditions under which the ship is affected by a wide range of waves over given time periods can be simplified as a series of numerous discrete sles based on a single random wave for single random waves the load distribution can be defined as a specific probability function by means of a single wave s stochastic properties obtained from the long term prediction of random ocean waves hence for a ship s stiffener design related to the yielding failure mode structural availability can be calculated using the method proposed in this paper 3 example of simple beam case this example involves one typical simple supported beam element that uniform pressure continuously acts on for a long period see fig 3 the pressure is assumed to be a dynamic load caused by environmental conditions e g winds and to occur once every 10 s i e the average period of load occurrence is 10 s the pressure magnitude is random and follows a specific probability distribution the design life of the beam is set to 20 years and no degradation due to corrosion is considered equation 35 shows the limit state equation of the example which is deduced from classical beam theory timoshenko 1953 the limit state equation includes several design variables table 1 shows the design variables defined in a probabilistic manner the simple beam case considers various design options depending on the change in beam height 35 z r l σ y i e l d σ w o r k i n g σ y i e l d 3 p ℓ 2 4 b h 2 based on the limit state equation and random variables listed above the probability of failure p f for one load is calculated by structural reliability analysis table 2 and fig 4 show the calculation results of failure probability and of related structural availability for each design option from the graph shown in fig 4 it is evident that the failure probability is steadily reduced as the beam is strengthened while the effects of increasing structural availability from strengthening are not straightforward even though the beam becomes larger structural availability seldom increases in height ranges of 0 52 0 60 or 0 40 0 44 an outstanding increase in structural availability is however shown in design options involving beam heights of 0 44 0 52 for demonstrating the potential of structural availability for life cycle cost analysis costs and earnings of the illustrated beam structure are analyzed this example depicts a simple earning cost model that only contains a material cost for construction and a regular income from the operation of structure for easy calculation based on the present worth method watts and chapman 2008 total earning at the end of lifetime estimated by accumulating all annual incomes is converted to its present value at a constant interest rate it is assumed that annual income increases at a constant inflation rate every year further assumptions for the analysis are made as follows anticipated operational earnings from the structure 2 usd day steel price 700 usd ton mean time to repair 1 day compound interest rate 5 per annum which remains invariant over the design life inflation rate 3 per annum which remains invariant over the design life table 2 and fig 5 show the outcomes of the cost effectiveness calculation from which the following evaluations can be made when applying a deterministic approach every design option is deemed safe because all working stresses are less than the yield limit of the material used the optimum design is the first option as it has the lowest material cost this evaluation involves no detailed consideration of cost effectiveness considering the design life 20 years and load occurrence period 10 s the acceptable limit of the failure probability is estimated at approximately 1 6 10 8 thus the ninth design option is deemed the optimum from a viewpoint of cost effectiveness based on the structural availability and the structural safety consequently we note from this example that the structural availability is capable of providing more useful information on cost effectiveness for structural design 4 example of longitudinal stiffener case 4 1 outline as another exemplary application of the proposed approach to ship structural design a typical longitudinal stiffener is considered the subject vessel is a conventional oil tanker detailed information is presented in table 3 and fig 6 design conditions assumed for the calculation are as follows the conditions are basically in line with the design bases defined in iacs international association of classification societies csr common structural rules for double hull oil tankers design life a nominal design life is 25 years external environment the ship operates in the north atlantic wave environment for its entire design life for the long term prediction of random waves a wave scatter diagram for the north atlantic iacs 2001 is considered internal environment the specific gravity of cargo and the corrosion addition are identical to those included in the rules loading conditions two loading conditions are considered full loading and normal ballasting periods under the full loading and normal ballasting conditions represent 60 and 40 of the design life respectively wave spectrum the two parameter pierson moskowitz spectrum is considered inspection periodic inspections or surveys are not considered 4 2 limit state equation limit state equations for the local stiffener s yielding failure mode are presented in equations 36 and 37 and are developed by recomposing the scantling formulas of iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the basic concept is that the structural capability against loads is not to be less than the actual working load in the equations both the capability and working load are described through a nominal stress term 36 z r l σ y i e l d σ w o r k i n g 37 σ w o r k i n g p w k s t a t p w k d y n s ℓ 2 f b e n d z s t i f f m w k s t a t c s c a l e m w

distribution types and parameters are determined by reviewing the relevant literature and instances that are considered appropriate the stochastic modelling of design variables is summarized in table 5 a direct load analysis is conducted for the dynamic loads p wk dyn and m wk dyn from the results of the conventional ship motion analysis that uses the 3d linear potential code and the long term prediction based on the weibull distribution probabilistic features of the dynamic loads are determined as shown in tables 6 and 7 this example considers a dozen discrete wave heading angles every 30 and the uniformly distributed occurrence probabilities of each angle hydro models used for the direct load analysis are shown in fig 7 4 4 calculation of failure probability considering that the dynamic loads bending moment and local pressure are coupled for a certain loading condition and wave heading angle it is necessary to calculate the individual failure probability corresponding to not only each possible loading condition but also each possible wave heading angle thus the final probability of failure is determined by summing all of the calculated probabilities as presented in equation 38 38 p f i 1 n l c r l c i j 1 n h a r a n g l e j p f i j n lc is the total number of loading conditions and n ha is the total number of wave heading angles r lc i and r angle j are the fractions of each loading condition and heading angle considered respectively based on the design condition defined in section 4 1 the failure probability of equation 38 is specified as shown in equations 39 41 the ratios of the two loading conditions r full and r ballast are set as 0 60 and 0 40 respectively 39 p f r f u l l p f f u l l r b a l l a s t p f b a l l a s t 40 p f f u l l a n g

in this study the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation is applied using a commercial reliability program i e strurel the calculation results of failure probability are summarized in table 8 42 p f 0 60 7 11 10 12 0 40 9 29 10 17 4 266 10 12 4 5 failure rate and repair rate estimation the structural failure rate λ is estimated based on the failure probability from equation 8 it is necessary to define the total occurrence time of the sle n t which is equivalent to the total number of waves over a lifetime the design life is 25 years so t is approximately 8 0 108 s the average wave period over the lifetime is assumed to be 10 s accordingly n t is 8 107 times and the failure rate is 4 266 10 13 43 λ n t p f t 8 10 7 4 266 10 12 8 0 10 8 4 266 10 13 s 1 the typical time interval needed to completely replace a failed stiffener including preparation active repair warm up and logistic times is assumed to be approximately 30 days 2 592 106 s thus the repair rate μ is approximately 3 858 10 7 44 μ 1 m t t r 1 2 592 10 6 3 858 10 7 s 1 4 6 structural availability calculation based on the above structural failure and repair rates structural availability is given by equation 45 45 a t λ λ μ μ λ e λ μ t 9 9999889 10 1 99 999889 46 q t λ λ μ 1 e λ μ t 1 1057459 10 6 0 000111 from the structural availability value calculated the stiffener is deemed to almost fulfill its required function against the yielding failure throughout the ship s lifetime in this regard we conclude that the example design sufficiently resists the working stress in the elastic region of the material applied and thus its current design is acceptable this assessment is based on the probabilistic approach the minimum required net section modulus is 1317 98 cm3 according to iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the as built net section modulus of the stiffener is 1762 9 cm3 which is approximately 1 34 times larger than the rule requirement for this reason the current design is considered acceptable this assessment result is based on the deterministic approach in reality the yielding failure of longitudinal bottom stiffeners of oil tankers rarely occurs provided that the stiffeners are designed in compliance with relevant requirements as the example stiffener has a much larger section modulus than rule requirement and the current structural rules have been established based on conservative safety margins the structural availability value which is found to be quite high is deemed reasonable 4 7 effects of failure probability changes on structural availability in this section the relationship between structural availability and failure probability is examined using the example data the trends of structural availability are shown in table 9 and fig 8 the minimum design case corresponds to the stiffener with a net section modulus required by the rules 1317 98 cm3 generally speaking minimum rule requirements are the absolute criteria to be fulfilled for design approval both the actual design case and minimum design case ensure sufficient availability of close to 100 when a design case is not less than the minimum rule requirement the graph shows that the structural availability improvement is not significant regardless of how large the design is in contrast when the design falls below rule requirement there is a steep decline in structural availability considering this trend the current rule requirement is deemed reasonable from the viewpoint of structural availability 4 8 cost benefit analysis based on structural availability this section describes a simple cost benefit analysis based on structural availability values the basic data used are identical to those shown in section 4 1 among the five life cycle cost and earning models proposed by turan et al 2009 the material cost and the operational earning are only considered in this example for the sake of simplicity operational earning per year can be viewed as the product of ship s productivity and freight rate turan et al 2009 47 r 24 s l d d w u d w t f r here r is the revenue per annum s is the average operating speed per hour ld is the number of loaded days at sea per annum dwu is deadweight utilization dwt is the deadweight of ship and fr is the freight rate per ton mile of cargo transported for reasonable cost benefit evaluation this example considers the present worth method based on a constant interest rate that is total operational earning for ship s lifetime 25 years determined by summing up all annual revenue is converted to its present value the annual revenue is assumed to increase at a constant inflation rate every year additional assumptions adopted are as follows s 14 0 knots ld 256 days year i e 70 of an year dwu 0 8 and fr 0 002 usd ton mile dwt is 105 000 tonnes for the design case complying with the rule minimum requirement the displacement of ship is kept constant thus dwt decreases when the weight of stiffeners increases in order to keep the displacement invariant conversely stiffener downsizing brings about dwt rise compound interest rate is 8 per annum and kept constant for 25 years inflation rate is 3 per annum and kept constant for 25 years except for the hull structure all systems are fully available except for the local stiffener all structural elements are fully available only the yielding failure mode is considered with other failure modes neglected the daily revenue calculated from the results in table 10 is approximately 39 000 usd over which is similar to the average daily earnings of aframax tankers in 2015 such as 37 954 usd unctad 2016 there are numerous stiffeners in the ship similar to those of the example case a rough enumeration of similar stiffeners shows that there are approximately 9660 ea all of the examined stiffeners are assumed to have similar dimensions and availability levels the material cost estimation is based on the stiffener sectional area and a steel density of 7 86 g cm3 the stiffener area change is assumed proportional to the section modulus to a power of 2 3 related maintenance costs are not considered because those are typically much lower than material costs for construction average steel cost for ship construction is assumed as 780 usd ton based on the data of meps world steel price in the asian region during 2014 for a simple cost benefit analysis variations in total lifetime earnings and stiffener material costs resulting from the application of several design modifications are investigated the relevant results are shown in table 10 in this analysis the failure probability is reduced by approximately 10 times by enlarging the stiffener s dimension the results show that the more reinforced the stiffeners are the lower the failure probability and the higher the degree of structural availability stiffener material costs and total earnings increase with the degree of reinforcement in fig 9 material costs increase uniformly with failure probability decline the total earnings increase however slows down considerably from the design case with a failure probability of 10 7 for the earning to cost ratio the cost effectiveness reaches a maximum value at a failure probability of 10 7 and then drops as the stiffener size increases because the degree of total earning growth is very small see fig 10 thus the design case with a failure probability of 10 7 could exhibit optimal cost effectiveness approximately 46 721 whereas the minimum rule requirement causes a level of cost effectiveness approximately 45 020 that is slightly less than the optimum accordingly the current rule requirement is deemed reasonable from a cost effectiveness perspective in addition to further understand the cost effectiveness of the example case the marginal cost and benefit are examined the results on the eight design cases are summarized in table 11 and in figs 11 and 12 assumptions and definitions for the marginal cost benefit analysis are listed as follows the minimum design case forms the basis for the comparison of costs and benefits thus the additional cost and benefit of the minimum design case are valued at zero δc i additional steel costs due to design modifications for the i th design case relative to the steel cost of the minimum design case δs i loss of earnings estimated for the i th design case relative to the maximum total earnings based on 100 availability δb i additional economic benefit for the i th design case which is equivalent to the decrement of the earning loss relative to the loss of the minimum design case 48 δ b i δ s 1 δ s i δb i δc i net benefit ratio which is the additional benefit divided by the additional cost in fig 11 additional costs steadily increase with failure probability decline but additional benefit growth slows down rapidly from the third case the additional cost and benefit intersect at a failure probability of between 10 9 and 10 10 for the net benefit ratio the cost effectiveness drops sharply as the stiffener size increases and the minimum design case is expected to be the most effective see fig 12 design options involving a failure probability of less than 3 10 10 are considered not to be cost effective because their net benefit ratios are less than 1 0 thus the actual design case wherein the ratio is approximately 0 372 is deemed excessive the cost benefit analysis results contribute the following principles on local stiffener design a design case corresponding to the rule requirement is deemed the most optimized from a cost effectiveness perspective design cases with a failure probability of less than 3 10 10 are deemed not cost effective because the additional benefit is less than the additional steel cost consequently local stiffeners should be designed to reflect the rule requirements as much as possible and to present a probability of failure greater than 3 10 10 to prevent excessive design among the 12 designs in table 10 the 5th and 6th options which are identical to the 1st and 2nd options in table 11 are considered optimal because they satisfy the rule s minimum requirement and have the net benefit ratio larger than 1 0 hence it is recommended that the stiffener should have a net section modulus larger than 1320 cm3 and less than 1400 cm3 in summary the reinforcement of a structure e g enlarging the member dimensions usually increases a structure s strength and decreases its probability of failure however from rule requirements and failure probabilities alone it is not easy to determine the most cost effective levels of structural reinforcement whereas a design option of optimal cost effectiveness can be identified when using the approach to structural availability quantification proposed in this paper 5 conclusions this article proposes a new approach to quantifying the structural availability of the yield strength of a slender beam element the proposed method is mainly based on the structural failure model formulated with the poisson approximation and on structural reliability essential characteristics of the structural availability method are as follows a specific discrete event such as a single load event sle is defined to simplify long term situations under which a beam element is continuously and repeatedly affected by numerous random external loads over its lifetime based on probabilistic features of the sle and its sequential occurrences over a long period the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation are made using statistical theory failure events of the element are modelled using the failure probability derived from a structural reliability analysis the structural availability is quantitatively derived from the exponential distribution based failure model the validity of the structural availability quantification method was proven through two examples a simple beam case and an actual ship design case structural availability values of the example cases were quantitatively calculated from the proposed method and brief cost benefit analyses based on structural availability were then performed to understand the applicability to risk based design finally the structural availability of a slender beam was quantified in terms of its yield strength and the related cost effectiveness was evaluated in a robust manner the proposed method is believed to contribute to risk based structural design by providing an optimized and cost effective design that meets safety requirements to apply the proposed structural availability method to design process of complex ship structures additional studies must be conducted in several areas structural repair modelling limit state equations for other failure modes stochastic definitions of random variables and structural availability evaluation criteria acknowledgements this research was supported through a grant

23674,this paper presents a new approach to the structural availability quantification of a slender beam element affected by external random loads with a special focus on yield strength the proposed method introduces the concept of structural availability which is intrinsically identical to the concept of operational availability in system reliability engineering structural availability is formulated with structural failure and repair models the failure model is determined based on failure probability and the poisson approximation in applying the structural availability method to design it is possible to quantitatively measure features related to the operation and maintenance of structures and to identify cost effective design options to understand feasibility levels of structural availability two cases based on actual design data are examined using the proposed method the case study results illustrate not only processes of quantifying the structural availability of a beam element but also the cost effectiveness evaluations on specific design options keywords structural availability probability of failure poisson approximation cost effectiveness risk based design 1 introduction ship structural design methods have been considerably improved through a number of studies and improvements in structural safety have in turn been achieved beghin 2013 mcnatt et al 2013 one representative method is the structural rules of the classification society which manages the majority of structural design variables in a deterministic manner this deterministic method i e rule based method mainly proposes the minimum requirements that each design case must satisfy in recent years in the interest of further design optimization the risk based design papanikolaou 2009 approach has been studied and related research is actively underway regarding risk based design a probabilistic approach to managing uncertainties of design variables is essential structural reliability analysis methods have been developed since the 1950s freudenthal 1956 and through such methods structural safety can be calculated in a probabilistic manner from structural reliability values it is possible to quantitatively consider variations in structural safety levels followed by design changes nevertheless the method still presents shortcomings in terms of risk based design it is difficult to account for probable effects of the maintenance of failure repair systems and cost effectiveness issues in a quantitative manner recently several studies on the risk based design of hull girder structures have been conducted using the failure probability derived from structural reliability analysis e g skjong and bitner gregersen 2002 imo 2006 however such studies still use the rule based design framework as they are based on partial safety factors and don t consider the effects of structural maintenance further existing research on the risk based design of local members of ship structures is currently insufficient in the petrochemical chemical and power plant industries production or operational availability has been used to show the extent to which a system approaches stable operations without production loss by using the availability more practical design optimizations based on estimations of production levels and evaluations of maintenance policies are achievable in turn the availability concept is applicable to the risk based design of ship structures and thus structural maintenance effects can be quantitatively considered throughout the design process juan et al 2011 examined the structural availability of a small truss structure by assuming that the failure model of a truss element follows a weibull distribution without failure probability calculations hess 2003 and knight et al 2015 also examined the structural availability related to fatigue cracks in naval ship structures whereby a failure model based not on failure probability but on a binomial distribution assumption was applied regarding the yield strength of a slender beam element subjected to random external loads this study proposes a method of structural availability quantification based on a new perspective the new method presented in this article first shows that it is possible to define the probabilistic failure model of a structural member based on the probability of failure derived from structural reliability analysis and the poisson approximation second this study specifies how to quantify the structural availability of a member by means of the failure model defined together with a structural repair model the structural availability calculations in this study follow current theories on the operational availability of typical failure repair systems kumamoto and henley 1996 two examples are included at the end of this paper one concerns a simple beam case and the other concerns a longitudinal stiffener case based on actual ship design data the feasibility and advantages of the method proposed can be understood well from these examples 2 structural availability quantification method this paper presents a means of quantifying the structural availability of a slender beam element on which external random loads are repeatedly applied for a long period a slender beam is considered an ordinary element of various structures for typical beam elements affected by external loads several failure modes such as yielding buckling and fatigue can result when loads are excessive of the various failure modes the yield strength against lateral bending deflection is addressed in this paper as it is a typical and fundamental mode considered in structural design a given beam element is continuously exposed to repeated random loads from the natural environment e g waves and winds when a single random load that is virtual and typically covers the probabilistic features of every load throughout a beam s design life is considered it can be assumed that the beam element should experience the single random load one by one in sequential order at a specific frequency over its lifetime the distribution of the single random load can be determined from a specific probability function based on the load s stochastic properties in this study the event that a beam experiences the single random load is defined as a single load event sle accordingly the situation that a beam element is affected by a broad range of loads over a long period can be simplified as a series of numerous individual sles once a beam element undergoes a sle one of two outcomes can result in terms of yield strength success or failure here success occurs when the bending stress in the beam is not greater than the nominal yield stress of the material used while failure implies that the bending stress is greater for this reason it is possible to apply the bernoulli trial assumption and the poisson approximation to a series of numerous sles the probability of beam failure for one sle is estimated from structural reliability analysis and the corresponding failure model is defined from the failure probability this study simply assumes that the repair model for beams should have an exponential distribution ultimately the structural availability of a beam is calculated quantitatively based on the failure and repair models fig 1 depicts an outline of the structural availability method a detailed description of the method is provided in subsequent parts of this section 2 1 bernoulli trial assumption essential assumptions on the environmental loads on a beam element are made in this study as follows random loads the magnitude of each load is fully random independent loads all loads are independent of one another periodic loads each load occurs repeatedly over a certain time interval without a break e g a random load is subjected to a beam every 10 s throughout a structure s lifetime based on the assumptions listed above the situation that a slender beam element experiences large numbers of external loads for a long time is simplified as a periodic and sequential series of numerous sles with respect to a slender beam and its yield strength a random variable y can have a value of one when the outcome of the sle is a success or zero when it is a failure thus the probability of y is given by 1 p y 1 1 p f 2 p y 0 p f here the probability of failure p f for the sle has a value from zero to one important features of the sle are summarized as follows one sle is statistically independent of the others one sle is statistically identical to the others an outcome from one sle is either a success or failure for the yielding failure of a beam element and the two outcomes from one sle are mutually exclusive consequently the sle becomes a bernoulli trial and the random variable y is a bernoulli random variable 2 2 poisson approximation as noted above the situation in which a slender beam element continuously and periodically experiences numerous random external loads throughout its lifetime t l can be simplified such that an sle occurs n times over a time period of t l i e a series of bernoulli trials the number of sle occurrences over a lifetime n is generally considered to be sufficiently large according to statistical theory a series of numerous bernoulli trials follows a binomial distribution let us define a random variable x as the number of failures occurring when sles occur n times over a period of t l 3 x b n p f the probability of k occurrences of failure or the probability when x k is as follows 4 p x k c n k p f k 1 p f n k n n k k p f k 1 p f n k the expected value of the random variable x becomes 5 e x λ 0 n p f here λ 0 denotes the expected number of failure events over the given period which is usually referred to as the arrival rate equation 4 is rewritten with λ 0 as follows 6 p x k n n k k λ 0 n k 1 λ 0 n n k the sle generally occurs very many times such that n can be considered to be a large number furthermore p f can be considered to be a significantly small value provided that the beam concerned complies with existing standards or rules based on these two considerations i e n is very large and p f is very small and assuming that the expected value of the random variable x i e λ 0 is kept constant equation 6 is equivalent to equation 7 7 p x k λ 0 k e λ 0 k w h e r e k 0 this probability function is identical to the poisson distribution with a constant arrival rate λ 0 consequently the probability that structural failure events occur k times when sles occur n times follows the poisson distribution the arrival rate λ 0 is presented as the combination of n and p f as the poisson distribution applies for rare events wackerly et al 2008 this result is deemed reasonable 2 3 structural failure modelling when the sle is assumed to occur a total of n t times over a period of 0 t the average number of failures occurring per unit time λ is defined as equation 8 8 λ λ 0 t n t p f t the number of failure event k t obeys the poisson distribution with an arrival rate of λt and hence it can be deemed a type of hpp homogeneous poisson process 9 k t p o s λ t 10 p k t k λ t k e λ t k w h e r e k 0 when t is defined as the elapsed time from time zero to the occurrence of the first failure event the probability that a failure event occurs for the first time during the time interval of t t dt is set as follows a failure occurring during t t dt is independent of previous event results for 0 t 11 p t t t d t λ e λ t d t 12 p t t t d t d t f t t λ e λ t here the probabilistic density function of t f t t is identical to the exponential distribution with a parameter of λ eventually the yielding failure of the beam can be modelled from the exponential distribution with parameter λ as follows 13 failure function f t 1 e λ t w h e r e t 0 14 reliability function r t e λ t 15 failure density function f t λ e λ t 16 mean time to failure m t t f 1 λ 17 failure rate z t λ 2 4 structural repair modelling in most cases the repair of a failed beam element would not be complicated e g simply replacing the failed beam with a new one it is expected that replacement work requires an almost identical amount of time and cost at any place and any time due to its simplicity thus the repair of a failed beam can be modelled using the exponential distribution with a constant repair rate μ in this study the repair density function g t is modelled as equation 18 18 g t μ e μ t 2 5 structural availability derivation structural availability is derived based on the failure and repair density functions shown in sections 2 3 and 2 4 kumamoto and henley 1996 for the yielding failure and subsequent repair of a slender beam element the intensity functions of failure and repair w t and v t are formulated using density functions f t and g t the failure intensity function means the unconditional probability that a structural element fails at time t and the repair intensity function does the unconditional probability that an element is repaired per unit time at time t in formulating the intensity functions it is possible to define the expected number of failures from time zero to time t w 0 t and the expected number of repairs to time t v 0 t the difference between the two expected numbers corresponds to the unavailability q t measured over the time interval t the availability value a t is determined based on the unavailability through equation 19 19 a t 1 q t assuming that a beam is initially not defective its behaviour over time can be classified into three types as shown in fig 2 in the case of type 1 the probability of failure is estimated as equation 20 20 f t d t the probability for type 2 is shown in equation 21 where the first term denotes the probability that the element is repaired during u u du and the second term denotes the probability that the element has been normal until time t and fails during t t dt given that it was repaired at time u 21 v u d u f t u d t the probability that the element fails during t t dt is defined as w t dt and it is identical to the sum of probabilities for type 1 and 2 hence the sum of equations 20 and 21 generates equation 22 22 w t d t f t d t d t 0 t f t u v u d u on the other hand the probability of failure for type 3 becomes equation 23 23 w u d u g t u d t thus the probability that the failed element is repaired during t t dt is written as follows 24 v t d t d t 0 t g t u w u d u equations 22 and 24 lead to the following simultaneous identities 25 w t f t 0 t f t u v u d u 26 v t 0 t g t u w u d u the unconditional failure intensity w t and the repair intensity v t are calculated via the iterative numerical integration of the above two equations when f t and g t are known for an analytical solution the laplace transform can be used provided that the density functions have constant failure and repair rates as a result the unconditional intensities are derived as follows 27 w t λ μ λ μ λ 2 λ μ e λ μ t 28 v t λ μ λ μ λ μ λ μ e λ μ t the expected numbers of failures and repairs occurring during time interval t w 0 t and v 0 t are obtained as

stationary steady state values of unavailability and availability are written as follows 33 q λ λ μ 1 μ 1 λ 1 μ m t t r m t t f m t t r 34 a μ λ μ 1 λ 1 λ 1 μ m t t f m t t f m t t r structural availability of this article is defined by the probability that a structural element under loads is fully functional at any specific time for a given time period given that it is as good as a new one at time zero 2 6 cost effectiveness based on structural availability with the help of structural availability the actual income made from the structure s operation which is the potential earnings for a given period can be estimated that is by multiplying ideal earnings based on an assumption of no failures and repairs occurring for a given period by the calculated structural availability it is possible to predict real earnings based on potential failures and repairs as structural availability is interpreted as the actual utilization rate of a structure for a given period accordingly for a certain design option more reasonable cost effectiveness can be understood by comparing costs of fabrication with earnings based on structural availability 2 7 applications to ship structural design while sailing across the ocean a ship encounters numerous irregular waves that vary continuously with time a range of studies have shown that the ocean waves follow a random process and that the characteristics of ocean waves can only be expressed in a probabilistic manner the responses of a ship to waves which result from dynamic interactions between waves and the vessel are random as well in this regard ship s responses to waves e g local dynamic pressure and hull girder moment can be approximated as a probabilistic function based on characteristic values of random waves through statistical theory chowdhury 2007 assuming that an ocean going ship experiences a single random wave that covers the probabilistic features of every ocean wave over a long period one by one in sequential order and with a specific frequency throughout its lifetime the conditions under which the ship is affected by a wide range of waves over given time periods can be simplified as a series of numerous discrete sles based on a single random wave for single random waves the load distribution can be defined as a specific probability function by means of a single wave s stochastic properties obtained from the long term prediction of random ocean waves hence for a ship s stiffener design related to the yielding failure mode structural availability can be calculated using the method proposed in this paper 3 example of simple beam case this example involves one typical simple supported beam element that uniform pressure continuously acts on for a long period see fig 3 the pressure is assumed to be a dynamic load caused by environmental conditions e g winds and to occur once every 10 s i e the average period of load occurrence is 10 s the pressure magnitude is random and follows a specific probability distribution the design life of the beam is set to 20 years and no degradation due to corrosion is considered equation 35 shows the limit state equation of the example which is deduced from classical beam theory timoshenko 1953 the limit state equation includes several design variables table 1 shows the design variables defined in a probabilistic manner the simple beam case considers various design options depending on the change in beam height 35 z r l σ y i e l d σ w o r k i n g σ y i e l d 3 p ℓ 2 4 b h 2 based on the limit state equation and random variables listed above the probability of failure p f for one load is calculated by structural reliability analysis table 2 and fig 4 show the calculation results of failure probability and of related structural availability for each design option from the graph shown in fig 4 it is evident that the failure probability is steadily reduced as the beam is strengthened while the effects of increasing structural availability from strengthening are not straightforward even though the beam becomes larger structural availability seldom increases in height ranges of 0 52 0 60 or 0 40 0 44 an outstanding increase in structural availability is however shown in design options involving beam heights of 0 44 0 52 for demonstrating the potential of structural availability for life cycle cost analysis costs and earnings of the illustrated beam structure are analyzed this example depicts a simple earning cost model that only contains a material cost for construction and a regular income from the operation of structure for easy calculation based on the present worth method watts and chapman 2008 total earning at the end of lifetime estimated by accumulating all annual incomes is converted to its present value at a constant interest rate it is assumed that annual income increases at a constant inflation rate every year further assumptions for the analysis are made as follows anticipated operational earnings from the structure 2 usd day steel price 700 usd ton mean time to repair 1 day compound interest rate 5 per annum which remains invariant over the design life inflation rate 3 per annum which remains invariant over the design life table 2 and fig 5 show the outcomes of the cost effectiveness calculation from which the following evaluations can be made when applying a deterministic approach every design option is deemed safe because all working stresses are less than the yield limit of the material used the optimum design is the first option as it has the lowest material cost this evaluation involves no detailed consideration of cost effectiveness considering the design life 20 years and load occurrence period 10 s the acceptable limit of the failure probability is estimated at approximately 1 6 10 8 thus the ninth design option is deemed the optimum from a viewpoint of cost effectiveness based on the structural availability and the structural safety consequently we note from this example that the structural availability is capable of providing more useful information on cost effectiveness for structural design 4 example of longitudinal stiffener case 4 1 outline as another exemplary application of the proposed approach to ship structural design a typical longitudinal stiffener is considered the subject vessel is a conventional oil tanker detailed information is presented in table 3 and fig 6 design conditions assumed for the calculation are as follows the conditions are basically in line with the design bases defined in iacs international association of classification societies csr common structural rules for double hull oil tankers design life a nominal design life is 25 years external environment the ship operates in the north atlantic wave environment for its entire design life for the long term prediction of random waves a wave scatter diagram for the north atlantic iacs 2001 is considered internal environment the specific gravity of cargo and the corrosion addition are identical to those included in the rules loading conditions two loading conditions are considered full loading and normal ballasting periods under the full loading and normal ballasting conditions represent 60 and 40 of the design life respectively wave spectrum the two parameter pierson moskowitz spectrum is considered inspection periodic inspections or surveys are not considered 4 2 limit state equation limit state equations for the local stiffener s yielding failure mode are presented in equations 36 and 37 and are developed by recomposing the scantling formulas of iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the basic concept is that the structural capability against loads is not to be less than the actual working load in the equations both the capability and working load are described through a nominal stress term 36 z r l σ y i e l d σ w o r k i n g 37 σ w o r k i n g p w k s t a t p w k d y n s ℓ 2 f b e n d z s t i f f m w k s t a t c s c a l e m w

distribution types and parameters are determined by reviewing the relevant literature and instances that are considered appropriate the stochastic modelling of design variables is summarized in table 5 a direct load analysis is conducted for the dynamic loads p wk dyn and m wk dyn from the results of the conventional ship motion analysis that uses the 3d linear potential code and the long term prediction based on the weibull distribution probabilistic features of the dynamic loads are determined as shown in tables 6 and 7 this example considers a dozen discrete wave heading angles every 30 and the uniformly distributed occurrence probabilities of each angle hydro models used for the direct load analysis are shown in fig 7 4 4 calculation of failure probability considering that the dynamic loads bending moment and local pressure are coupled for a certain loading condition and wave heading angle it is necessary to calculate the individual failure probability corresponding to not only each possible loading condition but also each possible wave heading angle thus the final probability of failure is determined by summing all of the calculated probabilities as presented in equation 38 38 p f i 1 n l c r l c i j 1 n h a r a n g l e j p f i j n lc is the total number of loading conditions and n ha is the total number of wave heading angles r lc i and r angle j are the fractions of each loading condition and heading angle considered respectively based on the design condition defined in section 4 1 the failure probability of equation 38 is specified as shown in equations 39 41 the ratios of the two loading conditions r full and r ballast are set as 0 60 and 0 40 respectively 39 p f r f u l l p f f u l l r b a l l a s t p f b a l l a s t 40 p f f u l l a n g

in this study the first order reliability method based on the rosenblatt transformation is applied using a commercial reliability program i e strurel the calculation results of failure probability are summarized in table 8 42 p f 0 60 7 11 10 12 0 40 9 29 10 17 4 266 10 12 4 5 failure rate and repair rate estimation the structural failure rate λ is estimated based on the failure probability from equation 8 it is necessary to define the total occurrence time of the sle n t which is equivalent to the total number of waves over a lifetime the design life is 25 years so t is approximately 8 0 108 s the average wave period over the lifetime is assumed to be 10 s accordingly n t is 8 107 times and the failure rate is 4 266 10 13 43 λ n t p f t 8 10 7 4 266 10 12 8 0 10 8 4 266 10 13 s 1 the typical time interval needed to completely replace a failed stiffener including preparation active repair warm up and logistic times is assumed to be approximately 30 days 2 592 106 s thus the repair rate μ is approximately 3 858 10 7 44 μ 1 m t t r 1 2 592 10 6 3 858 10 7 s 1 4 6 structural availability calculation based on the above structural failure and repair rates structural availability is given by equation 45 45 a t λ λ μ μ λ e λ μ t 9 9999889 10 1 99 999889 46 q t λ λ μ 1 e λ μ t 1 1057459 10 6 0 000111 from the structural availability value calculated the stiffener is deemed to almost fulfill its required function against the yielding failure throughout the ship s lifetime in this regard we conclude that the example design sufficiently resists the working stress in the elastic region of the material applied and thus its current design is acceptable this assessment is based on the probabilistic approach the minimum required net section modulus is 1317 98 cm3 according to iacs csr for double hull oil tankers the as built net section modulus of the stiffener is 1762 9 cm3 which is approximately 1 34 times larger than the rule requirement for this reason the current design is considered acceptable this assessment result is based on the deterministic approach in reality the yielding failure of longitudinal bottom stiffeners of oil tankers rarely occurs provided that the stiffeners are designed in compliance with relevant requirements as the example stiffener has a much larger section modulus than rule requirement and the current structural rules have been established based on conservative safety margins the structural availability value which is found to be quite high is deemed reasonable 4 7 effects of failure probability changes on structural availability in this section the relationship between structural availability and failure probability is examined using the example data the trends of structural availability are shown in table 9 and fig 8 the minimum design case corresponds to the stiffener with a net section modulus required by the rules 1317 98 cm3 generally speaking minimum rule requirements are the absolute criteria to be fulfilled for design approval both the actual design case and minimum design case ensure sufficient availability of close to 100 when a design case is not less than the minimum rule requirement the graph shows that the structural availability improvement is not significant regardless of how large the design is in contrast when the design falls below rule requirement there is a steep decline in structural availability considering this trend the current rule requirement is deemed reasonable from the viewpoint of structural availability 4 8 cost benefit analysis based on structural availability this section describes a simple cost benefit analysis based on structural availability values the basic data used are identical to those shown in section 4 1 among the five life cycle cost and earning models proposed by turan et al 2009 the material cost and the operational earning are only considered in this example for the sake of simplicity operational earning per year can be viewed as the product of ship s productivity and freight rate turan et al 2009 47 r 24 s l d d w u d w t f r here r is the revenue per annum s is the average operating speed per hour ld is the number of loaded days at sea per annum dwu is deadweight utilization dwt is the deadweight of ship and fr is the freight rate per ton mile of cargo transported for reasonable cost benefit evaluation this example considers the present worth method based on a constant interest rate that is total operational earning for ship s lifetime 25 years determined by summing up all annual revenue is converted to its present value the annual revenue is assumed to increase at a constant inflation rate every year additional assumptions adopted are as follows s 14 0 knots ld 256 days year i e 70 of an year dwu 0 8 and fr 0 002 usd ton mile dwt is 105 000 tonnes for the design case complying with the rule minimum requirement the displacement of ship is kept constant thus dwt decreases when the weight of stiffeners increases in order to keep the displacement invariant conversely stiffener downsizing brings about dwt rise compound interest rate is 8 per annum and kept constant for 25 years inflation rate is 3 per annum and kept constant for 25 years except for the hull structure all systems are fully available except for the local stiffener all structural elements are fully available only the yielding failure mode is considered with other failure modes neglected the daily revenue calculated from the results in table 10 is approximately 39 000 usd over which is similar to the average daily earnings of aframax tankers in 2015 such as 37 954 usd unctad 2016 there are numerous stiffeners in the ship similar to those of the example case a rough enumeration of similar stiffeners shows that there are approximately 9660 ea all of the examined stiffeners are assumed to have similar dimensions and availability levels the material cost estimation is based on the stiffener sectional area and a steel density of 7 86 g cm3 the stiffener area change is assumed proportional to the section modulus to a power of 2 3 related maintenance costs are not considered because those are typically much lower than material costs for construction average steel cost for ship construction is assumed as 780 usd ton based on the data of meps world steel price in the asian region during 2014 for a simple cost benefit analysis variations in total lifetime earnings and stiffener material costs resulting from the application of several design modifications are investigated the relevant results are shown in table 10 in this analysis the failure probability is reduced by approximately 10 times by enlarging the stiffener s dimension the results show that the more reinforced the stiffeners are the lower the failure probability and the higher the degree of structural availability stiffener material costs and total earnings increase with the degree of reinforcement in fig 9 material costs increase uniformly with failure probability decline the total earnings increase however slows down considerably from the design case with a failure probability of 10 7 for the earning to cost ratio the cost effectiveness reaches a maximum value at a failure probability of 10 7 and then drops as the stiffener size increases because the degree of total earning growth is very small see fig 10 thus the design case with a failure probability of 10 7 could exhibit optimal cost effectiveness approximately 46 721 whereas the minimum rule requirement causes a level of cost effectiveness approximately 45 020 that is slightly less than the optimum accordingly the current rule requirement is deemed reasonable from a cost effectiveness perspective in addition to further understand the cost effectiveness of the example case the marginal cost and benefit are examined the results on the eight design cases are summarized in table 11 and in figs 11 and 12 assumptions and definitions for the marginal cost benefit analysis are listed as follows the minimum design case forms the basis for the comparison of costs and benefits thus the additional cost and benefit of the minimum design case are valued at zero δc i additional steel costs due to design modifications for the i th design case relative to the steel cost of the minimum design case δs i loss of earnings estimated for the i th design case relative to the maximum total earnings based on 100 availability δb i additional economic benefit for the i th design case which is equivalent to the decrement of the earning loss relative to the loss of the minimum design case 48 δ b i δ s 1 δ s i δb i δc i net benefit ratio which is the additional benefit divided by the additional cost in fig 11 additional costs steadily increase with failure probability decline but additional benefit growth slows down rapidly from the third case the additional cost and benefit intersect at a failure probability of between 10 9 and 10 10 for the net benefit ratio the cost effectiveness drops sharply as the stiffener size increases and the minimum design case is expected to be the most effective see fig 12 design options involving a failure probability of less than 3 10 10 are considered not to be cost effective because their net benefit ratios are less than 1 0 thus the actual design case wherein the ratio is approximately 0 372 is deemed excessive the cost benefit analysis results contribute the following principles on local stiffener design a design case corresponding to the rule requirement is deemed the most optimized from a cost effectiveness perspective design cases with a failure probability of less than 3 10 10 are deemed not cost effective because the additional benefit is less than the additional steel cost consequently local stiffeners should be designed to reflect the rule requirements as much as possible and to present a probability of failure greater than 3 10 10 to prevent excessive design among the 12 designs in table 10 the 5th and 6th options which are identical to the 1st and 2nd options in table 11 are considered optimal because they satisfy the rule s minimum requirement and have the net benefit ratio larger than 1 0 hence it is recommended that the stiffener should have a net section modulus larger than 1320 cm3 and less than 1400 cm3 in summary the reinforcement of a structure e g enlarging the member dimensions usually increases a structure s strength and decreases its probability of failure however from rule requirements and failure probabilities alone it is not easy to determine the most cost effective levels of structural reinforcement whereas a design option of optimal cost effectiveness can be identified when using the approach to structural availability quantification proposed in this paper 5 conclusions this article proposes a new approach to quantifying the structural availability of the yield strength of a slender beam element the proposed method is mainly based on the structural failure model formulated with the poisson approximation and on structural reliability essential characteristics of the structural availability method are as follows a specific discrete event such as a single load event sle is defined to simplify long term situations under which a beam element is continuously and repeatedly affected by numerous random external loads over its lifetime based on probabilistic features of the sle and its sequential occurrences over a long period the bernoulli trial assumption and poisson approximation are made using statistical theory failure events of the element are modelled using the failure probability derived from a structural reliability analysis the structural availability is quantitatively derived from the exponential distribution based failure model the validity of the structural availability quantification method was proven through two examples a simple beam case and an actual ship design case structural availability values of the example cases were quantitatively calculated from the proposed method and brief cost benefit analyses based on structural availability were then performed to understand the applicability to risk based design finally the structural availability of a slender beam was quantified in terms of its yield strength and the related cost effectiveness was evaluated in a robust manner the proposed method is believed to contribute to risk based structural design by providing an optimized and cost effective design that meets safety requirements to apply the proposed structural availability method to design process of complex ship structures additional studies must be conducted in several areas structural repair modelling
