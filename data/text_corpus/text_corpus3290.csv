16450,the inactivation of algae by a combined process of peracetic acid and ultraviolet irradiation uv paa was systematically investigated by choosing microcystis aeruginosa as the reference algal species both hydroxyl ho and organic radicals ro contributed to the cell integrity loss and ro played the dominant roles the algae inactivation kinetics can be well fitted by the typical hom model showing that the inactivation kinetic curves followed a type of shoulder and exponential reduction the initial shoulder might be induced by the protection from the cell wall although the results from the cell morphology uv vis spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrices analysis suggested the cell lysis and the release of algal organic matter aom in the uv paa process the aom could be subsequently degraded humic acid 1 5 mg l inhibited the algal cell inactivation and the presence of chloride 0 5 2 mm had little effect on the cell viability reduction however the addition of bicarbonate 1 5 mm promoted cell integrity loss the uv paa process displayed better performance under the natural water background demonstrating the extensive potential for the practical application

xie et al 2013 have been widely used to promote algae removal due to their good performance on algae inactivation qi et al 2020 xie et al 2016 among them chlorination is a commonly used technique in waterworks for its low cost and wide acceptance qi et al 2016b nevertheless some undesired chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas would be generated fang et al 2010a xie et al 2013 therefore innovative inactivation strategies are needed to enhance algae removal peracetic acid paa an emerging disinfectant has been widely applied for water wastewater disinfection kitis 2004 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 paa has gained great concern as a substitution for chlorine based oxidants for several advantages including wide spectrum sterilization ability and reducing dbps formation ao et al 2020 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 for example xue et al found that no detectable levels of thms and haas were observed during paa disinfection in drinking water treatment demonstrating the potential use of paa as an alternative disinfectant xue et al 2017 additionally paa was also found to be able to control mussel growth in drinking water treatment plant intakes hurtado et al 2020 recently paa based advanced oxidation processes aops provide new strategies for bacteria inactivation which are more efficient than paa alone due to the formation of reactive radicals ao et al 2020 sun et al 2018 the combination of ultraviolet irradiation and paa uv paa is the most commonly reported technology for disinfection among the paa based aops ao et al 2020 the generated hydroxyl ho and organic radicals ro also act as disinfectants leading to better results from uv paa than uv irradiation and paa oxidation sun et al 2018 to our best knowledge the uv paa process has not been applied to inactivate algae due to the great similarity between algal cell and bacterial cell the uv paa process might also embrace good performance in algae inactivation generally there are two disinfection mechanisms involved in the inactivation process namely diffusion into cell membranes and subsequent interference in cellular life and direct reaction with cell membranes walls farinelli et al 2021 jenkins et al 2020 the organic part of the peracid molecule benefits the adsorption diffusion of paa onto into cells and the ro might also be easier to attack the algal cells luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore high efficiency of algae inactivation in the uv paa process is proposed which needs further investigation in addition it is important to evaluate the cell integrity loss and the release of intracellular organic matter iom which can introduce algal toxins and dbps precursors into water qi et al 2016a xie et al 2013 the algae inactivation kinetics might be different for different oxidants fan et al 2016 huo et al 2015 li et al 2014 for example huo et al huo et al 2015 and fan et al fan et al 2016 reported that the delayed chick watson model well described the kinetics of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa lysis in the uv h2o2 and chlorination processes therefore it would be beneficial to investigate the kinetics of cell rupture caused by the uv paa process furthermore the influence of some operational factors and water matrices on algae inactivation should be determined to comprehensively evaluate the uv paa process overall the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performance and characteristics of algae inactivation in the uv paa process 2 to investigate the kinetics of algae inactivation 3 to study the effects of some operational conditions and water matrices m aeruginosa which is one of the most commonly seen algal species in freshwater was selected as the model species in this study liu et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cell preparation m aeruginosa collection no fachb 911 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china and cultured in sterilized bg 11 media as previously described wan et al 2019 algal cells at the stationary growth phase were separated from the suspensions by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min the precipitated cells were then washed with phosphate buffer pb 10 mm at ph 7 0 followed by another cycle of centrifugation and supernatant removal the algae stock solution was then prepared by suspending the separated cells with pb or natural water to achieve an initial concentration of around 1 3 106 cells ml which is in the concentration range in the surface water during algae bloom in china and is similar to the widely used concentration level used in other studies chen et al 2020 fan et al 2018 2 2 chemicals paa was prepared through the reaction between acetic acid and h2o2 using sulfuric acid as the catalyst according to previous studies wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 the molecule ratio of h2o2 versus paa is 0 84 in the prepared paa solution the detailed information of other chemicals and natural water are provided in the supporting information si texts s1 and s2 respectively 2 3 experimental setup and procedures the uv based inactivation experiments were conducted in a customized photoreactor equipped with a low pressure hg lamp gph 212t5l 4 heraeus germany at a wavelength of 254 nm fig s1 the lamp was turned on at least 15 min before reaction to achieve stable photons output the uv light intensity i0 was determined to be 9 5 10 7 einstein l 1 s 1 by a reported method rahn 2008 continuous agitation by a magnetic stirring cjj78 1 junzhu shanghai china was provided to guarantee that the reaction solution was well mixed the solution temperature was maintained at 25 1 c by a thermostat dc 0510 hannuo shanghai china during the reaction each run was initiated by spiking appropriate amounts of paa or h2o2 into the algae stock solution in the photoreactor samples were withdrawn periodically from the reactor and quenched immediately with excess sodium thiosulfate for further measurements except the residual paa concentration detection zhang et al 2020 all experiments were conducted in duplicate at least and the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods the optical density at 680 nm was read by a uv vis spectrophotometer u 3100 pc mapada china for the measurement of m aeruginosa cell concentration according to a previous research chen et al 2020 the algal cell integrity was evaluated using a millipore cell flow cytometer fcm guava easycyte 5 merck germany combined with sytox green nucleic acid stain as reported previously daly et al 2007 xie et al 2013 a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica german was used to observe the fluorescence signals of algal cells the algal cell bound mucilage was observed by clsm and measured using fcm based on the fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated lectins concanavalin a fitc con a fan et al 2016 tien et al 2005 the algal cell morphology functional groups and algal organic matter aom were characterized by a scanning electron microscope s 4800 hitachi japan sem a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ertex 70 bruker germany ftir and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan respectively the detailed descriptions were provided in text s3 2 5 kinetic modeling and statistical analysis the algal cell inactivation ratio was determined by calculating the natural logarithms ln of the ratio of the surviving cell to the initial cell number n n 0 the inactivation kinetics were fitted by a series of well validated inactivation models of disinfection including hom rational hom power law selleck and delayed chick watson model deprived from chick watson model text s4 these kinetic models were fitted to experimental data using the least squares method in origin 2017 statistical analysis was performed in microsoft excel and r www r project org data points below the sensitivity limit of the fcm were excluded from the modeling the modeling results were assessed by comparing the residual sum of squared errors sse and coefficient of determination r2 model errors were checked for normality using the shapiro wilk statistical test 3 result and discussion 3 1 algae inactivation in different processes 3 1 1 comparison of algae inactivation by uv paa h2o2 uv h2o2 and uv paa fig 1 a illustrates that 3 17 ln 95 79 inactivation of the algal cell was achieved by the uv paa process which was considerably higher than other processes including uv alone paa alone h2o2 alone and uv h2o2 uv alone and paa alone could inactivate the algal cell to some extent with the inactivation ratio being 0 31 ln and 0 27 ln respectively after reaction for 40 min uv irradiation could destroy the m aeruginosa cell via direct photo degradation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species causing cell lysis liu et al 2004 ou et al 2011 the disinfection performance of paa is expected to result from its small molecular structure and high oxidation power e0 paa 1 0 1 7 v ao et al 2020 based on the findings from bacteria paa can permeate through the cell membrane of micro organisms by passive diffusion and oxidize sensitive sulfhydryl sh and sulfur bonds s s in proteins and enzymes farinelli et al 2021 compared with bacteria the low algae inactivation efficiency by paa might be due to that the algal cell whose size is generally bigger than the bacterial cell contains protective cell wall you et al 2021 to make clear the role of the co existing h2o2 in the paa solution on algae inactivation the inactivation of algae by h2o2 alone was also evaluated the result shown in fig 1a indicates that h2o2 alone played little to no role in algae inactivation which was consistent with a previous report farinelli et al 2021 suggesting that the small inactivation of algae in paa solution without uv irradiation should be due to paa rather than the co existing h2o2 additionally the much lower inactivation efficiency of algae in the uv h2o2 process 0 33 ln inactivation in 25 min than that in the uv paa process 3 17 ln inactivation in 25 min means that the good inactivation of algae in the uv paa process should be due to the paa rather than the co existing h2o2 as shown in fig s2 with the same total oxidant concentration the inactivation ratio in the uv h2o2 184 μm h2o2 process 0 72 ln inactivation in 25 min was still far lower than that in the uv paa process which further verified this conclusion as for the inactivation of micro organisms in the uv paa process the mechanisms would involve uv irradiation direct oxidation by paa and indirect oxidation by the formed reactive radicals sun et al 2018 nevertheless the formed reactive radicals would play the primary role in algae inactivation based on the comparative results of uv alone paa alone and uv paa process under irradiation ho and acetoxyl radical ch3c o o would be produced via the cleavage of o o bond in paa followed by yielding secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo and ch3oo table s2 wang et al 2019 zhang and huang 2020 to evaluate the roles of ho and ro in m aeruginosa cell inactivation experiments with extra tert butyl alcohol tba 1 mm or h2o2 84 420 μm were conducted fig s3 illustrates that extra addition of h2o2 enhanced the algae inactivation in the uv paa process the cell integrity loss at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 2 83 ln with an extra dose of 252 μm h2o2 spiking extra h2o2 would increase the concentration of ho as well as ch3c o oo via eq s19 table s2 indicating the important role of ho in this process zhang et al 2020 besides the addition of tba in excess could be used to assess the contribution of ho as tba can scavenge ho 6 0 108 m 1s 1 chen et al 2019 spiking excess tba could quench ho and also induced a hindered pathway for the generation of ch3c o oo from the reaction between paa and ho eq s19 in table s2 which led to underestimating the contribution of ro chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 1a although the concentration of ro would also be decreased when adding 1 mm tba high inactivation efficiency 2 52 ln inactivation in 25 min could be still achieved indicating the major roles of ro compared with uv alone the enhanced cell viability reduction in the uv h2o2 process suggested that ho also contributed to the inactivation of algae sun et al 2016 in the presence of excess tba the k obs decreased by 17 suggesting that both ho and ro contributed to algae inactivation with ro being dominant the k obs uv paa tba 8 89 10 9 min 6 is higher than the sum of the k obs uv 0 05 10 9 min 6 and k obs paa 0 03 10 9 min 6 by orders of magnitude further verifying the remarkable contribution of ro the calculation of k obs will be discussed later in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 kinetic model of algae inactivation to quantify the algal cell integrity loss we attempted to use five classical disinfection kinetic models text s4 to describe the algae inactivation kinetics fig s4 the modeling results together with shapiro wilk test statistics for all model errors were shown in table s3 the results show that the models including hom hom power law and delayed chick watson model well fitted the experimental data with the hom model eq 1 containing the highest r2 0 996 and the lowest sse value 0 22 1 ln n n 0 k c n t 6 k obs t 6 where ln n n 0 k μm n min 6 c μm k obs min 6 and t min represent inactivation ratio reaction rate constant paa concentration observed inactivation rate constant and contacting time respectively the hom model error statistics with the shapiro wilk test w 0 903 and the p value for sw test p 0 204 0 05 indicated the normality of the model residuals dunkin et al 2017 moreover fig 1b illustrates that the hom model predicted results of algae inactivation ratio could well fit the observed values under different processes except uv alone paa alone and h2o2 alone for all test conditions the good linear relationship r2 0 999 between the observed and the model predicted data demonstrates that the selected model described the algae inactivation kinetics well the k obs values obtained from the hom model fitting under different processes were provided in table 1 the k obs uv paa 10 74 10 9 min 6 was much higher than the k obs uv h2o2 0 62 10 9 min 6 suggesting that the inactivation efficiency of the m aeruginosa cell was remarkably promoted in the uv paa process which was consistent with bacteria inactivation formisano et al 2016 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 the synergetic effect referring to the enhanced algal cell lysis that was caused by the combination of uv and paa can be described by eq 2 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 zhang and huang 2020 2 k obs synergy k obs uv paa k obs uv k obs paa the result k obs synergy 10 66 10 9 min 6 indicates that the synergetic effects induced by radical generation made the dominant contribution to the cell integrity loss sun et al 2016 3 2 characterization of algae in the uv paa process 3 2 1 algal cell integrity as shown in fig 1a the kinetic curve of m aeruginosa cell rupture in the uv paa process displayed a type of shoulder exhibiting a sort of lag phase at the beginning and exponential reduction which agreed with other reports focusing on other oxidation processes fan et al 2016 huo et al 2015 li et al 2014 to better understand the algae inactivation in the uv paa process a clsm combined with sytox green nucleic acid stain was employed to identify the variation of algal cell integrity the confocal fluorescence images of the algal cells during the treatment also indicate that there was a lag phase at the beginning fig 2 in figs 2 and s11 the red green and yellow fluorescence represented chlorophyll a autofluorescence regarded as m aeruginosa cells nucleic acid staining by sytox used to identify cell lysis and the merged fluorescence green and red respectively fan et al 2016 at the beginning 0 5 min fig s11a b illustrates the strong intensity of chlorophyll a and weak intensity of sytox suggesting that algae maintained their cellular integrity the insignificant change of red fluorescence at 0 5 min fig 2 corresponded to the initial shoulder in the inactivation kinetic curve then more and more m aeruginosa cells appeared as yellow from 5 to 15 min from fig s11b d it can be found that time dependent enhanced green fluorescence overlapped well with the red fluorescence of chlorophyll a indicating that the gradually injured m aeruginosa cells allowed the sytox to stain with the nucleic acid at 15 25 min the algal cells turned from yellow to green fig 2 and the red fluorescence gradually faded and finally disappeared fig s11d f this might be due to the continuous lysis of algal cells and the degradation of chlorophyll a during the treatment fan et al 2016 which was consistent with the results of increased inactivation ratio in fig 1a meanwhile we evaluate the regrowth potential of the m aeruginosa cell treated by the uv paa process fig s12 the results suggested that the algal cell cannot repair the cellular impact led by the uv paa process indicating that the uv paa process was able to prevent the regrowth of m aeruginosa cells as reported the mechanism of the lag phase is possibly due to that the oxidative species initially react with the cell bound mucilage before destroying the algal cell membrane huo et al 2015 fan et al fan et al 2016 found that the protection from the mucilage slows down the chlorine oxidation and the thickness of the outer layer mucilage of the m aeruginosa colonies was determined to be around 27 2 6 2 μm using fitc con a stain fan et al 2016 tien et al 2005 we tried to figure out whether the existing lag phase in the uv paa process was led by the inhibition of algae inactivation from cell bound mucilage as expected the m aeruginosa cells which are documented to be mucilage producing cyanobacteria were surrounded by the mucilage displaying the green fluorescences a color from fitc con a stain for mucilage in the confocal fluorescence images fig s13a tien et al 2005 however the green fluorescences almost disappeared after centrifugation fig s13b it means that centrifugation could remove the majority of cell bound mucilage as the surface adsorbed algal organic matter s aom on algal cells could be removed which was also found in a previous report qi et al 2016a furthermore flow cytometry was employed to quantify the changes of mucilage during centrifugation waite et al 1995 the results show that the ratio of the m aeruginosa cell with cell bound mucilage group decreased from 86 50 to 2 41 suggesting that centrifugation is effective in removing the mucilage fig s14 thus the lag phase might be caused by the protection from the cell wall in this study the cell wall protects the cell membrane from oxidative attack until enough damage accumulates on the phospholipid bilayer to cause cell lysis chen et al 2021 moreover the hom model also described the initial shoulder well for the m m 6 is greater than unity huang s group observed that the bacteria inactivation data to be linear when log survival was plotted versus t3 and t2 suggesting a similar initial shoulder in the bacteria inactivation process sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 thus the inactivation of algal cell is suggested to be similar to the bacteria inactivation in which the barriers made up of the cell wall and phospholipid bilayer hamper the inactivation process chen et al 2021 it should be mentioned that the m in the hom model describing the inactivation kinetic of algae is higher than that of bacteria which might be led by the algal cell wall and its bigger cell size you et al 2021 3 2 2 algal cell morphology the morphological images of the m aeruginosa cells imply the serious cells damage in the uv paa process fig s15 before treatment the algal cells mainly existed as dispersed cells with intact membranes that was also reported by zhang et al zhang et al 2007 similar to the results obtained in fig 2 the algal cells maintained their cellular integrity in the initial 5 min with the contacting time extending to 15 min the cell wall wrinkled with only a few areas displaying partial damage which is in accordance with the lag phase shown in fig 1 then the m aeruginosa cells were severely twisted and parts of cells even lost their cellular integrity with visible holes when the reaction time was expanded to 25 min 3 2 3 release of aom to characterize the released aom during the treatment the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eem spectra of filtered solution were studied using the fluorescence regional integration fri method text s5 fig s16a shows that the eem spectra of the initial solution contained a fluorescence peak in region iv indicating the existence of dissolved microbial compounds chen et al 2003 however the eem spectra of the solution after 5 min in which the fluorescence intensity of region iv decreased were different from our previous findings in the uv chlorine process chen et al 2020 as reported the paa has high reactivity with sulfur moieties kim and huang 2021 wang et al 2021a and ro preferentially attack the electron rich sites e g nh2 group and aromatic ring wang et al 2020 2019 thus the substances with high organic nitrogen contents such as protein like organic matter in region iv might be quickly destroyed in the uv paa process the variation of fri values at this stage also verified the change of the protein like compounds the values of the region i ii and iv reduced by 9 4 and 12 9 respectively fig s16f on the other hand the eem spectra volumes of region iii and v increased by 4 5 and 69 8 respectively suggesting the transformation of high molecular weight protein like components to low molecular weight humic acid like and fluvic acid like matters fang et al 2010b wan et al 2019 with further prolonging the reaction time to 25 min the fluorescence intensity of region i ii iv and v remarkably increased fig s16f which declared the continuous release of aom due to the gradual loss of algal cell integrity liu et al 2018 xie et al 2013 it is worthy to mention that the eem spectra volumes of five regions reduced by 8 9 with prolonging reaction time from 25 to 40 min which would be attributed to the further degradation of the released aom wang et al 2021d 2016 additionally the uv vis spectra of algae solution were monitored as illustrated in fig s17 the absorbance in visible region decreased with prolonging reaction time to 60 min which might be attributed to the degradation of algal cells and chromophores e g chlorophyll a and carotenoids corresponding well to the serious cell damages fig s15 on the other hand the absorbance at wavelength below 240 nm continuously raised suggesting the release of aom which contains lots of unsaturated bonds chen et al 2020 it should be noted that the e2 e3 values elevated from 1 292 to 1 402 with expanding the reaction time from 25 to 60 min indicating the decrease of aromaticity and molecular weight of aom maizel and remucal 2017 which also verified the further degradation of the released aom in the uv paa process 3 3 effects of paa dose and water matrices on algae inactivation 3 3 1 effect of paa dose as depicted in fig 3 elevating the paa dose enhanced the algae integrity loss in the uv paa process for instance the algae inactivation ratio at 20 min gradually increased from 0 18 ln to 3 87 ln when the initial paa dose increased from 50 to 200 μm and the corresponding k obs of cell rupture gradually increased from 2 14 10 9 to 58 01 10 9 min 6 also we evaluated the paa decay at various doses during the treatment higher paa concentration induced more serious decomposition of paa over the same time fig s18 which is believed to generate more reactive radicals additionally the relationship between the k obs and the paa dose was investigated a linear relationship was observed r2 0 997 when plotting ln k obs versus ln paa 0 at different paa doses with a slope of 2 43 fig s19 then the parameter n was determined to be 2 43 as described in eq 1 the value of n 2 43 was less than m 6 in eq 1 indicating that contacting time is more important than paa dose to achieve a specified level of inactivation which can be attributed to the diffusion of paa into the algal cells gyürek and frinch 1998 sun et al 2018 this phenomenon was also observed in the study of huang s group focusing on the inactivation of bacteria in which a better disinfection strategy was applied by pre exposure of paa followed by uv paa process paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 followed this method we evaluated the performance of the m aeruginosa cell inactivation as illustrated in fig s20 the observed k obs of cell integrity loss nearly doubled from 10 74 10 9 to 22 44 10 9 min 6 with pre exposing the algal cells to paa for 3 min whereas the corresponding k obs decreased to 8 47 10 9 min 6 when the pre exposure time extended to 10 min which was likely due to the paa consumption during the pre exposure period reducing the paa concentration the results suggest that the suitable time for paa pre treatment could promote the inactivation rate in order to gain insight into the changes of typical functional groups of algal cells and aom caused by the uv paa process the ftir spectra of the m aeruginosa solution treated by the uv paa process with different paa doses were investigated fig s21 the spectral bands of the algal cells in the control sample were mainly located at 2800 3600 and 1000 1800 cm 1 which is in agreement with other reports xin et al 2019 2018 for example the stretching vibrations centered at 1080 cm 1 were related to p o which corresponds to the phospholipids and carbohydrates of nucleic acids mcfadden et al 2017 xin et al 2019 the detailed peak assignments were shown in table s4 similar to the bacteria inactivation by paa the intensity of the absorbance peaks decreased with elevating the paa dose suggesting that more peroxides caused more serious damage to the algal cells mcfadden et al 2017 these results also tell the changes in the chemical composition of the algae and aom and indicate that the uv paa process would mainly inactivate the algal cell by destroying the proteins lipids and nucleic acids functional groups ao et al 2020 farinelli et al 2021 3 3 2 effect of typical water matrices to evaluate the effect of water matrices on the inactivation of m aeruginosa in the uv paa process experiments with separately adding humic acid ha 0 5 mg l chloride cl 0 2 mm and bicarbonate hco3 0 5 mm were conducted fig 4 a shows that ha inhibited the algae inactivation which was similar to the inhibiting effects on contaminant degradation in the uv paa process chen et al 2019 the related k obs gradually decreased from 10 74 10 9 to 3 42 10 9 min 6 with the extra ha concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l which would be due to the following two reasons 1 ha absorbs uv photons inhibiting paa activation and uv induced algae inactivation wang et al 2021e 2 ha could scavenge both ho 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 and ro 5 76 104 l mg 1 s 1 chen et al 2019 fang et al 2014 the effect of cl on the inactivation of m aeruginosa cell was illustrated in fig 4b showing a small influence of cl at the selected concentration range 0 2 mm in this concentration range the corresponding k obs varied from 7 13 10 9 to 10 74 10 9 min 6 although the existing cl might react with ro eq s44 in table s2 which would reduce the formed ro in the system the generated reactive chlorine species cl cl2 also contain high reactivity towards the algal cells chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021c so the observed small impact of cl would be the result of the two contrary roles in the uv paa process as depicted in fig 4c the algae inactivation ratio at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 1 06 ln 1 24 ln and 1 34 ln with the existence of 1 2 and 5 mm hco3 respectively indicating that hco3 enhanced the inactivation efficiency of the uv paa process however the presence of hco3 inhibited the algae integrity loss in the uv h2o2 process fig s22 as the formed ho in the uv h2o2 would be transferred to co3 eqs s41 s42 in table s2 the result suggests that co3 contains lower reactivity towards the m aeruginosa cell compared with ho therefore the addition of hco3 is expected to reduce the contribution of ho to algae inactivation it is reported that hco3 hardly reacts with ro in the activated paa processes wang et al 2021b 2019 but co3 can fast react with paa to yield ro eq s43 in table s2 chen et al 2019 thus the addition of hco3 would transfer the formed ho to ro as ro were the dominant reactive species in the inactivation of algae the addition of hco3 accelerated the algal cell lysis additionally the little difference in algae inactivation efficiency between samples containing 2 mm and 5 mm hco3 might be because that all the generated ho were transformed for the two samples in the uv paa process furthermore the inactivation performance in natural water was evaluated to assess the potential of the uv paa process for practical application our previous work reported that the removal of algae was significantly reduced in natural water when applying the uv chlorine process to treat algae chen et al 2020 however as shown in fig 4d the uv paa process displayed better performance under real water background compared with the integrity loss in pb the inactivation ratio at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 3 20 ln and 2 76 ln in the east lake and yujia lake water respectively besides the k obs of the inactivation process in the east lake and yujia lake water were 35 21 10 9 and 32 59 10 9 min 6 respectively which were much higher than that in the pb 10 74 10 9 min 6 this might be ascribed to that the co existed bi carbonate in natural water table s1 could elevate the role of ro in destroying the integrity of algal cells fig 4c as the uv paa process performed much better in the inactivation of m aeruginosa cell in natural water this approach would possess extensive potential for practical application additionally the treatment of algae by the uv paa process can efficiently modify the negatively charged surface and neutralize the zeta potential fig s23 suggesting the possible combination with coagulation sedimentation process for algae removal xie et al 2013 4 conclusion in this work the uv paa process was applied for the efficient inactivation of algae by selecting m aeruginosa as the reference algae finding that the generated radicals including ho and ro played important roles and ro was dominant the paa diffusion also promoted the algae inactivation meanwhile the algae inactivation can be well described by some typical disinfection kinetic models and the hom model was the best which helps quantify the loss of cell integrity in the uv paa process the ftir spectra indicated that the uv paa process would mainly inactivate the algal cell by destroying the proteins lipids and nucleic acids functional groups the sem uv vis spectra and fluorescence eem results suggested the cell lysis and the simultaneous release of aom while the released aom could be further degraded by the uv paa process subsequently the effects of some operational conditions and water matrices were studied the inactivation efficiency increased with elevating the paa dose the presence of ha retarded the algae inactivation and cl had little effect while hco3 promoted the cell viability reduction better performance of algae inactivation in the uv paa process under real water background and the inhibition of algae regrowth suggested that the uv paa process would be an innovative approach for the removal of algae

16450,the inactivation of algae by a combined process of peracetic acid and ultraviolet irradiation uv paa was systematically investigated by choosing microcystis aeruginosa as the reference algal species both hydroxyl ho and organic radicals ro contributed to the cell integrity loss and ro played the dominant roles the algae inactivation kinetics can be well fitted by the typical hom model showing that the inactivation kinetic curves followed a type of shoulder and exponential reduction the initial shoulder might be induced by the protection from the cell wall although the results from the cell morphology uv vis spectra and fluorescence excitation emission matrices analysis suggested the cell lysis and the release of algal organic matter aom in the uv paa process the aom could be subsequently degraded humic acid 1 5 mg l inhibited the algal cell inactivation and the presence of chloride 0 5 2 mm had little effect on the cell viability reduction however the addition of bicarbonate 1 5 mm promoted cell integrity loss the uv paa process displayed better performance under the natural water background demonstrating the extensive potential for the practical application

xie et al 2013 have been widely used to promote algae removal due to their good performance on algae inactivation qi et al 2020 xie et al 2016 among them chlorination is a commonly used technique in waterworks for its low cost and wide acceptance qi et al 2016b nevertheless some undesired chlorinated disinfection byproducts dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas would be generated fang et al 2010a xie et al 2013 therefore innovative inactivation strategies are needed to enhance algae removal peracetic acid paa an emerging disinfectant has been widely applied for water wastewater disinfection kitis 2004 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 paa has gained great concern as a substitution for chlorine based oxidants for several advantages including wide spectrum sterilization ability and reducing dbps formation ao et al 2020 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 for example xue et al found that no detectable levels of thms and haas were observed during paa disinfection in drinking water treatment demonstrating the potential use of paa as an alternative disinfectant xue et al 2017 additionally paa was also found to be able to control mussel growth in drinking water treatment plant intakes hurtado et al 2020 recently paa based advanced oxidation processes aops provide new strategies for bacteria inactivation which are more efficient than paa alone due to the formation of reactive radicals ao et al 2020 sun et al 2018 the combination of ultraviolet irradiation and paa uv paa is the most commonly reported technology for disinfection among the paa based aops ao et al 2020 the generated hydroxyl ho and organic radicals ro also act as disinfectants leading to better results from uv paa than uv irradiation and paa oxidation sun et al 2018 to our best knowledge the uv paa process has not been applied to inactivate algae due to the great similarity between algal cell and bacterial cell the uv paa process might also embrace good performance in algae inactivation generally there are two disinfection mechanisms involved in the inactivation process namely diffusion into cell membranes and subsequent interference in cellular life and direct reaction with cell membranes walls farinelli et al 2021 jenkins et al 2020 the organic part of the peracid molecule benefits the adsorption diffusion of paa onto into cells and the ro might also be easier to attack the algal cells luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 zhang et al 2020 therefore high efficiency of algae inactivation in the uv paa process is proposed which needs further investigation in addition it is important to evaluate the cell integrity loss and the release of intracellular organic matter iom which can introduce algal toxins and dbps precursors into water qi et al 2016a xie et al 2013 the algae inactivation kinetics might be different for different oxidants fan et al 2016 huo et al 2015 li et al 2014 for example huo et al huo et al 2015 and fan et al fan et al 2016 reported that the delayed chick watson model well described the kinetics of microcystis aeruginosa m aeruginosa lysis in the uv h2o2 and chlorination processes therefore it would be beneficial to investigate the kinetics of cell rupture caused by the uv paa process furthermore the influence of some operational factors and water matrices on algae inactivation should be determined to comprehensively evaluate the uv paa process overall the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the performance and characteristics of algae inactivation in the uv paa process 2 to investigate the kinetics of algae inactivation 3 to study the effects of some operational conditions and water matrices m aeruginosa which is one of the most commonly seen algal species in freshwater was selected as the model species in this study liu et al 2018 2 materials and methods 2 1 algal cell preparation m aeruginosa collection no fachb 911 was obtained from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of science wuhan china and cultured in sterilized bg 11 media as previously described wan et al 2019 algal cells at the stationary growth phase were separated from the suspensions by centrifugation at 4500 rpm for 10 min the precipitated cells were then washed with phosphate buffer pb 10 mm at ph 7 0 followed by another cycle of centrifugation and supernatant removal the algae stock solution was then prepared by suspending the separated cells with pb or natural water to achieve an initial concentration of around 1 3 106 cells ml which is in the concentration range in the surface water during algae bloom in china and is similar to the widely used concentration level used in other studies chen et al 2020 fan et al 2018 2 2 chemicals paa was prepared through the reaction between acetic acid and h2o2 using sulfuric acid as the catalyst according to previous studies wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2008 the molecule ratio of h2o2 versus paa is 0 84 in the prepared paa solution the detailed information of other chemicals and natural water are provided in the supporting information si texts s1 and s2 respectively 2 3 experimental setup and procedures the uv based inactivation experiments were conducted in a customized photoreactor equipped with a low pressure hg lamp gph 212t5l 4 heraeus germany at a wavelength of 254 nm fig s1 the lamp was turned on at least 15 min before reaction to achieve stable photons output the uv light intensity i0 was determined to be 9 5 10 7 einstein l 1 s 1 by a reported method rahn 2008 continuous agitation by a magnetic stirring cjj78 1 junzhu shanghai china was provided to guarantee that the reaction solution was well mixed the solution temperature was maintained at 25 1 c by a thermostat dc 0510 hannuo shanghai china during the reaction each run was initiated by spiking appropriate amounts of paa or h2o2 into the algae stock solution in the photoreactor samples were withdrawn periodically from the reactor and quenched immediately with excess sodium thiosulfate for further measurements except the residual paa concentration detection zhang et al 2020 all experiments were conducted in duplicate at least and the error bars in the figures represent the standard deviations 2 4 analytical methods the optical density at 680 nm was read by a uv vis spectrophotometer u 3100 pc mapada china for the measurement of m aeruginosa cell concentration according to a previous research chen et al 2020 the algal cell integrity was evaluated using a millipore cell flow cytometer fcm guava easycyte 5 merck germany combined with sytox green nucleic acid stain as reported previously daly et al 2007 xie et al 2013 a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm tcs sp8 leica german was used to observe the fluorescence signals of algal cells the algal cell bound mucilage was observed by clsm and measured using fcm based on the fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated lectins concanavalin a fitc con a fan et al 2016 tien et al 2005 the algal cell morphology functional groups and algal organic matter aom were characterized by a scanning electron microscope s 4800 hitachi japan sem a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ertex 70 bruker germany ftir and a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4600 hitachi japan respectively the detailed descriptions were provided in text s3 2 5 kinetic modeling and statistical analysis the algal cell inactivation ratio was determined by calculating the natural logarithms ln of the ratio of the surviving cell to the initial cell number n n 0 the inactivation kinetics were fitted by a series of well validated inactivation models of disinfection including hom rational hom power law selleck and delayed chick watson model deprived from chick watson model text s4 these kinetic models were fitted to experimental data using the least squares method in origin 2017 statistical analysis was performed in microsoft excel and r www r project org data points below the sensitivity limit of the fcm were excluded from the modeling the modeling results were assessed by comparing the residual sum of squared errors sse and coefficient of determination r2 model errors were checked for normality using the shapiro wilk statistical test 3 result and discussion 3 1 algae inactivation in different processes 3 1 1 comparison of algae inactivation by uv paa h2o2 uv h2o2 and uv paa fig 1 a illustrates that 3 17 ln 95 79 inactivation of the algal cell was achieved by the uv paa process which was considerably higher than other processes including uv alone paa alone h2o2 alone and uv h2o2 uv alone and paa alone could inactivate the algal cell to some extent with the inactivation ratio being 0 31 ln and 0 27 ln respectively after reaction for 40 min uv irradiation could destroy the m aeruginosa cell via direct photo degradation and indirect oxidation by reactive oxygen species causing cell lysis liu et al 2004 ou et al 2011 the disinfection performance of paa is expected to result from its small molecular structure and high oxidation power e0 paa 1 0 1 7 v ao et al 2020 based on the findings from bacteria paa can permeate through the cell membrane of micro organisms by passive diffusion and oxidize sensitive sulfhydryl sh and sulfur bonds s s in proteins and enzymes farinelli et al 2021 compared with bacteria the low algae inactivation efficiency by paa might be due to that the algal cell whose size is generally bigger than the bacterial cell contains protective cell wall you et al 2021 to make clear the role of the co existing h2o2 in the paa solution on algae inactivation the inactivation of algae by h2o2 alone was also evaluated the result shown in fig 1a indicates that h2o2 alone played little to no role in algae inactivation which was consistent with a previous report farinelli et al 2021 suggesting that the small inactivation of algae in paa solution without uv irradiation should be due to paa rather than the co existing h2o2 additionally the much lower inactivation efficiency of algae in the uv h2o2 process 0 33 ln inactivation in 25 min than that in the uv paa process 3 17 ln inactivation in 25 min means that the good inactivation of algae in the uv paa process should be due to the paa rather than the co existing h2o2 as shown in fig s2 with the same total oxidant concentration the inactivation ratio in the uv h2o2 184 μm h2o2 process 0 72 ln inactivation in 25 min was still far lower than that in the uv paa process which further verified this conclusion as for the inactivation of micro organisms in the uv paa process the mechanisms would involve uv irradiation direct oxidation by paa and indirect oxidation by the formed reactive radicals sun et al 2018 nevertheless the formed reactive radicals would play the primary role in algae inactivation based on the comparative results of uv alone paa alone and uv paa process under irradiation ho and acetoxyl radical ch3c o o would be produced via the cleavage of o o bond in paa followed by yielding secondary radicals such as ch3c o oo and ch3oo table s2 wang et al 2019 zhang and huang 2020 to evaluate the roles of ho and ro in m aeruginosa cell inactivation experiments with extra tert butyl alcohol tba 1 mm or h2o2 84 420 μm were conducted fig s3 illustrates that extra addition of h2o2 enhanced the algae inactivation in the uv paa process the cell integrity loss at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 2 83 ln with an extra dose of 252 μm h2o2 spiking extra h2o2 would increase the concentration of ho as well as ch3c o oo via eq s19 table s2 indicating the important role of ho in this process zhang et al 2020 besides the addition of tba in excess could be used to assess the contribution of ho as tba can scavenge ho 6 0 108 m 1s 1 chen et al 2019 spiking excess tba could quench ho and also induced a hindered pathway for the generation of ch3c o oo from the reaction between paa and ho eq s19 in table s2 which led to underestimating the contribution of ro chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 1a although the concentration of ro would also be decreased when adding 1 mm tba high inactivation efficiency 2 52 ln inactivation in 25 min could be still achieved indicating the major roles of ro compared with uv alone the enhanced cell viability reduction in the uv h2o2 process suggested that ho also contributed to the inactivation of algae sun et al 2016 in the presence of excess tba the k obs decreased by 17 suggesting that both ho and ro contributed to algae inactivation with ro being dominant the k obs uv paa tba 8 89 10 9 min 6 is higher than the sum of the k obs uv 0 05 10 9 min 6 and k obs paa 0 03 10 9 min 6 by orders of magnitude further verifying the remarkable contribution of ro the calculation of k obs will be discussed later in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 kinetic model of algae inactivation to quantify the algal cell integrity loss we attempted to use five classical disinfection kinetic models text s4 to describe the algae inactivation kinetics fig s4 the modeling results together with shapiro wilk test statistics for all model errors were shown in table s3 the results show that the models including hom hom power law and delayed chick watson model well fitted the experimental data with the hom model eq 1 containing the highest r2 0 996 and the lowest sse value 0 22 1 ln n n 0 k c n t 6 k obs t 6 where ln n n 0 k μm n min 6 c μm k obs min 6 and t min represent inactivation ratio reaction rate constant paa concentration observed inactivation rate constant and contacting time respectively the hom model error statistics with the shapiro wilk test w 0 903 and the p value for sw test p 0 204 0 05 indicated the normality of the model residuals dunkin et al 2017 moreover fig 1b illustrates that the hom model predicted results of algae inactivation ratio could well fit the observed values under different processes except uv alone paa alone and h2o2 alone for all test conditions the good linear relationship r2 0 999 between the observed and the model predicted data demonstrates that the selected model described the algae inactivation kinetics well the k obs values obtained from the hom model fitting under different processes were provided in table 1 the k obs uv paa 10 74 10 9 min 6 was much higher than the k obs uv h2o2 0 62 10 9 min 6 suggesting that the inactivation efficiency of the m aeruginosa cell was remarkably promoted in the uv paa process which was consistent with bacteria inactivation formisano et al 2016 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 the synergetic effect referring to the enhanced algal cell lysis that was caused by the combination of uv and paa can be described by eq 2 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005 zhang and huang 2020 2 k obs synergy k obs uv paa k obs uv k obs paa the result k obs synergy 10 66 10 9 min 6 indicates that the synergetic effects induced by radical generation made the dominant contribution to the cell integrity loss sun et al 2016 3 2 characterization of algae in the uv paa process 3 2 1 algal cell integrity as shown in fig 1a the kinetic curve of m aeruginosa cell rupture in the uv paa process displayed a type of shoulder exhibiting a sort of lag phase at the beginning and exponential reduction which agreed with other reports focusing on other oxidation processes fan et al 2016 huo et al 2015 li et al 2014 to better understand the algae inactivation in the uv paa process a clsm combined with sytox green nucleic acid stain was employed to identify the variation of algal cell integrity the confocal fluorescence images of the algal cells during the treatment also indicate that there was a lag phase at the beginning fig 2 in figs 2 and s11 the red green and yellow fluorescence represented chlorophyll a autofluorescence regarded as m aeruginosa cells nucleic acid staining by sytox used to identify cell lysis and the merged fluorescence green and red respectively fan et al 2016 at the beginning 0 5 min fig s11a b illustrates the strong intensity of chlorophyll a and weak intensity of sytox suggesting that algae maintained their cellular integrity the insignificant change of red fluorescence at 0 5 min fig 2 corresponded to the initial shoulder in the inactivation kinetic curve then more and more m aeruginosa cells appeared as yellow from 5 to 15 min from fig s11b d it can be found that time dependent enhanced green fluorescence overlapped well with the red fluorescence of chlorophyll a indicating that the gradually injured m aeruginosa cells allowed the sytox to stain with the nucleic acid at 15 25 min the algal cells turned from yellow to green fig 2 and the red fluorescence gradually faded and finally disappeared fig s11d f this might be due to the continuous lysis of algal cells and the degradation of chlorophyll a during the treatment fan et al 2016 which was consistent with the results of increased inactivation ratio in fig 1a meanwhile we evaluate the regrowth potential of the m aeruginosa cell treated by the uv paa process fig s12 the results suggested that the algal cell cannot repair the cellular impact led by the uv paa process indicating that the uv paa process was able to prevent the regrowth of m aeruginosa cells as reported the mechanism of the lag phase is possibly due to that the oxidative species initially react with the cell bound mucilage before destroying the algal cell membrane huo et al 2015 fan et al fan et al 2016 found that the protection from the mucilage slows down the chlorine oxidation and the thickness of the outer layer mucilage of the m aeruginosa colonies was determined to be around 27 2 6 2 μm using fitc con a stain fan et al 2016 tien et al 2005 we tried to figure out whether the existing lag phase in the uv paa process was led by the inhibition of algae inactivation from cell bound mucilage as expected the m aeruginosa cells which are documented to be mucilage producing cyanobacteria were surrounded by the mucilage displaying the green fluorescences a color from fitc con a stain for mucilage in the confocal fluorescence images fig s13a tien et al 2005 however the green fluorescences almost disappeared after centrifugation fig s13b it means that centrifugation could remove the majority of cell bound mucilage as the surface adsorbed algal organic matter s aom on algal cells could be removed which was also found in a previous report qi et al 2016a furthermore flow cytometry was employed to quantify the changes of mucilage during centrifugation waite et al 1995 the results show that the ratio of the m aeruginosa cell with cell bound mucilage group decreased from 86 50 to 2 41 suggesting that centrifugation is effective in removing the mucilage fig s14 thus the lag phase might be caused by the protection from the cell wall in this study the cell wall protects the cell membrane from oxidative attack until enough damage accumulates on the phospholipid bilayer to cause cell lysis chen et al 2021 moreover the hom model also described the initial shoulder well for the m m 6 is greater than unity huang s group observed that the bacteria inactivation data to be linear when log survival was plotted versus t3 and t2 suggesting a similar initial shoulder in the bacteria inactivation process sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 thus the inactivation of algal cell is suggested to be similar to the bacteria inactivation in which the barriers made up of the cell wall and phospholipid bilayer hamper the inactivation process chen et al 2021 it should be mentioned that the m in the hom model describing the inactivation kinetic of algae is higher than that of bacteria which might be led by the algal cell wall and its bigger cell size you et al 2021 3 2 2 algal cell morphology the morphological images of the m aeruginosa cells imply the serious cells damage in the uv paa process fig s15 before treatment the algal cells mainly existed as dispersed cells with intact membranes that was also reported by zhang et al zhang et al 2007 similar to the results obtained in fig 2 the algal cells maintained their cellular integrity in the initial 5 min with the contacting time extending to 15 min the cell wall wrinkled with only a few areas displaying partial damage which is in accordance with the lag phase shown in fig 1 then the m aeruginosa cells were severely twisted and parts of cells even lost their cellular integrity with visible holes when the reaction time was expanded to 25 min 3 2 3 release of aom to characterize the released aom during the treatment the fluorescence excitation emission matrices eem spectra of filtered solution were studied using the fluorescence regional integration fri method text s5 fig s16a shows that the eem spectra of the initial solution contained a fluorescence peak in region iv indicating the existence of dissolved microbial compounds chen et al 2003 however the eem spectra of the solution after 5 min in which the fluorescence intensity of region iv decreased were different from our previous findings in the uv chlorine process chen et al 2020 as reported the paa has high reactivity with sulfur moieties kim and huang 2021 wang et al 2021a and ro preferentially attack the electron rich sites e g nh2 group and aromatic ring wang et al 2020 2019 thus the substances with high organic nitrogen contents such as protein like organic matter in region iv might be quickly destroyed in the uv paa process the variation of fri values at this stage also verified the change of the protein like compounds the values of the region i ii and iv reduced by 9 4 and 12 9 respectively fig s16f on the other hand the eem spectra volumes of region iii and v increased by 4 5 and 69 8 respectively suggesting the transformation of high molecular weight protein like components to low molecular weight humic acid like and fluvic acid like matters fang et al 2010b wan et al 2019 with further prolonging the reaction time to 25 min the fluorescence intensity of region i ii iv and v remarkably increased fig s16f which declared the continuous release of aom due to the gradual loss of algal cell integrity liu et al 2018 xie et al 2013 it is worthy to mention that the eem spectra volumes of five regions reduced by 8 9 with prolonging reaction time from 25 to 40 min which would be attributed to the further degradation of the released aom wang et al 2021d 2016 additionally the uv vis spectra of algae solution were monitored as illustrated in fig s17 the absorbance in visible region decreased with prolonging reaction time to 60 min which might be attributed to the degradation of algal cells and chromophores e g chlorophyll a and carotenoids corresponding well to the serious cell damages fig s15 on the other hand the absorbance at wavelength below 240 nm continuously raised suggesting the release of aom which contains lots of unsaturated bonds chen et al 2020 it should be noted that the e2 e3 values elevated from 1 292 to 1 402 with expanding the reaction time from 25 to 60 min indicating the decrease of aromaticity and molecular weight of aom maizel and remucal 2017 which also verified the further degradation of the released aom in the uv paa process 3 3 effects of paa dose and water matrices on algae inactivation 3 3 1 effect of paa dose as depicted in fig 3 elevating the paa dose enhanced the algae integrity loss in the uv paa process for instance the algae inactivation ratio at 20 min gradually increased from 0 18 ln to 3 87 ln when the initial paa dose increased from 50 to 200 μm and the corresponding k obs of cell rupture gradually increased from 2 14 10 9 to 58 01 10 9 min 6 also we evaluated the paa decay at various doses during the treatment higher paa concentration induced more serious decomposition of paa over the same time fig s18 which is believed to generate more reactive radicals additionally the relationship between the k obs and the paa dose was investigated a linear relationship was observed r2 0 997 when plotting ln k obs versus ln paa 0 at different paa doses with a slope of 2 43 fig s19 then the parameter n was determined to be 2 43 as described in eq 1 the value of n 2 43 was less than m 6 in eq 1 indicating that contacting time is more important than paa dose to achieve a specified level of inactivation which can be attributed to the diffusion of paa into the algal cells gyürek and frinch 1998 sun et al 2018 this phenomenon was also observed in the study of huang s group focusing on the inactivation of bacteria in which a better disinfection strategy was applied by pre exposure of paa followed by uv paa process paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 followed this method we evaluated the performance of the m aeruginosa cell inactivation as illustrated in fig s20 the observed k obs of cell integrity loss nearly doubled from 10 74 10 9 to 22 44 10 9 min 6 with pre exposing the algal cells to paa for 3 min whereas the corresponding k obs decreased to 8 47 10 9 min 6 when the pre exposure time extended to 10 min which was likely due to the paa consumption during the pre exposure period reducing the paa concentration the results suggest that the suitable time for paa pre treatment could promote the inactivation rate in order to gain insight into the changes of typical functional groups of algal cells and aom caused by the uv paa process the ftir spectra of the m aeruginosa solution treated by the uv paa process with different paa doses were investigated fig s21 the spectral bands of the algal cells in the control sample were mainly located at 2800 3600 and 1000 1800 cm 1 which is in agreement with other reports xin et al 2019 2018 for example the stretching vibrations centered at 1080 cm 1 were related to p o which corresponds to the phospholipids and carbohydrates of nucleic acids mcfadden et al 2017 xin et al 2019 the detailed peak assignments were shown in table s4 similar to the bacteria inactivation by paa the intensity of the absorbance peaks decreased with elevating the paa dose suggesting that more peroxides caused more serious damage to the algal cells mcfadden et al 2017 these results also tell the changes in the chemical composition of the algae and aom and indicate that the uv paa process would mainly inactivate the algal cell by destroying the proteins lipids and nucleic acids functional groups ao et al 2020 farinelli et al 2021 3 3 2 effect of typical water matrices to evaluate the effect of water matrices on the inactivation of m aeruginosa in the uv paa process experiments with separately adding humic acid ha 0 5 mg l chloride cl 0 2 mm and bicarbonate hco3 0 5 mm were conducted fig 4 a shows that ha inhibited the algae inactivation which was similar to the inhibiting effects on contaminant degradation in the uv paa process chen et al 2019 the related k obs gradually decreased from 10 74 10 9 to 3 42 10 9 min 6 with the extra ha concentration increased from 0 to 5 mg l which would be due to the following two reasons 1 ha absorbs uv photons inhibiting paa activation and uv induced algae inactivation wang et al 2021e 2 ha could scavenge both ho 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 and ro 5 76 104 l mg 1 s 1 chen et al 2019 fang et al 2014 the effect of cl on the inactivation of m aeruginosa cell was illustrated in fig 4b showing a small influence of cl at the selected concentration range 0 2 mm in this concentration range the corresponding k obs varied from 7 13 10 9 to 10 74 10 9 min 6 although the existing cl might react with ro eq s44 in table s2 which would reduce the formed ro in the system the generated reactive chlorine species cl cl2 also contain high reactivity towards the algal cells chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021c so the observed small impact of cl would be the result of the two contrary roles in the uv paa process as depicted in fig 4c the algae inactivation ratio at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 1 06 ln 1 24 ln and 1 34 ln with the existence of 1 2 and 5 mm hco3 respectively indicating that hco3 enhanced the inactivation efficiency of the uv paa process however the presence of hco3 inhibited the algae integrity loss in the uv h2o2 process fig s22 as the formed ho in the uv h2o2 would be transferred to co3 eqs s41 s42 in table s2 the result suggests that co3 contains lower reactivity towards the m aeruginosa cell compared with ho therefore the addition of hco3 is expected to reduce the contribution of ho to algae inactivation it is reported that hco3 hardly reacts with ro in the activated paa processes wang et al 2021b 2019 but co3 can fast react with paa to yield ro eq s43 in table s2 chen et al 2019 thus the addition of hco3 would transfer the formed ho to ro as ro were the dominant reactive species in the inactivation of algae the addition of hco3 accelerated the algal cell lysis additionally the little difference in algae inactivation efficiency between samples containing 2 mm and 5 mm hco3 might be because that all the generated ho were transformed for the two samples in the uv paa process furthermore the inactivation performance in natural water was evaluated to assess the potential of the uv paa process for practical application our previous work reported that the removal of algae was significantly reduced in natural water when applying the uv chlorine process to treat algae chen et al 2020 however as shown in fig 4d the uv paa process displayed better performance under real water background compared with the integrity loss in pb the inactivation ratio at 20 min increased from 0 78 ln to 3 20 ln and 2 76 ln in the east lake and yujia lake water respectively besides the k obs of the inactivation process in the east lake and yujia lake water were 35 21 10 9 and 32 59 10 9 min 6 respectively which were much higher than that in the pb 10 74 10 9 min 6 this might be ascribed to that the co existed bi carbonate in natural water table s1 could elevate the role of ro in destroying the integrity of algal cells fig 4c as the uv paa process performed much better in the inactivation of m aeruginosa cell in natural water this approach would possess extensive potential for practical application additionally the treatment of algae by the uv paa process can efficiently modify the negatively charged surface and neutralize the zeta potential fig s23 suggesting the possible combination with coagulation sedimentation process for algae removal xie et al 2013 4 conclusion in this work the uv paa process was applied for the efficient inactivation of algae by selecting m aeruginosa as the reference algae finding that the generated radicals including ho and ro played important roles and ro was dominant the paa diffusion also promoted the algae inactivation meanwhile the algae inactivation can be well described by some typical disinfection kinetic models and the hom model was the best which helps quantify the loss of cell integrity in the uv paa process the ftir spectra indicated that the uv paa process would mainly inactivate the algal cell by destroying the proteins lipids and nucleic acids functional groups the sem uv vis spectra and fluorescence eem results suggested the cell lysis and the simultaneous release of aom while the released aom could be further degraded by the uv paa process subsequently the effects of some operational conditions and water matrices were studied the inactivation efficiency increased with elevating the paa dose the presence of ha retarded the algae inactivation and cl had little effect while hco3 promoted the cell viability reduction better performance of algae inactivation in the uv paa process under real water background and the inhibition of algae regrowth suggested that the uv paa process would be an innovative approach for the removal of algae

precipitation experiments and concluded that pasp performed better than pesa in terms of caso4 2h2o gypsum and baso4 barite scale inhibition whereas pesa performed superior in caco3 scale inhibition later peronno et al 2015 showed that poly acrylic acid co maleic acid and pasp can exhibit a high inhibition efficiency for caco3 scales even at low concentration 4 mg l using a fast controlled precipitation fcp method and provided experimental evidence for a significant alteration of the caco3 crystal morphology upon inhibitor addition more recently chhim et al 2020 tested the performance of pesa and pasp against a homopolymer of acrylic acid ha in a controlled laboratory set up reproducing industrial cooling circuits and reported that the adsorption of the polymer molecules on a growing caco3 crystal surface i suppresses the caco3 growth rate and ii shifts the precipitation mode from thermodynamically stable phases towards a metastable phase with pasp i e vaterite wedenig et al 2021 tested the performance of four pasp agents products from different manufacturers in addition to maleic and acrylic acid copolymers ma aa and a hydrolyzed polymaleic anhydride agent hpma on caco3 scale inhibition in the concentration range from 0 5 to 10 mg l using a compact experimental test procedure coupled to a computer based thermodynamic modeling approach the authors concluded that pasp based inhibitors performed superior among all inhibitors tested efficiency 70 100 retardation times several hours to days which provides a solid basis for potential application at distinct field

white brownish colored scale deposits sw2 sw2 i and sw4 reveal the highest fe and mn contents reflecting a calcite mineralogy with admixtures of fe mn hydr oxides 4 1 2 microstructural characterization scanning electron microscopy imaging of the scale deposits confirms calcite to be the main component in both tunnels scale deposits without pasp are dominated by idiomorphic trigonal

figs 3 7 the calcite formed in the presence of pasp typically shows skeletal shaped crystals often consisting of small stacked crystallites figs 3 and 5 according to sem images the aragonite content

drainage solutions all drainage solutions reveal ph values from 7 90 to 9 95 which are typical for local groundwater interacting with concrete boch et al 2015 the spc values range from 626 to 835 µs cm in aqueous solutions without pasp the ca2 concentrations vary from 15 to 92 mg l and alkalinity ranges from 161 to 395 mg l reported as hco3 in samples with pasp the ca2 69 94 mg l and hco3 concentrations 370 505 mg l are significantly higher the difference in the ca2 concentration between the original drainage solution without pasp and after pasp treatment varies from 14 up to 77 mg l i

however it remained relatively low i 0 01 mol kgw so that an inhibition effect on pasp performance is unlikely the mg2 contents vary from 12 to 50 mg l the drainage solutions exhibit molar mg2 ca2 ratios from 0 6 to 3 2 with the lower ratios seen in solutions with pasp k and na concentrations range from 5 to 42 mg l and 4 to 34 mg l so4 2 no3 and cl contents are strongly variable ranging from 8

1 to 32 8 mg l table 3 fig c 1 appendix calculated charge balance errors cbe 100 cat an cat an are consistently 5 saturation indices si in respect to calcite aragonite and vaterite reveal supersaturation of any caco3 polymorph in all solutions for example sicalcite values range from 0 7 to 1 9 ikaite caco3 6h2o and strontianite srco3 are under or supersaturated while amorphous caco3 acc is undersaturated or close to saturation in all solutions siacc 0 2 the calculated internal partial pressure of co2 pco2 in atm table 3 lay between 10 4 95 and 10 2 43 atm the re for the two drainages was calculated to be 89 up to 2000 which is indicative of prevailing laminar flow conditions throughout liu et al 2020 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of scale deposit formation caco3 formation in drainage systems is frequently caused by site specific fluid solid interactions being impacted by the dissolution of host rocks and local building materials mixing of solutions different in composition along the water flow path and or by co2 exchange between the drainage solution and the tunnel atmosphere the mechanisms and rate limiting factors causing caco3 formation in the tunnels spital and steinhaus are detailed in eichinger et al 2020a briefly in the tunnel spital caco3 scale formation is strongly related to the local geology since the calcareous host rocks provide high ca2 and mg2 concentrations to the drained solutions cf eichinger et al 2020a contrary in the tunnel steinhaus higher pco2 values 10 2 73 atm than the earth s average atmosphere 10 3 45 atm and water mixing at high flow rates 0 1 0 05 l s suggest that co2 degassing promoted scale deposit formation however we note that the flow regime is characterized by laminar flow as indicated by re 2000 which should prevent from extremely fast and excessive co2 outgassing from solution into the tunnel atmosphere and associated disruptions of gas liquid solid interface processes within the drainage system eichinger et al 2020a in some cases sw4 and sw5 elevated k and na concentrations and ph values up to 10 indicate significant leaching of concrete table 3 has stimulated caco3 formation by shifting dic towards co3 2 species and adding ca2 ions to the reactive solution baldermann et al 2019 evidence for intensified water concrete interaction is given by very low flow rates 0 03 0 05 l s at tunnel steinhaus the scale growth rate in the two tunnels is approximately 0 5 1 0 cm over a 6 months period however we note that the caco3 growth kinetics remain undetermined as the water flow is not continuous between regular cleaning works from summer 2019 until pasp addition in january 2020 two types of primary scale deposits precipitated at the bottom of the drainage pipes deposits sw1 and sw3 type 1 display calcite mineralogy forming compact and dense fabrics table 1 fig 8 deposits sw2 sw4 and sw5 type 2 contain aragonite admixtures figs 4b 6 a b and 7 a b and they also show evidence of microbial activity and appear more porous fig 2 the occurrence of aragonite in such scale deposits is explained by prior caco3 precipitation pcp which is favored at low flow rates 0 05 l s or less boch 2019 fairchild et al 2000 pcp rises the aqueous mg2 ca2 ratio of the drainage solution by ongoing caco3 removal which progressively poisons calcite precipitation and promotes aragonite formation molar mg2 ca2 1 huang and fairchild 2001 riechelmann et al 2014 baldermann et al 2020 at site sw2 which is characterized by a high flow rate 0 5 l s the higher concentration ratio of mg2 and so4 2 vs ca2 table 3 inhibited calcite and promoted aragonite formation busenberg and plummer 1985 riechelmann et al 2014 götschl et al 2019 in both cases aragonite formation yields in more porous microfabrics which explains the observed overall increase of less dense scale material consistence 5 2 effect of pasp on drainage solution composition the scale deposits with pasp sw1 i to sw5 i possess analogous formation mechanisms since tunnel sections and fluid rock interaction remained the same in the considered timeframe however the atmospheric conditions e g t humidity co2 content in the tunnel are variable to a certain degree due to the specific timing of the sampling campaigns which express in a seasonal variability of the elemental concentrations table 3 apart from this increased ca2 hco3 and doc concentrations of solutions sw1 i to sw5 i document that pasp chemically modifies the groundwater and inhibits caco3 formation fig 8 path 1 inhibition is caused by pasp covering the caco3 nuclei and crystallites as well as chelate complexation with ca2 ions wierzbicki et al 1994 wada et al 2001 wu and grant 2002 martinod et al 2009 kirboga and öner 2012 shen et al 2017 which result in prominently high sicalcite values up to 1 9 that is close to saturation with respect to acc wedenig et al 2021 see table 3 liu et al 2012 have experimentally shown that the effect of scaling inhibition decreases with increasing temperature which could affect the pasp performance at distinct tunnel sites however at the present study sites the annual variation in temperature amounts only to 5 c which is too low to have an anticipated effect on reducing the total caco3 nuclei and crystallites coverage or ca2 complexation by pasp moreover liu et al 2012 and chhim et al 2020 have demonstrated that the efficiencies of pasp and polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa strongly depend on the ca2 concentration in solution i e a decrease is seen at higher ca2 to inhibitor concentration ratios as for the present tunnel sites where seasonal variations in the ca2 concentration at constant pasp dosage in the drainage solution are observable table 3 changes in the ca2 to inhibitor concentration ratios could result in a temporal increase i e scale deposits formation is reduced or decrease i e scale deposits formation is favored of the pasp efficiency nevertheless the observed increase in the ca2 concentration the change in the consistence of the caco3 scale deposits and the significant reduction of the caco3 scale mass after pasp treatment demonstrate the high efficiency of pasp application up to 84 in this dynamic system which corroborates findings of liu et al 2012 and quan et al 2008 who proposed a high efficiency 80 of pasp at comparable dosage concentrations up to 12 and 15 mg l respectively inhibitor dosage can be followed and adjusted by pasp and doc analyses of the local groundwater to achieve a pasp concentration for optimal inhibitor performance solutions sw1 i and sw2 i indicate the highest flow rates and the lowest inhibitor concentrations while sw4 i and sw5 i show lowest flow rates and higher pasp concentrations 1 1 versus 32 8 mg l of pasp table 3 explaining the systematically higher sicalcite values of the latter solutions see table 3 notwithstanding documented seasonal variations in the hydrochemical conditions within the drainages the flow regime was always characterized by laminar flow at the two localities even though we cannot completely exclude minor temporal changes in water flow dynamics due to the restricted number of sampling campaigns we argue that fast co2 degassing has had no anticipated impact on the gas liquid solid interface processes moreover wedenig et al 2021 provided experimental evidence that the rates of co2 degassing and caco3 precipitation are independent from the pasp performance corroborating the changes in scale deposit mineralogy and material consistence described below however sw2 i and sw3 i behave different as the ca2 and hco3 concentrations remain nearly at the same level compared to the initial solutions without pasp table 3 in the case of sw3 i the selected inhibitor dosage of 8 ml h was too low to significantly tune the inhibition performance fig 2e f i e the height of the scale deposits was reduced only by half the measured concentrations of pasp in sw3 i and sw5 i were 10 4 and 20 2 mg l at similar flow rates table 3 in the case of sw2 i occurrences of small hollow microtubes indicate that bacterial activity has influenced the petrography of the scale deposit and the chemical composition of the solution fig 4 this is supported by the lower fe content and sicalcite in sw2 i cf sw2 and sw2 i in table 3 which is attributed to microbial activity of leptothrix ochracea cf hashimoto et al 2007 chan et al 2016 an elevated fe content in the scale deposit a red coloration and a modified consistence of sw2 i argue for the strong influence of fe oxidizing bacteria fig 4 which is expressed by poorly crystallized fe hydr oxides tuhela et al 1997 hashimoto et al 2007 5 3 influence of pasp on mineralogy crystal morphology and material consistence the addition of pasp can either suppress ongoing caco3 crystal growth or even change the material s consistence via the type of caco3 polymorph forming the scale deposits this is expressed by a strong decrease in volume of the tunnel scale deposits by 50 vol up to 90 vol where the primary calcite deposits were almost quantitatively removed after exposure to pasp containing drainage water for 10 months cf fig 2a b e f which demonstrates the high efficiency of pasp application aragonite containing precipitates are typically more porous and even loose compared to dense and compact calcite scale deposits fig 2 kirboga and öner 2012 kumar 2012 shen et al 2017 eichinger et al 2020a chemical analyses reveal that scale deposits without pasp barely differ in the elemental composition compared to scale deposits affected by pasp table 2 only sw2 i reveals much higher fe and mn concentrations and a lower ca content compared to sw2 which is related to increased activity of fe oxidizing bacteria the almost constant chemical composition is explained by pasp affecting the mineralogy of caco3 precipitates such as calcite vs aragonite and vaterite yang et al 2001 martinod et al 2009 niedermayr et al 2013 vaterite is the thermodynamically least stable anhydrous caco3 polymorph and recrystallizes rapidly toward thermodynamically stable calcite which explains the scarcity of vaterite in the scale deposits kitamura 2009 rodriguez navarro and benning 2013 jones 2017 konopacka łyskawa 2019 in solutions at low temperature 10 c vaterite has a prolonged metastability 20 h andreassen 2005 the occurrence of pasp results in an effective retardation of calcite crystal growth giving rise to the formation of aragonite and vaterite nuclei at high supersaturation state and further inhibits the transformation of vaterite to calcite e g han et al 2006 njegić džakula et al 2010 konopacka łyskawa 2019 the suppression of calcite crystal growth and the competitive formation of the other caco3 polymorphs is documented by the change in consistence and volume cf fig 2c d g j and the high abundance of aragonite at sampling sites sw2 sw4 and sw5 up to 12 52 wt table 1 thus the aragonite and vaterite contents increase upon pasp addition which corresponds well to the high si values of the drainage solutions e g sw1 i cf table 3 yang et al 2001 a lower mg2 ca2 ratio and high pasp concentration induce vaterite instead of calcite formation niedermayr et al 2013 this matches our observations on scale deposit sw1 i where the lowest mg2 ca2 ratio 0 6 a high dosage of pasp 10 ml h and the highest si values up to 2 of all three caco3 polymorphs table 3 favored vaterite to form despite the above we cannot fully exclude temporal ikaite precipitation cf boch et al 2015 from solutions sw1 i sw4 i and sw5 i siikaite 0 3 0 4 but its lower metastability compared to vaterite and aragonite as well as experimental evidence niedermayr et al 2013 argue against the formation of this mineral phase importantly the presence of pasp also leads to a modification of caco3 crystallization which significantly affects the morphologies and microfabric of the precipitates pasp typically yields in smaller calcite crystallites with smooth surfaces truncated edges skeletal and stacked shaped morphologies or rarely irregular shapes cf fig 8 path 2 aragonite crystals mostly retain fibrous crystal shapes but with consistently reduced average particle sizes whereas vaterite shows spherical crystal shapes fig 3c such crystal morphologies indicate precipitation at high rates which fits well with high si values of e g sw1 i table 3 jones et al 2005 jones 2017 yang et al 2011 in supersaturated solutions pasp is preferentially sorbed towards the active crystal growth direction inhibiting or retarding the further crystal growth thereby modifying the caco3 scale mineralogy crystal morphology and consistence liu et al 2012 the latter may deteriorate the initial compact and dense microfabric of caco3 scale deposit towards more porous aragonite microfabrics or even unconsolidated mushy material consistence fig 2 it is beyond the scope of the present paper to elucidate the apparent dissolution or transformation rates of primary calcite scale deposits upon pasp addition because of poor resolution in time and limited number of sampling sites in the two tunnel drainages however as a first order approximation we can calculate caco3 removal rates for two contrasting scenarios reflecting the dominant calcite type 1 vs calcite aragonite type 2 mineralogy of the scale deposits after pasp addition using an estimated volume of the primary calcite scale deposit in the two drainage systems of 1225 672 cm³ height 0 5 1 0 cm coverage in pipe 15 17 cm in width a scale density of 2 7 g cm³ and a volume decrease of 50 90 over a 10 months period for type 1 the caco3 removal rate is 3 3 to 13 6 g caco3 day averaging 7 6 3 1 g caco3 day or 2 8 1 1 kg caco3 year as for type 2 calcite scale reduction amounts to 60 85 which is equivalent to a caco3 removal rate of 4 0 to 12 8 g caco3 day averaging 7 9 1 9 g caco3 day or 2 9 0 7 kg caco3 year upscaling of caco3 scale reduction to the total tunnel lengths 2500 vs 1800 m yields a total caco3 loss of 7 2 1 8 t caco3 year and 5 2 1 3 t caco3 year for spital and steinhaus respectively 5 4 microbial effects on pasp and scale deposits the investigated scale deposits show clear evidence of microbial activity in the form of remnants of filamentous eps structures cf pedley 2014 jones 2017 it is not possible to relate eps to a species and to evaluate how this microbial activity could have been affected the scale deposits but it is well known that various microorganisms can have a significant influence of the developing mineralogy crystal shapes and precipitation rates pedley 2014 shiraishi et al 2019 westphal et al 2019 in scale deposits sw2 and sw2 i extracellular twisted ribbon like stalks fig 4b as well as prominent hollow microtubes fig 4c and d are indicative of neutrophilic fe oxidizing bacterial communities feob which are represented by gallionella ferruginea and leptothrix ochracea ehrenberg 1836 hallberg and ferris 2004 chan et al 2011 2016 fleming et al 2018 in the scale deposit sw2 without pasp gallionella ferruginea is detected whereas scale deposit sw2 i mainly contains leptothrix ochracea both feobs have different habitat requirements with respect to their metabolism gallionella ferruginea oxidizes fe ii and precipitates fe iii hydr oxides in environments poor in doc by using dic via chemolithoautotrophic processes while leptothrix ochracea is abundant in doc rich solutions assimilating doc in combination with dic by mixotrophic processes hallbeck and pedersen 1991 fleming et al 2014 2018 thus doc from pasp addition leads to the dominance of leptothrix ochracea over gallionella ferruginea fleming et al 2014 2018 as evidenced in the scale deposit sw2 i fig 4b vs fig 4c and d it is known that the stalks gallionella and sheaths leptothrix of such feobs are fe iii rich which is consistent with intergrowths and coatings of fe hydr oxides chan et al 2011 hashimoto et al 2007 eichinger et al 2020a for solutions sw2 and sw2 i sufficient amounts of dissolved bioavailable fe are constantly delivered to maintain feobs metabolism which in turn influences the water chemistry and results in the co precipitation of fe hydr oxides and caco3 phases this explains the red brownish coloration of the scale deposits and the high fe and low ca contents upon addition of pasp table 2 however leptothrix ochracea may reduce the inhibitor effect of pasp by consuming doc as inferred from solution sw2 i which contained the highest pasp content 12 ml h but the lowest concentration of pasp 1 1 mg l and doc 0 8 mg l this observation is supported by pasp analyses pattern fig d 1 appendix where the main peak of the red spectral curve of solution sw2 i is shifted towards lower wavelengths compared to solution sw1 i and the pasp standard this shift most likely arises from the bacterial degradation of the long chained pasp polymers in solution sw2 i stedmon and markager 2005 jalalvandi and shavandi 2018 as leptothrix ochracea progressively consumes doc provided by pasp accordingly almost constant ca2 and hco3 concentrations of solutions sw2 and sw2 i indicate a less efficient inhibition effect while in all other solutions the ca2 and hco3 concentrations increase significantly indicative of a highly efficient inhibition effect supressing the precipitation of caco3 the above relationships demonstrate that the understanding of site specific conditions for scale deposit formation is required to identify advanced prevention strategies at the field site and to optimize the applicability of inhibitors for water conditioning future studies can make use of the herein presented inhibition effects induced by pasp addition on caco3 scale formation in dynamic i e underground drainage systems ongoing research is required to evaluate the impact of specific on site conditions inhibitor type and dosage on the magnitude and rate of caco3 scale inhibition and green inhibitor efficiency 6 summary and conclusions the application of the green inhibitor polyaspartate pasp to reduce caco3 scale deposition and to alter the composition and micro structure of the unwanted precipitates was rated on site in two tunnel drainages main conclusions are that the addition of pasp i results in elevated ca2 hco3 and doc concentrations in solution and in sicalcite values close to saturation with acc ii effectively retards caco3 nucleation even at low pasp concentrations iii favours the formation of metastable vaterite and aragonite over calcite iv changes the caco3 scale consistence from compact to mushy material and v modifies bacterial dominance which may limit pasp scaling inhibition effects an advanced understanding of the formation mechanisms of unwanted caco3 scale deposits is required for an optimized use of proactive prevention strategies such as the application of the green inhibitor pasp an appropriate dosage can constitute a comparatively cost

16451,mineral scale deposits in water drainage and supply systems are a common and challenging issue especially by clogging the water flow the removal of such unwanted deposits is cost intensive arguing for case specific and sustainable prevention strategies in the present study a novel on site approach to prevent calcium carbonate caco3 scale formation was assessed in two road tunnel drainages application of the eco friendly green inhibitor polyaspartate pasp caused i a significant inhibition of caco3 precipitation ii a more porous or even unconsolidated consistence of the deposits and iii a shift from calcite to the metastable aragonite and vaterite polymorphs even relatively low pasp concentrations 1 33 mg l can significantly decrease caco3 scale deposition removing up to 7 t caco3 year at an efficiency up to 84 application of pasp for water conditioning should also consider case specific microbial activity effects where consumption of pasp e g by leptothrix

green inhibitors are increasingly used in water treatment applications as well as in industrial and man made environments to prevent the technical infrastructure from unwanted scale formation i e mineral precipitation owning to their high performance and economic and ecological benefits abdel aal and sawada 2003 li et al 2006 quan et al 2008 liu et al 2012 chhim et al 2020 for example liu et al 2012 have investigated the effects of polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa and polyaspartic acid pasp dosage ca2 concentration and temperature on scale inhibition using static and rapid controlled precipitation experiments and concluded that pasp performed better than pesa in terms of caso4 2h2o gypsum and baso4 barite scale inhibition whereas pesa performed superior in caco3 scale inhibition later peronno et al 2015 showed that poly acrylic acid co maleic acid and pasp can exhibit a high inhibition efficiency for caco3 scales even at low concentration 4 mg l using a fast controlled precipitation fcp method and provided experimental evidence for a significant alteration of the caco3 crystal morphology upon inhibitor addition more recently chhim et al 2020 tested the performance of pesa and pasp against a homopolymer of acrylic acid ha in a controlled laboratory set up reproducing industrial cooling circuits and reported that the adsorption of the polymer molecules on a growing caco3 crystal surface i suppresses the caco3 growth rate and ii shifts the precipitation mode from thermodynamically stable phases towards a metastable phase with pasp i e vaterite wedenig et

caco3 scale inhibition in the concentration range from 0 5 to 10 mg l using a compact experimental test procedure coupled to a computer based thermodynamic modeling approach the authors concluded that pasp based inhibitors performed superior among all inhibitors tested efficiency 70 100 retardation times several hours to days which provides a solid basis for potential application at distinct field

reddish brown in color respectively as an exception the scale deposit sw4 is brown while sw4 i is white all scale deposits without influence of pasp appear more compact while deposits affected by pasp

of calcite and a higher aragonite content except for sw3 i compared to pasp untreated deposits samples sw2 i sw4 i and sw5 i reveal elevated aragonite contents of 27 49 and 52 wt respectively see table 1 the latter two having about equal calcite contents 50 wt scale deposit sw1 i consists of small amounts of vaterite 3 wt and sw4 i shows minor dolomite 4 wt note that the detected small amounts of quartz sio2 and dolomite camg co3 2 are considered as detrital components figs b 1 to 5 appendix chemical analyses of the caco3 dominated precipitates reveal no significant differences between scale deposits sw1 sw5 and sw1 i sw5 i table 2 the measured ca contents in the scales vary between 29 2 and 39 3 wt corresponding to caco3 contents between 72 9 and 98 2 wt the prominently red colored sample sw2 i contains the lowest caco3 content 72 9 wt and sw3 shows the highest caco3 content 98 2 wt consistent with the almost pure calcite mineralogy the concentrations of k and na range from 50 to 503 mg kg and 107 to 1140 mg kg the concentrations of sr and ba lay between 810 and 3343 mg kg and 153 to 684 mg kg for the analyzed scale deposits the al and si concentrations are highly variable in the range from 385 to 16 240 mg kg and 62 to 6814 mg kg respectively the fe content differs strongly in the individual scale deposits from 18 to 67 726 mg kg up to 10 wt fe2o3 the reddish brown and white brownish colored scale deposits sw2 sw2 i and sw4 reveal the highest fe and mn contents reflecting a calcite mineralogy with admixtures of fe mn hydr oxides 4 1 2 microstructural characterization scanning electron microscopy imaging of the scale deposits confirms calcite to be the main component in both tunnels scale deposits without pasp are dominated by idiomorphic trigonal rhombohedral calcite crystals 50 to 300 µm in size scale deposit sw1 reveals compact and columnar shaped calcite crystals 300 µm cf fig 3 a b orthorhombic aragonite typically exhibits bundles of acicular to fascicular crystal shapes 70 to 120 µm size in the presence of pasp smaller crystal sizes of calcite 1 to 10 µm and aragonite 20 µm occur compared to the scale deposits without pasp e g figs 3 7 the calcite formed in the presence of pasp typically shows skeletal shaped crystals often consisting of small stacked crystallites figs 3 and 5 according to sem images the aragonite content

drainage solutions all drainage solutions reveal ph values from 7 90 to 9 95 which are typical for local groundwater interacting with concrete boch et al 2015 the spc values range from 626 to 835 µs cm in aqueous solutions without pasp the ca2 concentrations vary from 15 to 92 mg l and alkalinity ranges from 161 to 395 mg l reported as hco3 in samples with pasp the ca2 69 94 mg l and hco3 concentrations 370 505 mg l are significantly higher the difference in the ca2 concentration between the original drainage solution without pasp and after pasp treatment varies from 14 up to 77 mg l i

however it remained relatively low i 0 01 mol kgw so that an inhibition effect on pasp performance is unlikely the mg2 contents vary from 12 to 50 mg l the drainage solutions exhibit molar mg2 ca2 ratios from 0 6 to 3 2 with the lower ratios seen in solutions with pasp k and na concentrations range from 5 to 42 mg l and 4 to 34 mg l so4 2 no3 and cl contents are strongly variable ranging from 8

supersaturation of any caco3 polymorph in all solutions for example sicalcite values range from 0 7 to 1 9 ikaite caco3 6h2o and strontianite srco3 are under or supersaturated while amorphous caco3 acc is undersaturated or close to saturation in all solutions siacc 0 2 the calculated internal partial pressure of co2 pco2 in atm table 3 lay between 10 4 95 and 10 2 43 atm the re for the two drainages was calculated to be 89 up to 2000 which is indicative of prevailing laminar flow conditions throughout liu et al 2020 5 discussion 5 1 mechanisms of scale deposit formation caco3 formation in drainage systems is frequently caused by site specific fluid solid interactions being impacted by the dissolution of host rocks and local building materials mixing of solutions different in composition along the water flow path and or by co2 exchange between the drainage solution and the tunnel atmosphere the mechanisms and rate limiting factors causing caco3 formation in the tunnels spital and steinhaus are detailed in eichinger et al 2020a briefly in the tunnel spital caco3 scale formation is strongly related to the local geology since the calcareous host rocks provide high ca2 and mg2 concentrations to the drained solutions cf eichinger et al 2020a contrary in the tunnel steinhaus higher pco2 values 10 2 73 atm than the earth s average atmosphere 10 3 45 atm and water mixing at high flow rates 0 1 0 05 l s suggest that co2 degassing promoted scale deposit formation however we note that the flow regime is characterized by laminar flow as indicated by re 2000 which should prevent from extremely fast and excessive co2 outgassing from solution into the tunnel atmosphere and associated disruptions of gas liquid solid interface processes within the drainage system eichinger et al 2020a in some cases sw4 and sw5 elevated k and na concentrations and ph values up to 10 indicate significant leaching of concrete table 3 has stimulated caco3 formation by shifting dic towards co3 2 species and adding ca2 ions to the reactive solution baldermann et al 2019 evidence for intensified water concrete interaction is given by very low flow rates 0 03 0 05 l s at tunnel steinhaus the scale growth rate in the two tunnels is approximately 0 5 1 0 cm over a 6 months period however we note that the caco3 growth kinetics remain undetermined as the water flow is not continuous between regular cleaning works from summer 2019 until pasp addition in january 2020 two types of primary scale deposits precipitated at the bottom of the drainage pipes deposits sw1 and sw3 type 1 display calcite mineralogy forming compact and dense fabrics table 1 fig 8 deposits sw2 sw4 and sw5 type 2 contain aragonite admixtures figs 4b 6 a b and 7 a b and they also show evidence of microbial activity and appear more porous fig 2 the occurrence of aragonite in such scale deposits is explained by prior caco3 precipitation pcp which is favored at low flow rates 0 05 l s or less boch 2019 fairchild et al 2000 pcp rises the aqueous mg2 ca2 ratio of the drainage solution by ongoing caco3 removal which progressively poisons calcite precipitation and promotes aragonite formation molar mg2 ca2 1 huang and fairchild 2001 riechelmann et al 2014 baldermann et al 2020 at site sw2 which is characterized by a high flow rate 0 5 l s the higher concentration ratio of mg2 and so4 2 vs ca2 table 3 inhibited calcite and promoted aragonite formation busenberg and plummer 1985 riechelmann et al 2014 götschl et al 2019 in both cases aragonite formation yields in more porous microfabrics which explains the observed overall increase of less dense scale material consistence 5 2 effect of pasp on drainage solution composition the scale deposits with pasp sw1 i to sw5 i possess analogous formation mechanisms since tunnel sections and fluid rock interaction remained the same in the considered timeframe however the atmospheric conditions e g t humidity co2 content in the tunnel are variable to a certain degree due to the specific timing of the sampling campaigns which express in a seasonal variability of the elemental concentrations table 3 apart from this increased ca2 hco3 and doc concentrations of solutions sw1 i to sw5 i document that pasp chemically modifies the groundwater and inhibits caco3 formation fig 8 path 1 inhibition is caused by pasp covering the caco3 nuclei and crystallites as well as chelate complexation with ca2 ions wierzbicki et al 1994 wada et al 2001 wu and grant 2002 martinod et al 2009 kirboga and öner 2012 shen et al 2017 which result in prominently high sicalcite values up to 1 9 that is close to saturation with respect to acc wedenig et al 2021 see table 3 liu et al 2012 have experimentally shown that the effect of scaling inhibition decreases with increasing temperature which could affect the pasp performance at distinct tunnel sites however at the present study sites the annual variation in temperature amounts only to 5 c which is too low to have an anticipated effect on reducing the total caco3 nuclei and crystallites coverage or ca2 complexation by pasp moreover liu et al 2012 and chhim et al 2020 have demonstrated that the efficiencies of pasp and polyepoxysuccinic acid pesa strongly depend on the ca2 concentration in solution i e a decrease is seen at higher ca2 to inhibitor concentration ratios as for the present tunnel sites where seasonal variations in the ca2 concentration at constant pasp dosage in the drainage solution are observable table 3 changes in the ca2 to inhibitor concentration ratios could result in a temporal increase i e scale deposits formation is reduced or decrease i e scale deposits formation is favored of the pasp efficiency nevertheless the observed increase in the ca2 concentration the change in the consistence of the caco3 scale deposits and the significant reduction of the caco3 scale mass after pasp treatment demonstrate the high efficiency of pasp application up to 84 in this dynamic system which corroborates findings of liu et al 2012 and quan et al 2008 who proposed a high efficiency 80 of pasp at comparable dosage concentrations up to 12 and 15 mg l respectively inhibitor dosage can be followed and adjusted by pasp and doc analyses of the local groundwater to achieve a pasp concentration for optimal inhibitor performance solutions sw1 i and sw2 i indicate the highest flow rates and the lowest inhibitor concentrations while sw4 i and sw5 i show lowest flow rates and higher pasp concentrations 1 1 versus 32 8 mg l of pasp table 3 explaining the systematically higher sicalcite values of the latter solutions see table 3 notwithstanding documented seasonal variations in the hydrochemical conditions within the drainages the flow regime was always characterized by laminar flow at the two localities even though we cannot completely exclude minor temporal changes in water flow dynamics due to the restricted number of sampling campaigns we argue that fast co2 degassing has had no anticipated impact on the gas liquid solid interface processes moreover wedenig et al 2021 provided experimental evidence that the rates of co2 degassing and caco3 precipitation are independent from the pasp performance corroborating the changes in scale deposit mineralogy and material consistence described below however sw2 i and sw3 i behave different as the ca2 and hco3 concentrations remain nearly at the same level compared to the initial solutions without pasp table 3 in the case of sw3 i the selected inhibitor dosage of 8 ml h was too low to significantly tune the inhibition performance fig 2e f i e the height of the scale deposits was reduced only by half the measured concentrations of pasp in sw3 i and sw5 i were 10 4 and 20 2 mg l at similar flow rates table 3 in the case of sw2 i occurrences of small hollow microtubes indicate that bacterial activity has influenced the petrography of the scale deposit and the chemical composition of the solution fig 4 this is supported by the lower fe content and sicalcite in sw2 i cf sw2 and sw2 i in table 3 which is attributed to microbial activity of leptothrix ochracea cf hashimoto et al 2007 chan et al 2016 an elevated fe content in the scale deposit a red coloration and a modified consistence of sw2 i argue for the strong influence of fe oxidizing bacteria fig 4 which is expressed by poorly crystallized fe hydr oxides tuhela et al 1997 hashimoto et al 2007 5 3 influence of pasp on mineralogy crystal morphology and material consistence the addition of pasp can either suppress ongoing caco3 crystal growth or even change the material s consistence via the type of caco3 polymorph forming the scale deposits this is expressed by a strong decrease in volume of the tunnel scale deposits by 50 vol up to 90 vol where the primary calcite deposits were almost quantitatively removed after exposure to pasp containing drainage water for 10 months cf fig 2a b e f which demonstrates the high efficiency of pasp application aragonite containing precipitates are typically more porous and even loose compared to dense and compact calcite scale deposits fig 2 kirboga and öner 2012 kumar 2012 shen et al 2017 eichinger et al 2020a chemical analyses reveal that scale deposits without pasp barely differ in the elemental composition compared to scale deposits affected by pasp table 2 only sw2 i reveals much higher fe and mn concentrations and a lower ca content compared to sw2 which is related to increased activity of fe oxidizing bacteria the almost constant chemical composition is explained by pasp affecting the mineralogy of caco3 precipitates such as calcite vs aragonite and vaterite yang et al 2001 martinod et al 2009 niedermayr et al 2013 vaterite is the thermodynamically least stable anhydrous caco3 polymorph and recrystallizes rapidly toward thermodynamically stable calcite which explains the scarcity of vaterite in the scale deposits kitamura 2009 rodriguez navarro and benning 2013 jones 2017 konopacka łyskawa 2019 in solutions at low temperature 10 c vaterite has a prolonged metastability 20 h andreassen 2005 the occurrence of pasp results in an effective retardation of calcite crystal growth giving rise to the formation of aragonite and vaterite nuclei at high supersaturation state and further inhibits the transformation of vaterite to calcite e g han et al 2006 njegić džakula et al 2010 konopacka łyskawa 2019 the suppression of calcite crystal growth and the competitive formation of the other caco3 polymorphs is documented by the change in consistence and volume cf fig 2c d g j and the high abundance of aragonite at sampling sites sw2 sw4 and sw5 up to 12 52 wt table 1 thus the aragonite and vaterite contents increase upon pasp addition which corresponds well to the high si values of the drainage solutions e g sw1 i cf table 3 yang et al 2001 a lower mg2 ca2 ratio and high pasp concentration induce vaterite instead of calcite formation niedermayr et al 2013 this matches our observations on scale deposit sw1 i where the lowest mg2 ca2 ratio 0 6 a high dosage of pasp 10 ml h and the highest si values up to 2 of all three caco3 polymorphs table 3 favored vaterite to form despite the above we cannot fully exclude temporal ikaite precipitation cf boch et al 2015 from solutions sw1 i sw4 i and sw5 i siikaite 0 3 0 4 but its lower metastability compared to vaterite and aragonite as well as experimental evidence niedermayr et al 2013 argue against the formation of this mineral phase importantly the presence of pasp also leads to a modification of caco3 crystallization which significantly affects the morphologies and microfabric of the precipitates pasp typically yields in smaller calcite crystallites with smooth surfaces truncated edges skeletal and stacked shaped morphologies or rarely irregular shapes cf fig 8 path 2 aragonite crystals mostly retain fibrous crystal shapes but with consistently reduced average particle sizes whereas vaterite shows spherical crystal shapes fig 3c such crystal morphologies indicate precipitation at high rates which fits well with high si values of e g sw1 i table 3 jones et al 2005 jones 2017 yang et al 2011 in supersaturated solutions pasp is preferentially sorbed towards the active crystal growth direction inhibiting or retarding the further crystal growth thereby modifying the caco3 scale mineralogy crystal morphology and consistence liu et al 2012 the latter may deteriorate the initial compact and dense microfabric of caco3 scale deposit towards more porous aragonite microfabrics or even unconsolidated mushy material consistence fig 2 it is beyond the scope of the present paper to elucidate the apparent dissolution or transformation rates of primary calcite scale deposits upon pasp addition because of poor resolution in time and limited number of sampling sites in the two tunnel drainages however as a first order approximation we can calculate caco3 removal rates for two contrasting scenarios reflecting the dominant calcite type 1 vs calcite aragonite type 2 mineralogy of the scale deposits after pasp addition using an estimated volume of the primary calcite scale deposit in the two drainage systems of 1225 672 cm³ height 0 5 1 0 cm coverage in pipe 15 17 cm in width a scale density of 2 7 g cm³ and a volume decrease of 50 90 over a 10 months period for type 1 the caco3 removal rate is 3 3 to 13 6 g caco3 day averaging 7 6 3 1 g caco3 day or 2 8 1 1 kg caco3 year as for type 2 calcite scale reduction amounts to 60 85 which is equivalent to a caco3 removal rate of 4 0 to 12 8 g caco3 day averaging 7 9 1 9 g caco3 day or 2 9 0 7 kg caco3 year upscaling of caco3 scale reduction to the total tunnel lengths 2500 vs 1800 m yields a total caco3 loss of 7 2 1 8 t caco3 year and 5 2 1 3 t caco3 year for spital and steinhaus respectively 5 4 microbial effects on pasp and scale deposits the investigated scale deposits show clear evidence of microbial activity in the form of remnants of filamentous eps structures cf pedley 2014 jones 2017 it is not possible to relate eps to a species and to evaluate how this microbial activity could have been affected the scale deposits but it is well known that various microorganisms can have a significant influence of the developing mineralogy crystal shapes and precipitation rates pedley 2014 shiraishi et al 2019 westphal et al 2019 in scale deposits sw2 and sw2 i extracellular twisted ribbon like stalks fig 4b as well as prominent hollow microtubes fig 4c and d are indicative of neutrophilic fe oxidizing bacterial communities feob which are represented by gallionella ferruginea and leptothrix ochracea ehrenberg 1836 hallberg and ferris 2004 chan et al 2011 2016 fleming et al 2018 in the scale deposit sw2 without pasp gallionella ferruginea is detected whereas scale deposit sw2 i mainly contains leptothrix ochracea both feobs have different habitat requirements with respect to their metabolism gallionella ferruginea oxidizes fe ii and precipitates fe iii hydr oxides in environments poor in doc by using dic via chemolithoautotrophic processes while leptothrix ochracea is abundant in doc rich solutions assimilating doc in combination with dic by mixotrophic processes hallbeck and pedersen 1991 fleming et al 2014 2018 thus doc from pasp addition leads to the dominance of leptothrix ochracea over gallionella ferruginea fleming et al 2014 2018 as evidenced in the scale deposit sw2 i fig 4b vs fig 4c and d it is known that the stalks gallionella and sheaths leptothrix of such feobs are fe iii rich which is consistent with intergrowths and coatings of fe hydr oxides chan et al 2011 hashimoto et al 2007 eichinger et al 2020a for solutions sw2 and sw2 i sufficient amounts of dissolved bioavailable fe are constantly delivered to maintain feobs metabolism which in turn influences the water chemistry and results in the co precipitation of fe hydr oxides and caco3 phases this explains the red brownish coloration of the scale deposits and the high fe and low ca contents upon addition of pasp table 2 however leptothrix ochracea may reduce the inhibitor effect of pasp by consuming doc as inferred from solution sw2 i which contained the highest pasp content 12 ml h but the lowest concentration of pasp 1 1 mg l and doc 0 8 mg l this observation is supported by pasp analyses pattern fig d 1 appendix where the main peak of the red spectral curve of solution sw2 i is shifted towards lower wavelengths compared to solution sw1 i and the pasp standard this shift most likely arises from the bacterial degradation of the long chained pasp polymers in solution sw2 i stedmon and markager 2005 jalalvandi and shavandi 2018 as leptothrix ochracea progressively consumes doc provided by pasp accordingly almost constant ca2 and hco3 concentrations of solutions sw2 and sw2 i indicate a less efficient inhibition effect while in all other solutions the ca2 and hco3 concentrations increase significantly indicative of a highly efficient inhibition effect supressing the precipitation of caco3 the above relationships demonstrate that the understanding of site specific conditions for scale deposit formation is required to identify advanced prevention strategies at the field site and to optimize the applicability of inhibitors for water conditioning future studies can make use of the herein presented inhibition effects induced by pasp addition on caco3 scale formation in dynamic i e underground drainage systems ongoing research is required to evaluate the impact of specific on site conditions inhibitor type and dosage on the magnitude and rate of caco3 scale inhibition and green inhibitor efficiency 6 summary and conclusions the application of the green inhibitor polyaspartate pasp to reduce caco3 scale deposition and to alter the composition and micro structure of the unwanted precipitates was rated on site in two tunnel drainages main conclusions are that the addition of pasp i results in elevated ca2 hco3 and doc concentrations in solution and in sicalcite values close to saturation with acc ii effectively retards caco3 nucleation even at low pasp concentrations iii favours the formation of metastable vaterite and aragonite over calcite iv changes the caco3 scale consistence from compact to mushy material and v modifies bacterial dominance which may limit pasp scaling inhibition effects an advanced understanding of the formation mechanisms of unwanted caco3 scale deposits is required for an optimized use of proactive prevention strategies such as the application of the green inhibitor pasp an appropriate dosage can constitute a comparatively cost

16452,what policy is needed to ensure that good quality water is available for both people s needs and the environment the eu water framework directive wfd which came into force in 2000 established a framework for the assessment management protection and improvement of the status of water bodies across the european union however recent reviews show that the ecological status of the majority of surface waters in the eu does not meet the requirement of good status thus it is an important question what measures water management authorities should take to improve the ecological status of their water bodies to find concrete answers several institutes in the netherlands cooperated to develop a software tool the wfd explorer to assist water managers in selecting efficient measures this article deals with the development of prediction tools that allow one to calculate the effect of restoration and mitigation measures on the biological quality expressed in terms of ecological quality ratios eqrs to find the ideal modeling tool we give a review of 11 predictive models 10 models from the field of machine learning and additionally the multiple regression model we present our results in terms of a prediction interpretation competition all these models were tested in a multiple stressor setting the values of 15 stressors or steering factors are available to predict the eqr values of four biological quality elements phytoplankton other aquatic flora benthic invertebrates and fish analyses are based on 29 data sets from various water clusters streams ditches lakes channels all 11 models were ranked by their predictive performance and their level of model transparency our review shows a trade off between these two aspects models that have the best eqr prediction performance show non transparent model structures these are random forest and boosting however models with low prediction accuracies show transparent response relationships between eqrs on the one hand and individual steering factors on the other hand these models are multiple regression regression trees and product unit neural networks to acknowledge both aspects of model quality predictive power and transparency we recommend that models from both groups are implemented in the wfd explorer software graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data science ecological quality ratios machine learning prediction water quality water framework directive 1 introduction what measures are needed to ensure that water of good quality is available for both people s needs and the environment since the first water directives in the 1970s the eu has worked to create an effective and coherent water policy to safeguard surface waters the water framework directive wfd which came into force in 2000 establishes a framework for the assessment management protection and improvement of the status of water bodies across the eu however recent reviews show that the ecological status of the majority of surface waters in the eu does not meet the requirement of good quality kristensen et al 2018 kristensen et al conclude that around 40 of european surface water bodies are in good or high ecological status with lakes and coastal waters having better status than rivers and transitional waters there has been limited change in ecological status since the first river basin management plans rmbps were reported in 2009 yet in 2027 all surface water bodies should achieve a good ecological status according to the wfd thus how can water management authorities such as ministries and regional water authorities improve the ecological status of water bodies and evaluate which measures will be the most effective to find concrete answers several institutes in the netherlands cooperated to develop a software tool the wfd explorer to assist water managers in selecting effective measures this explorer allows one to calculate the influence of restoration and mitigation measures on the ecological and chemical quality of surface waters one part of this tool is a biological quality module based on machine learning techniques that calculates the effectiveness of restoration measures such as stream re meandering or the construction of near natural riparian zones here quality is analyzed with respect to four biological quality elements phytoplankton other aquatic flora benthic invertebrates and fish fig 1 these elements are quantified in terms of ratios following eu regulations and denoted as ecological quality ratios eqrs eqrs range from 0 0 lowest element status to 1 0 highest element status thus far three approaches have been implemented in the wfd explorer to find multiple stressor relationships between an eqr on the one hand and a set of steering factors stressors x1 xm on the other hand namely regression trees neural networks and recently random forest these methods solve the following equation 1 eq r i f x 1 i x m i ε i where f stands for the functional relationship between an eqri value and the available steering factors εi is the model residual where index i stands for a sample number with i 1 n since 2008 these models were periodically evaluated for 8 water types and 3 to 4 eqrs making up a total of 29 data sets the number of samples records n lies around 200 the application of eq 1 is relatively new in water quality modeling examples are given by gieswein et al 2017 boosted regression trees followed by generalized linear regression herrero et al 2018 random forest models gebler et al 2018 neural networks and lemm et al 2021 various boosted regression tree implementations originally water managers and authorities accepted predictive modeling tools from the field of machine learning as they were evaluated on their predictive performance however recent discussions with authorities showed some discontent due to the black box nature of these models in general the question was raised are there models that solve eq 1 that show good prediction performance while preserving a high level of interpretational quality why should we trust a model such as neural networks that predicts well but at the same time might show increasing eqr values with rising toxicity levels this wish to interpret the model and understand how it works refers to a long lasting discussion within the fields of machine learning and statistics breiman 2001a donoho 2017 in this article we report on a predictive modeling experiment which acknowledges both aspects prediction and model transparency to do so we have set up a competition among 10 machine learning models and additionally the multiple regression model all 11 models were applied to estimate eqr values according to the general model structure 1 and based on 29 data sets updated with recent measurements the competition is presented by two ranking lists first all models are ranked by their predictive power second all models are ranked by their interpretability clearly the first ranking has a quantitative nature while the second is more qualitative the key question we will try to answer is is there a method that wins the competition given both ranking lists we note that the concept of competition among different types of models such as presented here is rather new in the field of hydrological modeling we name the studies of chen et al 2020 and el bilali and taleb 2020 however competitions are not unusual in the field of data science in general donoho 2017 section 6 highlights the role of competition and concludes that one explanation of predictive modeling success is this methodological aspect which he describes as the secret sauce of data science recent competitions such as hosted by www kaggle com may entail cash prizes up to one million usds date of access 9 17 2021 the outline of this article is as follows data and methods are described in section 2 prediction performances are ranked in section 3 1 and the interpretational quality of models is assessed and ranked in section 3 2 both rankings are discussed in section 4 where the winning model s are presented next to that we discuss the wider application of the findings presented here we end with concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 eqrs and stressors the analyses in this article are based on 29 data sets which consist of samples from eight water type clusters in the netherlands 1 slow flowing streams 2 fast flowing streams 3 ditches 4 channels 5 shallow lakes 6 deep lakes 7 weak brackish waters and 8 brackish to saline waters three to four biological quality elements are available for each cluster following the scheme shown in table 1 the table shows that we have 5 data sets for phytoplankton 8 data sets for other aquatic flora 8 data sets for benthic invertebrates and 8 data sets for fish next to data availability we have added descriptive statistics showing mean values of quality elements along with sample sizes these values show that mean qualities lie within the eu classes poor and moderate with only one element having status good eqr values for biological quality elements are calculated following eu rules to arrive at a scaled eqr value between 0 0 and 1 0 reference values have been defined such that an eqr value of 1 0 corresponds to the ideal quality element situation or reference condition given a specific region and water type details of eqr calculation methods in the netherlands are described by evers et al 2018 and molen et al 2019 since uniform calculation methods are lacking across eu member states bund and solimini 2007 birk et al 2012 eqr estimates were regularly intercalibrated eu 2018 we strived to select samples with an ideal spread along the eqr water quality classifications 0 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 0 40 0 60 0 60 0 80 and 0 80 1 00 however this spread was hampered since most water types in the netherlands have values in the range 0 20 0 60 with limited data at higher values in case of brackish to saline waters limited data were available for low eqr values as well to complement the data sets for those cases eqrs were estimated by three ecologists hereafter denoted as expert judgment along with regional knowledge eqr values of other quality elements and samples from older dates more details are given by linden et al 2021 section 2 4 the percentages of eqrs based on samples rather than expert judgment are summarized in table 1 as a sensitivity exercise we will evaluate the predictive performance of models as function of sample availability in section 3 1 models for all 29 data sets for data sets restricted to those with 85 of samples or more 14 data sets and for data set with less than 85 of samples 15 data sets next to eqrs seven physico chemical indicators and eight hydro morphological indicators are available summarized in table 2 details are given by linden et al 2021 section 2 3 all but one indicator are based on measurements the toxicity indicator is modelled and expressed in terms of a multi substance potentially affected fraction or mspaf in short clearly the application of steering factors depends on the specific water type cluster there is no shipping in streams or meandering in channels etc details are given in table si 1 we note that the literature shows a number of denominations for indicators such as listed in table 2 stressors pressures or steering factors in biological terms features or predictors in machine learning terms and regressors or explanatory variables in statistical terms we will use both the terms stressor and steering factor throughout this article in fact steering factor is more precise since all 15 indicators could be steered by water authorities to improve the ecological quality of their surface waters all 29 data sets are supplied as an excel supplemental file with 8 sheets each sheet shows 3 to 4 eqrs for each of the eight water type categories with corresponding stressors according to the scheme shown in table 1 additionally locations are given along with sample numbers sample dates water authorities and water types also the split in records for training 80 and validation 20 are given in the sheets to perform a prediction competition as presented here we aimed to build data sets with around 200 samples this number is needed to arrive at stable and reliable estimation results as suggested by feld et al 2016 a high number of records is especially important if the number of stressors m increases in our case varying between 7 and 10 more technically if m increases the m dimensional stressor outcome space will become exponentially sparse due to what is called the curse of dimensionality 2 2 multiple stressor modeling and predictive power predictive modeling tools mostly coming from the field of machine learning have gained immense popularity within many fields of research including the field of hydrological modeling this popularity might be explained by their superior prediction performance qualities and the recent pattern recognition successes of deep learning neural network algorithms as for general texts on techniques and their mathematical background we refer to the books of hastie et al 2008 and kuhn and johnson 2016 review articles are those by mulainathan and spiess 2017 and yarkoni and westfall 2017 within the field of hydrology we name raghavendra and deka 2014 feld et al 2016 mosavi et al 2018 and tyralis et al 2019 pyo et al 2020 and chen et al 2020 as stated in the introduction we selected 11 predictive modeling tools to generate predictions by the following functional relationship 2 eq r i f p 1 i p 2 i h 1 i h 2 i ε i where p stands for physico chemical indicators h for hydro morphological indicators and the index i a sample number with i 1 n multiple stressor modeling as defined in eq 2 is relatively new we name feld et al 2016 gieswein et al 2017 gebler et al 2018 herrero et al 2018 birk et al 2020 and lemm et al 2021 next to that the multiple stressor approach deviates from studies that construct composite pressure indicators these studies combine a number of pressures xi into one single indicator as in poikane et al 2017 a review of methods other than formulated in eq 2 is given by poikane et al 2020 the models selected in this review are listed in table 3 along with specific characteristics and references the table shows that some models were implemented multiple times to explore the role of various software implementations and tuning options a general description of these models except models 6 and 10 is given in sections 6 7 and 8 in kuhn and johnson 2016 a description of the product unit neural networks models punns has been given by de niet et al 2014 and linden et al 2021 section 3 1 the models listed in table 3 are implemented in the r statistical computing environment ihaka and gentlemen 1996 except punns r scripts of nine models are supplied as supplementary material the tools listed in table 3 are a cross section of the most popular models within the fields of machine learning and statistics however we note that the literature shows other tools as well we name penalized models such as bayesian ridge regression and lasso cubist elastic net and generalized linear mixed models glmms however at the moment of publishing there are no signs that one of these tools would outperform the models chosen here both in terms of predictive power and transparency of model structure at least for the data sets analysed here we applied three metrics to express the prediction performance of the tools listed in table 3 as a first step we have split the 29 eqr data sets in a training set 80 of the available records and a validation set 20 of the records where all models are estimated on the 29 training sets the split was made by cluster sampling to guarantee that both high and low eqr values are contained in the validation sets the first metric is the root mean squared error rmse it is defined for each validation set as follows 3a r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi stands for a an eqr value in the validation dataset y i its prediction and index i a sample number 1 n clearly a perfect prediction leads to an rmse value of zero the second metric is the coefficient of determination cod the cod is closely related to the rmse and is calculated as follows 3b c o d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 r m s e 2 var y i n n 1 where yi stands for the actual eqr value y i the prediction and y the mean of all known eqr values the advantage of cod performance values over rmses is that cods can be applied to evaluate prediction performances across all 29 datasets since rmses are corrected for data set variances we note that the definition of cod is similar to that of the well known squared correlation the difference is that r2 measures the linear coherence between yi and y i whereas the cod measures the coherence around one specific line namely the one to one line the latter implies that the cod criterion only reaches its maximum value of 1 0 if all n predictions are perfect finally we evaluated the fraction correct within 0 10 this criterion stands for the fraction of all n validation data for which the eqr prediction y i lies within the interval yi 0 10 yi 0 10 we note that this fraction correct differs from the rmse and cod metric in that it is not sensitive to outliers 2 3 criteria for model interpretability as for the interpretability of predictive modeling machine learning techniques several methods have been developed recently to enlarge the transparency of black box models since the work of breiman 2001b these methods apply to all models in table 3 are doshi velez and kim 2017 molnar 2021 and the literature cited therein molnar shows that both multiple regression models and regression trees are transparent as for their model structure and prediction formulae his sections 4 1 and 4 4 this point is easily seen for multiple regression due to the linearity assumption model 2 transforms to 4 eq r i α 0 α 1 p 1 i α 2 p 2 i β 1 h 1 i β 2 h 2 i ε i clearly the black box defined by the function f in eq 2 is opened in eq 4 models other than multiple regression and regression trees have a more black box character although differences exist punns which belong to the neural network group of models allows one to re write the neural network into a non linear response equation as we will show random forest and boosting models are based on an ensemble of regression trees where each individual tree has a transparent structure software can show these individual trees as an option however transparency is more limited since prediction are given for the forest as a whole the remaining models in table 3 have a complex structure and we will place them at the low end of model transparency transparency varies across models but how does that influence the finding of partial dependencies that is the response relationships between eqrs and individual steering factors this is the item raised by water authorities next to prediction clearly the multiple regression model formulated in eq 4 gives direct answers due to its linear structure here counterintuitive relationships are directly seen for example if toxicity or total nitrogen would show corresponding positive α parameters molnar 2021 discusses a general method that tries to mimic exact partial dependencies for any machine learning model namely by the calculation of so called partial dependency plots or pdps in short a pdp shows the average marginal effect that one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model a pdp can show whether the relationship between an eqr value and a specific steering factor xk is linear monotonic or more complex thus pdps reveal associations between eqrs and individual steering factors x1 xm including possibly counterintuitive relationships unfortunately pdps have a disadvantage as well if a steering factor xi is correlated to other steering factors in the model pdps might show misleading relationships since other steering factors were set to mean values only details are given by molnar in his section 5 1 to complement the description of methods recently developed to enlarge the transparency of black box models we name the method of importance ranking of steering factors as with pdps this method is applicable to all models summed up in table 3 importance ranking is done by successive permutation of factors as introduced by breiman 2001b in the context of random forest models the importance of a particular feature is calculated from the change in the model s prediction error after permuting that feature details are given by molnar in his section 5 5 more advanced methods of importance ranking are still in an experimental phase we name the calculation of so called shapley values and the more advanced shapley additive explanations or shaps in short both methods are based on concepts from game theory and allow a distribution of features over a specific prediction sections 5 9 and 5 10 in molnar 2021 we propose to apply three criteria for the interpretability of models in order of importance 1 transparency of model structure 2 availability of accurate partial dependence estimates and 3 the availability of accurate importance ranking estimates 3 results 3 1 ranking prediction performance all 11 models were estimated on the same 29 training data sets described in tables 1 and 2 and evaluated on the corresponding validation datasets using the prediction performance metrics defined in section 2 2 results are summarized in table 4 here descriptive statistics are shown based on 29 cod values 29 rmse values and 29 values for fraction correct within 0 10 the models are ranked according to their mean score on rmses the table shows that the best mean prediction performances are found for the three random forest models this holds for all three accuracy metrics worst values are found for regression trees deep learning and multiple regression models although deep learning performs somewhat better on the fraction correct criterion these inferences are illustrated in fig 2 the figure shows the cod and fraction correct metrics for all 11 models and all 29 data sets where the results for random forest ranger implementation and multiple regression are highlighted in green and red respectively the figure shows the dominance of random forest next to that it shows that prediction accuracy is highly variable between data sets therefore we tested the statistical significance of cod prediction performances by two non parametric tests the friedman test which tests if one or more models outperform others and the one sided wilcoxon signed rank test for pairs of models results show p values 0 05 meaning i that some models outperform others and ii that the ranger implementation of the random forest model is the statistical significant winner in all paired tests as noted in section 2 1 a number of eqr samples was estimated by expert judgement if we restrict the 29 data sets to those that have 85 field collected samples or more 14 data sets remain we have re estimated the values shown in table 4 for these 14 data sets to see if the ranking of models is sensitive to this aspect of expert judgment results show only one shift in ranking namely for multiple regression this model ends up in the 8th position coming from the 11th no changes are seen for the top 7 rankings in table 4 as a complement we re estimated prediction metrics for data sets with less than 85 field collected samples 15 data sets here ranking results are identical to those shown in table 4 from these results we conclude that the random forest model is the winner here and more specifically the ranger software implementation 3 2 ranking models by their interpretability given the criteria formulated at the end of section 2 3 we place three models at the top of our ranking namely multiple regression and regression trees ex aequo at position one and two and punns at the third position as an illustration we show the model structures of regression trees multiple regression and punns for benthic invertebrates in channels based on a training set of 169 samples the multiple regression model reads as 5a the model structure of regression trees based on the same data is shown in fig 3 both models allow one to derive exact partial dependencies and to calculate exact importance values if steering factors are standardized to zero mean and unit variance weighing factors in eq 5a can be interpreted as importance values the non linear functional form for punns reads as 5b e q r b e n t h i c i n v e r t e b r a t e s 0 087 0 20 w a t e r l e v e l d y n a m i c

transparent model structure if all but one stressor are set to fixed numbers the relationship between eqr values and that selected stressor can be calculated by simulation however eq 5b is more difficult to interpret than the relationship shown in eq 5a due to its non linear character the inferences made above lead to the ranking of models in table 5 the table shows three groups with similar interpretational qualities multiple regression regression trees on top punns at a third position the random forest implementations and boosting ex aequo at positions 4 to 7 and neural networks deep learning k nearest neighbors and support vector machines ex aequo at positions 8 11 we have placed both random forest models and boosting in the middle since their structure based on an ensemble of regression trees allows somewhat more interpretation compared to neural networks deep learning k nearest neighbors and support vector machines as an example we show the importance values for the benthic invertebrates in channels in fig 4 random forest pdps for all 29 data sets are given in appendix f of linden et al 2021 a full set of 29 punn formulae are given in appendix c and a full set of 29 regression trees in appendix g of linden et al 2021 4 discussion 4 1 and the winner is clearly we want to select a method that is strong from both perspectives prediction table 4 and interpretational quality table 5 unfortunately these tables show contrasting rankings models that predict the best the three random forest implementations do not rank highest for interpretability and models that rank highest by interpretability multiple regression regression trees and punns do not predict very well thus what would be the best choice given this trade off between both aspects a simple solution would be to sum the rankings from tables 4 and 5 which generates a new ranking this equal weight approach yields the following ordering with the sum of table rankings between brackets 1 random forest ranger score 1 0 5 5 6 5 2 random forest h2o score 2 0 5 5 7 5 3 random forest breiman score 3 0 5 5 8 5 4 punns score 6 0 3 0 9 0 5 boosting score 4 0 5 5 9 5 6 regression trees score 9 0 1 5 10 5 7 multiple regression score 11 0 1 5 12 5 8 neural networks score 5 0 9 5 14 5 9 k nearest neighbors score 7 0 9 5 16 5 10 svms score 8 0 9 5 17 5 11 deep learning score 10 0 9 5 19 5 clearly the ranger implementation of random forest is the winner however given the contrasting rankings in tables 4 and 5 our suggestion would be to apply two to three models simultaneously preferably models that are complementary with respect to prediction performance and interpretability here we note that the terms interpretability or transparency which are used throughout this article are not necessarily equivalent to causation e g takeshita et al 2020 although the eqr stressor combinations summarized in table sm 1 are carefully chosen water authorities should always analyze estimation results as for their ecological plausibility the first model we would advise is the random forest model where the ranger software yielded the highest prediction performance a detailed calculation of pdps and importance values yielded satisfactory results for this model linden 2021 appendix f however since pdps might lose their interpretational value if a number of steering factors are mutually correlated as noted in section 2 2 correlations illustrated in figure sm 1 we advise to complement the random forest model by adding punns and or regression trees and or multiple regression these additional models show less convincing prediction performances but produce transparent model formulations and show accurate partial dependencies another approach not applied here has been followed by feld et al 2016 gieswein et al 2017 and herrero et al 2018 who propose to analyze multiple stressor models as a two stage procedure rank the importance of stressors by applying random forest or boosted regression trees and identify the possible role of interaction terms between stressors apply a generalized linear regression model or a linear mixed model with relevant stressors as input including interaction terms if necessary interaction terms are added as the product of selected stressors if we have stressors x1 and x2 the models are based on x1 x2 and x1 x2 although this two stage approach has advantages we see disadvantages as well why should we model interaction terms as simple products many other functional relations could be chosen including quadratic stressors e g x1 x1 2 x2 x2 2 x1 x2 etc next to that it is not trivial which stressors should be selected for interaction terms a high number of interaction terms should be avoided since it would lead to the curse of dimensionality as explained in section 2 1 the same argument holds for the approach of birk et al 2020 and spears et al 2021 who apply generalized linear mixed models glmms with interaction terms having the form x1 x2 4 2 do competition outcomes generalize to data sets from other countries an important question is whether our competition results generalize to other data sets gathered within the context of the eu water framework directive first the easy part on this question transparency as summarized in table 5 transparency inferences do not depend on the specific data sets at hand and have a general character thus inferences hold for any application however the predictive performance rankings as summarized in table 4 and illustrated in fig 2 are difficult to generalize if we look at wfd data sets published and analysed in the literature we see a scattered landscape analyses which follow the formulation of eq 1 differ in many aspects choice of water type s indices for biological quality other than eqrs and even more important a wide range of stressor indicator choices we give a few examples the study of herrero et al 2018 applies to rivers only where stressors such as temperature altitude inhabitants and discharge were chosen these choices are quite different from those given in our tables 1 and 2 the study of lemm et al 2021 is also directed to rivers only where 7 stressors are chosen all output of models or based on satellite data gieswein et al 2017 analyze 21 biological metrics their table 2 where only three eqrs are involved next to that their choices of 14 stressors are quite different to our set of 15 stressors and these differences are not all data sets will differ as for i the number of samples ii the presence or absence of extreme eqrs the width of gradients in stressors transformations of stressor indicators such as box cox transformations feld et al 2016 given these differences it is difficult to say if random forest models or boosting regression trees would outperform other tools such as support vector machines or various neural network implementations for other data sets what we can say is that our predictive performances are based on a wide set of eight water types combined with all relevant biological quality elements data were carefully selected we have chosen wide eqr ranges and stressor values with environmentally relevant gradients another argument for choosing random forest or boosting models would be that these models are applied within many fields of research including hydrology tyralis et al 2019 and more specifically within the context of the water framework directive we name feld et al 2016 herrero et al 2018 and segurado et al 2018 both arguments given here do not proof that the choice for random forest models would be the best choice for water authorities and researchers in other countries however we feel that the modeling results presented here show a strong case for random forest implementations 5 concluding remarks we have presented 11 methods that follow the multiple stressor approach formulated in eq 1 and highlighted two aspects prediction performance and transparency we make four short remarks concerning i the prediction performances reported ii data uncertainties iii the low scores for the support vector machine and deep learning models and iv the implementation of results in the wfd explorer first we have ranked methods as for their predictive power but it is a policy relevant question if the best ranking models provide eqr predictions that are accurate enough for water authorities to decide what cost effective measures they should take prediction errors are given in table 4 in terms of mean error values the rmse column as for the ranger random forest model the model that performed best in terms of prediction it is found that the mean rmse value equals 0 11 all underlying prediction errors were evaluated over the 29 validation data sets ranger rmse values for each of the 29 eqr water type combinations are given by linden 2021 their table 4 2 it shows that the highest rmse value is found for benthic invertebrates in brackish to saline waters 0 13 the lowest value is found for benthic invertebrates in deep lakes 0 072 again the question is are these values good enough this is a point that should be discussed with water managers and authorities since there is no objective statistical yardstick second we have concerns about data accuracies as shown in table 2 not all eqr values are based on measurement procedures and thus on field collected samples as an example eqr data for fish in brackish to saline waters rely for 16 on samples and thus for 84 on some form of expert judgment the highest percentage of samples is found for benthic invertebrates in slow flowing streams 99 the results in section 3 1 show that prediction performance rankings do not alter if we select data sets with low levels of expert judgment with the exception of multiple regression however our advice would be to give more attention to data accuracies in future eqr measurement cycles and thus to avoid expert judgments as much as possible this is especially striking for the fish eqr data sets third the low scores for support vector machines and deep learning are remarkable these models are often found to be competition winners we explain their low rankings from the fact that the number of records available in the datasets is relatively small around 180 records in the training sets according to table 1 deep learning results reported in the literature are based on training set containing thousands of records as a final remark we note that the present findings and those presented by the report of linden et al 2021 have led to the implementation of three models in the latest wfd explorer software namely the ranger random forest model regression trees and punns these models are currently applied by deltares in the ex ante

16452,what policy is needed to ensure that good quality water is available for both people s needs and the environment the eu water framework directive wfd which came into force in 2000 established a framework for the assessment management protection and improvement of the status of water bodies across the european union however recent reviews show that the ecological status of the majority of surface waters in the eu does not meet the requirement of good status thus it is an important question what measures water management authorities should take to improve the ecological status of their water bodies to find concrete answers several institutes in the netherlands cooperated to develop a software tool the wfd explorer to assist water managers in selecting efficient measures this article deals with the development of prediction tools that allow one to calculate the effect of restoration and mitigation measures on the biological quality expressed in terms of ecological quality ratios eqrs to find the ideal modeling tool we give a review of 11 predictive models 10 models from the field of machine learning and additionally the multiple regression model we present our results in terms of a prediction interpretation competition all these models were tested in a multiple stressor setting the values of 15 stressors or steering factors are available to predict the eqr values of four biological quality elements phytoplankton other aquatic flora benthic invertebrates and fish analyses are based on 29 data sets from various water clusters streams ditches lakes channels all 11 models were ranked by their predictive performance and their level of model transparency our review shows a trade off between these two aspects models that have the best eqr prediction performance show non transparent model structures these are random forest and boosting however models with low prediction accuracies show transparent response relationships between eqrs on the one hand and individual steering factors on the other hand these models are multiple regression regression trees and product unit neural networks to acknowledge both aspects of model quality predictive power and transparency we recommend that models from both groups are implemented in the wfd explorer software graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords data science ecological quality ratios machine learning prediction water quality water framework directive 1 introduction what measures are needed to ensure that water of good quality is available for both people s needs and the environment since the first water directives in the 1970s the eu has worked to create an effective and coherent water policy to safeguard surface waters the water framework directive wfd which came into force in 2000 establishes a framework for the assessment management protection and improvement of the status of water bodies across the eu however recent reviews show that the ecological status of the majority of surface waters in the eu does not meet the requirement of good quality kristensen et al 2018 kristensen et al conclude that around 40 of european surface water bodies are in good or high ecological status with lakes and coastal waters having better status than rivers and transitional waters there has been limited change in ecological status since the first river basin management plans rmbps were reported in 2009 yet in 2027 all surface water bodies should achieve a good ecological status according to the wfd thus how can water management authorities such as ministries and regional water authorities improve the ecological status of water bodies and evaluate which measures will be the most effective to find concrete answers several institutes in the netherlands cooperated to develop a software tool the wfd explorer to assist water managers in selecting effective measures this explorer allows one to calculate the influence of restoration and mitigation measures on the ecological and chemical quality of surface waters one part of this tool is a biological quality module based on machine learning techniques that calculates the effectiveness of restoration measures such as stream re meandering or the construction of near natural riparian zones here quality is analyzed with respect to four biological quality elements phytoplankton other aquatic flora benthic invertebrates and fish fig 1 these elements are quantified in terms of ratios following eu regulations and denoted as ecological quality ratios eqrs eqrs range from 0 0 lowest element status to 1 0 highest element status thus far three approaches have been implemented in the wfd explorer to find multiple stressor relationships between an eqr on the one hand and a set of steering factors stressors x1 xm on the other hand namely regression trees neural networks and recently random forest these methods solve the following equation 1 eq r i f x 1 i x m i ε i where f stands for the functional relationship between an eqri value and the available steering factors εi is the model residual where index i stands for a sample number with i 1 n since 2008 these models were periodically evaluated for 8 water types and 3 to 4 eqrs making up a total of 29 data sets the number of samples records n lies around 200 the application of eq 1 is relatively new in water quality modeling examples are given by gieswein et al 2017 boosted regression trees followed by generalized linear regression herrero et al 2018 random forest models gebler et al 2018 neural networks and lemm et al 2021 various boosted regression tree implementations originally water managers and authorities accepted predictive modeling tools from the field of machine learning as they were evaluated on their predictive performance however recent discussions with authorities showed some discontent due to the black box nature of these models in general the question was raised are there models that solve eq 1 that show good prediction performance while preserving a high level of interpretational quality why should we trust a model such as neural networks that predicts well but at the same time might show increasing eqr values with rising toxicity levels this wish to interpret the model and understand how it works refers to a long lasting discussion within the fields of machine learning and statistics breiman 2001a donoho 2017 in this article we report on a predictive modeling experiment which acknowledges both aspects prediction and model transparency to do so we have set up a competition among 10 machine learning models and additionally the multiple regression model all 11 models were applied to estimate eqr values according to the general model structure 1 and based on 29 data sets updated with recent measurements the competition is presented by two ranking lists first all models are ranked by their predictive power second all models are ranked by their interpretability clearly the first ranking has a quantitative nature while the second is more qualitative the key question we will try to answer is is there a method that wins the competition given both ranking lists we note that the concept of competition among different types of models such as presented here is rather new in the field of hydrological modeling we name the studies of chen et al 2020 and el bilali and taleb 2020 however competitions are not unusual in the field of data science in general donoho 2017 section 6 highlights the role of competition and concludes that one explanation of predictive modeling success is this methodological aspect which he describes as the secret sauce of data science recent competitions such as hosted by www kaggle com may entail cash prizes up to one million usds date of access 9 17 2021 the outline of this article is as follows data and methods are described in section 2 prediction performances are ranked in section 3 1 and the interpretational quality of models is assessed and ranked in section 3 2 both rankings are discussed in section 4 where the winning model s are presented next to that we discuss the wider application of the findings presented here we end with concluding remarks in section 5 2 data and methods 2 1 eqrs and stressors the analyses in this article are based on 29 data sets which consist of samples from eight water type clusters in the netherlands 1 slow flowing streams 2 fast flowing streams 3 ditches 4 channels 5 shallow lakes 6 deep lakes 7 weak brackish waters and 8 brackish to saline waters three to four biological quality elements are available for each cluster following the scheme shown in table 1 the table shows that we have 5 data sets for phytoplankton 8 data sets for other aquatic flora 8 data sets for benthic invertebrates and 8 data sets for fish next to data availability we have added descriptive statistics showing mean values of quality elements along with sample sizes these values show that mean qualities lie within the eu classes poor and moderate with only one element having status good eqr values for biological quality elements are calculated following eu rules to arrive at a scaled eqr value between 0 0 and 1 0 reference values have been defined such that an eqr value of 1 0 corresponds to the ideal quality element situation or reference condition given a specific region and water type details of eqr calculation methods in the netherlands are described by evers et al 2018 and molen et al 2019 since uniform calculation methods are lacking across eu member states bund and solimini 2007 birk et al 2012 eqr estimates were regularly intercalibrated eu 2018 we strived to select samples with an ideal spread along the eqr water quality classifications 0 0 0 20 0 20 0 40 0 40 0 60 0 60 0 80 and 0 80 1 00 however this spread was hampered since most water types in the netherlands have values in the range 0 20 0 60 with limited data at higher values in case of brackish to saline waters limited data were available for low eqr values as well to complement the data sets for those cases eqrs were estimated by three ecologists hereafter denoted as expert judgment along with regional knowledge eqr values of other quality elements and samples from older dates more details are given by linden et al 2021 section 2 4 the percentages of eqrs based on samples rather than expert judgment are summarized in table 1 as a sensitivity exercise we will evaluate the predictive performance of models as function of sample availability in section 3 1 models for all 29 data sets for data sets restricted to those with 85 of samples or more 14 data sets and for data set with less than 85 of samples 15 data sets next to eqrs seven physico chemical indicators and eight hydro morphological indicators are available summarized in table 2 details are given by linden et al 2021 section 2 3 all but one indicator are based on measurements the toxicity indicator is modelled and expressed in terms of a multi substance potentially affected fraction or mspaf in short clearly the application of steering factors depends on the specific water type cluster there is no shipping in streams or meandering in channels etc details are given in table si 1 we note that the literature shows a number of denominations for indicators such as listed in table 2 stressors pressures or steering factors in biological terms features or predictors in machine learning terms and regressors or explanatory variables in statistical terms we will use both the terms stressor and steering factor throughout this article in fact steering factor is more precise since all 15 indicators could be steered by water authorities to improve the ecological quality of their surface waters all 29 data sets are supplied as an excel supplemental file with 8 sheets each sheet shows 3 to 4 eqrs for each of the eight water type categories with corresponding stressors according to the scheme shown in table 1 additionally locations are given along with sample numbers sample dates water authorities and water types also the split in records for training 80 and validation 20 are given in the sheets to perform a prediction competition as presented here we aimed to build data sets with around 200 samples this number is needed to arrive at stable and reliable estimation results as suggested by feld et al 2016 a high number of records is especially important if the number of stressors m increases in our case varying between 7 and 10 more technically if m increases the m dimensional stressor outcome space will become exponentially sparse due to what is called the curse of dimensionality 2 2 multiple stressor modeling and predictive power predictive modeling tools mostly coming from the field of machine learning have gained immense popularity within many fields of research including the field of hydrological modeling this popularity might be explained by their superior prediction performance qualities and the recent pattern recognition successes of deep learning neural network algorithms as for general texts on techniques and their mathematical background we refer to the books of hastie et al 2008 and kuhn and johnson 2016 review articles are those by mulainathan and spiess 2017 and yarkoni and westfall 2017 within the field of hydrology we name raghavendra and deka 2014 feld et al 2016 mosavi et al 2018 and tyralis et al 2019 pyo et al 2020 and chen et al 2020 as stated in the introduction we selected 11 predictive modeling tools to generate predictions by the following functional relationship 2 eq r i f p 1 i p 2 i h 1 i h 2 i ε i where p stands for physico chemical indicators h for hydro morphological indicators and the index i a sample number with i 1 n multiple stressor modeling as defined in eq 2 is relatively new we name feld et al 2016 gieswein et al 2017 gebler et al 2018 herrero et al 2018 birk et al 2020 and lemm et al 2021 next to that the multiple stressor approach deviates from studies that construct composite pressure indicators these studies combine a number of pressures xi into one single indicator as in poikane et al 2017 a review of methods other than formulated in eq 2 is given by poikane et al 2020 the models selected in this review are listed in table 3 along with specific characteristics and references the table shows that some models were implemented multiple times to explore the role of various software implementations and tuning options a general description of these models except models 6 and 10 is given in sections 6 7 and 8 in kuhn and johnson 2016 a description of the product unit neural networks models punns has been given by de niet et al 2014 and linden et al 2021 section 3 1 the models listed in table 3 are implemented in the r statistical computing environment ihaka and gentlemen 1996 except punns r scripts of nine models are supplied as supplementary material the tools listed in table 3 are a cross section of the most popular models within the fields of machine learning and statistics however we note that the literature shows other tools as well we name penalized models such as bayesian ridge regression and lasso cubist elastic net and generalized linear mixed models glmms however at the moment of publishing there are no signs that one of these tools would outperform the models chosen here both in terms of predictive power and transparency of model structure at least for the data sets analysed here we applied three metrics to express the prediction performance of the tools listed in table 3 as a first step we have split the 29 eqr data sets in a training set 80 of the available records and a validation set 20 of the records where all models are estimated on the 29 training sets the split was made by cluster sampling to guarantee that both high and low eqr values are contained in the validation sets the first metric is the root mean squared error rmse it is defined for each validation set as follows 3a r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 where yi stands for a an eqr value in the validation dataset y i its prediction and index i a sample number 1 n clearly a perfect prediction leads to an rmse value of zero the second metric is the coefficient of determination cod the cod is closely related to the rmse and is calculated as follows 3b c o d 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 1 r m s e 2 var y i n n 1 where yi stands for the actual eqr value y i the prediction and y the mean of all known eqr values the advantage of cod performance values over rmses is that cods can be applied to evaluate prediction performances across all 29 datasets since rmses are corrected for data set variances we note that the definition of cod is similar to that of the well known squared correlation the difference is that r2 measures the linear coherence between yi and y i whereas the cod measures the coherence around one specific line namely the one to one line the latter implies that the cod criterion only reaches its maximum value of 1 0 if all n predictions are perfect finally we evaluated the fraction correct within 0 10 this criterion stands for the fraction of all n validation data for which the eqr prediction y i lies within the interval yi 0 10 yi 0 10 we note that this fraction correct differs from the rmse and cod metric in that it is not sensitive to outliers 2 3 criteria for model interpretability as for the interpretability of predictive modeling machine learning techniques several methods have been developed recently to enlarge the transparency of black box models since the work of breiman 2001b these methods apply to all models in table 3 are doshi velez and kim 2017 molnar 2021 and the literature cited therein molnar shows that both multiple regression models and regression trees are transparent as for their model structure and prediction formulae his sections 4 1 and 4 4 this point is easily seen for multiple regression due to the linearity assumption model 2 transforms to 4 eq r i α 0 α 1 p 1 i α 2 p 2 i β 1 h 1 i β 2 h 2 i ε i clearly the black box defined by the function f in eq 2 is opened in eq 4 models other than multiple regression and regression trees have a more black box character although differences exist punns which belong to the neural network group of models allows one to re write the neural network into a non linear response equation as we will show random forest and boosting models are based on an ensemble of regression trees where each individual tree has a transparent structure software can show these individual trees as an option however transparency is more limited since prediction are given for the forest as a whole the remaining models in table 3 have a complex structure and we will place them at the low end of model transparency transparency varies across models but how does that influence the finding of partial dependencies that is the response relationships between eqrs and individual steering factors this is the item raised by water authorities next to prediction clearly the multiple regression model formulated in eq 4 gives direct answers due to its linear structure here counterintuitive relationships are directly seen for example if toxicity or total nitrogen would show corresponding positive α parameters molnar 2021 discusses a general method that tries to mimic exact partial dependencies for any machine learning model namely by the calculation of so called partial dependency plots or pdps in short a pdp shows the average marginal effect that one or two features have on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model a pdp can show whether the relationship between an eqr value and a specific steering factor xk is linear monotonic or more complex thus pdps reveal associations between eqrs and individual steering factors x1 xm including possibly counterintuitive relationships unfortunately pdps have a disadvantage as well if a steering factor xi is correlated to other steering factors in the model pdps might show misleading relationships since other steering factors were set to mean values only details are given by molnar in his section 5 1 to complement the description of methods recently developed to enlarge the transparency of black box models we name the method of importance ranking of steering factors as with pdps this method is applicable to all models summed up in table 3 importance ranking is done by successive permutation of factors as introduced by breiman 2001b in the context of random forest models the importance of a particular feature is calculated from the change in the model s prediction error after permuting that feature details are given by molnar in his section 5 5 more advanced methods of importance ranking are still in an experimental phase we name the calculation of so called shapley values and the more advanced shapley additive explanations or shaps in short both methods are based on concepts from game theory and allow a distribution of features over a specific prediction sections 5 9 and 5 10 in molnar 2021 we propose to apply three criteria for the interpretability of models in order of importance 1 transparency of model structure 2 availability of accurate partial dependence estimates and 3 the availability of accurate importance ranking estimates 3 results 3 1 ranking prediction performance all 11 models were estimated on the same 29 training data sets described in tables 1 and 2 and evaluated on the corresponding validation datasets using the prediction performance metrics defined in section 2 2 results are summarized in table 4 here descriptive statistics are shown based on 29 cod values 29 rmse values and 29 values for fraction correct within 0 10 the models are ranked according to their mean score on rmses the table shows that the best mean prediction performances are found for the three random forest models this holds for all three accuracy metrics worst values are found for regression trees deep learning and multiple regression models although deep learning performs somewhat better on the fraction correct criterion these inferences are illustrated in fig 2 the figure shows the cod and fraction correct metrics for all 11 models and all 29 data sets where the results for random forest ranger implementation and multiple regression are highlighted in green and red respectively the figure shows the dominance of random forest next to that it shows that prediction accuracy is highly variable between data sets therefore we tested the statistical significance of cod prediction performances by two non parametric tests the friedman test which tests if one or more models outperform others and the one sided wilcoxon signed rank test for pairs of models results show p values 0 05 meaning i that some models outperform others and ii that the ranger implementation of the random forest model is the statistical significant winner in all paired tests as noted in section 2 1 a number of eqr samples was estimated by expert judgement if we restrict the 29 data sets to those that have 85 field collected samples or more 14 data sets remain we have re estimated the values shown in table 4 for these 14 data sets to see if the ranking of models is sensitive to this aspect of expert judgment results show only one shift in ranking namely for multiple regression this model ends up in the 8th position coming from the 11th no changes are seen for the top 7 rankings in table 4 as a complement we re estimated prediction metrics for data sets with less than 85 field collected samples 15 data sets here ranking results are identical to those shown in table 4 from these results we conclude that the random forest model is the winner here and more specifically the ranger software implementation 3 2 ranking models by their interpretability given the criteria formulated at the end of section 2 3 we place three models at the top of our ranking namely multiple regression and regression trees ex aequo at position one and two and punns at the third position as an illustration we show the model structures of regression trees multiple regression and punns for benthic invertebrates in channels based on a training set of 169 samples the multiple regression model reads as 5a the model structure of regression trees based on the same data is shown in fig 3 both models allow one to derive exact partial dependencies and to calculate exact importance values if steering factors are standardized to zero mean and unit variance weighing factors in eq 5a can be interpreted as importance values the non linear functional form for punns reads as 5b e q r b e n t h i c i n v e r t e b r a t e s 0 087 0 20 w a t e r l e v e l d y n a m i c s 0 71 t r a n s p a r e n c y 0 32 m a i n t e n a n c e 0 86 s h i p p i n g 0 56 t o t a l p 0 25 0 0072 w a t e r l e v e l d y n a m i c s 2 09 a m m o n i u m 0 33 b a n k d e s i g n 0 86 t o t

transparent model structure if all but one stressor are set to fixed numbers the relationship between eqr values and that selected stressor can be calculated by simulation however eq 5b is more difficult to interpret than the relationship shown in eq 5a due to its non linear character the inferences made above lead to the ranking of models in table 5 the table shows three groups with similar interpretational qualities multiple regression regression trees on top punns at a third position the random forest implementations and boosting ex aequo at positions 4 to 7 and neural networks deep learning k nearest neighbors and support vector machines ex aequo at positions 8 11 we have placed both random forest models and boosting in the middle since their structure based on an ensemble of regression trees allows somewhat more interpretation compared to neural networks deep learning k nearest neighbors and support vector machines as an example we show the importance values for the benthic invertebrates in channels in fig 4 random forest pdps for all 29 data sets are given in appendix f of linden et al 2021 a full set of 29 punn formulae are given in appendix c and a full set of 29 regression trees in appendix g of linden et al 2021 4 discussion 4 1 and the winner is clearly we want to select a method that is strong from both perspectives prediction table 4 and interpretational quality table 5 unfortunately these tables show contrasting rankings models that predict the best the three random forest implementations do not rank highest for interpretability and models that rank highest by interpretability multiple regression regression trees and punns do not predict very well thus what would be the best choice given this trade off between both aspects a simple solution would be to sum the rankings from tables 4 and 5 which generates a new ranking this equal weight approach yields the following ordering with the sum of table rankings between brackets 1 random forest ranger score 1 0 5 5 6 5 2 random forest h2o score 2 0 5 5 7 5 3 random forest breiman score 3 0 5 5 8 5 4 punns score 6 0 3 0 9 0 5 boosting score 4 0 5 5 9 5 6 regression trees score 9 0 1 5 10 5 7 multiple regression score 11 0 1 5 12 5 8 neural networks score 5 0 9 5 14 5 9 k nearest neighbors score 7 0 9 5 16 5 10 svms score 8 0 9 5 17 5 11 deep learning score 10 0 9 5 19 5 clearly the ranger implementation of random forest is the winner however given the contrasting rankings in tables 4 and 5 our suggestion would be to apply two to three models simultaneously preferably models that are complementary with respect to prediction performance and interpretability here we note that the terms interpretability or transparency which are used throughout this article are not necessarily equivalent to causation e g takeshita et al 2020 although the eqr stressor combinations summarized in table sm 1 are carefully chosen water authorities should always analyze estimation results as for their ecological plausibility the first model we would advise is the random forest model where the ranger software yielded the highest prediction performance a detailed calculation of pdps and importance values yielded satisfactory results for this model linden 2021 appendix f however since pdps might lose their interpretational value if a number of steering factors are mutually correlated as noted in section 2 2 correlations illustrated in figure sm 1 we advise to complement the random forest model by adding punns and or regression trees and or multiple regression these additional models show less convincing prediction performances but produce transparent model formulations and show accurate partial dependencies another approach not applied here has been followed by feld et al 2016 gieswein et al 2017 and herrero et al 2018 who propose to analyze multiple stressor models as a two stage procedure rank the importance of stressors by applying random forest or boosted regression trees and identify the possible role of interaction terms between stressors apply a generalized linear regression model or a linear mixed model with relevant stressors as input including interaction terms if necessary interaction terms are added as the product of selected stressors if we have stressors x1 and x2 the models are based on x1 x2 and x1 x2 although this two stage approach has advantages we see disadvantages as well why should we model interaction terms as simple products many other functional relations could be chosen including quadratic stressors e g x1 x1 2 x2 x2 2 x1 x2 etc next to that it is not trivial which stressors should be selected for interaction terms a high number of interaction terms should be avoided since it would lead to the curse of dimensionality as explained in section 2 1 the same argument holds for the approach of birk et al 2020 and spears et al 2021 who apply generalized linear mixed models glmms with interaction terms having the form x1 x2 4 2 do competition outcomes generalize to data sets from other countries an important question is whether our competition results generalize to other data sets gathered within the context of the eu water framework directive first the easy part on this question transparency as summarized in table 5 transparency inferences do not depend on the specific data sets at hand and have a general character thus inferences hold for any application however the predictive performance rankings as summarized in table 4 and illustrated in fig 2 are difficult to generalize if we look at wfd data sets published and analysed in the literature we see a scattered landscape analyses which follow the formulation of eq 1 differ in many aspects choice of water type s indices for biological quality other than eqrs and even more important a wide range of stressor indicator choices we give a few examples the study of herrero et al 2018 applies to rivers only where stressors such as temperature altitude inhabitants and discharge were chosen these choices are quite different from those given in our tables 1 and 2 the study of lemm et al 2021 is also directed to rivers only where 7 stressors are chosen all output of models or based on satellite data gieswein et al 2017 analyze 21 biological metrics their table 2 where only three eqrs are involved next to that their choices of 14 stressors are quite different to our set of 15 stressors and these differences are not all data sets will differ as for i the number of samples ii the presence or absence of extreme eqrs the width of gradients in stressors transformations of stressor indicators such as box cox transformations feld et al 2016 given these differences it is difficult to say if random forest models or boosting regression trees would outperform other tools such as support vector machines or various neural network implementations for other data sets what we can say is that our predictive performances are based on a wide set of eight water types combined with all relevant biological quality elements data were carefully selected we have chosen wide eqr ranges and stressor values with environmentally relevant gradients another argument for choosing random forest or boosting models would be that these models are applied within many fields of research including hydrology tyralis et al 2019 and more specifically within the context of the water framework directive we name feld et al 2016 herrero et al 2018 and segurado et al 2018 both arguments given here do not proof that the choice for random forest models would be the best choice for water authorities and researchers in other countries however we feel that the modeling results presented here show a strong case for random forest implementations 5 concluding remarks we have presented 11 methods that follow the multiple stressor approach formulated in eq 1 and highlighted two aspects prediction performance and transparency we make four short remarks concerning i the prediction performances reported ii data uncertainties iii the low scores for the support vector machine and deep learning models and iv the implementation of results in the wfd explorer first we have ranked methods as for their predictive power but it is a policy relevant question if the best ranking models provide eqr predictions that are accurate enough for water authorities to decide what cost effective measures they should take prediction errors are given in table 4 in terms of mean error values the rmse column as for the ranger random forest model the model that performed best in terms of prediction it is found that the mean rmse value equals 0 11 all underlying prediction errors were evaluated over the 29 validation data sets ranger rmse values for each of the 29 eqr water type combinations are given by linden 2021 their table 4 2 it shows that the highest rmse value is found for benthic invertebrates in brackish to saline waters 0 13 the lowest value is found for benthic invertebrates in deep lakes 0 072 again the question is are these values good enough this is a point that should be discussed with water managers and authorities since there is no objective statistical yardstick second we have concerns about data accuracies as shown in table 2 not all eqr values are based on measurement procedures and thus on field collected samples as an example eqr data for fish in brackish to saline waters rely for 16 on samples and thus for 84 on some form of expert judgment the highest percentage of samples is found for benthic invertebrates in slow flowing streams 99 the results in section 3 1 show that prediction performance rankings do not alter if we select data sets with low levels of expert judgment with the exception of multiple regression however our advice would be to give more attention to data accuracies in future eqr measurement cycles and thus to avoid expert judgments as much as possible this is especially striking for the fish eqr data sets third the low scores for support vector machines and deep learning are remarkable these models are often found to be competition winners we explain their low rankings from the fact that the number of records available in the datasets is relatively small around 180 records in the training sets according to table 1 deep learning results reported in the literature are based on training set containing thousands of records as a final remark we note that the present findings and those presented by the report of linden et al 2021 have led to the implementation of three models in the latest wfd explorer software namely the ranger random forest model regression trees and punns these models are currently applied by deltares in the ex ante

16453,polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes one kind of persistent organic pollutants were widely detected in coastal wetlands microbial reductive debromination is one of the most important attenuation processes for pbdes in anaerobic environment whereas the underlying reaction mechanisms remain elusive dual element stable isotope analysis was recently recognized to distinguish different reaction mechanism for degradation of organic pollutants in this study the dual carbon bromine isotope effects associated with the anaerobic microbial degradation were first investigated to characterize the reaction mechanisms for bde 47 and bde 153 presence of lower brominated congeners indicated stepwise debromination as the main degradation pathway with the preferential removal of bromine in para position meta ortho position the pronounced isotope fractionation was observed for both carbon and bromine with similar carbon ε c and bromine isotope enrichment factor εbr between bde 47 ε c 5 98 ε br 2 44 and bde 153 ε c 5 57 ε br 2 06 during the microbial degradation compared to ε c and ε br the correlation of carbon and isotope effects λc br δδ 81br δδ 13c was almost the same between bde 47 0 436 and bde 153 0 435 indicating the similar reaction mechanism the calculated carbon and bromine apparent kinetic isotope effects akie c and akie br were 1 0773 and 1 0098 for bde 47 and 1 0716 and 1 0125 for bde 153 within range reported for degradation of halogenated compounds following nucleophilic substitution combination analysis of degradation products λc br and akie all the results pointed to that the anaerobic reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the nucleophilic aromatic substitution with the addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer and the cleavage of c br bond was the rate determining step this study contributed to the development of dual carbon bromine isotope analysis as a robust approach to probe the fate of pbdes in contaminated sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial reductive debromination dual carbon bromine isotope analysis nucleophilic aromatic substitution polybrominated diphenyl ethers wetland bottom water 1 introduction polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes one typical kind of the brominated flame retardants have been widely used in various domestic and industrial products over the past five decades including plastics textiles wires cables and electronics lu et al 2021 zhen et al 2021 between 1970 and 2020 it was documented that the consumption volume was approximate 46 000 2500 and 380 000 tones for the commercial penta octa and deca bde respectively in the united states and canada abbasi et al 2015 china began to produce pbdes in the 1980s and became one of the major manufacturers for deca bde from 2000 abbasi et al 2019 the massive application of pbdes leads to the ubiquitous contamination in various environmental matrices over the world such as sediments deng et al 2021 lu et al 2021 soils jeon et al 2021 oloruntoba et al 2021 water liu et al 2020a zhen et al 2021 animals and human tissues addison et al 2020 pietron et al 2021 pbdes have the potential of bioaccumulation and biomagnification through the food webs and are associated with the neurotoxicity endocrine disruption reproductive toxicity and potential carcinogenicity to humans hurley et al 2019 kicinski et al 2012 leijs et al 2012 therefore the widespread detection and adverse effects of pbdes have raised the increasing concern over their behaviors and fates in the environment microbe mediated degradation is one of the importantly natural attenuation processes for pbdes in various environmental matrices wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 in anoxic conditions the microbial reductive debromination is the predominant pathway for pbde transformation and the higher brominated pbdes can be degraded into lower brominated congeners via the stepwise debromination robrock et al 2008 tokarz iii et al 2008 the diverse anaerobic organohalide respiring bacterial including dehalococcoides spp desulfovibrio spp and dehalogenimonas spp were reported to utilize pbdes as electron acceptors and hydrogen or organic acid as electron donor to support their growth during the debromination lee et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 the responsible enzymes belonging to reductive dehalogenase in the anaerobic organohalide respiring bacterial are known to contain a corrinoid and two iron sulfur centers as cofactors badin et al 2014 bommer et al 2014 lihl et al 2019 payne et al 2015 generally three possible reaction mechanisms associated with the active corrinoid cofactor are proposed for the microbial reductive dehalogenation of aromatic halides in anaerobic environment 1 the electrophilic aromatic substitution involving initial addition of a proton to the aromatic ring followed by addition of the cofactor scheme 1a 2 the nucleophilic aromatic substitution involving addition of the cofactor to the aromatic ring followed by elimination of bromine scheme 1b and 3 the homolytic aromatic substitution involving initial formation of a benzyl radical ion intermediate upon dissociative release of bromine scheme 1c aeppli et al 2013 liang et al 2011 2014 to date most of the studies mainly focused on the anaerobic microbial degradation of pbdes in the sediments and soils chen et al 2018 song et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 and information is scarce in the water more importantly characterization of the reaction mechanisms underlying the reductive debromination of pbdes is still a scientific challenge in the field environment because the same degradation product can be formed via different degradation mechanisms which is beyond the conventional method based on concentration and product identification therefore comprehensive approaches are urgently needed for insight into the mechanistic interpretation on pbde anaerobic biodegradation in the field environment during the last two decades compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has evolved as a well established tool to monitor transformation reaction and quantify the transformation processes of organic pollutants in the laboratory and field conditions droz et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2020c palau et al 2017b molecules with lighter isotopes in the reaction positions react slightly faster than ones containing heavier isotopes during the reaction leading to enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining substrates known as isotope fractionation in our previous studies the stable carbon isotope fractionation of pbdes were reported during the transformation by aerobic and anaerobic microbes and the ε c of bde 153 was distinctly different between aerobic 7 58 and anaerobic biodegradation 3 50 in laboratory experiments wang et al 2021 2020 in addition the significant difference in ε c value also occurred for the animal metabolic transformation ε c 0 86 and photo transformation ε c 1 73 of bde 153 ren et al 2021 tang et al 2017 the nondestructive processes such as adsorption evaporation and dilution were reported to be generally unable to cause the significant isotope fractionation of organic contaminants bombach et al 2010 illman and alvarez 2009 thus csia can be used to accurate characterize degradation of pbdes and distinguish the different degradation pathways in recent years an increasing number of studies reported that the additional effects could influence the observed isotope fractionation such as masking derived from the rate limiting steps preceding bond cleavage e g mass transfer and binding to the enzyme and superimposed isotope effects of multiple chemical reactions liu et al 2019 renpenning et al 2014 2015 the ε value can be altered not only by different degradation pathways but also by these additional effects and thus it is uncertain that whether the different ε values between experiments with only one element csia are attributed to different degradation mechanisms or these additional effects on the contrary dual element isotope analysis allowed to correlate changes in isotope ratios of both elements and the dual isotope slope λ was not affected by the masking effects huang et al 2021 lihl et al 2019 liu et al 2020c hence dual element isotope analysis can offer a more reliable distinction for the different reaction mechanisms dual c cl and c br isotope analysis has been widely used to pinpoint out the underlying degradation mechanisms for the microbial degradation of halide hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane palau et al 2017b tetrachloroethene badin et al 2014 ethylene dibromide kuntze et al 2016 polychlorinated phenols aeppli et al 2013 and hexachlorocyclohexane liu et al 2020c the different degradation mechanisms could lead to significantly different λ values for the same bond cleavage within the same substrate and λ could even be used to evaluate the relative contribution of different degradation pathways in the field environment kuntze et al 2016 lihl et al 2019 however so far there was no information on the dual element stable isotope analysis for pbde biodegradation this is a major bottleneck for the application of csia to discovery the underling mechanisms behind the pbde microbial degradation in the environment hence in order to fill the knowledge gaps anaerobic microbial reductive biodegradation of pbdes were explored by the dual c br csia in wetland bottom water in the present study bde 47 and bde 153 the widespread congeners detected in high levels in wetland chai et al 2019 ren et al 2019 were selected as targeted contaminants it was documented that pbde congeners shared the similar debromination pathways and reaction mechanisms in the anaerobic microbial degradation robrock et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 thus selecting the prevalent congeners as the targets was representative in the wetland bottom water the bottom water from liaohe coastal wetland were selected as the incubation matrix the main objective of this study was 1 to explore the biodegradation kinetics and pathways 2 to investigate the c and br isotope fractionation patterns and determine the ε c and ε br for bde 47 and bde 153 during the anaerobic reductive debromination 3 to reveal the reaction mechanisms based on the dual c br λ and apparent kinetic isotope kinetic akie values to the best of our knowledge this was the first report on br isotope fractionation for pbdes during the biodegradation and the dual c br cisa was also first applied to decipher the underlying reaction mechanisms for pbde biodegradation meanwhile the dual c br cisa reported in this study can also be applied in other degradation modes of pbdes and then to evaluate the potency of dual c br cisa to distinguish different reaction pathways of pbdes in the field environment such as anaerobic and aerobic transformation photo transformation hydrolysis and oxidative transformation in the future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bde 47 analytical purity 100 and bde 153 analytical purity 98 6 were purchased from accustandard inc usa a mixture standard of pbdes containing 37 congeners from mono bde to deca bde was also purchased from accustandard inc which was used for the identification of debromination products n hexane dichloromethane ethyl alcohol and isooctane were all of high performance liquid chromatography grade analytical purity 99 0 and provided by j k chemicals beijing china 2 2 water samples bottom water samples 30 50 cm were collected from the liaohe coastal wetland north china the wetland bottom water was in anoxic conditions with the redox potential in the range of 163 199 mv the water samples were passed through 100 μm filter membrane to remove large impurity and stored at 4 c for further use 2 3 anaerobic microbial degradation experiments water microcosms were set up in 250 ml serum bottles prior to the biodegradation experiment the serum bottles were prepared with 150 ml water sample flushed with n2 co2 70 30 gas mixture for 10 min to remove oxygen and placed in the anaerobic chamber for two weeks to active the intrinsic microorganisms after that 100 μl of bde 47 1 5 mg l in n hexane bde 153 stock solution 1 2 mg l in n hexane was spiked into the bottle to construct the treatments as 1 water spiked with bde 47 and 2 water spiked with bde 153 the volume of each sample was 150 ml the initial concentrations of bde 47 and bde 153 were 1 0 and 0 8 μg l respectively to simulate the severely contaminated water in coastal wetland the pbde spiked water was shaken thoroughly to ensure homogenous mixture the yeast extract was added as the electron donor with the excessive amount 1 0 ml 0 2 g l in both bde 47 and bde 153 cultivation systems to ensure provide enough electron during the biodegradation to maintain the anaerobic condition the headspace of bottles was filled with n2 co2 70 30 gas mixture and sealed gastight with teflon coated stoppers all of the bottles were wrapped by aluminum foil and incubated in dark environment at room temperature in anaerobic chamber to monitor the abiotic effects the sterilized controls were prepared and incubated with the same way as described above except that the pbde spiked water was autoclaved at 121 c for 3 h and then added hgcl2 and nan3 to inhibit the intrinsic microbial activity each set of the batch experiments had 33 bottles and the sample time was day 0 20 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 and 270 for each sampling the water in three bottles were all collected as the triplicates and the microbial reaction was stopped by addition of saturated na2so4 solution ph 1 0 acidified with h2so4 after sampling the water was immediately processed for the analysis of pbde concentrations degradation products and stable isotope compositions 2 4 sample pretreatment and instrumental analysis the sample extraction stable carbon and bromine isotope analysis were based on the previous studies kozell et al 2015 wang et al 2021 zakon et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 with the details in supporting information si briefly the water was extracted with the mixture of n hexane and dichloromethane 1 1 v v for three times a quarter of the extractions was used for analysis of concentrations and degradation products two quarters used for the stable carbon isotope analysis and the rest was used for the bromine isotope analysis no changes in carbon and bromine isotope compositions were detected during the

groups of parallel experiments along with six procedural blanks for the analysis of concentrations no target compounds were detected in the procedural blanks and thus the results were not black corrected pcb 209 was selected as the surrogate and added into sample before the extraction the surrogate recoveries in all samples ranged from 80 7 to 106 2 the relative standard deviations of concentrations of bde 47 and 153 were less than 11 8 for the analysis of stable carbon and bromine isotopes a pbde standard mixture bde 28 47 99 100 153 154 and 183 was tested daily to ensure the stability of instruments and the relative percentage variations were less than 0 3 for δ 13c values and 0 1 for δ 81br of all the pbde congeners prior to the instrumental analysis another standard of bde 77 with the known δ 13c and 81br 79br values were added into the extraction the online measured δ 13c and δ 81br values were 28 18 0 17 and 0 9734 0 0002 which were both closed to the true values 28 21 for δ 13c and 0 9733 for 81br 79br indicating the high reliability of instruments the injection amount of bde 47 and 153 should be larger than 100 ng which could generate quantitatively chromatographic peak peak intensity 800 mv in the gc c irms and gc mc icpms 2 6 isotope enrichment factor ε apparent kinetic isotope effect akie and dual c br isotope slope λc br values for the cleavage of c br bond bonds with lighter isotopes react slightly faster than the ones with heavier isotopes leading to the change in isotope ratios in the residual pbdes known as isotope fractionation tang et al 2017 ε c and ε br represent the extent of stable carbon and bromine isotope fractionation during the c br bond cleavage of pbdes the simplified rayleigh equation was used to quantify the stable isotope fractionation during the microbial degradation in the present study carbon and bromine isotope enrichment factors were derived from the linearized rayleigh equation as shown in eq 3 torrentó et al 2017 3 l n r t r 0 ln δ e t 1 δ e 0 1 ε e l n f where r t and r 0 are the isotope ratios of the element 13c 12c or 81br 79br at the given time t and the beginning time 0 respectively e is the considered element c or br δet and δe0 are the isotope composition values of the element at the given time t and the beginning time 0 respectively ε e is the stable isotope enrichment factor of considered element f is the remaining fraction of bde 47 or bde 153 the kinetic isotope effect kie refers to the ratio of l k and h k where l k and h k are the reaction rates of molecules containing the light and heavy isotopes of one element palau et al 2014b isotope enrichment factor introduced to the kie leads to the akie which takes into the effect of nonreacting positions and reaction positions which are in intramolecular competition for the targeted element badin et al 2014 liu et al 2020c for the cleavage of a given chemical bond the akie value of related element is depended on the reaction mechanism i e the different mechanisms lead to different akie values palau et al 2014b torrentó et al 2017 to get more insight into the mechanisms underlying the reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 the akie values of carbon and bromine were simultaneously investigated to accurately reveal the reaction mechanisms of c br bond cleavage akie was calculated as shown in eq 4 liu et al 2020c 4 a k i e e 1 1 z n x ε e where n is the number of atoms of considered element in bde 47 or bde 153 x is the number of reaction sites z is the number of indistinguishable reaction sites dual carbon bromine isotope plots were expressed as the correlation of δ 13c and δ 81br and the λc br was the slope of the linear regression λc br was a sensitive indicator to distinguish the different reaction mechanisms of c br bond cleavage horst et al 2019 kuntze et al 2016 and was also calculated in the present study as shown in eq 5 kuntze et al 2016 lihl et al 2019 5 λ c b r δ 13 c

degradation were investigated in the bottom water from liaohe coastal wetland north china fig 1 in the sterilized water there were no significant changes in concentrations for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiments with the residual fractions fluctuating between 96 4 and 99 8 however in the water with intrinsic microbes the residual fractions of bde 47 and bde 153 showed the gradually decreasing trend along the incubation at day 270 the residual fraction of bde 47 and bde 153 was decreased to 37 6 and 21 9 respectively the degradation degree of bde 153 was higher than that of bde 47 in agreement with the result from the anaerobic wetland sediments wang et al 2021 to get insight into the degradation kinetics the biodegradation of bde 47 and 153 both followed a pseudo first order kinetic with r 2 0 94 fig 1 red line the degradation rate constant was 0 006 day 1 for bde 47 which was lower than that of bde 153 0 008 day 1 these results might indicate that the higher degradation potential of higher brominated congeners than lower brominated congeners in the anaerobic microbial degradation which was also found in other previous studies wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 in addition the degradation rate constant was 0 006 day 1 for bde 47 and 0 008 day 1 for bde 153 which was much lower than those 0 009 0 091 day 1 in the coastal wetland sediments and fresh water sediments pan et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 this discrepancy might be attributed to the lower contents of organic matters some constituents as electron donors and abundance of microbes in water than sediments in the non sterilized bottom water the lower brominated congeners were detected during the incubation period whilst not in sterilized bottom water further evidencing that the intrinsic microorganisms were the major contributor for the loss of bde 47 and bde 153 in the anaerobic conditions the stepwise debromination was reported for the microbial degradation of pbdes robrock et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 bde 17 and bde 28 as tri bdes were detected as the degradation products of bde 47 fig s1a indicating the removal of one bromine in the para or ortho position as the process for bde 47 degradation due to the higher concentration of bde 15 than bde 28 the para debromination was the main degradation pathway consistent with the results in the wetland sediments chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 with regard to bde 153 penta bdes bde 101 and bde 99 and tetra bdes bde 52 and bde 49 were detected as the degradation products fig s1b indicating that bde 153 underweight two consecutive debromination processes bde 153 was first debrominated to bde 101 and bde 99 via the removal of bromine in the para and meta positions respectively and para debromination was the main step with higher concentrations of bde 101 than bde 99 fig s1b bde 101 and bde 99 were further transformed to bde 52 and bde 49 via the both removal of bromine in para position respectively meanwhile bde 101 could also be further transformed to bde49 by the removal of bromine in meta position these results corresponded to the decrease in concentrations for bde 101 and bde 99 in the later period of incubation fig s1b combined the above results the postulated degradation pathways of pbdes were suggested in the anaerobic bottom water fig s2 the substituted position of bromine affected the debromination of pbdes during the microbial degradation and the removal potential was para position ortho meta position in agreement with the previous studies wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 it was reported that the steric hindrance and local charge of target carbon were two major factors influencing the debromination of pbdes in the reductive conditions field and sierra alvarez 2008 zhuang et al 2012 the local charge of carbon in the para position was higher than that in ortho meta position for both bde 47 and bde 153 and the bromine in ortho meta position was reported to be more easily removed than para position in the anaerobic photodegradation for pbdes guo et al 2019 which was different from our present results thus in the present study the differences in removal ability of bromine in different positions should be attributed to the steric hindrance and the bromine in ortho position was more stable in anaerobic microbial degradation of pbdes zeng et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 mass balance was calculated as the relative percentages of total mass of detected debromination products and parent target at the intermediate time to the mass at the initial time tables s2 and s3 for bde 47 and bde 153 the calculated mass balances overall showed the decreasing trends with increasing the incubation time at the end of 270 day incubation the calculated mass balances of bde 47 and bde 153 were 95 6 and 90 9 respectively which were both lower than those in sterilized water 96 4 for bde 47 and 96 7 for bde 153 these results implied that other transformation products might occur besides the debromination products during the anaerobic microbial degradation due to the degradation experiments at the dark environment the hydrolysis of bde 47 and bde 153 might occur during the anaerobic incubation which should be verified by the hrlc hrms ms in the further studies 3 2 carbon and bromine isotope fractionation associated with anaerobic biodegradation and comparison with other degradation pathways carbon isotope fractionation carbon isotope signatures of bde 47 and bde 153 were measured at different stages of anaerobic degradation during the period of 270 day incubation fig 2 violet triangle the initial δ 13c values were 26 7 for bde 47 and 29 4 for bde 153 in sterilized controls no significant changes in δ 13c values were detected for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiment however δ 13c values of bde 47 and bde 153 both showed a trend to more positive values reflecting an enrichment in 13c over 12c in non sterilized water for example at the end of experiment the δ 13c value was enriched to 21 2 and 22 0 after approximate 62 3 of bde 47 and 78 1 of bde 153 transformation respectively combined with the changes in concentrations the above results confirmed that only biodegradation could induce the carbon isotope fractionation of bde 47 and bde 153 in anaerobic bottom water for both congeners carbon isotope fractionation was well described by the raileigh model with r 2 values 0 97 fig 3 violet line there was no statistically significant difference in the determined ε c values between bde 47 and bde 153 with 5 98 0 12 for bde 47 and 5 57 0 24 for bde 153 table 1 indicating the similar debromination mechanism between these two congeners however these ε c values in the present study were all higher than those 4 50 for bde 47 and 3 50 for bde 153 reported in anaerobic wetland sediments from the same area in our previous study wang et al 2021 this discrepancy indicated that the anaerobic microbial degradation varied in different environmental matrices even for the same pbde congeners to date the information on the carbon isotope fractionation of pbdes associated with the degradation was limited and the reported ε c values were mainly focused on bde 153 the ε c value of bde 153 in the present study was lower than that in the aerobic degradation 7 58 wang et al 2020 but much higher than that in metabolism in fish oscar 1 60 and common carp 0 86 tang et al 2018 2017 and photodegradation by simulated sunlight 1 73 ren et al 2021 which indicated the potential for applying carbon isotope fractionation to characterize different degradation modes however the ε c value of bde 153 in the photodegradation was comparable to that in the metabolism in oscar fish within the analytical uncertainty of 0 5 tang et al 2017 in addition in the heterogenous environment of field sites the isotope fractionation can be masked by the rate limiting steps preceding dehalogenation such as substrate enzyme binding mass transfer into the cell and phase transfer and the ε values could not characterize the bond cleavage badin et al 2014 droz et al 2021 liu et al 2019 renpenning et al 2014 therefore based on only carbon isotope fractionation it would be difficult to completely distinguish different degradation mechanism in the field to find an evaluation parameter that is more sensitive to differentiating reaction mechanisms simultaneous analysis of dual or multiple element stable isotopes are urgently needed for targeted contaminants bromine isotope fractionation similar to carbon the bromine isotope composition overall remained constant along the incubation time in the sterilized controls fig 2 hollow diamond however the significant enrichment in heavy bromine isotope i e 81br over 79br was observed for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiments fig 2 solid diamond confirming the c br bond cleavage in the degradation due to no relative standard the δ 81br was calculated relatively to the bromine isotope ratio at time 0 eq 2 thus the initial δ 81br values of bde 47 and bde 153 were both zero when the remaining fraction was 37 6 for bde 47 and 21 9 for bde 153 at the end of experiments the δ 81br values were enriched to 2 43 and 3 20 respectively the δ 81br values versus remaining fraction were also well described by a raileigh isotope fractionation trend r 2 0 96 fig 3 orange line and the derived ε br values of bde 47 and bde 153 were 2 44 0 09 and 2 06 0 12 respectively table 1 although the similarity in reductive debromination the ε br value of bde 153 was slightly lower than that of bde 47 the occurrence of secondary isotope effects was documented for the dehalogenation of organic pollutants and the halogen atom in the adjacent non reaction position could stabilize the transition stage leading to the dilution of normal halogen isotope fractionation liu et al 2020c palau et al 2014b due to the occurrence of bromine adjacent to the reactive position for bde 153 the secondary bromine isotope effect should contribute to the lower ε br value of bde 153 for both of bde 47 and bde 153 the carbon isotope fractionation was larger than bromine isotope fraction ε c ε br in the anaerobic microbial degradation table 1 which was consistent with the reported results of anaerobic biodegradation of ethylene dibromide kuntze et al 2016 hexachlorocyclohexane liu et al 2020b 2020c chloroethane and chloroethene lihl et al 2019 palau et al 2017a 2017b this phenomenon was expected because of the larger primary carbon isotope effects than halogen during the cleavage of carbon halogen bond in the anaerobic biodegradation elsner et al 2005 palau et al 2017b to the best of our knowledge only one study had reported the bromine isotope fractionation for the pbde transformation and the ε br of bde 99 was reported to be 3 0 in the photodegradation huang et al 2020 which was slightly higher than bde 47 and bde 153 however the instrumental measurement method of bromine isotope composition was different and the analytical targets were also different between these two studies thus the discrepancy in ε br values could not be directly used as a powerful evidence for distinguishing the two different kinds of degradation pathways in order to overcome the bottleneck the bromine isotope effects of pbde congeners should be investigated for various transformation modes in the future studies 3 3 dual element isotope patterns and comparison with other brominated organic contaminants carbon and bromine isotope data of bde 47 and bde 153 for the anaerobic biodegradation were combined in the dual c br isotope plots with the significant linear correlation between δ 13c and δ 81br r 2 0 98 fig 4 the λc br value of bde 47 0 436 reported as the slope of dual c br isotope plot was almost identical to bde 153 0 435 table 1 confirming the similar reaction mechanism for the debromination during the biodegradation compared to ε c and ε br λc br was more identical between bde 47 and bde 153 and thus was more reliable to characterize the debromination transformation of pbdes this result was also reported for other halogenated compounds because λ could cancel out the isotope masking effect during the microbial degradation liu et al 2020c wiegert et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge the λc br associated with pbde biodegradation has not been reported yet only one study reported the λc br values of 0 564 for bde 99 in the photodegradation which was higher than those reported in the present study huang et al 2020 due to the very limited information on pbdes the λc br values of pbdes in the present study were compared to those of other brominated organic compounds table 2 zakon et al 2013 reported the carbon and bromine isotope fractionation of 4 bromophenol during the photolysis in water and the λc br value was 0 174 due to the inverse bromine isotope effect kozell et al 2015 applied dual carbon bromine isotope analysis to probe abiotic transformation of tribromoneopentyl alcohol and the λc br value was 0 038 0 250 and 0 for alkaline hydrolysis reductive debromination by zero valent iron nanoparticles and oxidative degradation by h2o2 in the presence of cuo nanoparticles the λc br value of ethylene dibromide was reported to be 0 034 for alkaline hydrolysis 0 for oxidation by fenton reagent 0 230 for transformation by corrinoid cofactors 0 193 for reduction with zero valent zn nanoparticles 0 087 for aerobic biodegradation and 0 433 for anaerobic biodegradation kuntze et al 2016 from the comparison it was obvious that although the target brominated compounds were different the λc br value was similar for the same transformation pathway for example the λc br was 0 for the oxidation degradation 0 03 for alkaline hydrolysis and 0 43 for anaerobic degradation in addition there was difference in λc br values among different transformation pathways indicating the transformation pathway depended λc b for brominated organic compounds this phenomenon was also found for the chlorinated organic compounds via the dual c cl isotope analysis palau et al 2017a 2017b torrentó et al 2017 overall this pronounced difference in λc br values indicated the high potential of application of dual c br isotope analysis to distinguish the transformation pathways of pbdes in field sites 3 4 postulated reaction mechanism of c br bond cleavage insight from stable isotope analysis in the anaerobic reductive conditions the stepwise debromination was reported to be the main degradation pathways for pbdes robrock et al 2008 tokarz iii et al 2008 however the underlying reactive mechanisms remain ambiguous for the cleavage c br bong of pbdes during the anaerobic biodegradation the mechanisms of anaerobic microbial reductive debromination of chlorinated ethenes and aromatic compounds were wildly reported to be associated with the formation of chlorine cobalt bond via the interaction between cobalt corrinoid dependent enzymes and chlorinated compounds heckel et al 2018 liang et al 2014 lihl et al 2019 due to the similarity in chemical structures between brominated and chlorinated organic compounds three fundamental mechanistic scaffolds were proposed for pbdes of microbial reductive debromination scheme 1 the same degradation products were obtained via the three different reaction mechanisms so that the general identification of products was far away to probe the mechanistic processes during the microbial degradation an insight into the underlying isotope fractionation effects can allow to overcome this difficulty to better elucidation of the reaction mechanisms akies were calculated to quantitatively characterize the isotope effects of rupture of chemical bond at the reactive positions by removing the dilution effect caused by nonreaction positions and intramolecular competition the akie c was calculated based on the eq 4 and n 12 x z 4 and n 12 x z 6 were applied for bde 47 and bde 153 respectively the calculated akie c was 1 0773 for bde 47 and 1 0716 for bde 153 which was close to the reported range of 1 010 1 070 for the reductive cleavage of c br bond by considering the analytical uncertainty 0 01 koster van groos et al 2018 kuder et al 2012 kuntze et al 2016 for bromine isotope effect the values of akie br were calculated as 1 0098 and 1 0125 for bde 47 and bde 153 respectively these values were in the upper range of the reported akie br values associated with c br bond cleavage kozell et al 2015 kuder et al 2012 kuntze et al 2016 the high values of akie c and akie br indicated the occurrence of both carbon and bromine primary isotope effects and the initial cleavage of c br bond was the rate limiting step in the present study in the electrophilic aromatic substitution scheme 1a the mechanism consists the initial addition of a proton to the aromatic ring followed by addition of the cofactor and the transient formation of a halogen cobalamin was the rate determining step liang et al 2014 consequently the electrophilic aromatic substitution was not the underlying reaction mechanism for the anaerobic biodegradation of pbdes due to the large isotope fractionation of carbon and bromine in the present study for nucleophilic scheme 1b and homolytic aromatic substitution scheme 1c both of the reaction mechanisms involve the initial formation of cobalamin bromine bond simultaneously concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond and the primary carbon and bromine isotope effects were expected badin et al 2014 liang et al 2014 however the modes of electron transfer were different between the two different reaction mechanisms with inner sphere electron transfer for nucleophilic aromatic substitution and outer sphere single electron transfer for homolytic aromatic substitution badin et al 2014 liang et al 2014 in a recent study on degradation of chlorinated ethene reductive outer sphere single electron transfer was reported to be an exception rather than the rule in natural and engineered chlorinated ethene dichlorination and the chlorine isotope effect was nonexistent heckel et al 2017 due to the pronounced bromine isotope fractionation the homolytic aromatic substitution was also not the underlying reaction mechanism and the nucleophilic aromatic substitution seemed more plausible for pbde biodegradation in the present study to date some limited studies reported the carbon and bromine isotope effect associated with the nucleophilic substitution reaction of brominated aliphatic compounds for example kuder et al 2012 reported akie c 1 07 for nucleophilic substitution of 1 2 dibromoethane for the abiotic debromination of ethylene dibromide followed by nucleophilic substitution kuntze et al 2016 reported akie c 1 062 and akie br 1 002 the values observed for reaction of tribromoneopentyl alcohol in aqueous alkaline solution by nucleophilic substitution were calculated as akie c 1 052 and akie br 1 001 kozell et al 2015 in addition for microbial degradation of 1 2 dichloroethane the values of akie c 1 068 and akie cl 1 009 were documented for nucleophilic substitution palau et al 2014a these akie c values were in good agreement with the values obtained in the present study however the akie br values were slightly lower than our results which might be attributed to the secondary bromine isotope effects liu et al 2020c palau et al 2014b it was documented that although the differences in c br versus c cl bond vibration frequencies and in reduced masses of br versus cl the slight differences in the ratio of halogen and carbon isotope effects were anticipated for c br and c cl bond cleavage elsner et al 2005 kozell et al 2015 coupled with the limited data on bromine stable isotope the dual c br stable isotope of targeted compounds was always compared to the dual c cl stable isotope of other chlorinated organic compounds during the transformation in the previous studies kozell et al 2015 kuntze et al 2016 for the microbial degradation the chlorinated and brominated organic pollutants shared the similar transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms in most cases to date only one study reported the λc br values of organic brominated compounds in the biodegradation and the λc br was 0 433 for ethylene dibromide followed by nucleophilic substitution kuntze et al 2016 which was similar to those in the present study to further confirm reaction mechanism as accurately as possible the λc br values of dual c br isotope effects were compared with the biotic reductive dehalogenation of other halogenated compounds the λc br values of bde 47 0 435 and bde 153 0 435 agreed well with those of tetrachloroethene 0 35 0 11 and trichloroethene 0 37 0 11 for microbial reductive dichlorination followed by nucleophilic substitution lihl et al 2019 wiegert et al 2013 consequently all of the above good consistence between the present study and other previous studies confirmed that the dissociation of c br bond was the rate determining step and the nucleophilic aromatic substitution was the main reaction mechanism with addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer for the anaerobic microbial reductive debromination of pbdes in the wetland bottom water 4 conclusion the present study aimed to probe the underlying reaction mechanism of pbdes with the anaerobic microbial reductive debromination by dual carbon bromine isotope analysis in the wetland bottom water the degradation of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the pseudo first order kinetic model and the degradation rate of bde 153 with the more substituted bromine was higher than that of bde 47 with the less substituted bromine stepwise debromination was the main degradation pathway for both bde 47 and bde 153 with the preferential remove of bromine in para position meta ortho position the pronounced isotope fractionation was found for carbon and bromine of bde 47 and bde 153 during the microbial degradation indicating the cleavage of c br bond as the rate determining step the similar ε c and ε br was obtained for bde 47 and bde 153 indicating the expected similar reaction mechanism compared to ε c and ε br the λc br of dual carbon bromine isotope effects was more sensitive to distinguish the different degradation pathways and relevant reaction mechanisms based on the identification of degradation products and dual carbon bromine isotope analysis the anaerobic reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the nucleophilic aromatic substitution with the addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer in summary the present study indicated that dual carbon bromine isotope analysis was a robust method to probe the reaction mechanisms of pbdes in the field site however the analysis of carbon and bromine stable isotope of pbdes is still limited for other degradation pathways such as aerobic degradation oxidation hydrolysis and reduction by fe 0 zn 0 and need to be investigated in further studies in addition the stable carbon and bromine isotope ratios were not detected for debromination products given that most organic contaminants exist as intermediates in the field environment the isotope fractionation of intermediates is also controlled by the chemical bond cleavage and formation thus more key information could be obtained by exploring the variations in isotope compositions of degradation products in the future studies which is helpful for accurately verify the transformation pathways and

16453,polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes one kind of persistent organic pollutants were widely detected in coastal wetlands microbial reductive debromination is one of the most important attenuation processes for pbdes in anaerobic environment whereas the underlying reaction mechanisms remain elusive dual element stable isotope analysis was recently recognized to distinguish different reaction mechanism for degradation of organic pollutants in this study the dual carbon bromine isotope effects associated with the anaerobic microbial degradation were first investigated to characterize the reaction mechanisms for bde 47 and bde 153 presence of lower brominated congeners indicated stepwise debromination as the main degradation pathway with the preferential removal of bromine in para position meta ortho position the pronounced isotope fractionation was observed for both carbon and bromine with similar carbon ε c and bromine isotope enrichment factor εbr between bde 47 ε c 5 98 ε br 2 44 and bde 153 ε c 5 57 ε br 2 06 during the microbial degradation compared to ε c and ε br the correlation of carbon and isotope effects λc br δδ 81br δδ 13c was almost the same between bde 47 0 436 and bde 153 0 435 indicating the similar reaction mechanism the calculated carbon and bromine apparent kinetic isotope effects akie c and akie br were 1 0773 and 1 0098 for bde 47 and 1 0716 and 1 0125 for bde 153 within range reported for degradation of halogenated compounds following nucleophilic substitution combination analysis of degradation products λc br and akie all the results pointed to that the anaerobic reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the nucleophilic aromatic substitution with the addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer and the cleavage of c br bond was the rate determining step this study contributed to the development of dual carbon bromine isotope analysis as a robust approach to probe the fate of pbdes in contaminated sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial reductive debromination dual carbon bromine isotope analysis nucleophilic aromatic substitution polybrominated diphenyl ethers wetland bottom water 1 introduction polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes one typical kind of the brominated flame retardants have been widely used in various domestic and industrial products over the past five decades including plastics textiles wires cables and electronics lu et al 2021 zhen et al 2021 between 1970 and 2020 it was documented that the consumption volume was approximate 46 000 2500 and 380 000 tones for the commercial penta octa and deca bde respectively in the united states and canada abbasi et al 2015 china began to produce pbdes in the 1980s and became one of the major manufacturers for deca bde from 2000 abbasi et al 2019 the massive application of pbdes leads to the ubiquitous contamination in various environmental matrices over the world such as sediments deng et al 2021 lu et al 2021 soils jeon et al 2021 oloruntoba et al 2021 water liu et al 2020a zhen et al 2021 animals and human tissues addison et al 2020 pietron et al 2021 pbdes have the potential of bioaccumulation and biomagnification through the food webs and are associated with the neurotoxicity endocrine disruption reproductive toxicity and potential carcinogenicity to humans hurley et al 2019 kicinski et al 2012 leijs et al 2012 therefore the widespread detection and adverse effects of pbdes have raised the increasing concern over their behaviors and fates in the environment microbe mediated degradation is one of the importantly natural attenuation processes for pbdes in various environmental matrices wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 in anoxic conditions the microbial reductive debromination is the predominant pathway for pbde transformation and the higher brominated pbdes can be degraded into lower brominated congeners via the stepwise debromination robrock et al 2008 tokarz iii et al 2008 the diverse anaerobic organohalide respiring bacterial including dehalococcoides spp desulfovibrio spp and dehalogenimonas spp were reported to utilize pbdes as electron acceptors and hydrogen or organic acid as electron donor to support their growth during the debromination lee et al 2011 zhao et al 2018 the responsible enzymes belonging to reductive dehalogenase in the anaerobic organohalide respiring bacterial are known to contain a corrinoid and two iron sulfur centers as cofactors badin et al 2014 bommer et al 2014 lihl et al 2019 payne et al 2015 generally three possible reaction mechanisms associated with the active corrinoid cofactor are proposed for the microbial reductive dehalogenation of aromatic halides in anaerobic environment 1 the electrophilic aromatic substitution involving initial addition of a proton to the aromatic ring followed by addition of the cofactor scheme 1a 2 the nucleophilic aromatic substitution involving addition of the cofactor to the aromatic ring followed by elimination of bromine scheme 1b and 3 the homolytic aromatic substitution involving initial formation of a benzyl radical ion intermediate upon dissociative release of bromine scheme 1c aeppli et al 2013 liang et al 2011 2014 to date most of the studies mainly focused on the anaerobic microbial degradation of pbdes in the sediments and soils chen et al 2018 song et al 2015 zhu et al 2014 and information is scarce in the water more importantly characterization of the reaction mechanisms underlying the reductive debromination of pbdes is still a scientific challenge in the field environment because the same degradation product can be formed via different degradation mechanisms which is beyond the conventional method based on concentration and product identification therefore comprehensive approaches are urgently needed for insight into the mechanistic interpretation on pbde anaerobic biodegradation in the field environment during the last two decades compound specific stable isotope analysis csia has evolved as a well established tool to monitor transformation reaction and quantify the transformation processes of organic pollutants in the laboratory and field conditions droz et al 2021 huang et al 2021 liu et al 2020c palau et al 2017b molecules with lighter isotopes in the reaction positions react slightly faster than ones containing heavier isotopes during the reaction leading to enrichment of heavier isotopes in the remaining substrates known as isotope fractionation in our previous studies the stable carbon isotope fractionation of pbdes were reported during the transformation by aerobic and anaerobic microbes and the ε c of bde 153 was distinctly different between aerobic 7 58 and anaerobic biodegradation 3 50 in laboratory experiments wang et al 2021 2020 in addition the significant difference in ε c value also occurred for the animal metabolic transformation ε c 0 86 and photo transformation ε c 1 73 of bde 153 ren et al 2021 tang et al 2017 the nondestructive processes such as adsorption evaporation and dilution were reported to be generally unable to cause the significant isotope fractionation of organic contaminants bombach et al 2010 illman and alvarez 2009 thus csia can be used to accurate characterize degradation of pbdes and distinguish the different degradation pathways in recent years an increasing number of studies reported that the additional effects could influence the observed isotope fractionation such as masking derived from the rate limiting steps preceding bond cleavage e g mass transfer and binding to the enzyme and superimposed isotope effects of multiple chemical reactions liu et al 2019 renpenning et al 2014 2015 the ε value can be altered not only by different degradation pathways but also by these additional effects and thus it is uncertain that whether the different ε values between experiments with only one element csia are attributed to different degradation mechanisms or these additional effects on the contrary dual element isotope analysis allowed to correlate changes in isotope ratios of both elements and the dual isotope slope λ was not affected by the masking effects huang et al 2021 lihl et al 2019 liu et al 2020c hence dual element isotope analysis can offer a more reliable distinction for the different reaction mechanisms dual c cl and c br isotope analysis has been widely used to pinpoint out the underlying degradation mechanisms for the microbial degradation of halide hydrocarbons such as dichloroethane palau et al 2017b tetrachloroethene badin et al 2014 ethylene dibromide kuntze et al 2016 polychlorinated phenols aeppli et al 2013 and hexachlorocyclohexane liu et al 2020c the different degradation mechanisms could lead to significantly different λ values for the same bond cleavage within the same substrate and λ could even be used to evaluate the relative contribution of different degradation pathways in the field environment kuntze et al 2016 lihl et al 2019 however so far there was no information on the dual element stable isotope analysis for pbde biodegradation this is a major bottleneck for the application of csia to discovery the underling mechanisms behind the pbde microbial degradation in the environment hence in order to fill the knowledge gaps anaerobic microbial reductive biodegradation of pbdes were explored by the dual c br csia in wetland bottom water in the present study bde 47 and bde 153 the widespread congeners detected in high levels in wetland chai et al 2019 ren et al 2019 were selected as targeted contaminants it was documented that pbde congeners shared the similar debromination pathways and reaction mechanisms in the anaerobic microbial degradation robrock et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 thus selecting the prevalent congeners as the targets was representative in the wetland bottom water the bottom water from liaohe coastal wetland were selected as the incubation matrix the main objective of this study was 1 to explore the biodegradation kinetics and pathways 2 to investigate the c and br isotope fractionation patterns and determine the ε c and ε br for bde 47 and bde 153 during the anaerobic reductive debromination 3 to reveal the reaction mechanisms based on the dual c br λ and apparent kinetic isotope kinetic akie values to the best of our knowledge this was the first report on br isotope fractionation for pbdes during the biodegradation and the dual c br cisa was also first applied to decipher the underlying reaction mechanisms for pbde biodegradation meanwhile the dual c br cisa reported in this study can also be applied in other degradation modes of pbdes and then to evaluate the potency of dual c br cisa to distinguish different reaction pathways of pbdes in the field environment such as anaerobic and aerobic transformation photo transformation hydrolysis and oxidative transformation in the future studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals bde 47 analytical purity 100 and bde 153 analytical purity 98 6 were purchased from accustandard inc usa a mixture standard of pbdes containing 37 congeners from mono bde to deca bde was also purchased from accustandard inc which was used for the identification of debromination products n hexane dichloromethane ethyl alcohol and isooctane were all of high performance liquid chromatography grade analytical purity 99 0 and provided by j k chemicals beijing china 2 2 water samples bottom water samples 30 50 cm were collected from the liaohe coastal wetland north china the wetland bottom water was in anoxic conditions with the redox potential in the range of 163 199 mv the water samples were passed through 100 μm filter membrane to remove large impurity and stored at 4 c for further use 2 3 anaerobic microbial degradation experiments water microcosms were set up in 250 ml serum bottles prior to the biodegradation experiment the serum bottles were prepared with 150 ml water sample flushed with n2 co2 70 30 gas mixture for 10 min to remove oxygen and placed in the anaerobic chamber for two weeks to active the intrinsic microorganisms after that 100 μl of bde 47 1 5 mg l in n hexane bde 153 stock solution 1 2 mg l in n hexane was spiked into the bottle to construct the treatments as 1 water spiked with bde 47 and 2 water spiked with bde 153 the volume of each sample was 150 ml the initial concentrations of bde 47 and bde 153 were 1 0 and 0 8 μg l respectively to simulate the severely contaminated water in coastal wetland the pbde spiked water was shaken thoroughly to ensure homogenous mixture the yeast extract was added as the electron donor with the excessive amount 1 0 ml 0 2 g l in both bde 47 and bde 153 cultivation systems to ensure provide enough electron during the biodegradation to maintain the anaerobic condition the headspace of bottles was filled with n2 co2 70 30 gas mixture and sealed gastight with teflon coated stoppers all of the bottles were wrapped by aluminum foil and incubated in dark environment at room temperature in anaerobic chamber to monitor the abiotic effects the sterilized controls were prepared and incubated with the same way as described above except that the pbde spiked water was autoclaved at 121 c

groups of parallel experiments along with six procedural blanks for the analysis of concentrations no target compounds were detected in the procedural blanks and thus the results were not black corrected pcb 209 was selected as the surrogate and added into sample before the extraction the surrogate recoveries in all samples ranged from 80 7 to 106 2 the relative standard deviations of concentrations of bde 47 and 153 were less than 11 8 for the analysis of stable carbon and bromine isotopes a pbde standard mixture bde 28 47 99 100 153 154 and 183 was tested daily to ensure the

bde 77 with the known δ 13c and 81br 79br values were added into the extraction the online measured δ 13c and δ 81br values were 28 18 0 17 and 0 9734 0 0002 which were both closed to the true values 28 21 for δ 13c and 0 9733 for 81br 79br indicating the high reliability of instruments the injection amount of bde 47 and 153 should be larger than 100 ng which could generate quantitatively chromatographic peak peak intensity 800 mv in the gc c irms and gc mc icpms 2 6 isotope enrichment factor ε apparent kinetic isotope effect akie and dual c br isotope slope λc br values for the cleavage of c br bond bonds with lighter isotopes react slightly faster than the ones with heavier isotopes leading to the change in isotope ratios in the residual pbdes known as isotope fractionation tang et al 2017 ε c and ε br represent the extent of stable carbon and bromine isotope fractionation during the c br bond cleavage of pbdes the simplified rayleigh equation was used to quantify the stable isotope fractionation during the microbial degradation in the present study carbon and bromine isotope enrichment factors were derived from the linearized rayleigh equation as shown in eq 3 torrentó et al 2017 3 l n r t r 0 ln δ e t 1 δ e 0 1 ε e l n f where r t and r 0 are the isotope ratios of the element 13c 12c or 81br 79br at the given time t and the beginning time 0 respectively e is the considered element c or br δet and δe0 are the isotope composition values of the element at the given time t and the beginning time 0 respectively ε e is the stable isotope enrichment factor of considered element f is the remaining fraction of bde 47 or bde 153 the kinetic isotope effect kie refers to the ratio of l k and h k where l k and h k are the reaction rates of molecules containing the light and heavy isotopes of one element palau et al 2014b isotope enrichment factor introduced to the kie leads to the akie which takes into the effect of nonreacting positions and reaction positions which are in intramolecular competition for the targeted element badin et al 2014 liu et al 2020c for the cleavage of a given chemical bond the akie value of related element is depended on the reaction mechanism i e the different mechanisms lead to different akie values palau et al 2014b torrentó et al 2017 to get more insight into the mechanisms underlying the reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 the akie values of carbon and bromine were simultaneously investigated to accurately reveal the reaction mechanisms of c br bond cleavage akie was calculated as shown in eq 4 liu et al 2020c 4 a k i e e 1 1 z n x ε e where n is the number of atoms of considered element in bde 47 or bde 153 x is the number of reaction sites z is the number of indistinguishable reaction sites dual carbon bromine isotope plots were expressed as the correlation of δ 13c and δ 81br and the λc br was the slope of the linear regression λc br was a sensitive indicator to distinguish the different reaction mechanisms of c br bond cleavage horst et al 2019 kuntze et al 2016 and was also calculated in the present study as shown in eq 5 kuntze et al 2016 lihl et al 2019 5 λ c b r δ 13 c t δ 13 c 0 δ 81 b r t δ 81 b r 0 ε c ε b r 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic biodegradation kinetics and products the natural attenuations of bde 47 and bde 153 by the anaerobic microbial degradation were investigated in the bottom water from liaohe coastal wetland north china fig 1 in the sterilized water there were no significant changes in concentrations for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiments with the residual fractions fluctuating between 96 4 and 99 8 however in the water with intrinsic microbes the residual fractions of bde 47 and bde 153 showed the gradually decreasing trend along the incubation at day 270 the residual fraction of bde 47 and bde 153 was decreased to 37 6 and 21 9 respectively the degradation degree of bde 153 was higher than that of bde 47 in agreement with the result from the anaerobic wetland sediments wang et al 2021 to get insight into the degradation kinetics the biodegradation of bde 47 and 153 both followed a pseudo first order kinetic with r 2 0 94 fig 1 red line the degradation rate constant was 0 006 day 1 for bde 47 which was lower than that of bde 153 0 008 day 1 these results might indicate that the higher degradation potential of higher brominated congeners than lower brominated congeners in the anaerobic microbial degradation which was also found in other previous studies wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 in addition the degradation rate constant was 0 006 day 1 for bde 47 and 0 008 day 1 for bde 153 which was much lower than those 0 009 0 091 day 1 in the coastal wetland sediments and fresh water sediments pan et al 2018 wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 this discrepancy might be attributed to the lower contents of organic matters some constituents as electron donors and abundance of microbes in water than sediments in the non sterilized bottom water the lower brominated congeners were detected during the incubation period whilst not in sterilized bottom water further evidencing that the intrinsic microorganisms were the major contributor for the loss of bde 47 and bde 153 in the anaerobic conditions the stepwise debromination was reported for the microbial degradation of pbdes robrock et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 bde 17 and bde 28 as tri bdes were detected as the degradation products of bde 47 fig s1a indicating the removal of one bromine in the para or ortho position as the process for bde 47 degradation due to the higher concentration of bde 15 than bde 28 the para debromination was the main degradation pathway consistent with the results in the wetland sediments chen et al 2018 wang et al 2021 with regard to bde 153 penta bdes bde 101 and bde 99 and tetra bdes bde 52 and bde 49 were detected as the degradation products fig s1b indicating that bde 153 underweight two consecutive debromination processes bde 153 was first debrominated to bde 101 and bde 99 via the removal of bromine in the para and meta positions respectively and para debromination was the main step with higher concentrations of bde 101 than bde 99 fig s1b bde 101 and bde 99 were further transformed to bde 52 and bde 49 via the both removal of bromine in para position respectively meanwhile bde 101 could also be further transformed to bde49 by the removal of bromine in meta position these results corresponded to the decrease in concentrations for bde 101 and bde 99 in the later period of incubation fig s1b combined the above results the postulated degradation pathways of pbdes were suggested in the anaerobic bottom water fig s2 the substituted position of bromine affected the debromination of pbdes during the microbial degradation and the removal potential was para position ortho meta position in agreement with the previous studies wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2014 it was reported that the steric hindrance and local charge of target carbon were two major factors influencing the debromination of pbdes in the reductive conditions field and sierra alvarez 2008 zhuang et al 2012 the local charge of carbon in the para position was higher than that in ortho meta position for both bde 47 and bde 153 and the bromine in ortho meta position was reported to be more easily removed than para position in the anaerobic photodegradation for pbdes guo et al 2019 which was different from our present results thus in the present study the differences in removal ability of bromine in different positions should be attributed to the steric hindrance and the bromine in ortho position was more stable in anaerobic microbial degradation of pbdes zeng et al 2010 zhu et al 2014 mass balance was calculated as the relative percentages of total mass of detected debromination products and parent target at the intermediate time to the mass at the initial time tables s2 and s3 for bde 47 and bde 153 the calculated mass balances overall showed the decreasing trends with increasing the incubation time at the end of 270 day incubation the calculated mass balances of bde 47 and bde 153 were 95 6 and 90 9 respectively which were both lower than those in sterilized water 96 4 for bde 47 and 96 7 for bde 153 these results implied that other transformation products might occur besides the debromination products during the anaerobic microbial degradation due to the degradation experiments at the dark environment the hydrolysis of bde 47 and bde 153 might occur during the anaerobic incubation which should be verified by the hrlc hrms ms in the further studies 3 2 carbon and bromine isotope fractionation associated with anaerobic biodegradation and comparison with other degradation pathways carbon isotope fractionation carbon isotope signatures of bde 47 and bde 153 were measured at different stages of anaerobic degradation during the period of 270 day incubation fig 2 violet triangle the initial δ 13c values were 26 7 for bde 47 and 29 4 for bde 153 in sterilized controls no significant changes in δ 13c values were detected for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiment however δ 13c values of bde 47 and bde 153 both showed a trend to more positive values reflecting an enrichment in 13c over 12c in non sterilized water for example at the end of experiment the δ 13c value was enriched to 21 2 and 22 0 after approximate 62 3 of bde 47 and 78 1 of bde 153 transformation respectively combined with the changes in concentrations the above results confirmed that only biodegradation could induce the carbon isotope fractionation of bde 47 and bde 153 in anaerobic bottom water for both congeners carbon isotope fractionation was well described by the raileigh model with r 2 values 0 97 fig 3 violet line there was no statistically significant difference in the determined ε c values between bde 47 and bde 153 with 5 98 0 12 for bde 47 and 5 57 0 24 for bde 153 table 1 indicating the similar debromination mechanism between these two congeners however these ε c values in the present study were all higher than those 4 50 for bde 47 and 3 50 for bde 153 reported in anaerobic wetland sediments from the same area in our previous study wang et al 2021 this discrepancy indicated that the anaerobic microbial degradation varied in different environmental matrices even for the same pbde congeners to date the information on the carbon isotope fractionation of pbdes associated with the degradation was limited and the reported ε c values were mainly focused on bde 153 the ε c value of bde 153 in the present study was lower than that in the aerobic degradation 7 58 wang et al 2020 but much higher than that in metabolism in fish oscar 1 60 and common carp 0 86 tang et al 2018 2017 and photodegradation by simulated sunlight 1 73 ren et al 2021 which indicated the potential for applying carbon isotope fractionation to characterize different degradation modes however the ε c value of bde 153 in the photodegradation was comparable to that in the metabolism in oscar fish within the analytical uncertainty of 0 5 tang et al 2017 in addition in the heterogenous environment of field sites the isotope fractionation can be masked by the rate limiting steps preceding dehalogenation such as substrate enzyme binding mass transfer into the cell and phase transfer and the ε values could not characterize the bond cleavage badin et al 2014 droz et al 2021 liu et al 2019 renpenning et al 2014 therefore based on only carbon isotope fractionation it would be difficult to completely distinguish different degradation mechanism in the field to find an evaluation parameter that is more sensitive to differentiating reaction mechanisms simultaneous analysis of dual or multiple element stable isotopes are urgently needed for targeted contaminants bromine isotope fractionation similar to carbon the bromine isotope composition overall remained constant along the incubation time in the sterilized controls fig 2 hollow diamond however the significant enrichment in heavy bromine isotope i e 81br over 79br was observed for both bde 47 and bde 153 during the whole experiments fig 2 solid diamond confirming the c br bond cleavage in the degradation due to no relative standard the δ 81br was calculated relatively to the bromine isotope ratio at time 0 eq 2 thus the initial δ 81br values of bde 47 and bde 153 were both zero when the remaining fraction was 37 6 for bde 47 and 21 9 for bde 153 at the end of experiments the δ 81br values were enriched to 2 43 and 3 20 respectively the δ 81br values versus remaining fraction were also well described by a raileigh isotope fractionation trend r 2 0 96 fig 3 orange line and the derived ε br values of bde 47 and bde 153 were 2 44 0 09 and 2 06 0 12 respectively table 1 although the similarity in reductive debromination the ε br value of bde 153 was slightly lower than that of bde 47 the occurrence of secondary isotope effects was documented for the dehalogenation of organic pollutants and the halogen atom in the adjacent non reaction position could stabilize the transition stage leading to the dilution of normal halogen isotope fractionation liu et al 2020c palau et al 2014b due to the occurrence of bromine adjacent to the reactive position for bde 153 the secondary bromine isotope effect should contribute to the lower ε br value of bde 153 for both of bde 47 and bde 153 the carbon isotope fractionation was larger than bromine isotope fraction ε c ε br in the anaerobic microbial degradation table 1 which was consistent with the reported results of anaerobic biodegradation of ethylene dibromide kuntze et al 2016 hexachlorocyclohexane liu et al 2020b 2020c chloroethane and chloroethene lihl et al 2019 palau et al 2017a 2017b this phenomenon was expected because of the larger primary carbon isotope effects than halogen during the cleavage of carbon halogen bond in the anaerobic biodegradation elsner et al 2005 palau et al 2017b to the best of our knowledge only one study had reported the bromine isotope fractionation for the pbde transformation and the ε br of bde 99 was reported to be 3 0 in the photodegradation huang et al 2020 which was slightly higher than bde 47 and bde 153 however the instrumental measurement method of bromine isotope composition was different and the analytical targets were also different between these two studies thus the discrepancy in ε br values could not be directly used as a powerful evidence for distinguishing the two different kinds of degradation pathways in order to overcome the bottleneck the bromine isotope effects of pbde congeners should be investigated for various transformation modes in the future studies 3 3 dual element isotope patterns and comparison with other brominated organic contaminants carbon and bromine isotope data of bde 47 and bde 153 for the anaerobic biodegradation were combined in the dual c br isotope plots with the significant linear correlation between δ 13c and δ 81br r 2 0 98 fig 4 the λc br value of bde 47 0 436 reported as the slope of dual c br isotope plot was almost identical to bde 153 0 435 table 1 confirming the similar reaction mechanism for the debromination during the biodegradation compared to ε c and ε br λc br was more identical between bde 47 and bde 153 and thus was more reliable to characterize the debromination transformation of pbdes this result was also reported for other halogenated compounds because λ could cancel out the isotope masking effect during the microbial degradation liu et al 2020c wiegert et al 2013 to the best of our knowledge the λc br associated with pbde biodegradation has not been reported yet only one study reported the λc br values of 0 564 for bde 99 in the photodegradation which was higher than those reported in the present study huang et al 2020 due to the very limited information on pbdes the λc br values of pbdes in the present study were compared to those of other brominated organic compounds table 2 zakon et al 2013 reported the carbon and bromine isotope fractionation of 4 bromophenol during the photolysis in water and the λc br value was 0 174 due to the inverse bromine isotope effect kozell et al 2015 applied dual carbon bromine isotope analysis to probe abiotic transformation of tribromoneopentyl alcohol and the λc br value was 0 038 0 250 and 0 for alkaline hydrolysis reductive debromination by zero valent iron nanoparticles and oxidative degradation by h2o2 in the presence of cuo nanoparticles the λc br value of ethylene dibromide was reported to be 0 034 for alkaline hydrolysis 0 for oxidation by fenton reagent 0 230 for transformation by corrinoid cofactors 0 193 for reduction with zero valent zn nanoparticles 0 087 for aerobic biodegradation and 0 433 for anaerobic biodegradation kuntze et al 2016 from the comparison it was obvious that although the target brominated compounds were different the λc br value was similar for the same transformation pathway for example the λc br was 0 for the oxidation degradation 0 03 for alkaline hydrolysis and 0 43 for anaerobic degradation in addition there was difference in λc br values among different transformation pathways indicating the transformation pathway depended λc b for brominated organic compounds this phenomenon was also found for the chlorinated organic compounds via the dual c cl isotope analysis palau et al 2017a 2017b torrentó et al 2017 overall this pronounced difference in λc br values indicated the high potential of application of dual c br isotope analysis to distinguish the transformation pathways of pbdes in field sites 3 4 postulated reaction mechanism of c br bond cleavage insight from stable isotope analysis in the anaerobic reductive conditions the stepwise debromination was reported to be the main degradation pathways for pbdes robrock et al 2008 tokarz iii et al 2008 however the underlying reactive mechanisms remain ambiguous for the cleavage c br bong of pbdes during the anaerobic biodegradation the mechanisms of anaerobic microbial reductive debromination of chlorinated ethenes and aromatic compounds were wildly reported to be associated with the formation of chlorine cobalt bond via the interaction between cobalt corrinoid dependent enzymes and chlorinated compounds heckel et al 2018 liang et al 2014 lihl et al 2019 due to the similarity in chemical structures between brominated and chlorinated organic compounds three fundamental mechanistic scaffolds were proposed for pbdes of microbial reductive debromination scheme 1 the same degradation products were obtained via the three different reaction mechanisms so that the general identification of products was far away to probe the mechanistic processes during the microbial degradation an insight into the underlying isotope fractionation effects can allow to overcome this difficulty to better elucidation of the reaction mechanisms akies were calculated to quantitatively characterize the isotope effects of rupture of chemical bond at the reactive positions by removing the dilution effect caused by nonreaction positions and intramolecular competition the akie c was calculated based on the eq 4 and n 12 x z 4 and n 12 x z 6 were applied for bde 47 and bde 153 respectively the calculated akie c was 1 0773 for bde 47 and 1 0716 for bde 153 which was close to the reported range of 1 010 1 070 for the reductive cleavage of c br bond by considering the analytical uncertainty 0 01 koster van groos et al 2018 kuder et al 2012 kuntze et al 2016 for bromine isotope effect the values of akie br were calculated as 1 0098 and 1 0125 for bde 47 and bde 153 respectively these values were in the upper range of the reported akie br values associated with c br bond cleavage kozell et al 2015 kuder et al 2012 kuntze et al 2016 the high values of akie c and akie br indicated the occurrence of both carbon and bromine primary isotope effects and the initial cleavage of c br bond was the rate limiting step in the present study in the electrophilic aromatic substitution scheme 1a the mechanism consists the initial addition of a proton to the aromatic ring followed by addition of the cofactor and the transient formation of a halogen cobalamin was the rate determining step liang et al 2014 consequently the electrophilic aromatic substitution was not the underlying reaction mechanism for the anaerobic biodegradation of pbdes due to the large isotope fractionation of carbon and bromine in the present study for nucleophilic scheme 1b and homolytic aromatic substitution scheme 1c both of the reaction mechanisms involve the initial formation of cobalamin bromine bond simultaneously concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond and the primary carbon and bromine isotope effects were expected badin et al 2014 liang et al 2014 however the modes of electron transfer were different between the two different reaction mechanisms with inner sphere electron transfer for nucleophilic aromatic substitution and outer sphere single electron transfer for homolytic aromatic substitution badin et al 2014 liang et al 2014 in a recent study on degradation of chlorinated ethene reductive outer sphere single electron transfer was reported to be an exception rather than the rule in natural and engineered chlorinated ethene dichlorination and the chlorine isotope effect was nonexistent heckel et al 2017 due to the pronounced bromine isotope fractionation the homolytic aromatic substitution was also not the underlying reaction mechanism and the nucleophilic aromatic substitution seemed more plausible for pbde biodegradation in the present study to date some limited studies reported the carbon and bromine isotope effect associated with the nucleophilic substitution reaction of brominated aliphatic compounds for example kuder et al 2012 reported akie c 1 07 for nucleophilic substitution of 1 2 dibromoethane for the abiotic debromination of ethylene dibromide followed by nucleophilic substitution kuntze et al 2016 reported akie c 1 062 and akie br 1 002 the values observed for reaction of tribromoneopentyl alcohol in aqueous alkaline solution by nucleophilic substitution were calculated as akie c 1 052 and akie br 1 001 kozell et al 2015 in addition for microbial degradation of 1 2 dichloroethane the values of akie c 1 068 and akie cl 1 009 were documented for nucleophilic substitution palau et al 2014a these akie c values were in good agreement with the values obtained in the present study however the akie br values were slightly lower than our results which might be attributed to the secondary bromine isotope effects liu et al 2020c palau et al 2014b it was documented that although the differences in c br versus c cl bond vibration frequencies and in reduced masses of br versus cl the slight differences in the ratio of halogen and carbon isotope effects were anticipated for c br and c cl bond cleavage elsner et al 2005 kozell et al 2015 coupled with the limited data on bromine stable isotope the dual c br stable isotope of targeted compounds was always compared to the dual c cl stable isotope of other chlorinated organic compounds during the transformation in the previous studies kozell et al 2015 kuntze et al 2016 for the microbial degradation the chlorinated and brominated organic pollutants shared the similar transformation pathways and reaction mechanisms in most cases to date only one study reported the λc br values of organic brominated compounds in the biodegradation and the λc br was 0 433 for ethylene dibromide followed by nucleophilic substitution kuntze et al 2016 which was similar to those in the present study to further confirm reaction mechanism as accurately as possible the λc br values of dual c br isotope effects were compared with the biotic reductive dehalogenation of other halogenated compounds the λc br values of bde 47 0 435 and bde 153 0 435 agreed well with those of tetrachloroethene 0 35 0 11 and trichloroethene 0 37 0 11 for microbial reductive dichlorination followed by nucleophilic substitution lihl et al 2019 wiegert et al 2013 consequently all of the above good consistence between the present study and other previous studies confirmed that the dissociation of c br bond was the rate determining step and the nucleophilic aromatic substitution was the main reaction mechanism with addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer for the anaerobic microbial reductive debromination of pbdes in the wetland bottom water 4 conclusion the present study aimed to probe the underlying reaction mechanism of pbdes with the anaerobic microbial reductive debromination by dual carbon bromine isotope analysis in the wetland bottom water the degradation of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the pseudo first order kinetic model and the degradation rate of bde 153 with the more substituted bromine was higher than that of bde 47 with the less substituted bromine stepwise debromination was the main degradation pathway for both bde 47 and bde 153 with the preferential remove of bromine in para position meta ortho position the pronounced isotope fractionation was found for carbon and bromine of bde 47 and bde 153 during the microbial degradation indicating the cleavage of c br bond as the rate determining step the similar ε c and ε br was obtained for bde 47 and bde 153 indicating the expected similar reaction mechanism compared to ε c and ε br the λc br of dual carbon bromine isotope effects was more sensitive to distinguish the different degradation pathways and relevant reaction mechanisms based on the identification of degradation products and dual carbon bromine isotope analysis the anaerobic reductive debromination of bde 47 and bde 153 followed the nucleophilic aromatic substitution with the addition of cofactor to the benzene ring concomitant with dissociation of carbon bromine bond via the inner sphere electron transfer in summary the present study indicated that dual carbon bromine isotope analysis was a robust method to probe the reaction mechanisms of pbdes in the field site however the analysis of carbon and bromine stable isotope of pbdes is still limited for other degradation pathways such as aerobic degradation oxidation hydrolysis and reduction by fe 0 zn 0 and need to be investigated in further studies in addition the stable carbon and bromine isotope ratios were not detected for debromination products given that most organic contaminants exist as intermediates in the field environment the isotope fractionation of intermediates is also controlled by the chemical bond cleavage and formation thus more key information could be obtained by exploring the variations in isotope compositions of degradation products in the future studies which is helpful for accurately verify the transformation pathways and

16454,the present nitrogen fixation industry is usually energy intensive and environmentally detrimental therefore it is appealing to find alternatives here we achieved both a synchronized biological nitrogen fixation and electric energy production by using geobacter sulfurreducens in a microbial electrochemical system the results showed that g sulfurreducens was able to fix nitrogen depending on anode respiration producing a maximum current density of 0 17 0 015 ma cm 2 and a nitrogen fixing activity of ca 0 78 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1 h 1 thereby achieving a net total nitrogen fixing rate of ca 5 6 mg l 1 day 1 specifically nitrogen fixation did not impair coulombic efficiency transcriptomic and metabolic analyses demonstrated that anode respiration provided sufficient energy to drive nitrogen fixation and in turn nitrogen fixation promoted anode respiration of the cell by increasing acetate catabolism but reducing acetate anabolism furthermore we showed that g sulfurreducens could

wastewater treatment 1 introduction nitrogen fixation which involves converting inert n2 to reactive nh3 has been essential for the advancement of modern agriculture and human society the ever increasing development of human civilization has aggravated the need for ammonium various endeavors have been carried out to meet the demand cherkasov et al 2015 mus et al 2018 among them the haber bosch process has been widely applied contributing to approximately 90 of global artificial nh3 production fowler et al 2013 however the process is both carbon and energy intensive running at elevated temperatures x223c 500 c and pressures 150 300 bar accounting for 1 4 of global carbon dioxide emissions and consuming 1 of the world s total energy production kandemir et al 2013 milton et al 2017 therefore it is appealing to find alternatives vicente and dean 2017 biological nitrogen fixation bnf is a process catalyzed by nitrogenase in diazotrophs hoffman et al 2014 kuypers et al 2018 during that process cellular catabolism and respiration have been shown to provide reduction power and energy to drive nitrogen fixation dixon and kahn 2004 therefore bnf is sustainable and environmentally benign and is considered the best choice actually bnf is widely carried out in natural ecosystems contributing to over 50 of global nitrogen fixation fowler et al 2013 various efforts have been devoted to harvesting bnf for example ortiz marquez et al 2012 applied different mutagenesis strategies by point mutation of the glutamine synthase gene or deletion of the nitrogenase transcription antiactivator nifl gene and increased the ammonium secretion of azotobacter liu et al 2017 sought an inorganic biological hybrid combining inorganic catalysts to split water for h2 generation and the h2 oxidizing diazotroph to fix n2 and achieved the synthesis of nh3 under ambient conditions and ospina betancourth et al 2020 employed a culture enrichment procedure and selected superior n2 fixing microbial consortia achieving a nitrogen fixing efficiency comparable to that of existing nitrogen fixing technologies specifically ortiz medina et al 2019 used anaerobic microbial electrolysis cells mecs inoculated with mixed microbial species not only to achieve bnf but also generate electric energy here the mecs selected an anode consortium which was predominated by geobacter species and generated a maximum nitrogen fixation activity comparable to that of model aerobic diazotrophs geobacter species are strictly anaerobic heterotrophic microorganisms and generate energy by performing extracellular electron transfer to respire extracellular electron acceptors lovley et al 2011 they are the most efficient exoelectrogens known and usually dominate in the anode biofilms of mecs commault et al 2013 zakaria et al 2018 in addition nearly all geobacter species have been shown to contain nitrogenase encoding genes and were able to fix nitrogen coupled with the respiration of fe iii oxides ueki and lovley 2010 rӧling 2014 therefore it is suspected that geobacter species play a key part in both current generation and nitrogen fixation in that mecs ortiz medina et al 2019 moreover in another study electrochemically active diazotrophs from clostridium species were abundant in the anode biofilm involved in current generation and bnf wong et al 2014 obviously these two studies suggested the possibility of using electrochemically active diazotrophs to achieve a green nitrogen fixation that performs simultaneous electric energy generation and bnf however this had previously not been corroborated furthermore the relationship between current generation and nitrogen fixation appears mysterious considering the following two issues i for one biological nitrogen gas fixation reaction to be completed eight electrons must be consumed and current generation also consumes electrons therefore these two processes are competitive however ii current generation drives the formation of a transmembrane proton gradient required for energy generation atp which supports nitrogen fixation therefore in turn these two processes are cooperative in that bnf should depend on current generation to clarify the possibility and mechanism of simultaneous bnf and current generation of electrochemically active diazotrophs in this study a representative geobacter species geobacter sulfurreducens strain kn400 was selected since it generated the highest current in comparison to all other bacterial species and had been shown to fix nitrogen efficiently methé et al 2005 yi et al 2009 g sulfurreducens strain kn400 was inoculated into the anode chamber of an n deficient microbial fuel cell with the anode acting as the electron acceptor to induce current generation the results showed that g sulfurreducens fixed nitrogen via anode reduction suggesting an anode respiration dependent bnf and in return bnf enhanced the anode respiration energy metabolism of g sulfurreducens cells in addition g sulfurreducens could be supplied as an additive in microbial electrochemical system for n deficient wastewater treatment to achieve not only dissoluble organic carbon removal but also bnf and current generation our study provides the first direct evidence of synchronizing nitrogen fixation with electric energy output and has implications for green nitrogen fixation and n deficient wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation three electrodes of two chambered h shaped cells with a liquid volume of 60 ml and a headspace volume of 90 ml in each chamber were assembled as previously described jing et al 2019 the anode and cathode were made of graphite plates 2 3 0 3 cm jinglong special carbon beijing china which were polished using sandpaper grit type 400 sonicated for 30 mins soaked in 1 m hcl overnight and then rinsed at least five times with milli q water a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the electrolyte was freshwater medium fwnn medium buffered with carbonate as previously reported nevin et al 2009 except that the anolyte was supplied with 12 mm sodium acetate to perform the bnf test nh4cl was eliminated from the anolyte the reactor was autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min and then purged with sterile n2 co2 80 20 for at least 30 min to remove oxygen and to saturate n2 geobacter sulfurreducens strain kn400 was initially cultured in n deficient nbaf medium without nh4cl as previously reported liu et al 2019 to start the process 5 ml of bacterial cells in logarithmic phase was inoculated into the anode chamber in which the anode was polarized at 0 3 v vs sce with a multichannel electrochemical workstation chi 1000 c shanghai china the current was recorded continuously and normalized to the maximum projected area of the anode all experiments were conducted in triplicate at 30 c and the mean values were reported all test groups were listed in supplementary table s1 2 2 quantification of the total nitrogen protein and dissolved organic carbon the nitrogen fixation rate was evaluated by calculating the increase in total nitrogen n total including dissolved nitrogen in the anolyte and biomass on the anode to measure these parameters destructive sampling was carried out briefly the whole anode biofilm was scraped and suspended in the anolyte the cells were lysed with an ultrasonic homogenizer jy92 iidn ningbo scientz biotechnology co ningbo china at a frequency of 30 khz and a potential of 180 w for 30 min the concentration of total nitrogen was determined directly using the persulfate digestion method hach kits 2672245 beijing china liu et al 2017 to measure the protein concentration the lysate was analyzed using the microbca protein assay micro bca protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific rockford usa chen et al 2017 the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a multi 3100 analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany 2 3 nad p h nad p and atp quantification cells on the anode were collected after the current reached the maximum to determine the concentrations of atp nadh nad and nadph nadp cells were first washed three times with 50 mm pbs ph 7 0 and then resuspended in pbs the concentration of intracellular atp was measured using the enhanced atp assay kit beyotime biotechnology china following the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations of intracellular nadh nad and nadph nadp were determined using an nad h quantification kit mak037 sigma aldrich and nadp h assay kit bc1105 solarbio beijing china respectively as previously reported leonardo et al 1996 2 4 biological nitrogen fixation characterization nitrogenase activity was determined following the acetylene reduction assay by measuring the consumption of ethylene using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 14 kyoto japan chen et al 2021 in detail when the current reached the maximum the anolyte was replaced with anaerobic fresh sterile anolyte and purged with ar co2 80 20 for at least 30 min thereafter c2h2 was injected into the anode chamber at a final concentration of 10 v v gas phase the concentration of c2h4 was monitored by regularly applying 300 μl of headspace sample to the gas chromatograph the isotope labeling experiment was performed as previously described chen et al 2021 briefly the microbial fuel cell was purged with ar2 co2 80 20 firstly and then the headspace was purged with 15n2 co2 80 20 after a mature biofilm was formed cells were collected by scraping and lyophilized the 15n m z 29 14n m z 28 ratio was measured by using the thermo scientific mat 253 plus gas bench isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific the n2 content in the headspace was determined by a robotized sampling and analysis system molstad et al 2007 2 5 biofilm morphology characterization the morphology of the anode biofilm was characterized when the bioelectrochemical system produced the maximum current density biofilms were rinsed briefly with sterile 0 9 nacl stained using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit life technologies usa for 15 min in the dark and then rinsed briefly with sterile 0 9 nacl to remove excess dyes the 3 d structure of the biofilm was depicted using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss lsm 880 germany jing et al 2019 2 6 bacterial community analysis cells were collected when the current reached the maximum the total dna was extracted according to the instructions of the ezna mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek inc norcross ga usa the primers nobar 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and nobar 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the 16sv3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for pyrosequencing using a miseq sequencer by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the sequencing data were processed according to a previous study dong et al 2017 2 7 transcriptome sequencing and analysis cells on the anode were collected at the mid log phase and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at 80 c until needed the total rna was extracted using trizol reagent invitrogen california usa as previously described liu et al 2021 transcriptome sequencing was performed at novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd tianjin china briefly mrna was purified from total rna by removing 16s and 23s rrna and sequenced using the illumina novaseq platform raw data were quality checked and filtered and then were processed through in house perl scripts and then used to map against the published reference genome of g sulfurreducens kn400 nz cp002031 1 htseq v0 6 1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads fpkm of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene and then the deseq r package 1 18 0 was used to analyze the differential expression the p values were adjusted using the tmm trimmed mean of m values method 3 results 3 1 simultaneous biological nitrogen fixation and current generation in geobacter sulfurreducens a three electrode two chambered h shaped cell was constructed and inoculated with g sulfurreducens strain kn400 the anode was poised at 0 3 v to act as an infinite electron acceptor as expected in the absence of ammonium and with nitrogen gas being the only candidate nitrogen source g sulfurreducens was still able to use the anode as an electron acceptor producing a current density with a maximum of approximately 0 17 0 015 ma cm 2 fig 1 a accordingly a rough anode biofilm with a thickness of ca 30 µm was formed fig 1b indicating that g sulfurreducens was able to use nitrogen gas to grow the nitrogen balance was further calculated by measuring the nitrogen consumption and ntotal as indicated in fig 1c the ntotal increased by 107 79 11 25 μmol which is consistent with the amount of nitrogen gas consumed 56 29 6 98 μmol these results indicated that g sulfurreducens was able to perform bnf on the anode an 15n isotope labeling experiment was further performed by supplying 15n2 in the gaseous phase peak height values of 15n14n and 14n14n were measured and 15n 14n atom ratio was calculated here a higher 15n 14n ratio represents more 15n being fixed a natural 15n abundance is usually around 0 366 atom shinoda et al 2019 in contrast as shown in fig 2 a the abundance of 15n increased to 6 574 atom in the system furthermore as shown in fig 2b the nitrogenase activity of g sulfurreducens in the system was calculated to be approximately 0 78 0 037 μmol c2h4 mg 1 protein h 1 these results provided direct evidence of simultaneous current generation and biological nitrogen fixation on the anode by g sulfurreducens notably strain kn400 also generated a current density with a maximum at approximately 0 17 0 013 ma cm 2 fig 1a when growing in n sufficient electrolyte but formed a compact and smooth biofilm with a thickness of ca 28 µm fig 1b at this point the strain neither fixed nitrogen figs 1c and 2a nor showed nitrogenase activity fig 2b therefore it appeared that bnf did not affect current generation of the g sulfurreducens fuel cell 3 2 biological nitrogen fixation enhances anode respiration nitrogen fixation is a reduction process that consumes eight electrons per reduction of one molecule of nitrogen gas n2 therefore the two processes of current generation and nitrogen fixation compete for the electrons generated from acetate oxidation the results demonstrating that bnf did not affect current generation suggested that g sulfurreducens used a mechanism to dissipate electrons in a distinct ratio which balanced energy production and bnf the electron dissipations under n deficient and n sufficient conditions were analyzed by calculating the coulombic efficiency which represents the ratio of electrons used for current generation versus the total electrons released by electron donor oxidation liu et al 2015 as indicated in table 1 strain kn400 catabolized a comparable amount of acetate to generate a comparable amount of current either under n deficient or n sufficient conditions in the same time period therefore similar coulombic efficiencies of 40 05 9 65 under n deficient conditions and 38 97 8 52 under n sufficient conditions were calculated this result is surprising considering that nitrogen fixation should lead to additional electron consumption that would decrease the coulombic efficiency when the same amount of acetate is oxidized notably the biomass formed in n deficient fuel cells 56 2 1 24 mg l 1 was significantly lower than the biomass 68 2 1 17 mg l 1 formed in n sufficient fuel cells table 1 in addition to being an electron donor for anode reduction acetate also provides a carbon source to support biomass formation mollaei et al 2021 therefore part of the supplied acetate will enter the anabolic pathway of the cell during acetate metabolism under n deficient conditions less biomass was formed suggesting that acetate in part probably had flown into the catabolic cycle for energy and reducing power generation to meet the needs of bnf but not affecting the coulombic efficiency to examine this hypothesis the amount of acetate consumption that was used as carbon source for biomass synthesis was calculated according to the assimilation eq 1 galushko and schink 2000 after measuring the biomass amount which could be displayed as the amount of total protein 1 17ch3coo 11h2o 8 c4h7o3 2hco3 15oh as indicated in table 1 and fig 3 a the ratio of acetate to biomass conversion accounts for 13 9 and 16 8 of consumed acetate under n deficient and n sufficient condition respectively the amount of acetate consumed for nitrogen fixation was calculated based on the assumption that the oxidization of 1 acetate could release 8 electrons eligible for 2 nh3 generation eq 2 and the carbon to nitrogen ratio was shown to be approximately 5 1 in bacteria persson 1989 as indicated in fig 3a 1 4 of equivalent acetate would enter the bnf pathway the extra acetate flux toward a catabolic pathway requires the cell boosting catabolism 2 n 2 8 h 8 e 16 at 2 n h 3 h 2 16 adp 16 pi the metabolism of single g sulfurreducens cell was calculated further fig s1 as expected fig 3b the cell displayed a higher acetate metabolism rate 1 84 0 11 mm mg 1 protein and current generation 26 30 1 39 μa mg 1 protein when performing bnf than when growing under n sufficient conditions with an acetate metabolism of 1 52 0 10 mm mg 1 protein and current generation of 21 02 0 99 μa mg 1 protein the results indicated that the cells boosted their energy metabolism to meet energy requirements when performing nitrogen fixation therefore atp generation was significantly higher in nitrogen fixing cells 328 83 19 19 nmol mg 1 protein reaching 2 15 times higher than the atp generation in nonnitrogen fixing cells 152 70 13 39 nmol mg 1 protein fig 3c furthermore both the nadh nad and nadph nadp ratios were also higher in nitrogen fixing cells at 0 043 0 003 and 0 873 0 036 respectively than in nonnitrogen fixing cells which yielded 0 020 0 005 and 0 647 0 023 respectively fig 3d this is also in accordance with the calculation fig 3a bnf is an energy and electron consuming process that requires 16 atp and 8 electrons for the fixation of 1 molecule of nitrogen gas eq 2 foster et al 2018 in particular nadh nadph acts as the reducing power thereby providing electron sources for nitrogenase poudel et al 2018 therefore the accumulation of reducing power and atp was necessary to accommodate conditions necessary for nitrogen fixation by the cell these data demonstrated that at the single cell level the cell accelerated the acetate catabolic pathway and then increased its energy yield to produce conditions favorable for efficient nitrogen fixation furthermore electrochemical kinetic analysis also demonstrated that the nitrogen fixing anode biofilm had a lower electron transfer resistance fig s3 all these factors contributed to an efficient extracellular electron transfer path that facilitated anode reduction by g sulfurreducens cells and finally served in nitrogen fixation additionally the higher nad p h nad p ratios but lower biomass formed also corroborated the alteration of electron flow in g sulfurreducens under n deficient conditions fig 3a 3 3 anode respiration drives biological nitrogen fixation geobacter species perform anaerobic extracellular respiration and transfer electrons extracellularly to drive the formation of a transmembrane proton gradient thereby contributing to energy generation lovley et al 2011 therefore anode reduction and subsequent current generation generated energy to support nitrogen fixation otherwise the cell could not respire the unpoised anode and then fix nitrogen fig s2 thus the process should be described as being an anode respiration driven bnf to further analyze the coupling between anode respiration and bnf the global transcriptional profiles of g sulfurreducens cells growing under n deficient and n sufficient conditions were obtained table s3 in accordance with a higher catabolism and a less efficient anabolism during bnf the energy yielding tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle was upregulated while the acetate to biomass conversion pathways therefore assimilation were downregulated fig 4 here the tca cycle generated reducing power in the form of nadh and nadph which will either be oxidized for energy production via anode respiration or provide electrons for bnf reduced flavodoxin or ferredoxin are direct electron donors to nitrogenase previous study suggested that the activity of pyruvate flavodoxin oxidoreductase pfor contributed to the generation of flavodoxin in g sulfurreducens poudel et al 2018 however the expression of pfor was downregulated during bnf fig s4a ni fe hydrogenase also could catalyze the reduction of ferredoxin but was also downregulated fig s4a in contrast the expression of the electron transferring flavoprotein etf complex etfa etfb and kn400 2732 and nadh dependent ferredoxin nadp reductase nfnab were upregulated fig s4a particularly the eft complex is homologous to the fix complex encoded by fixabcx and is able to catalyze the oxidation of two nadh to generate a reduced quinone and a reduced ferredoxin ledbetter et al 2017 nfnab was also shown to catalyze an electron bifurcating process via oxidation of two nadph for the generation of reduced ferredoxin and nadh buckel and thauer 2018 therefore the activity of etf complex and nfnab should contribute to the generation of reduced ferredoxin in g sulfurreducens the expression of nitrogenase and its regulatory cascade were also upregulated in n deficient electrolyte fig s4b which is consistent with the high nitrogenase activity also indicating a process of bnf in g sulfurreducens 3 4 inoculating g sulfurreducens promotes n deficient wastewater treatment in microbial fuel cells microbial fuel cells mfcs are an effective device for facilitating wastewater treatment due to it enhancing the anaerobic respiration catabolism of the microbial community liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 it has been reported that mfcs could also be used for synthetic n deficient wastewater which had the characteristics of pulp and paper and the sugar refining industries treatment after inducing the enrichment of electrochemically active nitrogen fixing bacteria wong et al 2014 the abilities of g sulfurreducens cell to fix nitrogen by reducing the anode and to generate current more efficiently in n deficient electrolyte suggest that g sulfurreducens could be applied in n deficient wastewater treatment this possibility was tested in the three electrode two chambered h shaped cell with the anode chamber directly supplied with the real pulp and paper mills wastewater collected from nine dragons paper limited dongguan china and the catholyte of fmnn medium the wastewater had a ph of 7 56 and an initial doc of approximately 950 mg l 1 and total nitrogen of 43 33 1 51 mg l 1 as shown in fig 5 a the mfc slowly generated a current that achieved a maximum of approximately 0 012 ma cm 2 in 5 days and then remained stable when treated with crude n deficient wastewater meanwhile the doc of the wastewater decreased slowly at a rate of 8 99 2 02 mg l 1 day 1 and the net ntotal of the mfc increased steadily at a rate of 0 488 0 14 mg l 1 day 1 fig 5b in contrast after inoculation of 5 ml of g sulfurreducens culture in the anolyte the current increased continuously and arrived at a maximum of ca 0 075 ma cm 2 at 10 days thereafter decreasing due to the depletion of doc fig 5a here the average doc removal rate and ntotal increasing rate were 45 42 4 02 mg l 1 day 1 and 1 44 0 19 mg l 1 day 1 respectively fig 5b therefore the inoculation of g sulfurreducens increased the electrocatalytic activity and nitrogen fixation of the microbial community in particular the nitrogenase activity at day 12 was 1 7 0 29 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1 h 1 which was much higher than the nitrogenase activity without g sulfurreducens inoculation 0 097 0 04 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1h 1 fig 5c this result demonstrated that supplementation with g sulfurreducens could accelerate n deficient wastewater treatment by increasing anaerobic respiration and nitrogen fixation of the anode microbial community the microbial community architectures in the two different treatments were analyzed by examining the 16s rdna profiles after performing illumina miseq sequencing the overall phylogenetic characteristics at the genus level are plotted in fig 5d as illustrated the inoculation of g sufurreducens affected the structure of the bacterial community in detail genera belonging to tepidiphilus pseudomonas and thermicanus dominated in crude wastewater after being treated by mfc genera belonging to tepidiphilus bacteroides pseudomonas desulfovibrio ideonella and unclassified pseudomonadaceae dominated in the anode biofilm here species from pseudomonas and ideonella contain diazotrophs that can perform anaerobic growth and fix nitrogen noar and buckley 2009 yan et al 2010 thereby providing nitrogen sources to other species and species from bacteroides pseudomonas and desulfovibrio can perform extracellular electron transfer ha et al 2012 ouyang et al 2021 yu et al 2018 which can contribute to anodic respiration for current generation furthermore species from bacteroides pseudomonas and ideonella are predicted to also contribute to the decomposition of doc including lignin hemicelluloses benzoic acid phenylacetic acid hexadecenoic acid etc in wastewater ismail and hossain 2015 thorell et al 2003 and could provide simple carbon and energy sources for other species wong et al 2014 the diversity of the microbial community was further increased after inoculation with g sulfurreducens for example the community of diazotrophs expanded to include species from azospirillum steenhoudt and vanderleyden 2000 geobacter ideonella and clostridiales chen 2004 and the community of exoelectrogens included bacteroides desulfovibrio pseudomonas and geobacter species in particular geobacter species dominated the anode microbial community accounting for 4 51 and are predicted to be the predominant contributors to current generation and nitrogen fixation considering that they are the most efficient exoelectrogens and are able to synchronize biological nitrogen fixation and current generation 4 discussion 4 1 using electrogenic diazotroph for green nitrogen fixation geobacter species are the most efficient exoelectrogens and contain genes encoding nitrogen fixing functions lovley et al 2011 methé et al 2005 applying geobacter species as an electrogenic diazotroph and an anode as an electron acceptor showed promise for realizing simultaneous current generation and biological nitrogen fixation especially considering that performing electron intensive nitrogen fixation was not shown to affect current generation or columbic efficiency of microbial fuel cells and that the current nitrogen fixing industry is energy intensive moreover previous progresses in increasing the loading of exoelectrogens on the anode or the current generation of the anode provides possibilities to further increase nitrogen fixation liu et al 2019 yaqoob et al 2020 for example upon shifting the operation of this g sulfurreducens fuel cell from fed batch mode to continuous mode the maximum current increases to 0 3 0 02 ma cm 2 and the nitrogen fixation rate reaches approximately 8 6 mg l 1 day 1 fig s5 this is approaching the highest rate of microbial nitrogen fixation as recently reported ospina betancourth et al 2020 notably even though the combination of a bioelectrochemical system with nitrogen fixing bacteria for nitrogen fixation has been reported chen et al 2021 knoche et al 2017 in these systems electric energy was consumed to drive nitrogen fixation our results showed that nitrogen fixation affected the biofilm formation of g sulfurreducens inducing the formation of a rough biofilm transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the genes related to chemotaxis and flagella expression were down regulated during nitrogen fixation table s2 we also showed that a rough anode biofilm was formed in n sufficient electrolyte when the expression of the flagellum was inhibited fig s6 so it can be speculated that a deficiency of flagellum expression during nitrogen fixation contributed to the formation of a rough biofilm highlighting the structural function of flagella in g sulfurreducens biofilm formation liu et al 2019 inhibiting the expression of flagella might be a mechanism to save energy to meet the energy demand needed for nitrogen fixation 4 2 balancing act between catabolism and anabolism the finding showing that g sulfurreducens cell increased acetate respiration but decreased acetate to cell carbon conversion during nitrogen fixation indicated that g sulfurreducens harbors a mechanism to regulate the carbon metabolism this is consistent with previous studies showing that g sulfurreducens possessed a mechanism to upregulate acetate catabolism for energy production and reduce acetate anabolism under conditions of electron acceptor limitation esteve núñez et al 2005 mahadevan et al 2006 this type of response was suggested to be universal in providing cells with enough atp to adapt to fluctuating subsurface environment esteve núñez et al 2005 thereafter satisfying the extensive energy demand during nitrogen fixation it was reported that the intracellular metabolite level and the redox state are two major factors determining the global regulation of cellular activities kouzuma et al 2015 considering the accumulation of nad p h in cells under both nitrogen fixing and electron acceptor limiting conditions a more reducing intracellular environment might trigger a similar cellular response in shifting metabolism toward energy generation actually the transcriptome data have shown a different expression of signal transduction pathways table s3 such as second messenger system and two component system in g sulfurreducens under different nitrogen conditions indicating an active metabolic regulation 4 3 using electrogenic diazotroph for n deficient wastewater treatment using geobacter species as additives to facilitate n deficient wastewater treatment in a bioelectrochemical system bes is intriguing and represents a novel technique traditionally n deficient wastewater treatment strategies include adding ammonium supplying nitrogen fixing microorganisms and treating with activated sludge ismail and hossain 2015 vashi et al 2018 however corresponding problems arise including the risk of nitrogen contamination the energy consuming process of aeration and the concomitant oxygen toxicity to nitrogenase vashi et al 2018 in contrast combining geobacter species and bes for n deficient wastewater treatment eliminates these problems since the bes is an anaerobic system and the anode can act as an infinite electron acceptor to support the nitrogen fixation of geobacter species thereby generating electrical energy notably the specific function of geobacter species in this process has not been identified electroactive diazotrophs have been proposed to directly oxidize organic waste to reduce the anode during n deficient wastewater treatment wong et al 2014 however geobacter species were shown to only be able to grow on a few small organic acids including the fermentation products of other species lovley et al 2011 therefore it is possible that they can form symbiosis with other fermenting bacteria and establish a syntrophic community thereby accelerating doc removal notably geobacter species can express conductive extracellular matrices liu et al 2020a 2020b 2019 or form direct electric contacts with other species liu et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014 thereby contributing to the extracellular respiration of other species the simultaneous abundance of the other diazotrophs and exoelectrogens strengthens the possibility of geobacter species contributing to or facilitating the anodic respiration of those species further studies are warranted furthermore the finding that biological nitrogen fixation consumes doc in wastewater and generates electric energy is not only beneficial for the environment but also exemplifies green nitrogen fixation 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated simultaneous biological nitrogen fixation and electric energy production by g sulfurreducens specifically the biological nitrogen fixation of g sulfurreducens was driven by anode respiration after coupling the extracellular electron transfer for energy production with nitrogen fixation and in return biological nitrogen fixation could enhance anode respiration of the g sulfurreducens cell by increasing acetate catabolism but decreasing acetate anabolism and increasing extracellular electron transfer furthermore we revealed that biological nitrogen fixation did not impair the current generation or coulombic efficiency of the g sulfurreducens fuel cell finally we showed that g sulfurreducens could be supplied in n deficient wastewater during bioelectrochemical treatment which not only increased the anaerobic respiration of the consortia but also enhanced the biological nitrogen fixation of the system thereby supporting the formation of an efficient microbial community for wastewater treatment our findings show great promise to further green nitrogen fixation and could be used in n deficient wastewater bioelectrochemical treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest funding this

16454,the present nitrogen fixation industry is usually energy intensive and environmentally detrimental therefore it is appealing to find alternatives here we achieved both a synchronized biological nitrogen fixation and electric energy production by using geobacter sulfurreducens in a microbial electrochemical system the results showed that g sulfurreducens was able to fix nitrogen depending on anode respiration producing a maximum current density of 0 17 0 015 ma cm 2 and a nitrogen fixing activity of ca 0 78 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1 h 1 thereby achieving a net total nitrogen fixing rate of ca 5 6 mg l 1 day 1 specifically nitrogen fixation did not impair coulombic efficiency transcriptomic and metabolic analyses demonstrated that anode respiration provided sufficient energy to drive nitrogen fixation and in turn nitrogen fixation promoted anode respiration of the cell by increasing acetate catabolism but reducing acetate anabolism furthermore we showed that g sulfurreducens could be supplied in a bioelectrochemical system for n deficient wastewater treatment to relieve n deficiency stress contributing to the formation of an electroactive biofilm thereby simultaneously achieving nitrogen fixation current generation and dissoluble organic carbon removal our study revealed a synergistic effect between biological nitrogen fixation and current generation by g

that process cellular catabolism and respiration have been shown to provide reduction power and energy to drive nitrogen fixation dixon and kahn 2004 therefore bnf is sustainable and environmentally benign and is considered the best choice actually bnf is widely carried out in natural ecosystems contributing to over 50 of global nitrogen fixation fowler et al 2013 various efforts have been devoted to harvesting bnf for example ortiz marquez et al 2012 applied different mutagenesis strategies by point mutation of the glutamine synthase gene or deletion of the nitrogenase transcription antiactivator nifl gene and increased the ammonium secretion of azotobacter liu et al 2017 sought an inorganic biological hybrid combining inorganic catalysts to split water for h2 generation and the h2 oxidizing diazotroph to fix n2 and achieved the synthesis of nh3 under ambient conditions and ospina betancourth et al 2020 employed a culture enrichment procedure and selected superior n2 fixing microbial consortia achieving a nitrogen fixing efficiency comparable to that of existing nitrogen fixing technologies specifically ortiz medina et al 2019 used anaerobic microbial electrolysis cells mecs inoculated with mixed microbial species not only to achieve bnf but also generate electric energy here the mecs selected an anode consortium which was predominated by geobacter species and generated a maximum nitrogen fixation activity comparable to that of model aerobic diazotrophs geobacter species are strictly anaerobic heterotrophic microorganisms and generate energy by performing extracellular electron transfer to respire extracellular electron acceptors lovley et al 2011 they are the most efficient exoelectrogens known and usually dominate in the anode biofilms of mecs commault et al 2013 zakaria et al 2018 in addition nearly all geobacter species have been shown to contain nitrogenase encoding genes and were able to fix nitrogen coupled with the respiration of fe iii oxides ueki and lovley 2010 rӧling 2014 therefore it is suspected that geobacter species play a key part in both current generation and nitrogen fixation in that mecs ortiz medina et al 2019 moreover in another study electrochemically active diazotrophs from clostridium species were abundant in the anode biofilm involved in current generation and bnf wong et al 2014 obviously these two studies suggested the possibility of using electrochemically active diazotrophs to achieve a green nitrogen fixation that performs simultaneous electric energy generation and bnf however this had previously not been corroborated furthermore the relationship between current generation and nitrogen fixation appears mysterious considering the following two issues i for one biological nitrogen gas fixation reaction to be completed eight electrons must be consumed and current generation also consumes electrons therefore these two processes are competitive however ii current generation drives the formation of a transmembrane proton gradient required for energy generation atp which supports nitrogen fixation therefore in turn these two processes are cooperative in that bnf should depend on current generation to clarify the possibility and mechanism of simultaneous bnf and current generation of electrochemically active diazotrophs in this study a representative geobacter species geobacter sulfurreducens strain kn400 was selected since it generated the highest current in comparison to all other bacterial species and had been shown to fix nitrogen efficiently methé et al 2005 yi et al 2009 g sulfurreducens strain kn400 was inoculated into the anode chamber of an n deficient microbial fuel cell with the anode acting as the electron acceptor to induce current generation the results showed that g sulfurreducens fixed nitrogen via anode reduction suggesting an anode respiration dependent bnf and in return bnf enhanced the anode respiration energy metabolism of g sulfurreducens cells in addition g sulfurreducens could be supplied as an additive in microbial electrochemical system for n deficient wastewater treatment to achieve not only dissoluble organic carbon removal but also bnf and current generation our study provides the first direct evidence of synchronizing nitrogen fixation with electric energy output and has implications for green nitrogen fixation and n deficient wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 reactor construction and operation three electrodes of two chambered h shaped cells with a liquid volume of 60 ml and a headspace volume of 90 ml in each chamber were assembled as previously described jing et al 2019 the anode and cathode were made of graphite plates 2 3 0 3 cm jinglong special carbon beijing china which were polished using sandpaper grit type 400 sonicated for 30 mins soaked in 1 m hcl overnight and then rinsed at least five times with milli q water a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode the electrolyte was freshwater medium fwnn medium buffered with carbonate as previously reported nevin et al 2009 except that the anolyte was supplied with 12 mm sodium acetate to perform the bnf test nh4cl was eliminated from the anolyte the reactor was autoclaved at 121 c for 30 min and then purged with sterile n2 co2 80 20 for at least 30 min to remove oxygen and to saturate n2 geobacter sulfurreducens strain kn400 was initially cultured in n deficient nbaf medium without nh4cl as previously reported liu et al 2019 to start the process 5 ml of bacterial cells in logarithmic phase was inoculated into the anode chamber in which the anode was polarized at 0 3 v vs sce with a multichannel electrochemical workstation chi 1000 c shanghai china the current was recorded continuously and normalized to the maximum projected area of the anode all experiments were conducted in triplicate at 30 c and the mean values were reported all test groups were listed in supplementary table s1 2 2 quantification of the total nitrogen protein and dissolved organic carbon the nitrogen fixation rate was evaluated by calculating the increase in total nitrogen n total including dissolved nitrogen in the anolyte and biomass on the anode to measure these parameters destructive sampling was carried out briefly the whole anode biofilm was scraped and suspended in the anolyte the cells were lysed with an ultrasonic homogenizer jy92 iidn ningbo scientz biotechnology co ningbo china at a frequency of 30 khz and a potential of 180 w for 30 min the concentration of total nitrogen was determined directly using the persulfate digestion method hach kits 2672245 beijing china liu et al 2017 to measure the protein concentration the lysate was analyzed using the microbca protein assay micro bca protein assay kit thermo fisher scientific rockford usa chen et al 2017 the dissolved organic carbon doc was measured using a multi 3100 analyzer multi n c 3100 analytik jena germany 2 3 nad p h nad p and atp quantification cells on the anode were collected after the current reached the maximum to determine the concentrations of atp nadh nad and nadph nadp cells were first washed three times with 50 mm pbs ph 7 0 and then resuspended in pbs the concentration of intracellular atp was measured using the enhanced atp assay kit beyotime biotechnology china following the manufacturer s instructions the concentrations of intracellular nadh nad and nadph nadp were determined using an nad h quantification kit mak037 sigma aldrich and nadp h assay kit bc1105 solarbio beijing china respectively as previously reported leonardo et al 1996 2 4 biological nitrogen fixation characterization nitrogenase activity was determined following the acetylene reduction assay by measuring the consumption of ethylene using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 14 kyoto japan chen et al 2021 in detail when the current reached the maximum the anolyte was replaced with anaerobic fresh sterile anolyte and purged with ar co2 80 20 for at least 30 min thereafter c2h2 was injected into the anode chamber at a final concentration of 10 v v gas phase the concentration of c2h4 was monitored by regularly applying 300 μl of headspace sample to the gas chromatograph the isotope labeling experiment was performed as previously described chen et al 2021 briefly the microbial fuel cell was purged with ar2 co2 80 20 firstly and then the headspace was purged with 15n2 co2 80 20 after a mature biofilm was formed cells were collected by scraping and lyophilized the 15n m z 29 14n m z 28 ratio was measured by using the thermo scientific mat 253 plus gas bench isotope mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific the n2 content in the headspace was determined by a robotized sampling and analysis system molstad et al 2007 2 5 biofilm morphology characterization the morphology of the anode biofilm was characterized when the bioelectrochemical system produced the maximum current density biofilms were rinsed briefly with sterile 0 9 nacl stained using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit life technologies usa for 15 min in the dark and then rinsed briefly with sterile 0 9 nacl to remove excess dyes the 3 d structure of the biofilm was depicted using a confocal laser scanning microscope clsm carl zeiss lsm 880 germany jing et al 2019 2 6 bacterial community analysis cells were collected when the current reached the maximum the total dna was extracted according to the instructions of the ezna mag bind soil dna kit omega biotek inc norcross ga usa the primers nobar 341f cctacgggnggcwgcag and nobar 805r gactachvgggtatctaatcc were used to amplify the 16sv3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for pyrosequencing using a miseq sequencer by sangon biotech co ltd shanghai china the sequencing data were processed according to a previous study dong et al 2017 2 7 transcriptome sequencing and analysis cells on the anode were collected at the mid log phase and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at 80 c until needed the total rna was extracted using trizol reagent invitrogen california usa as previously described liu et al 2021 transcriptome sequencing was performed at novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd tianjin china briefly mrna was purified from total rna by removing 16s and 23s rrna and sequenced using the illumina novaseq platform raw data were quality checked and filtered and then were processed through in house perl scripts and then used to map against the published reference genome of g sulfurreducens kn400 nz cp002031 1 htseq v0 6 1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene fragments per kilobase per million mapped reads fpkm of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene and then the deseq r package 1 18 0 was used to analyze the differential expression the p values were adjusted using the tmm trimmed mean of m values method 3 results 3 1 simultaneous biological nitrogen fixation and current generation in geobacter sulfurreducens a three electrode two chambered h shaped cell was constructed and inoculated with g sulfurreducens strain kn400 the anode was poised at 0 3 v to act as an infinite electron acceptor as expected in the absence of ammonium and with nitrogen gas being the only candidate nitrogen source g sulfurreducens was still able to use the anode as an electron acceptor producing a current density with a maximum of approximately 0 17 0 015 ma cm 2 fig 1 a accordingly a rough anode biofilm with a thickness of ca 30 µm was formed fig 1b indicating that g sulfurreducens was able to use nitrogen gas to grow the nitrogen balance was further calculated by measuring the nitrogen consumption and ntotal as indicated in fig 1c the ntotal increased by 107 79 11 25 μmol which is consistent with the amount of nitrogen gas consumed 56 29 6 98 μmol these results indicated that g sulfurreducens was able to perform bnf on the anode an 15n isotope labeling experiment was further performed by supplying 15n2 in the gaseous phase peak height values of 15n14n and 14n14n were measured and 15n 14n atom ratio was calculated here a higher 15n 14n ratio represents more 15n being fixed a natural 15n abundance is usually around 0 366 atom shinoda et al 2019 in contrast as shown in fig 2 a the abundance of 15n increased to 6 574 atom in the system furthermore as shown in fig 2b the nitrogenase activity of g sulfurreducens in the system was calculated to be approximately 0 78 0 037 μmol c2h4 mg 1 protein h 1 these results provided direct evidence of simultaneous current generation and biological nitrogen fixation on the anode by g sulfurreducens notably strain kn400 also generated a current density with a maximum at approximately 0 17 0 013 ma cm 2 fig 1a when growing in n sufficient electrolyte but formed a compact and smooth biofilm with a thickness of ca 28 µm fig 1b at this point the strain neither fixed nitrogen figs 1c and 2a nor showed nitrogenase activity fig 2b therefore it appeared that bnf did not affect current generation of the g sulfurreducens fuel cell 3 2 biological nitrogen fixation enhances anode respiration nitrogen fixation is a reduction process that consumes eight electrons per reduction of one molecule of nitrogen gas n2 therefore the two processes of current generation and nitrogen fixation compete for the electrons generated from acetate oxidation the results demonstrating that bnf did not affect current generation suggested that g sulfurreducens used a mechanism to dissipate electrons in a distinct ratio which balanced energy production and bnf the electron dissipations under n deficient and n sufficient conditions were analyzed by calculating the coulombic efficiency which represents the ratio of electrons used for current generation versus the total electrons released by electron donor oxidation liu et al 2015 as indicated in table 1 strain kn400 catabolized a comparable amount of acetate to generate a comparable amount of current either under n deficient or n sufficient conditions in the same time period therefore similar coulombic efficiencies of 40 05 9 65 under n deficient conditions and 38 97 8 52 under n sufficient conditions were calculated this result is surprising considering that nitrogen fixation should lead to additional electron consumption that would decrease the coulombic efficiency when the same amount of acetate is oxidized notably the biomass formed in n deficient fuel cells 56 2 1 24 mg l 1 was significantly lower than the biomass 68 2 1 17 mg l 1 formed in n sufficient fuel cells table 1 in addition to being an electron donor for anode reduction acetate also provides a carbon source to support biomass formation mollaei et al 2021 therefore part of the supplied acetate will enter the anabolic pathway of the cell during acetate metabolism under n deficient conditions less biomass was formed suggesting that acetate in part probably had flown into the catabolic cycle for energy and reducing power generation to meet the needs of bnf but not affecting the coulombic efficiency to examine this hypothesis the amount of acetate consumption that was used as carbon source for biomass synthesis was calculated according to the assimilation eq 1 galushko and schink 2000 after measuring the biomass amount which could be displayed as the amount of total protein 1 17ch3coo 11h2o 8 c4h7o3 2hco3 15oh as indicated in table 1 and fig 3 a the ratio of acetate to biomass conversion accounts for 13 9 and 16 8 of consumed acetate under n deficient and n sufficient condition respectively the amount of acetate consumed for nitrogen fixation was calculated based on the assumption that the oxidization of 1 acetate could release 8 electrons eligible for 2 nh3 generation eq 2 and the carbon to nitrogen ratio was shown to be approximately 5 1 in bacteria persson 1989 as indicated in fig 3a 1 4 of equivalent acetate would enter the bnf pathway the extra acetate flux toward a catabolic pathway requires the cell boosting catabolism 2 n 2 8 h 8 e 16 at 2 n h 3 h 2 16 adp 16 pi the metabolism of single g sulfurreducens cell was calculated further fig s1 as expected fig 3b the cell displayed a higher acetate metabolism rate 1 84 0 11 mm mg 1 protein and current generation 26 30 1 39 μa mg 1 protein when performing bnf than when growing under n sufficient conditions with an acetate metabolism of 1 52 0 10 mm mg 1 protein and current generation of 21 02 0 99 μa mg 1 protein the results indicated that the cells boosted their energy metabolism to meet energy requirements when performing nitrogen fixation therefore atp generation was significantly higher in nitrogen fixing cells 328 83 19 19 nmol mg 1 protein reaching 2 15 times higher than the atp generation in nonnitrogen fixing cells 152 70 13 39 nmol mg 1 protein fig 3c furthermore both the nadh nad and nadph nadp ratios were also higher in nitrogen fixing cells at 0 043 0 003 and 0 873 0 036 respectively than in nonnitrogen fixing cells which yielded 0 020 0 005 and 0 647 0 023 respectively fig 3d this is also in accordance with the calculation fig 3a bnf is an energy and electron consuming process that requires 16 atp and 8 electrons for the fixation of 1 molecule of nitrogen gas eq 2 foster et al 2018 in particular nadh nadph acts as the reducing power thereby providing electron sources for nitrogenase poudel et al 2018 therefore the accumulation of reducing power and atp was necessary to accommodate conditions necessary for nitrogen fixation by the cell these data demonstrated that at the single cell level the cell accelerated the acetate catabolic pathway and then increased its energy yield to produce conditions favorable for efficient nitrogen fixation furthermore electrochemical kinetic analysis also demonstrated that the nitrogen fixing anode biofilm had a lower electron transfer resistance fig s3 all these factors contributed to an efficient extracellular electron transfer path that facilitated anode reduction by g sulfurreducens cells and finally served in nitrogen fixation additionally the higher nad p h nad p ratios but lower biomass formed also corroborated the alteration of electron flow in g sulfurreducens under n deficient conditions fig 3a 3 3 anode respiration drives biological nitrogen fixation geobacter species perform anaerobic extracellular respiration and transfer electrons extracellularly to drive the formation of a transmembrane proton gradient thereby contributing to energy generation lovley et al 2011 therefore anode reduction and subsequent current generation generated energy to support nitrogen fixation otherwise the cell could not respire the unpoised anode and then fix nitrogen fig s2 thus the process should be described as being an anode respiration driven bnf to further analyze the coupling between anode respiration and bnf the global transcriptional profiles of g sulfurreducens cells growing under n deficient and n sufficient conditions were obtained table s3 in accordance with a higher catabolism and a less efficient anabolism during bnf the energy yielding tricarboxylic acid cycle tca cycle was upregulated while the acetate to biomass conversion pathways therefore assimilation were downregulated fig 4 here the tca cycle generated reducing power in the form of nadh and nadph which will either be oxidized for energy production via anode respiration or provide electrons for bnf reduced flavodoxin or ferredoxin are direct electron donors to nitrogenase previous study suggested that the activity of pyruvate flavodoxin oxidoreductase pfor contributed to the generation of flavodoxin in g sulfurreducens poudel et al 2018 however the expression of pfor was downregulated during bnf fig s4a ni fe hydrogenase also could catalyze the reduction of ferredoxin but was also downregulated fig s4a in contrast the expression of the electron transferring flavoprotein etf complex etfa etfb and kn400 2732 and nadh dependent ferredoxin nadp reductase nfnab were upregulated fig s4a particularly the eft complex is homologous to the fix complex encoded by fixabcx and is able to catalyze the oxidation of two nadh to generate a reduced quinone and a reduced ferredoxin ledbetter et al 2017 nfnab was also shown to catalyze an electron bifurcating process via oxidation of two nadph for the generation of reduced ferredoxin and nadh buckel and thauer 2018 therefore the activity of etf complex and nfnab should contribute to the generation of reduced ferredoxin in g sulfurreducens the expression of nitrogenase and its regulatory cascade were also upregulated in n deficient electrolyte fig s4b which is consistent with the high nitrogenase activity also indicating a process of bnf in g sulfurreducens 3 4 inoculating g sulfurreducens promotes n deficient wastewater treatment in microbial fuel cells microbial fuel cells mfcs are an effective device for facilitating wastewater treatment due to it enhancing the anaerobic respiration catabolism of the microbial community liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 it has been reported that mfcs could also be used for synthetic n deficient wastewater which had the characteristics of pulp and paper and the sugar refining industries treatment after inducing the enrichment of electrochemically active nitrogen fixing bacteria wong et al 2014 the abilities of g sulfurreducens cell to fix nitrogen by reducing the anode and to generate current more efficiently in n deficient electrolyte suggest that g sulfurreducens could be applied in n deficient wastewater treatment this possibility was tested in the three electrode two chambered h shaped cell with the anode chamber directly supplied with the real pulp and paper mills wastewater collected from nine dragons paper limited dongguan china and the catholyte of fmnn medium the wastewater had a ph of 7 56 and an initial doc of approximately 950 mg l 1 and total nitrogen of 43 33 1 51 mg l 1 as shown in fig 5 a the mfc slowly generated a current that achieved a maximum of approximately 0 012 ma cm 2 in 5 days and then remained stable when treated with crude n deficient wastewater meanwhile the doc of the wastewater decreased slowly at a rate of 8 99 2 02 mg l 1 day 1 and the net ntotal of the mfc increased steadily at a rate of 0 488 0 14 mg l 1 day 1 fig 5b in contrast after inoculation of 5 ml of g sulfurreducens culture in the anolyte the current increased continuously and arrived at a maximum of ca 0 075 ma cm 2 at 10 days thereafter decreasing due to the depletion of doc fig 5a here the average doc removal rate and ntotal increasing rate were 45 42 4 02 mg l 1 day 1 and 1 44 0 19 mg l 1 day 1 respectively fig 5b therefore the inoculation of g sulfurreducens increased the electrocatalytic activity and nitrogen fixation of the microbial community in particular the nitrogenase activity at day 12 was 1 7 0 29 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1 h 1 which was much higher than the nitrogenase activity without g sulfurreducens inoculation 0 097 0 04 μmol c2h4 mg protein 1h 1 fig 5c this result demonstrated that supplementation with g sulfurreducens could accelerate n deficient wastewater treatment by increasing anaerobic respiration and nitrogen fixation of the anode microbial community the microbial community architectures in the two different treatments were analyzed by examining the 16s rdna profiles after performing illumina miseq sequencing the overall phylogenetic characteristics at the genus level are plotted in fig 5d as illustrated the inoculation of g sufurreducens affected the structure of the bacterial community in detail genera belonging to tepidiphilus pseudomonas and thermicanus dominated in crude wastewater after being treated by mfc genera belonging to tepidiphilus bacteroides pseudomonas desulfovibrio ideonella and unclassified pseudomonadaceae dominated in the anode biofilm here species from pseudomonas and ideonella contain diazotrophs that can perform anaerobic growth and fix nitrogen noar and buckley 2009 yan et al 2010 thereby providing nitrogen sources to other species and species from bacteroides pseudomonas and desulfovibrio can perform extracellular electron transfer ha et al 2012 ouyang et al 2021 yu et al 2018 which can contribute to anodic respiration for current generation furthermore species from bacteroides pseudomonas and ideonella are predicted to also contribute to the decomposition of doc including lignin hemicelluloses benzoic acid phenylacetic acid hexadecenoic acid etc in wastewater ismail and hossain 2015 thorell et al 2003 and could provide simple carbon and energy sources for other species wong et al 2014 the diversity of the microbial community was further increased after inoculation with g sulfurreducens for example the community of diazotrophs expanded to include species from azospirillum steenhoudt and vanderleyden 2000 geobacter ideonella and clostridiales chen 2004 and the community of exoelectrogens included bacteroides desulfovibrio pseudomonas and geobacter species in particular geobacter species dominated the anode microbial community accounting for 4 51 and are predicted to be the predominant contributors to current generation and nitrogen fixation considering that they are the most efficient exoelectrogens and are able to synchronize biological nitrogen fixation and current generation 4 discussion 4 1 using electrogenic diazotroph for green nitrogen fixation geobacter species are the most efficient exoelectrogens and contain genes encoding nitrogen fixing functions lovley et al 2011 methé et al 2005 applying geobacter species as an electrogenic diazotroph and an anode as an electron acceptor showed promise for realizing simultaneous current generation and biological nitrogen fixation especially considering that performing electron intensive nitrogen fixation was not shown to affect current generation or columbic efficiency of microbial fuel cells and that the current nitrogen fixing industry is energy intensive moreover previous progresses in increasing the loading of exoelectrogens on the anode or the current generation of the anode provides possibilities to further increase nitrogen fixation liu et al 2019 yaqoob et al 2020 for example upon shifting the operation of this g sulfurreducens fuel cell from fed batch mode to continuous mode the maximum current increases to 0 3 0 02 ma cm 2 and the nitrogen fixation rate reaches approximately 8 6 mg l 1 day 1 fig s5 this is approaching the highest rate of microbial nitrogen fixation as recently reported ospina betancourth et al 2020 notably even though the combination of a bioelectrochemical system with nitrogen fixing bacteria for nitrogen fixation has been reported chen et al 2021 knoche et al 2017 in these systems electric energy was consumed to drive nitrogen fixation our results showed that nitrogen fixation affected the biofilm formation of g sulfurreducens inducing the formation of a rough biofilm transcriptome analysis demonstrated that the genes related to chemotaxis and flagella expression were down regulated during nitrogen fixation table s2 we also showed that a rough anode biofilm was formed in n sufficient electrolyte when the expression of the flagellum was inhibited fig s6 so it can be speculated that a deficiency of flagellum expression during nitrogen fixation contributed to the formation of a rough biofilm highlighting the structural function of flagella in g sulfurreducens biofilm formation liu et al 2019 inhibiting the expression of flagella might be a mechanism to save energy to meet the energy demand needed for nitrogen fixation 4 2 balancing act between catabolism and anabolism the finding showing that g sulfurreducens cell increased acetate respiration but decreased acetate to cell carbon conversion during nitrogen fixation indicated that g sulfurreducens harbors a mechanism to regulate the carbon metabolism this is consistent with previous studies showing that g sulfurreducens possessed a mechanism to upregulate acetate catabolism for energy production and reduce acetate anabolism under conditions of electron acceptor limitation esteve núñez et al 2005 mahadevan et al 2006 this type of response was suggested to be universal in providing cells with enough atp to adapt to fluctuating subsurface environment esteve núñez et al 2005 thereafter satisfying the extensive energy demand during nitrogen fixation it was reported that the intracellular metabolite level and the redox state are two major factors determining the global regulation of cellular activities kouzuma et al 2015 considering the accumulation of nad p h in cells under both nitrogen fixing and electron acceptor limiting conditions a more reducing intracellular environment might trigger a similar cellular response in shifting metabolism toward energy generation actually the transcriptome data have shown a different expression of signal transduction pathways table s3 such as second messenger system and two component system in g sulfurreducens under different nitrogen conditions indicating an active metabolic regulation 4 3 using electrogenic diazotroph for n deficient wastewater treatment using geobacter species as additives to facilitate n deficient wastewater treatment in a bioelectrochemical system bes is intriguing and represents a novel technique traditionally n deficient wastewater treatment strategies include adding ammonium supplying nitrogen fixing microorganisms and treating with activated sludge ismail and hossain 2015 vashi et al 2018 however corresponding problems arise including the risk of nitrogen contamination the energy consuming process of aeration and the concomitant oxygen toxicity to nitrogenase vashi et al 2018 in contrast combining geobacter species and bes for n deficient wastewater treatment eliminates these problems since the bes is an anaerobic system and the anode can act as an infinite electron acceptor to support the nitrogen fixation of geobacter species thereby generating electrical energy notably the specific function of geobacter species in this process has not been identified electroactive diazotrophs have been proposed to directly oxidize organic waste to reduce the anode during n deficient wastewater treatment wong et al 2014 however geobacter species were shown to only be able to grow on a few small organic acids including the fermentation products of other species lovley et al 2011 therefore it is possible that they can form symbiosis with other fermenting bacteria and establish a syntrophic community thereby accelerating doc removal notably geobacter species can express conductive extracellular matrices liu et al 2020a 2020b 2019 or form direct electric contacts with other species liu et al 2018 rotaru et al 2014 thereby contributing to the extracellular respiration of other species the simultaneous abundance of the other diazotrophs and exoelectrogens strengthens the possibility of geobacter species contributing to or facilitating the anodic respiration of those species further studies are warranted furthermore the finding that biological nitrogen fixation consumes doc in wastewater and generates electric energy is not only beneficial for the environment but also exemplifies green nitrogen fixation 5 conclusions in this study we demonstrated simultaneous biological nitrogen fixation and electric energy production by g sulfurreducens specifically the biological nitrogen fixation of g sulfurreducens was driven by anode respiration after coupling the extracellular electron transfer for energy production with nitrogen fixation and in return biological nitrogen fixation could enhance anode respiration of the g sulfurreducens cell by increasing acetate catabolism but decreasing acetate anabolism and increasing extracellular electron transfer furthermore we revealed that biological nitrogen fixation did not impair the current generation or coulombic efficiency of the g sulfurreducens fuel cell finally we showed that g sulfurreducens could be supplied in n deficient wastewater during bioelectrochemical treatment which not only increased the anaerobic respiration of the consortia but also enhanced the biological nitrogen fixation of the system thereby supporting the formation of an efficient microbial community for wastewater treatment our findings show great promise to further green nitrogen fixation and could be used in n deficient wastewater bioelectrochemical treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest funding this
