9240,it is still a long term challenge to decrease root rot and improve saponin content of panax notoginseng thus economic benefits in guangxi and yunnan provinces china the objective of this study was therefore to propose a promising abiotic stresses strategy deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride disc to cope with the challenge a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on physiological traits yield quality attributes water use efficiency and economic benefit of panax notoginseng in 2018 and 2019 experiment treatments consisted of two deficit irrigation levels d l light deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 80 65 θ fc d m moderate deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 70 55 θ fc where θ fc represents field capacity and five nacl application rates 0 c 0 15 c 1 30 c 2 45 c 3 and 60 c 4 mmol l 1 respectively all treatments were designed using a randomized complete block with three replications the results indicated that disc could significantly promote the physiology and growth of panax notoginseng and improve yield quality and economic benefits under micro sprinkler irrigation and shaded conditions in 2018 and 2019 compared with the d m c 0 and d l c 0 treatments d l c 1 treatment significantly improved net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs root k r shoot k sh and canopy k c hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng the d l c 1 treatment significantly increased root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng compared with the d m c 0 and d l c 0 treatments the d l c 1 treatment significantly improved rood dry matter yield saponin content of panax notoginseng water use efficiency and economic benefits by decreasing the incidence of root rot but reverse results were observed in the d l c 2 d l c 3 and d l c 4 treatments therefore this study suggested that deficit irrigation amount d l 80 65 θ fc combined with nacl concentration c 1 15 mmol l 1 should be recommended as an appropriate agronomic management strategy to alleviate root rot and improve water use efficiency saponin content economic benefits of panax notoginseng in the seasonally arid region of southwest china graphical abstract ga1 keywords panax notoginseng deficit irrigation incidence of root rot saponin content water use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction panax notoginseng burk f h chen which was called sanqi that belonged to a perennial herb species of panax genus under the araliaceae family was a main cash crop planted widely in seasonal arid regions yunnan province of southwest china cui et al 2002 panax notoginseng was a famous chinese medicine due to the fact that it contained lots of saponins such as notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r b1 r e r d and r g1 li et al 2013 notably panax notoginseng powder had the functions of promoting blood circulation removing blood stasis stopping bleeding and relieving pain in medicine in the medical field yang et al 2018 therefore the improvement of the yield and quality of panax notoginseng would play a very important role in the pharmaceutical market and human health however recently the yield per unit area of panax notoginseng has improved from 879 kg ha 1 in 2003 1102 kg ha 1 in 2007 but dropped from 1097 kg ha 1 in 2008 500 kg ha 1 in 2013 bai et al 2014 cui et al 2014 moreover it was worth noting that the quality saponins and other bioactive ingredients of panax notoginseng also decreased sharply due to unreasonable planting management measures such as excessive irrigation and pesticides liao et al 2017a 2017b zhao et al 2020 most importantly the yield of panax notoginseng was an effective guarantee for farmers to obtain economic income miao et al 2006 reported that the frequent occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng was responsible for the decrease of yield and quality of panax notoginseng therefore how to improve the yield and quality of notoginseng and deal with the occurrence of root rot has become an urgent problem in the cultivation of notoginseng panax notoginseng usually preferred a shaded and humid growing environment and the plant will produce roots with beneficial therapeutic effects for at least three years in seasonal arid regions of southwest china miao et al 2006 duan et al 2018 this long cultivation period combined with the warm and humid environment makes plants vulnerable to attacks by many soil borne pathogens including fungi bacteria and nematodes kim et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 march april and july august were the two peak periods for the incidence of root rot panax notoginseng tang et al 2020 this was attributed to the fact that rainfall was scarce in the seasonal arid region from march to april while rainfall was frequent in july august this would make it difficult to control soil moisture in the panax notoginseng field thereby resulting in occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng therefore the humidity light transmittance and soil moisture were major factors resulting in the incidence of root rot wang et al 1998 in this study we built an artificial growth environment fig 1b c suitable for the growth of panax notoginseng in order to reduce the influence of these factors on the growth of panax notoginseng the artificial growth environment consisted of micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems which could be used to deal with the problem of air humidity and light transmittance however irrigation levels could directly affect soil moisture in panax notoginseng fields which would cause occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng due to the fact that root rot was closely related to soil moisture cook and papendick 1972 for example study reported by li et al 2021 found that high irrigation level could not only increase incidence of root rot of panax notoginseng but also decrease yield and bioactive ingredients of panax notoginseng xia et al 2016 also reported that high soil moisture could increase the severity of root rot of panax notoginseng therefore taking effective water control measures to prevent panax notoginseng root rot and increase yield and quality were of great significance to panax notoginseng production economic efficiency and the development of cultivation theory water deficit stress was an effectively water controlling measure that could not only promote root growth and increase yield but also contribute to the synthesis of medicinal ingredients reynolds et al 1994 gao and liang 2004 zhang et al 2018 notably many studies reported that water deficit was beneficial to improve yield and quality of chinese herbal medicine such as astragalus membranaceus in 60 65 swc liang et al 2016 dendrobium moniliforme in 40 70 swc wu et al 2016 and salvia miltiorrhiza bunge in 70 fc liu et al 2011 however little information is available in the literature regarding the effects of water deficit on root rot of panax notoginseng furthermore lots of pesticides were frequently sprayed by farmers in panax notoginseng fields to prevent and control root rot of panax notoginseng in traditional field management measures zotarelli et al 2009 the traditional pesticides application could not only lead to a sharp decline in the quality of panax notoginseng but also cause the pesticide residues of panax notoginseng to exceed the standard yang et al 2022 which will seriously affect the production of panax notoginseng and human health therefore finding a measure that could replace pesticides to prevent and control root rot of panax notoginseng will be of great significance to the green production of panax notoginseng and human health fortunately chloride could be used to inhibit plant diseases and has been widely recognized in crop productivity maas 1986 fixen 1993 it was worth noting that the application of sodium chloride could alleviate disease stress and promote crop growth when crops suffered from disease stress elmer 1992 chloride could affect nitrification plant water potential root exudates and the effectiveness of manganese and phosphate elmer 1992 schneider 1990 elmer 2003 it could also inhibit nitrification and allow nitrogen to exist in the form of ammonia for longer periods of time elmer 2003 moreover the application of cl indirectly alleviated root diseases by increasing beneficial microorganisms to inhibit these disease related microorganisms and promote plant growth characteristics elmer 1995 huber and mccay buis 1993 when nacl was applied to fields that have declined due to root rot the severity of the disease would decrease and the yield would increase elmer 1995 roseberg et al 1986 most importantly some researchers observed z xanthoxylum and sesuvium portulacastrum absorbed na from a low salinity soil and accumulated it in the leaves demonstrated that na accumulation is involved in plant resistance to water stress maas and grattan 1999 martı nez et al 2004 wang et al 2004 glenn and brown 1998 concluded the atriplex canescens tolerance to water and salt stress is linked through a common mechanism of na uptake yue et al 2012 reported that nacl mitigated the deleterious impacts of deficit irrigation on the cell membranes and stimulated growth and alleviated water stress in z xanthoxylum by improving photosynthesis sodium chloride was superior to other chloride salts such as kcl or cacl2 in reducing the severity of disease elmer 1992 at present however there are few studies on the effects of nacl application on severity of root rot yield and quality of panax notoginseng therefore to sum up the above we tried to explore the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on plant hydraulic conductance photosynthetic characteristics root morphological characteristics root dry matter root rot rate yield water use efficiency and quality of panax notoginseng a two year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2019 in the field under an artificial micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 investigate the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic characteristics of panax notoginseng 2 explore the responses of root morphological characteristics and root dry matter to the deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride 3 evaluate the influence of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride incidence of root rot yield and quality of panax notoginseng 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site in 2018 and 2019 a two year field experiment was carried out at luxi research and demonstration base of key

2018 and 2019 fig 2 which was the high incidence stage of root rot of panax notoginseng zhang et al 2019 the daily mean air temperature was 17 1 in 2018 and 18 1 in 2019 respectively fig 2 the physicochemical properties of soil in the experimental site are showed in table 1 2 2 experimental design experiment treatments consisted of two deficit irrigation levels d l light deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 80 65 θ fc d m moderate deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 70 55 θ fc where θ fc represents field capacity and five nacl application rates 0 c 0 15 c 1 30 c 2 45 c 3 and 60 c 4 mmol l 1 yue et al 2012 colmenero flores et al 2019 franco navarro et al 2021 respectively table 2 each treatment had three replicates randomly distributed within 30 plots each plot was designed with an area of 7 5 m2 all plots were irrigated with an independent micro sprinkler irrigation system which consisted of a main pipe water valve water meter and three micro sprinkler irrigation nozzles panax notoginseng seedlings were purchased from local farmers in luxi county and each plant was planted at 10 cm intervals in each plot with 750 plants then the surface of each plot was covered with 1 cm thick pine needles the water valve and water meter installed on main water pipe of each plot were used to control the amount of irrigation the spray area of each nozzle was circular and the diameter of the spray area was about 1 5 m a watering bottle was used to spray different concentrations of sodium chloride solution directly on the soil surface of panax notoginseng field in order to prevent the sodium chloride solution from burning the panax notoginseng leaves 2 3 field management and agronomic practices panax notoginseng usually preferred a shaded and humid growing environment in seasonal arid regions of southwest china miao et al 2006 therefore we build an artificial growth environment fig 1b c suitable for the growth of panax notoginseng the artificial growth environment consisted of micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems fig 1b c which could be used to deal with the problem of air humidity and light transmittance the artificial shading system consisted of three layers of shading nets and pine stakes fig 1b a 2 1 m long pine stakes were buried at 2 m intervals in the field of panax notoginseng and then using steel wire to fix the shading nets on the top and periphery of the pine stakes measured the light transmittance with tes 1330a the growing environment of panax notoginseng was 24 5 the fertilizer was a large amount of element water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 1 1 2 n 94 5 kg ha 1 p 94 5 kg ha 1 k 189 kg ha 1 produced by sichuan shifang demei industrial co ltd tang et al 2020 all treatments had same fertilization schedule table 2 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 soil water content soil water content at the soil profile 0 60 cm was measured using trime pico iph tdr profile soil moisture measurement system after each irrigation event in each plot the instrument was a sensor based on time domain reflectometry with intelligent microelements and it could directly measure the dielectric constant of soil or other media that was closely related to the soil moisture content the soil water content could be calculated and displayed by the reading system through the analog voltage output the measurement depths of the instrument were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm respectively three tubes of trime measured soil moisture were installed in each plot at 20 cm intervals and total of 30 probes in 10 treatments the monitored soil water contents were calibrated by a measured soil water content with an oven drying method soil samples were collected at 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm soil depths in the vicinity of instruments in each plot 3 replicates at each depth 540 soil samples in total volumetric soil water content was determined by multiplying the gravimetric water content with bulk density liang et al 2021 bulk density

root samples were collected by the monolith method bohm 1979 in october 2018 and 2019 root samples were individually dug in a soil volume of 10 10 cm and a depth of 30 cm where panax notoginseng plants had similar aboveground growth conditions in all treatments the root samples were loaded into a 5 mm mesh sieve and then rinsed with water in order to separate roots from soil sample then these root samples were tiled scanned and photographed by using the winrhizo root analysis system in order to obtain the parameters of root morphological characteristic such as root length surface area average diameter and volume of root pang et al 2011 moreover root dry matter was determined by placing these root samples in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then drying to constant weight at 50 c root weight density was the root dry matter divided by the volume of root sample at harvest root dry matter 3 m2 field plots for each treatment was determined by the above method then the root dry matter was used to estimate yield of panax notoginseng per hectare 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 water use efficiency evapotranspiration et was calculated through the water balance method liang et al 2019 li et al

sodium chloride disc adaptive abiotic stresses strategy for farming herbs was conductive to improve the accumulation of active substances and sustain agricultural production hayashi and sudo 2009 mária et al 2012 egamberdieva and mamedov 2015 sarker et al 2018 zhao 2018 furlan et al 2020 deficit irrigation and sodium chloride disc application were regarded as water stress and salt stress respectively water stress and salt stress were classified as the popularly adaptive abiotic stress way that could be used as a promising measure to increase yield and quality of crops by decreasing root rot hohjo et al 1999 elmer 2003 van kruistum et al 2005 xia et al 2016 liao et al 2017 in this present study we tried to propose an integrated abiotic stress strategy of disc application based on traditional deficit irrigation water stress we hypothesized that disccould alleviate root rot and improve yield water use efficiency saponin content and economic benefit in the cultivation and production of panax notoginseng our data presented in tables 3 7 supported these hypotheses for example compared with the traditional deficit irrigation treatment disc significantly decreased root rot fig 4 and improved hydraulic conductivity table 3 photosynthetic characteristics table 4 root morphological characteristics table 5 root dry matter fig 3 yield wue fig 4 economic benefits table 6 and saponin content table 7 of panax notoginseng deficit irrigation and sodium chloride stress could contribute to improving the physiology and growth of panax notoginseng in this present study it was noteworthy that hydraulic conductivity photosynthetic characteristics root dry matter of panax notoginseng were larger in the light deficit irrigation d l treatment than that of the moderate deficit irrigation d m treatment tables 3 4 this might be due to the following two reasons on the one hand high water stress d m might inhibit photosynthesis of plant by reducing leaf gas exchange rate thereby reducing dry matter accumulation wang et al 2008a 2008b gong et al 2006 also demonstrated that moderate water deficit could close the stomata of plant leaves resulting in lower net photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic accumulation on the other hand the greater the degree of deficit irrigation the longer the soil continues to dry which will lead to damage of leaf cell structure and stomata to close reduce gas exchange rate thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation wang et al 2008a 2008b shahzad 2022 liao et al 2017 also demonstrated that too little soil water content could significantly decrease the photosynthesis characteristics plant growth yield and quality of panax notoginseng moreover it was noteworthy that the hydraulic conductivity photosynthetic characteristics root dry matter yield quality and economic benefits of panax notoginseng first increased and then decreased with increasing sodium chloride concentration and the maximum value of these parameters was obtained in the c 1 treatment in 2018 and 2019 this result implied that appropriate sodium chloride concentration could improve the production of panax notoginseng and the economic benefits of farmers but the reverse result was obtained in the treatment of excessive sodium chloride concentration similar result reported by huang et al 2022 and hohjo et al 1999 indicated that appropriate sodium chloride could promote photosynthesis and growth of plants and improve dry matter accumulation crop yield and quality this was mainly attributed to the fact that excessive nacl application affected the photosynthetic electron transport chain resulting in the release of more reactive oxygen species into plant cells causing photooxidative damage and photoinhibition and reducing leaf photosynthesis which in turn reduces plant growth and dry matter accumulation ricoult et al 2006 huang et al 2022 in this present study the optimal wuei was in d l c 0 the deficit irrigation has no significant effect on wuei but the concentration of sodium chloride had a significant effect moreover the largest wue was in d m c 1 and yield was in d l c 1 this indicated that panax notoginseng plants may not tolerate to drought and salinity but adaptive abiotic stresses strategy disc was beneficial to improve production of panax notoginseng this might attribute to that the positive roles of nacl in the drought resistance the plant accumulated concentrations of na in the leaves and use the na as an osmoregulator to cope with deficit water yue et al 2012 franco navarro et al 2021 found that drought resistance promoted by cl nutrition improved leaf turgor water balance photosynthesis performance wuei and wue during deficit irrigation but wuei for assessing the effects of genes on plants it used to explain the instantaneous physiological state of plants and inability to provide a comprehensive reflection of crop productivity and crop water use efficiency over an extended period of time gago et al 2014 d h wang et al 2010 j l wang et al 2010 compared with wuei the wue and yield are more important therefore the d l c 1 treatment would be a promising abiotic stresses strategy for promoting the production of panax notoginseng and improving the economic benefits of farmers 4 2 effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on root rot of panax notoginseng continuous cropping obstacle was the main factor restricting the production of panax notoginseng especially the root rot problem due to the fact that panax notoginseng was a perennial herb li et al 2021 panax notoginseng root rot occurred when fusarium oxysporum in the soil infected the injured root system dong et al 2016 notably excessive pesticides were generally used by farmers to prevent and control the occurrence of root rot zotarelli et al 2009 which would result in the pesticide residues of panax notoginseng to exceed the standard yang et al 2022 therefore finding a green control measure for root rot was of great significance to the production of panax notoginseng in this present study disc could significantly decrease the incidence of root rot compared with the c 0 treatment without applying sodium chloride fig 4 for example the d l c 1 treatment was effective in decreasing the root rot incidence and improving root morphological characteristics taproot dry matter fibrous root dry matter total root dry matter tables 5 7 this was mainly due to the fact that root rot of panax notoginseng was positively correlated with soil water content xia et al 2016 similar study reported by liao et al 2017 indicated that appropriate water deficit could promote the growth and development of panax notoginseng roots due to the fact that the root of panax notoginseng was sensitive to the change of soil water ricoult et al 2006 demonstrated that excess soil water content could lead to root rot moreover compared with the traditional application of pesticides applying sodium chloride to reduce root rot could not only reduce the cost of pesticides but also produce healthy panax notoginseng without pesticide residues similar studies reported by van kruistum et al 2005 and ester et al 2003 indicated that nacl application could significantly reduce the incidence of root rot and increase asparagus yield hanson and may 2011 this was mainly due to the following three reasons on the one hand the application of nacl to crop roots could inhibit soil fungal infection and improve plant stress resistance thereby reducing the incidence of root rot elmer 2002 on the other hand nacl application could reduce the root rot incidence of plant by directly affecting the internal physiological metabolism of plants or indirectly affecting the resistance of plants to external water and pathogens xu et al 1999 furthermore nacl application could promote root growth of plant wang et al 2009 robin and saha 2015 therefore exploring the relationships between nacl and root growth and fusarium oxysporum were fundamentally needed in revealing underlying mechanisms of alleviating root rot of panax notoginseng however the relationships were not addressed in this study in further researches therefore we should mainly focus on the following several aspects 1 monitoring the vertical and horizontal distributions of panax notoginseng roots with and without sodium chloride treatments during the different panax notoginseng growing stages 2 analyzing the effect of sodium chloride on fusarium oxysporum in soil and 3 quantifying relationships between nacl and root growth and fusarium oxysporum with and without sodium chloride treatments 4 3 effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on saponin content of panax notoginseng abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity significantly increased the content of four iridoid glycosides and steroid alkaloid solanine in scrophulariaceae and solanum nigrum l d h wang et al 2010 j l wang et al 2010 aftab 2019 deficit irrigation significantly affected the content of the main monomer saponins cao et al 2015 eisenreich et al 2004 rohdich et al 2001 suzuki et al 2002 tansakul et al 2006 in the current study the saponin content of panax notoginseng was larger in the d l treatment than that of the d m treatment in 2018 and 2019 this result implied that light deficit irrigation could improve saponin content of panax notoginseng similar studies also reported that light deficit irrigation could increase glycyrrhizic acid content of licorice root nasrollahi et al 2014 tanshinone content of salvia miltiorrhiza yang et al 2012 and anthocyanin and secondary metabolite content of pomegranate fruit bazargani et al 2011 however excessive water deficit adversely affects plant root yield and accumulation of active substances xia et al 2016 liu et al 2011 demonstrated that high water stress could significantly decrease rosmarinic acid content of salvia furthermore nacl application could modulate the production of secondary metabolites such as saponins one of glucosinolates martínez et al 2013 suggested that leaf water balance under salt stress was maintained by increasing the synthesis of osmoprotective compounds by glucosinolates lópez et al 2008 indicated that the addition of nacl increases the content of glucosinolates in the water balance response of plants to salt stress in this study the r 1 r b1 r e r d and r g1 first increased and then decreased with increasing nacl concentrations and the largest five monomeric saponins were observed in the c 1 treatment this result implied that the application of appropriate nacl concentration could promote plant growth and production or induce synthesis of secondary metabolites espinosa leal et al 2018 wa lwalaba et al 2017 therefore light deficit irrigation and appropriate sodium chloride concentration could improve saponin content of panax notoginseng naik and al khayri 2016 puente garza et al 2017 5 conclusions in conclusion the disc was a promising abiotic stresses strategy to alleviate incidence of root rot and improve yield water use efficiency saponin content of panax notoginseng and economic benefits compared with the traditional deficit irrigation the deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride could improve net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs root k r shoot k sh and canopy k c hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng in this study compared with d l c 0 the d l c 1 treatment deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride significantly increased root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng moreover the d l c 1 treatment significantly decrease the incidence of root rot of panax notoginseng and improve rood dry matter yield saponin content of panax notoginseng water use efficiency and economic benefits therefore the combination of deficit irrigation amount d l 70 55 θ fc and nacl concentration c 1 15 mmol l 1 should be recommended as an economical and appropriate agronomic management method for decreasing incidence of root rot and improve yield and saponin content

9240,it is still a long term challenge to decrease root rot and improve saponin content of panax notoginseng thus economic benefits in guangxi and yunnan provinces china the objective of this study was therefore to propose a promising abiotic stresses strategy deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride disc to cope with the challenge a two year field experiment was conducted to explore the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on physiological traits yield quality attributes water use efficiency and economic benefit of panax notoginseng in 2018 and 2019 experiment treatments consisted of two deficit irrigation levels d l light deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 80 65 θ fc d m moderate deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 70 55 θ fc where θ fc represents field capacity and five nacl application rates 0 c 0 15 c 1 30 c 2 45 c 3 and 60 c 4 mmol l 1 respectively all treatments were designed using a randomized complete block with three replications the results indicated that disc could significantly promote the physiology and growth of panax notoginseng and improve yield quality and economic benefits under micro sprinkler irrigation and shaded conditions in 2018 and 2019 compared with the d m c 0 and d l c 0 treatments d l c 1 treatment significantly improved net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs root k r shoot k sh and canopy k c hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng the d l c 1 treatment significantly increased root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng compared with the d m c 0 and d l c 0 treatments the d l c 1 treatment significantly improved rood dry matter yield saponin content of panax notoginseng water use efficiency and economic benefits by decreasing the incidence of root rot but reverse results were observed in the d l c 2 d l c 3 and d l c 4 treatments therefore this study suggested that deficit irrigation amount d l 80 65 θ fc combined with nacl concentration c 1 15 mmol l 1 should be recommended as an appropriate agronomic management strategy to alleviate root rot and improve water use efficiency saponin content economic benefits of panax notoginseng in the seasonally arid region of southwest china graphical abstract ga1 keywords panax notoginseng deficit irrigation incidence of root rot saponin content water use efficiency data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction panax notoginseng burk f h chen which was called sanqi that belonged to a perennial herb species of panax genus under the araliaceae family was a main cash crop planted widely in seasonal arid regions yunnan province of southwest china cui et al 2002 panax notoginseng was a famous chinese medicine due to the fact that it contained lots of saponins such as notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r b1 r e r d and r g1 li et al 2013 notably panax notoginseng powder had the functions of promoting blood circulation removing blood stasis stopping bleeding and relieving pain in medicine in the medical field yang et al 2018 therefore the improvement of the yield and quality of panax notoginseng would play a very important role in the pharmaceutical market and human health however recently the yield per unit area of panax notoginseng has improved from 879 kg ha 1 in 2003 1102 kg ha 1 in 2007 but dropped from 1097 kg ha 1 in 2008 500 kg ha 1 in 2013 bai et al 2014 cui et al 2014 moreover it was worth noting that the quality saponins and other bioactive ingredients of panax notoginseng also decreased sharply due to unreasonable planting management measures such as excessive irrigation and pesticides liao et al 2017a 2017b zhao et al 2020 most importantly the yield of panax notoginseng was an effective guarantee for farmers to obtain economic income miao et al 2006 reported that the frequent occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng was responsible for the decrease of yield and quality of panax notoginseng therefore how to improve the yield and quality of notoginseng and deal with the occurrence of root rot has become an urgent problem in the cultivation of notoginseng panax notoginseng usually preferred a shaded and humid growing environment and the plant will produce roots with beneficial therapeutic effects for at least three years in seasonal arid regions of southwest china miao et al 2006 duan et al 2018 this long cultivation period combined with the warm and humid environment makes plants vulnerable to attacks by many soil borne pathogens including fungi bacteria and nematodes kim et al 2006 zhao et al 2020 march april and july august were the two peak periods for the incidence of root rot panax notoginseng tang et al 2020 this was attributed to the fact that rainfall was scarce in the seasonal arid region from march to april while rainfall was frequent in july august this would make it difficult to control soil moisture in the panax notoginseng field thereby resulting in occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng therefore the humidity light transmittance and soil moisture were major factors resulting in the incidence of root rot wang et al 1998 in this study we built an artificial growth environment fig 1b c suitable for the growth of panax notoginseng in order to reduce the influence of these factors on the growth of panax notoginseng the artificial growth environment consisted of micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems which could be used to deal with the problem of air humidity and light transmittance however irrigation levels could directly affect soil moisture in panax notoginseng fields which would cause occurrence of root rot of panax notoginseng due to the fact that root rot was closely related to soil moisture cook and papendick 1972 for example study reported by li et al 2021 found that high irrigation level could not only increase incidence of root rot of panax notoginseng but also decrease yield and bioactive ingredients of panax notoginseng xia et al 2016 also reported that high soil moisture could increase the severity of root rot of panax notoginseng therefore taking effective water control measures to prevent panax notoginseng root rot and increase yield and quality were of great significance to panax notoginseng production economic efficiency and the development of cultivation theory water deficit stress was an effectively water controlling measure that could not only promote root growth and increase yield but also contribute to the synthesis of medicinal ingredients reynolds et al 1994 gao and liang 2004 zhang et al 2018 notably many studies reported that water deficit was beneficial to improve yield and quality of chinese herbal medicine such as astragalus membranaceus in 60 65 swc liang et al 2016 dendrobium moniliforme in 40 70 swc wu et al 2016 and salvia miltiorrhiza bunge in 70 fc liu et al 2011 however little information is available in the literature regarding the effects of water deficit on root rot of panax notoginseng furthermore lots of pesticides were frequently sprayed by farmers in panax notoginseng fields to prevent and control root rot of panax notoginseng in traditional field management measures zotarelli et al 2009 the traditional pesticides application could not only lead to a sharp decline in the quality of panax notoginseng but also cause the pesticide residues of panax notoginseng to exceed the standard yang et al 2022 which will seriously affect the production of panax notoginseng and human health therefore finding a measure that could replace pesticides to prevent and control root rot of panax notoginseng will be of great significance to the green production of panax notoginseng and human health fortunately chloride could be used to inhibit plant diseases and has been widely recognized in crop productivity maas 1986 fixen 1993 it was worth noting that the application of sodium chloride could alleviate disease stress and promote crop growth when crops suffered from disease stress elmer 1992 chloride could affect nitrification plant water potential root exudates and the effectiveness of manganese and phosphate elmer 1992 schneider 1990 elmer 2003 it could also inhibit nitrification and allow nitrogen to exist in the form of ammonia for longer periods of time elmer 2003 moreover the application of cl indirectly alleviated root diseases by increasing beneficial microorganisms to inhibit these disease related microorganisms and promote plant growth characteristics elmer 1995 huber and mccay buis 1993 when nacl was applied to fields that have declined due to root rot the severity of the disease would decrease and the yield would increase elmer 1995 roseberg et al 1986 most importantly some researchers observed z xanthoxylum and sesuvium portulacastrum absorbed na from a low salinity soil and accumulated it in the leaves demonstrated that na accumulation is involved in plant resistance to water stress maas and grattan 1999 martı nez et al 2004 wang et al 2004 glenn and brown 1998 concluded the atriplex canescens tolerance to water and salt stress is linked through a common mechanism of na uptake yue et al 2012 reported that nacl mitigated the deleterious impacts of deficit irrigation on the cell membranes and stimulated growth and alleviated water stress in z xanthoxylum by improving photosynthesis sodium chloride was superior to other chloride salts such as kcl or cacl2 in reducing the severity of disease elmer 1992 at present however there are few studies on the effects of nacl application on severity of root rot yield and quality of panax notoginseng therefore to sum up the above we tried to explore the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on plant hydraulic conductance photosynthetic characteristics root morphological characteristics root dry matter root rot rate yield water use efficiency and quality of panax notoginseng a two year field experiment was conducted from 2018 to 2019 in the field under an artificial micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems the main objectives of this study were therefore to 1 investigate the effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic characteristics of panax notoginseng 2 explore the responses of root morphological characteristics and root dry matter to the deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride 3 evaluate the influence of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride incidence of root rot yield and quality of panax notoginseng 2 materials and methods 2 1 details of experimental site in 2018 and 2019 a two year field experiment was carried out at luxi research and demonstration base of key technologies for water control pollution reduction quality and efficiency improvement of panax notoginseng wujiepu town luxi city yunnan province china 24 26 n 103 34 e altitude 1945 m fig 1a this experimental site has a subtropical monsoon climate the precipitation was 1096 5 mm in 2018 and 915 9 mm in 2019 respectively fig 2 precipitation was mostly concentrated between june and october in 2018 and 2019 fig 2 which was the high incidence stage of root rot of panax notoginseng zhang et al 2019 the daily mean air temperature was 17 1 in 2018 and 18 1 in 2019 respectively fig 2 the physicochemical properties of soil in the experimental site are showed in table 1 2 2 experimental design experiment treatments consisted of two deficit irrigation levels d l light deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 80 65 θ fc d m moderate deficit level irrigation upper lower limit 70 55 θ fc where θ fc represents field capacity and five nacl application rates 0 c 0 15 c 1 30 c 2 45 c 3 and 60 c 4 mmol l 1 yue et al 2012 colmenero flores et al 2019 franco navarro et al 2021 respectively table 2 each treatment had three replicates randomly distributed within 30 plots each plot was designed with an area of 7 5 m2 all plots were irrigated with an independent micro sprinkler irrigation system which consisted of a main pipe water valve water meter and three micro sprinkler irrigation nozzles panax notoginseng seedlings were purchased from local farmers in luxi county and each plant was planted at 10 cm intervals in each plot with 750 plants then the surface of each plot was covered with 1 cm thick pine needles the water valve and water meter installed on main water pipe of each plot were used to control the amount of irrigation the spray area of each nozzle was circular and the diameter of the spray area was about 1 5 m a watering bottle was used to spray different concentrations of sodium chloride solution directly on the soil surface of panax notoginseng field in order to prevent the sodium chloride solution from burning the panax notoginseng leaves 2 3 field management and agronomic practices panax notoginseng usually preferred a shaded and humid growing environment in seasonal arid regions of southwest china miao et al 2006 therefore we build an artificial growth environment fig 1b c suitable for the growth of panax notoginseng the artificial growth environment consisted of micro sprinkler irrigation and shade net systems fig 1b c which could be used to deal with the problem of air humidity and light transmittance the artificial shading system consisted of three layers of shading nets and pine stakes fig 1b a 2 1 m long pine stakes were buried at 2 m intervals in the field of panax notoginseng and then using steel wire to fix the shading nets on the top and periphery of the pine stakes measured the light transmittance with tes 1330a the growing environment of panax notoginseng was 24 5 the fertilizer was a large amount of element water soluble fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 1 1 2 n 94 5 kg ha 1 p 94 5 kg ha 1 k 189 kg ha 1 produced by sichuan shifang demei industrial co ltd tang et al 2020 all treatments had same fertilization schedule table 2 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 soil water content soil water content at the soil profile 0 60 cm was measured using trime pico iph tdr profile soil moisture measurement system after each irrigation event in each plot the instrument was a sensor based on time domain reflectometry with intelligent microelements and it could directly measure the dielectric constant of soil or other media that was closely related to the soil moisture content the soil water content could be calculated and displayed by the reading system through the analog voltage output the measurement depths of the instrument were 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm respectively three tubes of trime measured soil moisture were installed in each plot at 20 cm intervals and total of 30 probes in 10 treatments the monitored soil water contents were calibrated by a measured soil water content with an oven drying method soil samples were collected at 10 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm soil depths in the vicinity of instruments in each plot 3 replicates at each depth 540 soil samples in total volumetric soil water content was determined by multiplying the gravimetric water content with bulk density liang et al 2021 bulk density was calculated by ring knife method volumetric soil water content was used to determine each irrigation event in 2018 and 2019 2 4 2 photosynthetic characteristics and hydraulic conductance five representative plants in each plot were selected to determine the photosynthetic characteristics and hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng in 2018 and 2019 the net photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs measurements were conducted on three leaves were recorded during 9 30 11 00 am using li 6400xt licor lincoln ne usa on sunny days without clouds liao et al 2017a 2017b the hydraulic conductance of shoot canopy and root of panax notoginseng was measured by hpfm gen3 plant high pressure flow meter produced by dynamax company in the united states yang et al 2013 2 4 3 incidence of root rot a field plot of 1 m2 for each treatment was selected to determine the incidence of root rot of panax notoginseng during the harvest period panax notoginseng plants were dug from the 1 m2 field plot from per replicate in each treatment and diseased plants and total number of plants were recorded incidence of root rot was calculated by the following equation 1 i n c i d e n c e o f r o o t r o t n u m b e r o f d i s e a s e d p l a n t s t o t a l n u m b e r o f p l a n t s i n 1 m 2 f i e l d p l o t s 100 2 4 4 root morphological characteristics root dry matter and yield root samples were collected by the monolith method bohm 1979 in october 2018 and 2019 root samples were individually dug in a soil volume of 10 10 cm and a depth of 30 cm where panax notoginseng plants had similar aboveground growth conditions in all treatments the root samples were loaded into a 5 mm mesh sieve and then rinsed with water in order to separate roots from soil sample then these root samples were tiled scanned and photographed by using the winrhizo root analysis system in order to obtain the parameters of root morphological characteristic such as root length surface area average diameter and volume of root pang et al 2011 moreover root dry matter was determined by placing these root samples in an oven at 105 c for 30 min and then drying to constant weight at 50 c root weight density was the root dry matter divided by the volume of root sample at harvest root dry matter 3 m2 field plots for each treatment was determined by the above method then the root dry matter was used to estimate yield of panax notoginseng per hectare 2 5 calculations 2 5 1 water use efficiency evapotranspiration et was calculated through the water balance method liang et al 2019 li et al 2021 2 e t p i δ s w s 3 δ s w s w 0 w e where p i and δsws represents precipitation p mm irrigation amount i mm w 0 is initial soil water storage mm and we is the end soil water storage δsws mm respectively water use efficiency was calculated as follows 4 w u e y e t where wue represents the water use efficiency kg hm 2 mm 1 y represents the panax notoginseng yield kg hm 2 et is the same as in eq 2 2 5 2 cost benefit analysis material inputs including land rental labor cost sodium chloride cover shade material field micro irrigation system water and fertilizer machine an automatic pressurized garden watering can was used for spraying manually the different concentrations of chloride solution panax notoginseng seedling fertilizer update installation of shade nets and plastic tarpaulins infrastructure construction in 2018 and 2019 respectively the output value was yield of panax notoginseng the selling price of panax notoginseng was 93 89 kg 1 due to the fact that the higher saponin content in panax notoginseng and cultivation without any pesticides the input of land rental labor cost cover shade material field micro irrigation system and water and fertilizer machine was 1251 92 1251 92 hm 2 52 189 41 1251 92 and 234 74 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the input of irrigation water and sodium chloride was 0 44 m 3 and 0 04 kg 1 in 2018 and 2019 respectively panax notoginseng seedling fertilizer update installation of shade nets installation of plastic tarpaulins and other infrastructure construction was 344 28 and 1251 92 in 2018 and 2019 respectively exchange rate was 1 6 38 the economic benefit was calculated as follows 5 n e t p r o f i t t o t a l i n c o m e t o t a l c o s t 2 6 saponin content of panax notoginseng in 2019 we harvested the roots of three year old panax notoginseng according to the harvesting period of farmers to measure the content of panax notoginseng saponins root dry matter of panax notoginseng was milled through a mill and then crushed and passed through a 0 5 mm screen for analysis quality of panax notoginseng appropriate amounts of the milled fine powder 6 g accurate to 0 01 g were put into a 50 ml centrifuge tube added 25 ml 70 of methanol sonicated for 40 min and used 70 methanol to make up the loss mass filter filtrate with a microporous membrane 425 µm to prepare a test solution panax notoginseng saponins were determined by hplc method 1260 infinity liquid chromatograph agilent company united states to determine the content mg kg 1 of notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r g1 r e r b1 r d 2 7 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed through the spss statistics 20 0 software all data were showed as the average value of three replicates the significant differences among all treatments were determined by least significant differences and analysis of variance lsd and anova at p 0 05 level origin pro 2021 and the excel 2019 were used to create figures and analyze data respectively a flow chart of the research steps followed in this study is shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng deficit irrigation level d nacl concentration c and cultivation years y had significant p 0 05 effects on root k r shoot k sh and canopy k c hydraulic conductance of 2 year old 2018 and 3 year old 2019 panax notoginseng table 3 under the same nacl concentration compared with the d m treatment d l treatment significantly p 0 05 improved k r by 30 8 88 0 k c by 108 0 157 0 and k sh by 55 0 66 4 in 2018 and 2019 respectively under the same deficit irrigation level compared with c 0 treatment without adding nacl the k r k sh and k c in nacl application treatments c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 showed a same trend of first increasing and then decreasing in 2018 and 2019 the largest k r k sh and k c were obtained in the d l c 1 treatment in 2018 and 2019 compared with the d l c 0 treatment the k r k c and k sh in the d l c 1 treatment enhanced by 68 6 296 3 305 2 499 2 and 146 9 372 2 in 2018 and 2019 respectively under the interaction of deficit irrigation and nacl concentration hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng increased with the increasing of cultivation years y compared with 2 year old 2018 panax notoginseng 3 year old 2019 significantly p 0 05 improved k r by 64 6 but decreased k c by 8 0 and k sh by 39 2 in all treatments on average respectively this result indicated that d l c 1 treatment could improve hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng 3 2 net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance of panax notoginseng significant differences in net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs and intrinsic water use efficiency wuei of panax notoginseng were observed among all treatments in 2018 and 2019 table 4 under the same deficit irrigation level the pn and gs first increased then decreased with increasing nacl concentrations in 2018 and 2019 the wuei initial decreased then increased and decreased with increasing nacl concentrations in 2018 and 2019 except for d m deficit irrigation level in 2018 wuei initial decreased and then increased with increasing nacl concentrations the largest pn gs and wuei were obtained in the c 1 and c 0 treatment under the same nacl concentrations the pn gs and wuei in the d l treatment were larger than those of the d m treatment on the average therefore the largest values of pn gs and wuei were observed in the d l c 1 and d l c 0 treatment in 2018 and 2019 compared with the d l c 0 treatment the pn in d l c 1 treatment increased by 3 5 in 2018 and 6 2 p 0 05 in 2019 the gs in d l c 1 treatment significantly p 0 05 increased by 88 3 in 2018 and 53 1 in 2019 respectively while the wuei in d l c 0 was the optimal in 2018 and 2019 respectively under the deficit irrigation and nacl concentration treatment the pn and wuei of panax notoginseng increased with the increasing of cultivation years y but gs decreased with the increasing of cultivation years y compared with 2 year old 2018 panax notoginseng 3 year old 2019 significantly p 0 05 improved pn and wuei by 32 5 and 50 9 but decreased gs by 13 8 in all treatments on average respectively this indicated that d l c 1 treatment could improve photosynthesis of panax notoginseng but d l c 1 treatment could decrease water use efficiency wuei of panax notoginseng 3 3 root morphological characteristics of panax notoginseng deficit irrigation level d and nacl concentration c treatments had significant p 0 05 effects on root morphological characteristics root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng in 2018 and 2019 table 5 under the d m and d l treatments root morphological characteristics root length surface area average diameter and

2018 panax notoginseng 3 year old 2019 significantly p 0 05 improved surface area by 7 3 average diameter by 6 6 and volume of root by 20 6 in 10 treatments on average respectively this indicated that the root increased with the increasing of planting years and d l c 1 treatment could enhance root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng 3 4 root dry matter of panax notoginseng there were significant p 0 05 differences in taproot dry matter fibrous root dry matter and total root dry matter of panax notoginseng among all treatments in 2018 and 2019 fig 4 under the same nacl concentration taproot dry matter fibrous root dry matter and total root dry matter were larger in the d l treatment than those of the d m treatment in 2018 and 2019 under the d l

treatment could effectively promoted root growth of panax notoginseng 3 5 incidence of root rot yield water use efficiency and economic benefits of panax notoginseng there were significant differences in root rot rate yield and water use efficiency of panax notoginseng among all treatments in 2018 and 2019 fig 5 nacl application treatments c 1 c 2 c 3 and c 4 significantly p 0 05 decreased incidence of root rot compared with the c 0 treatment without adding nacl in 2018 and 2019 this indicated that the application of nacl could decrease incidence of root disease moreover under the same nacl concentrations rate of root rot was lower in the d m treatment than that of the d l treatment in 2018 and 2019 yield and wue of panax notoginseng first increased and then decreased with the increase of nacl concentrations in 2018 and 2019 and the largest wue and yield of panax notoginseng were obtained in the c 1 treatment under the c 1 treatment the yield of panax notoginseng was larger in the d l treatment than that of the d m treatment in 2018 and 2019 but reverse result was found in wue this indicated that the application of nacl could also improve yield and wue of panax notoginseng although the cost increased with increasing nacl concentrations and irrigation amount no significant difference in the cost was observed among all treatments in 2018 and 2019 table 6 there were significant p 0 05 differences in income and economic benefits for nacl application treatments in 2018 and 2019 table 6 under the same deficit irrigation level the income and economic benefits first increased then decreased with increasing nacl concentrations in 2018 and 2019 compared with the c 0 treatment the income and economic benefits were larger in the c 1 treatment than those of the c 0 treatment in 2018 and 2019 p 0 05 the largest income and economic benefits were obtained in the c 1 treatment in 2018 and 2019 this indicated that nacl application could increase economic benefits of farmer deficit irrigation level had no significant difference on income and economic benefits in 2018 but significant differences in income and economic benefits for deficit irrigation treatment were observed in 2019 under the c 1 treatment the income and economic benefits were significantly p 0 05 larger in the d l treatment than that of the d m treatment in 2019 therefore the largest income and economic benefits were obtained in the d l c 1 treatment compared with the d l c 0 treatment the d l c 1 treatment significantly p 0 05 enhanced economic benefits by 5 6 in 2018 and 22 2 in 2019 respectively under the deficit irrigation and nacl concentration treatment the income and economic benefits of panax notoginseng increased with the increasing of cultivation years y compared with 2 year old 2018 panax notoginseng 3 year old 2019 significantly p 0 05 improved income by 44 6 economic benefits by 68 0 in all treatments on average respectively this indicated that the d l c 1 treatment could effectively improve economic benefits of panax notoginseng 3 6 saponin content of panax notoginseng there were significant p 0 05 differences in panax notoginseng saponins pns content for 3 year old panax notoginseng among all treatments table 7 the notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r b1 r e r d and r g1 first increased and then decreased with increasing nacl concentrations and the largest r 1 r b1 r e r d and r g1 were observed in the c 1 treatment under the c 1 treatment notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r b1 r e r d and r g1 contents were larger in the d l treatment than those of the d m treatment therefore the largest notoginsenoside r 1 and ginsenosides r b1 r e r d and r g1 contents were obtained in the d l c 1 treatment compared with the d l c 0 treatment the d l c 1 treatment significantly p 0 05 improved r 1 r b1 r e r d and r g1 by 129 6 78 4 63 4 62 2 and 19 8 respectively under the same nacl concentrations total pns content was larger in the d l treatment than that of the d m treatment and the largest total pns content was observed in the d l c 1 treatment the d l c 1 treatment significantly p 0 05 enhanced total pns content by 61 0 compared with the d l c 0 treatment this indicated that the d l c 1 treatment could improve quality of panax notoginseng 4 discussions 4 1 a promising abiotic stresses strategy deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride disc adaptive abiotic stresses strategy for farming herbs was conductive to improve the accumulation of active substances and sustain agricultural production hayashi and sudo 2009 mária et al 2012 egamberdieva and mamedov 2015 sarker et al 2018 zhao 2018 furlan et al 2020 deficit irrigation and sodium chloride disc application were regarded as water stress and salt stress respectively water stress and salt stress were classified as the popularly adaptive abiotic stress way that could be used as a promising measure to increase yield and quality of crops by decreasing root rot hohjo et al 1999 elmer 2003 van kruistum et al 2005 xia et al 2016 liao et al 2017 in this present study we tried to propose an integrated abiotic stress strategy of disc application based on traditional deficit irrigation water stress we hypothesized that disccould alleviate root rot and improve yield water use efficiency saponin content and economic benefit in the cultivation and production of panax notoginseng our data presented in tables 3 7 supported these hypotheses for example compared with the traditional deficit irrigation treatment disc significantly decreased root rot fig 4 and improved hydraulic conductivity table 3 photosynthetic characteristics table 4 root morphological characteristics table 5 root dry matter fig 3 yield wue fig 4 economic benefits table 6 and saponin content table 7 of panax notoginseng deficit irrigation and sodium chloride stress could contribute to improving the physiology and growth of panax notoginseng in this present study it was noteworthy that hydraulic conductivity photosynthetic characteristics root dry matter of panax notoginseng were larger in the light deficit irrigation d l treatment than that of the moderate deficit irrigation d m treatment tables 3 4 this might be due to the following two reasons on the one hand high water stress d m might inhibit photosynthesis of plant by reducing leaf gas exchange rate thereby reducing dry matter accumulation wang et al 2008a 2008b gong et al 2006 also demonstrated that moderate water deficit could close the stomata of plant leaves resulting in lower net photosynthetic rate and photosynthetic accumulation on the other hand the greater the degree of deficit irrigation the longer the soil continues to dry which will lead to damage of leaf cell structure and stomata to close reduce gas exchange rate thereby inhibiting photosynthesis and dry matter accumulation wang et al 2008a 2008b shahzad 2022 liao et al 2017 also demonstrated that too little soil water content could significantly decrease the photosynthesis characteristics plant growth yield and quality of panax notoginseng moreover it was noteworthy that the hydraulic conductivity photosynthetic characteristics root dry matter yield quality and economic benefits of panax notoginseng first increased and then decreased with increasing sodium chloride concentration and the maximum value of these parameters was obtained in the c 1 treatment in 2018 and 2019 this result implied that appropriate sodium chloride concentration could improve the production of panax notoginseng and the economic benefits of farmers but the reverse result was obtained in the treatment of excessive sodium chloride concentration similar result reported by huang et al 2022 and hohjo et al 1999 indicated that appropriate sodium chloride could promote photosynthesis and growth of plants and improve dry matter accumulation crop yield and quality this was mainly attributed to the fact that excessive nacl application affected the photosynthetic electron transport chain resulting in the release of more reactive oxygen species into plant cells causing photooxidative damage and photoinhibition and reducing leaf photosynthesis which in turn reduces plant growth and dry matter accumulation ricoult et al 2006 huang et al 2022 in this present study the optimal wuei was in d l c 0 the deficit irrigation has no significant effect on wuei but the concentration of sodium chloride had a significant effect moreover the largest wue was in d m c 1 and yield was in d l c 1 this indicated that panax notoginseng plants may not tolerate to drought and salinity but adaptive abiotic stresses strategy disc was beneficial to improve production of panax notoginseng this might attribute to that the positive roles of nacl in the drought resistance the plant accumulated concentrations of na in the leaves and use the na as an osmoregulator to cope with deficit water yue et al 2012 franco navarro et al 2021 found that drought resistance promoted by cl nutrition improved leaf turgor water balance photosynthesis performance wuei and wue during deficit irrigation but wuei for assessing the effects of genes on plants it used to explain the instantaneous physiological state of plants and inability to provide a comprehensive reflection of crop productivity and crop water use efficiency over an extended period of time gago et al 2014 d h wang et al 2010 j l wang et al 2010 compared with wuei the wue and yield are more important therefore the d l c 1 treatment would be a promising abiotic stresses strategy for promoting the production of panax notoginseng and improving the economic benefits of farmers 4 2 effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on root rot of panax notoginseng continuous cropping obstacle was the main factor restricting the production of panax notoginseng especially the root rot problem due to the fact that panax notoginseng was a perennial herb li et al 2021 panax notoginseng root rot occurred when fusarium oxysporum in the soil infected the injured root system dong et al 2016 notably excessive pesticides were generally used by farmers to prevent and control the occurrence of root rot zotarelli et al 2009 which would result in the pesticide residues of panax notoginseng to exceed the standard yang et al 2022 therefore finding a green control measure for root rot was of great significance to the production of panax notoginseng in this present study disc could significantly decrease the incidence of root rot compared with the c 0 treatment without applying sodium chloride fig 4 for example the d l c 1 treatment was effective in decreasing the root rot incidence and improving root morphological characteristics taproot dry matter fibrous root dry matter total root dry matter tables 5 7 this was mainly due to the fact that root rot of panax notoginseng was positively correlated with soil water content xia et al 2016 similar study reported by liao et al 2017 indicated that appropriate water deficit could promote the growth and development of panax notoginseng roots due to the fact that the root of panax notoginseng was sensitive to the change of soil water ricoult et al 2006 demonstrated that excess soil water content could lead to root rot moreover compared with the traditional application of pesticides applying sodium chloride to reduce root rot could not only reduce the cost of pesticides but also produce healthy panax notoginseng without pesticide residues similar studies reported by van kruistum et al 2005 and ester et al 2003 indicated that nacl application could significantly reduce the incidence of root rot and increase asparagus yield hanson and may 2011 this was mainly due to the following three reasons on the one hand the application of nacl to crop roots could inhibit soil fungal infection and improve plant stress resistance thereby reducing the incidence of root rot elmer 2002 on the other hand nacl application could reduce the root rot incidence of plant by directly affecting the internal physiological metabolism of plants or indirectly affecting the resistance of plants to external water and pathogens xu et al 1999 furthermore nacl application could promote root growth of plant wang et al 2009 robin and saha 2015 therefore exploring the relationships between nacl and root growth and fusarium oxysporum were fundamentally needed in revealing underlying mechanisms of alleviating root rot of panax notoginseng however the relationships were not addressed in this study in further researches therefore we should mainly focus on the following several aspects 1 monitoring the vertical and horizontal distributions of panax notoginseng roots with and without sodium chloride treatments during the different panax notoginseng growing stages 2 analyzing the effect of sodium chloride on fusarium oxysporum in soil and 3 quantifying relationships between nacl and root growth and fusarium oxysporum with and without sodium chloride treatments 4 3 effects of deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride on saponin content of panax notoginseng abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity significantly increased the content of four iridoid glycosides and steroid alkaloid solanine in scrophulariaceae and solanum nigrum l d h wang et al 2010 j l wang et al 2010 aftab 2019 deficit irrigation significantly affected the content of the main monomer saponins cao et al 2015 eisenreich et al 2004 rohdich et al 2001 suzuki et al 2002 tansakul et al 2006 in the current study the saponin content of panax notoginseng was larger in the d l treatment than that of the d m treatment in 2018 and 2019 this result implied that light deficit irrigation could improve saponin content of panax notoginseng similar studies also reported that light deficit irrigation could increase glycyrrhizic acid content of licorice root nasrollahi et al 2014 tanshinone content of salvia miltiorrhiza yang et al 2012 and anthocyanin and secondary metabolite content of pomegranate fruit bazargani et al 2011 however excessive water deficit adversely affects plant root yield and accumulation of active substances xia et al 2016 liu et al 2011 demonstrated that high water stress could significantly decrease rosmarinic acid content of salvia furthermore nacl application could modulate the production of secondary metabolites such as saponins one of glucosinolates martínez et al 2013 suggested that leaf water balance under salt stress was maintained by increasing the synthesis of osmoprotective compounds by glucosinolates lópez et al 2008 indicated that the addition of nacl increases the content of glucosinolates in the water balance response of plants to salt stress in this study the r 1 r b1 r e r d and r g1 first increased and then decreased with increasing nacl concentrations and the largest five monomeric saponins were observed in the c 1 treatment this result implied that the application of appropriate nacl concentration could promote plant growth and production or induce synthesis of secondary metabolites espinosa leal et al 2018 wa lwalaba et al 2017 therefore light deficit irrigation and appropriate sodium chloride concentration could improve saponin content of panax notoginseng naik and al khayri 2016 puente garza et al 2017 5 conclusions in conclusion the disc was a promising abiotic stresses strategy to alleviate incidence of root rot and improve yield water use efficiency saponin content of panax notoginseng and economic benefits compared with the traditional deficit irrigation the deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride could improve net photosynthetic rate pn stomatal conductance gs root k r shoot k sh and canopy k c hydraulic conductance of panax notoginseng in this study compared with d l c 0 the d l c 1 treatment deficit irrigation combined with sodium chloride significantly increased root length surface area average diameter and volume of root of panax notoginseng moreover the d l c 1 treatment significantly decrease the incidence of root rot of panax notoginseng and improve rood dry matter yield saponin content of panax notoginseng water use efficiency and economic benefits therefore the combination of deficit irrigation amount d l 70 55 θ fc and nacl concentration c 1 15 mmol l 1 should be recommended as an economical and appropriate agronomic management method for decreasing incidence of root rot and improve yield and saponin content of panax notoginseng and economic benefits of the farmers declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

9241,olive trees olea europaea l in natural environments are increasingly being subjected to abiotic stresses such as water deficit arbuscular mycorrhizal am symbioses can improve olive tolerance to water deficit in the current study to elucidate the role of am fungi in regulating water deficit resistance in olive the effects of am fungi rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 on gas exchange stem water potential phytohormones carbohydrates and individual phenolic compounds were studied in potted culture under well watered and water deficit stressed conditions results showed a negative impact of mycorrhizal fungi on abscisic acid aba and salicylic acid sa contents in roots on the other hand many intermediaries in primary and secondary were among the compounds accumulating more in am leaves mainly sugar alcohols mannitol flavan 3 ols catechin flavones luteolin 7 o glucoside secoiridoid oleuropein these enhancements were higher under water deficit stressed conditions maintaining high phenolic especially oleuropein and sugars especially mannitol levels in mycorrhizal stressed olive plants prevented stem water potential to decline to critical value which did not exceed 2 mpa compared to their relative non mycorrhizal stressed plants 3 8 mpa we showed that colonization of olive roots by rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 significantly reduced the deleterious effect of water deficit stress by up regulating the primary and secondary metabolism and preserving a high stem water potential level keywords arbuscular mycorrhizas hormone phenolic compounds olea europaea water deficit data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction olive tree olea europaea l is a tree with high ecological nutritional and economic values extensively widespread in the mediterranean basin olive oils and fruits are rich in proteins lipids carbohydrates and secondary metabolites guo et al 2018 in addition to the minor compounds present in fruits and olive oils such as sterols tocopherol pigments chlorophyll and carotene squalene and phenols the elevated monounsaturated fatty acids content confer their healthy and nutritional benefits guo et al 2018 among the environmental factors affecting the development and growth of olive tree water defcit could be considered as a major one fernández 2014 olives are recognized with their resistance to water deficit stress when they face high temperatures low availability of water in soil and scarce precipitation especially during summer fernández 2014 olea europaea fight back the detrimental effects of water deficit stress by a sequence of physiological and biochemical mechanisms to avoid desiccation such as regulating root water uptake a procedure involving aquaporins calvo polanco et al 2016 transcription factors regulation calvo polanco et al 2019 and inducing osmotic adjustments and antioxidant activity conde et al 2011 denaxa et al 2020 more recently various phenylpropanoid metabolites such as secoiridoid flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are postulated to contribute to the antioxidant protection in the olive tree against drought conditions mechri et al 2020a b in olive leaves oleuropein is the most predominant secoiridoid and verbascoside is the most abundant compound from the hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives michel et al 2015 flavonoids include the flavones flavan 3 ols and flavonols tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are the most important phenolic alcohols michel et al 2015 organoleptic properties of table olives and olive oils are vigorously influenced with these compounds ghanbari et al 2012 they also play primordial role in the defense against excessive generation of reactive oxygen species agati et al 2012 and it has been proposed that their accumulation was stimulated in olive fruits and leaves under drought stress mechri et al 2020b valente et al 2020 also olive leaves comprise elevated levels of sugars glucose fructose galactose and sucrose and polyols myo inositol and mannitol mechri et al 2020a both sugars and phenolic compounds participate in the protection of olive plant against drought stress and salt conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a some studies suggested that sugars and phenolic compounds protect the plant cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting the production of harmful reactive oxygen species ros like superoxide ions hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl ions and other free radicals shen et al 1997 nakabayashi and saito 2015 the accumulation of metabolic compounds like sugars polyphenols is further modulated by phytohormones like abscisic acid indole acetic acid cytokinins jasmonates and salicylic acid grzegorczyk karolak et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 phytohormones as it has been reported could affect positively or negatively the plant water deficit tolerance ullah et al 2018 verma et al 2016 interaction between individual hormone groups considering a novel group of plant hormones karrikins is enormously important and can participate in plant tolerance to drought stress antala et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 it has been shown that in plants exposed to drought hormone concentration in the cells depends on many factors such as stress severity drought duration and ability of individual species to respond to the water deficit stress sharma et al 2019 verma et al 2016 the need of novel strategies to improve and understand olive trees towards water deficit conditions is a major issue in order to avoid the decline of their performance in the context of climate change predictions of water scarcity in this context associations of olea europaea with soil beneficial microbes like arbuscular mycorrhizal am fungi believed on the resistance of olive plants via the environmental variations which assure to those plants possibilities of adaptation and surviving as an example rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 is a rapid colonizer of roots and produces a high number of spores in a short time period lenoir et al 2016 maillet et al 2011 demonstrated that r irregularis daom 197198 secretes lipochitooligosaccharides symbiotic signals which stimulate am formation in plant species of diverse families the extraradical hyphal exudates of r irregularis daom 197198 have been shown to support phosphate solubilizing bacteria growth and activity taktek et al 2015 the concentrations of mg k and na were positively associated with p concentration in the extraradical hyphae developing in the hyphal compartment of r irregularis daom 197198 zhang et al 2016 therefore am fungi plants generally show better p n mg and k levels it has also been reported that the fungus daom 197198 gets sugars from the olive plant and reciprocally they support the host plant in the procurement of water and mineral nutrients mainly phosphorus potassium calcium iron manganese and zinc tekaya et al 2017 am symbiosis resulted in increased photosynthetic rates transpiration and stomatal conductance a better leaf water potential and improved gas exchange under water deficit stress latef et al 2016 nevertheless the activation of many signals like cytokinins auxine gibberellins jasmonic acid abscisic acid and ethylene could be induced by the am fungus plant association pozo et al 2015 auxin and cytokinins are counted as positive growth regulators and jasmonic acid salicylic acid and abscisic acid are defined as stress hormones kosová et al 2012 it has been reported that these phytohormones are the most important signal substances in modulating physiological responses for drought tolerance in major crop plants chhaya et al 2021 zou et al 2017 support the hypothesis that the adaptation of mycorrhizal plants increase under water deficit stress more than non mycorrhizal ones this is potentially associated with auxine methyl jasmonate nitric oxide and calmodulin levels mycorrhizal phaseolus vulgaris plants had relatively higher auxin and abscisic acid contents than non mycorrhizal under water deficit stress and well watered sánchez romera et al 2016 ouledali et al 2019 proved that the inoculation of olive plants with different am fungal species decreased the abscisic acid content under drought conditions little is known about the response of olea europaea phytohormones to mycorrhization under water deficit stressed conditions therefore the aim of this work was to study the effect of the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 on root and leaf phytohormone levels of olive tree olea europaea l under well watered and water deficit stress conditions we previously showed that the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 is a rapid colonizer of olive plant roots and generates a high number of intraradical structures including vesicules intraradical hyphae and arbuscules mechri et al 2014 2020 phenolic compounds and sugar composition were also measured in m and nm olive leaves to our knowledge this research is the first reporting the hormonal rearrangement in mycorrhizal olive roots and leaves and their potential functions under drought stress condition 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental description a greenhouse experiment was performed to determine the effect of am colonization by r irregularis daom 197198 on physiological performance and root and leaf phytohormone levels in olive trees olea europaea l cv

its moisture content at field capacity and at permanent wilting point of 21 and 10 respectively thus the available water content in the soil was about 11 during re potting 1000 spores of r irregularis daom 197198 were directly placed under the olive plantlets roots mycorrhizal m and non mycorrhizal nm olive trees growth under natural daylight during 9 months under greenhouse conditions in order to maintain the level of moisture in the potted olive plantlets higher than 65 of the soil available water content equivalent to soil moisture of 17 olive plantlets were irrigated every second day we

statistical analyses the analysis of the experimental data was established using 18 0 program spss inc chicago il usa the differences among treatments were established using duncan test and one way analysis of variance a two way anova was applied water stress am symbiosis and interaction between water stress and am symbiosis to confirm whether the effects of water stress and mycorrhizal symbiosis or their interaction had any significant influence on the results all reported data were presented as means standard deviation sd 3 results 3 1 effects of water deficit on am root colonization the roots of non am olive plants were observed before water treatment confirming the absence of mycorrhizae the presence of fungal structures was confirmed in roots of olive plants colonized with r irregularis daom 197198 see mechri et al 2020a fig 1 at the end of the experiment water stress significantly decreased the intensity of mycorrhizal colonization m and the abundance of arbuscules a in the olive tree root system 39 and 50 respectively fig 1 3 2 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on olive physiological performance the net co2 assimilation rate in wwm plants was significantly higher than that of wwnm plants however no significant variations were observed in stem water potential ѱstem and stomatal conductance values of control and am colonized plants maintained in unstressed conditions during the experimental period olive plant growth was also significantly influenced by water stress conditions as evidenced with the reduction in net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance by 45 and 37 respectively wsnm compared to the control wwnm fig 2 unstressed plants maintained stem water potential ѱstem level at 1 3 mpa while it declined in response to water deficit and wsnm plants reached severe ws status about 3 8 mpa fig 2 it was evident from fig 2 that colonization of olive roots by r irregularis maximized the values for the net co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs and stem water potential ѱstem under water deficit conditions in response to am symbiosis we observed increases of 26 a 47 ѱstem and 31 gs when compared with the values obtained with the wsnm olive plants two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly p 0 05 affected net co2 assimilation rate gs and ѱstem exceptions were water deficit stress x am symbiosis interaction for net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance supplementary appendix table s1 3 3 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on sugar composition in olive leaves one of the major pathways affected in mycorrhizal leaves was the metabolism of sugars rhamnose fructose glucose and mannitol were consistently more concentrated in mycorrhizal leaves colonized by r irregularis contrastingly arabinose xylose galactose sucrose xylitol sorbitol and myo inositol did not appear to be significantly influenced by am fungi colonization table 1 the leaf sugar composition of olive plants was also influenced by water stress conditions water deficit stress significantly increased the mannitol sucrose galactose and xylitol concentrations whereas it decreased the glucose rhamnose xylose and fructose content when subjecting olea europaea to water deficit stress colonization of roots by r irregularis significantly increased the contents of arabinose rhamnose xylose glucose sucrose myo inositol and mannitol in leaves table 1 however the levels of fructose galactose xylitol and sorbitol were not significantly affected by mycorrhizal colonization under water stress conditions table 1 two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction enormously p 0 05 influenced arabinose rhamnose xylose fructose galactose glucose sucrose xylitol sorbitol myo inositol and mannitol concentrations particularities were water deficit for rhamnose and sorbitol am symbiosis for xylitol and galactose and water deficit x am symbiosis interaction for xylitol galactose glucose and sorbitol supplementary appendix table s2 3 4 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on phenolic composition in olive leaves it was evident from table 2 that secoiridoid oleuropein flavones especially luteolin 7 o glucoside and apigenin 7 o glucoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives verbascoside were the major identified phenolic compounds in the leaves of wwm and wwnm olive plants mycorrhizal symbiosis did not disturb all the flavonoids in the same way am fungi colonization enormously augmented the concentration of oleuropein catechin and luteolin 7 o glucoside however the levels of luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin and quercetin did not appear to be enormously affected by mycorrhizal symbiosis table 2 the leaf phenolic compounds of olive plants were also influenced by water stress conditions water deficit stress caused a significant increase in the level of oleuropein luteolin 7 o glucoside and apigenin 7 o glucoside by 58 41 and 31 respectively when compared to control in leaves of wsnm olive plants an important augmentation in hydroxytyrosol tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin quercetin pinoresinol and verbascoside was also consistently observed water deficit stressed olive plants inoculated with am fungi caused differential changes in the leaf concentrations of phenolic compounds colonization of olive roots by r irregularis increased the levels of oleuropein verbascoside hydroxytyrosol tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o rutinoside luteolin 7 o glucoside apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin quercetin and pinoresinol under water deficit stress conditions but the increase of tyrosol apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin and pinoresinol was not significant two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly p 0 05 affected hydroxytyrosol tyrosol oleuropein verbascoside pinoresinol and all the identified flavonoid compounds exceptions were am symbiosis for tyrosol apigenin 7 o glucoside pinoresinol and apigenin and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o glucoside luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin 7 o glucoside quercetin apigenin and mannitol oleuropein ratio supplementary appendix table s3 3 5 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on mannitol oleuropein ratio table 1 and table 2 revealed that in the leaves of wsnm and wsm olive plants the major sugar and phenolic compounds were mannitol and oleuropein respectively thus these compounds and their ratios can be used as metabolic stress indicators our results showed that am fungal symbiosis decreased significantly the mannitol oleuropein ratio when compared to the control fig 3 application of water deficit stress revealed shifts in the mannitol oleuropein ratio the mannitol oleuropein ratio in wsnm leaf samples was 28 lower than in wwnm samples demonstrating the enhancement of the biosynthesis of oleuropein under water deficit stressed conditions fig 3 significant water stress and am symbiosis effects p 0 05 were also observed for mannitol oleuropein ratio fig 3 the results exposed in this work showed a significant decrease in the mannitol oleuropein ratio present in the leaves of wsm plants when compared to those of wsnm ones proposing a principal role assisted by r irregularis in the metabolic pathway of oleuropein under water stress 3 6 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on iaa aba sa and ja concentrations in olive leaves and roots quantitative analysis of iaa in olive leaves and roots revealed no significant differences between m and nm plants fig 4 inoculation with am fungi decreased the aba and sa root contents when compared to the wwnm plants while mycorrhizal symbiosis did not alter the aba and sa contents of leaves fig 4 an increase in the ja content was observed in roots of wwm plants by 18 when compared to the wwnm plants while am colonization did not alter the ja content of olive leaves large changes also were observed within the leaf and root hormonal profiles following application of water deficit stress leaves and roots shared a common water deficit induced increasing trend of iaa fig 4 leaf and root aba contents were also influenced by water stress treatment water deficit caused an increase in aba content in leaves and roots of wsnm plants by 80 and 79 respectively compared to wwnm olive plants fig 4 similarly to iaa and aba the sa content was significantly higher in leaves and roots of stressed plants by 36 and 15 respectively than in irrigated control plants fig 4 in leaves of wsnm plants a 18 increase in ja content was observed under water deficit stress condition compared with control on the contrary a decrease of ja content was detected in roots of wsnm olive plants fig 4 water deficit stressed olive plants inoculated with am fungi resulted in differential changes in the endogenous concentrations of leaf and root hormones sa content was remarkably augmented in leaves and roots of wsm plants by 23 and 18 respectively compared to wsnm plants highlighting the important role of mycorrhizal colonization in enhancing sa accumulation under water deficit stress accumulation of iaa also increased considerably in leaves of mycorrhizal stressed olive plants as a consequence of water deficit however quantitative analysis of iaa in roots of olive plants did not expose any considerable differences between m and nm plants under stress conditions fig 4 as revealed by the results exposed in this work the tendency of leaf and root aba concentrations was dissimilar to that of sa and iaa consecutive to a water deficit stress the concentrations of aba decreased meaningfully aba concentrations in leaves and roots of wsm plants were 45 and 36 lower than in leaves and roots of wsnm plants respectively fig 4 similarly to aba ja content was decreased in leaves of wsm plants by 52 when compared to wsnm olive plants however the levels of ja in roots of m and nm olive plants were not meaningfully affected by water deficit stress fig 4 two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly affected iaa aba ja and sa p 0 05 exceptions were water stress for ja am symbiosis for sa and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ip n9 g supplementary appendix table s4 in roots the two factors water stress and am symbiosis and their interaction also significantly affected iaa aba ja and sa and cytokinins p 0 05 exceptions were am symbiosis for iaa and sa and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for iaa aba and ja supplementary appendix table s4 3 7 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on cytokinin concentrations in olive leaves and roots higher total amounts of cytokinins were found in both leaves and roots of wwm when compared to the wwnm plants fig 5a b it is important to note that leaves and roots of m plants contained 37 and 33 higher levels of cytokinins than leaves and roots of nm olive plants fig 4a b uplcms ms analysis revealed that the cytokinin profiles in olive leaves and roots differed markedly trans zr and ip n9 g were the predominant isoprenoid cytokinins detected in leaves of olive plants fig 6a whereas ipa z n7 g dhz n9 g zn 9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g were the main isoprenoid cytokinins detected in roots of olive plants fig 6b in leaves colonization caused a significant increase in the level of trans zr however the level of ip n9 g did not appear to be significantly influenced by mycorrhizal symbiosis fig 6a in roots am colonization did not affect all the isoprenoid cytokinins in the same way the levels of z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g increased significantly in the roots of wwm plants however the levels of ipa and zn 9 g did not appear to be significantly influenced by mycorrhization fig 6b the study demonstrated an important augmentation in the total amounts of cytokinins in both leaves fig 5a and roots fig 5b after application of water stress in leaves ip n9 g level increased in water deficit stressed olive plants by 64 when compared to the control however trans zr which was present in the leaves of wwnm plants was not detected under water stress conditions fig 6a in roots of wsnm plants significantly higher values were detected for z n7 g 61 dhz n9 g 68 zn 9 g 75 ip n7 g 56 and ip n9 g 60 remarkably ipa which was present in the olive roots under irrigated non stressful conditions was not detected under water deficit stress conditions fig 6b this strong hormonal pathway rearrangement in the response mechanisms to water deficit is seemingly relevant for enhanced tolerance to stress the total amounts of isoprenoid cytokinins in both leaves and roots of m plants were also affected by water deficit stress when compared to the nm plants leaves and roots of wsm olive plants accumulated respectively 21 and 22 more cytokinins than in wsnm plants fig 5a b the results presented in this study showed that the interaction between drought and mycorrhiza affected markedly the content of trans zr whereas the trans zr was undetected in the leaves of non mycorrhizal stressed control plants colonization of olive roots by r irregularis resulted in the apparition of trans zr fig 6a it is important to note that leaves of wsm olive plants contained 17 higher levels of ip n9 g than in those of wsnm plants fig 5a application of water deficit stress did not affect the concentrations of z n7 g and ip n7 g in wsm roots when compared to those in wsnm ones however dhz n9 g zn 9 g and ip n9 g contents increased respectively by 18 33 and 37 in roots of water deficit stressed m plants compared to water deficit stressed non am plants showing the importance of r irregularis role in hormonal metabolic reprogramming under drought stress conditions fig 6b it is important to note that water deficit stress affected the biosynthetic pathways of ipa and roots of wsm and wsnm plants did not contain this cytokinin fig 6b two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly affected cytokinins in leaves p 0 05 exceptions were water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ip n9 g supplementary appendix table s4 in roots the two factors water stress and am symbiosis and their interaction also significantly affected cytokinins p 0 05 exceptions were water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ja z n7 g dhz n9 g and ip n7 g supplementary appendix table s4 4 discussion water stress adversely affect olive plant physiology growth and productivity fernández 2014 along evolution olea europaea have evolved mechanisms to flexibly adapt to these harsh environments fernández 2014 one of these approaches is the establishment of mycorrhizal symbiosis mechri et al 2014 this mutualistic symbiosis presents a principal component aiding olive plants to cope with adversative environmental conditions calvo polanco et al 2019 mechri et al 2020a interestingly we showed here for the first time that am fungi colonization enhanced drought resistance in olea europaea by modifying the profiles of sugars phenylpropanoids and hormones in roots and leaves the positive effects of am symbioses on the development and growth of plants under water deficit stress have been exposed in numerous plant species such as apple carob lettuce and tomato huang et al 2020 ruiz lozano et al 2016 we recently showed that am fungi enhanced water deficit resistance in olive by inducing the accumulation of mannitol and oleuropein in roots mechri et al 2020a however in the latter experiment the hormonal profile was not studied we studied here for the first time the effects of the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 on the levels of iaa aba ja sa and isoprenoid cytokinins in olive roots and leaves under well watered and water deficit stressed conditions phenolic and sugar compositions were also assessed in m and nm olive leaves 4 1 r irregularis daom 197198 induced priming and resistance of olive plant defense to water deficit stress the results presented in this study showed that mycorrhizae put roots of the olive plant in a warned state known as priming which allows earlier and enhanced defense responses to water deficit compared to non mycorrhizal plants we previously showed a strong reorganization of the phenylpropanoids sugars and hormonal profile in olive roots as a consequence of am colonization in the absence of stress mechri et al 2020a which apparently pivotal for successful defense against water deficit stress the olive plant response to mycorrhizal colonisation produced a characteristic root hormonal profile while the iaa levels remained unaltered in the roots of m plants compared with nm plants ja z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g increased in contrast significant decreases in the levels of aba and sa were found this metabolic reprogramming apparently reinforces the possibility that am symbiosis induced resistance taken place through priming in the present study we observed that the levels of auxin in roots did not differ significantly between wwnm and wwm olive plants similarly danneberg et al 1993 shaul keinan et al 2002 and torelli et al 2000 did not find that the auxin contents in maize zea mays tabacco nicotiana tabacum and leek allium porrum roots differed according to whether or not they were colonized with a glomus species mohan raj et al 2016 tested in vitro various indole 3 acetic acid and indole 3 butyric acid concentrations with daucus carota inoculated with r irregulare and observed a slight decrease in both spore numbers and root colonization the reason for the lack of appreciable changes in the level of auxin observed in this study could be that this particular hormone does not play a major role during colonization of olive roots by r irregularis we observed an increase in the concentrations of ja in root of am olive plants colonized by r irregularis which apparently important priming stimulus a primed response of ja was observed in am tomato upon caterpillar feeding or mechanical wounding jung et al 2012 the reason for the increased level of ja in am h vulgare has been attributed to the osmotic stress caused by the increased level of sugars transported from the leaves to the roots of am plants hause et al 2007 in this study the increased concentration of sugars in roots of wwm olive plants may be able to induce the genes expression which are responsible for the production of enzymes producing ja miransari et al 2014 ja and its derivatives are believed to play a key role in the root fungal colonization and activation of the plant immune responses adolfsson et al 2017 jung et al 2012 lópez ráez et al 2010 this activation can lead to an induced resistance and increased defensive capacity of systemic parts of the olive plant in response to abiotic and biotic stress jung et al 2012 other findings have reported null or reduced effects on am fungi colonization in plants treated with exogenous ja bedini et al 2018 additionally it has been reported that ja signaling might differentially affect am symbiosis and development by performing different roles in early and late stages of colonization foo et al 2013 we also observed a decline in concentrations of sa in roots of am olive plants this result suggests that sa seems to have a negative effect on am fungi colonization and it is plausible that am symbiosis requires inhibition of certain sa regulated responses in this regard our result corroborates with those of herrera medina et al 2003 who suggested that sa has inhibitory effects on root colonization by g mosseae and g intraradices it is known that sa and ja signalling pathways are antagonist proietti et al 2013 during am fungi colonization induction of plant defense responses occurs potentially through cross talk between sa and ja dependent signaling pathways mauch mani et al 2017 this induced resistance may impact plant responses to drought stress by priming the olive tissues for a more efficient activation of defense mechanisms our results showed that the colonization of olea europaea by am fungi influences the accumulation of aba in olive roots compared to nm ones indeed in the roots of wwm lower aba content was observed when compared to wwnm olive plants suggesting the role of r irregularis in improving the olive plant water balance under non stressful conditions as aba is able to control the activities of guard cells surrounding the stomata miransari et al 2014 additionally aba has been shown to increase the susceptibility of plants to mycorrhizal colonization and contributes to the development of arbuscules and their functionality charpentier et al 2014 martín rodríguez et al 2016 the results presented in this study showed that roots of am olive plants accumulate more cytokinins than nm olive plants in this regard our result corroborate with those of cosme et al 2016 who claimed that the positive effects of am fungi on the cytokinins levels in both leaves and roots might be required to restrict the carbon availability from the plant roots to the am fungi thus averting parasitism increase of fungal carbon demand to the point where it may depress plant growth by fungus cytokinins are also known to promote branching and cell division adolfsson et al 2017 hence the observed increase of z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g may be the factor involved in remodeling the root architecture in wwm plants an elevated concentration of cytokinin in am olive roots may provoke additional biochemical activity in the colonized plants some of which could be related to mineral uptake of roots and olive plant growth and development bedini et al 2018 cortleven et al 2019 4 2 the primed response is not restricted to the olive root system the results presented in this study showed that the primed response is not restricted to the olive root system we found a strong reorganization of the phenolic compound and sugar profiles of olive leaves as a consequence of mycorrhizal symbiosis in the absence of water defcit stress which apparently important priming stimulus our experiment showed that the pools of rhamnose fructose glucose and mannitol were higher in wwm compared with wwnm olive leaves this effect has been previously related to a higher carbon mobilization and requirements in mycorrhizal plants bárzana et al 2015 in addition am olive plants seem to maintain a higher metabolic activity and can be use the soluble sugars in order to form flavonoids especially catechin and luteolin 7 o glucoside and secoiridoids see table 2 a positive correlation between rates of sugars and phenolic metabolism was demonstrated by arnold et al 2004 in our previous study we have demonstrated that am colonization of olea europaea influences the carbon assimilation and allocation and increases the rate of photosynthesis in olive trees tekaya et al 2017 thereby possibly affecting the source sink relations that may influence the primary and secondary metabolism in mycorrhizal olive plants there is experimental evidence of the role of the phenylpropanoids and sugar metabolic pathway in priming of olive plant defenses by mycorrhizas such a suggestion appears to be further corroborated by the spectacular increase of oleuropein and mannitol in mycorrhizal plants under water deficit stress the importance of oleuropein and mannitol in the water deficit stresses reaction of olives was supported by petridis et al 2012 and conde et al 2011 moreover the results presented in this study showed that maintaining high oleuropein and mannitol levels in wsm plants prevented stem water potential ѱstem to decline to critical value which did not exceed 2 mpa compared to their relative wsnm plants 3 8 mpa other compounds with primed pattern after water deficit stress in olive am plants are the flavan 3 ol catechin and the flavone luteolin 7 o glucoside these two compounds were found to accumulate in leaves of wwm plants similarly an elevated concentration of luteolin 7 o glucoside was observed in shoots of mycorrhized salix purpurea aliferis et al 2015 and medicago truncatula adolfsson et al 2017 the flavonoid pathway is known to be involved in several processes associated with plant stress adaptation agati et al 2012 fini et al 2011 a potential contribution of catechin to olive plant protection against water deficit stress is supported by reports of the increased salinity tolerance achieved after exogenous application of catechin to sweet pepper and tomato plants yiu et al 2011 2012 the results obtained in this work revealed that the induction of resistance does not necessarily require moderate accumulation of metabolites our experiments showed that the level of iaa sa and ip n9 g in leaves did not appear to be enormously affected by symbiosis however am colonization of olea europaea boosted the iaa sa and ip n9 g increase during water deficit stress similar results have been reported by aroca et al 2013 who showed amplified accumulation of the aba in mycorrhizal lettuce plants upon salt stress whereas aba concentrations may be unaltered or even lower in mycorrhizal plants under favorable conditions in our recent previous study we have observed that under non stress conditions mannitol concentration may be unaltered in mycorrhizal olive root plants however under water stress the increase in mannitol content is higher in m compared with nm plants and is likely to lead to primed stress responses mechri et al 2020a under non stress conditions total isoprenoid cytokinins content were found at meaningfully elevated concentrations in wwm leaves than in the non am olive plants the obtained results are in agree with those of numerous earlier investigations chanclud and morel 2016 danneberg et al 1993 martínez medina et al 2011 noting that the elevated level of cytokinin in olive leaves of m plants could be related to translocation from the olive roots the hormone synthesis could be provoked by the colonization of roots by r irregularis rather than to de novo synthesis in the leaves shaul keinan et al 2002 most importantly while the iaa aba ja sa and ip n9 g levels persisted unchanged in the leaves of wwm plants when comparing with wwnm plants trans zr increased differences in zr compounds between m and nm plants have been earlier described by drüge and schonbeck 1993 shaul keinan et al 2002 and adolfsson et al 2017 it has been reported that trans zeatin protects arabidopsis plant against photoperiod stress frank et al 2020 an elevated level of cytokinin in the leaves may elicit additional biochemical activity in mycorrhizal olive plants some of which could be due to plant development growth and acclimation to drought stress ullah et al 2018 4 3 r irregularis daom 197198 enhanced water deficit resistance in olea europaea experimental data did not show a general increase in am colonization under such conditions but mycorrhizal olive plants perform better under water deficit stress mechri et al 2020a previous investigations have shown that the main stages of the am fungi development cycle sporulation germination and colonization could be hampered by the presence of water deficit stress fouad et al 2014 lenoir et al 2016 we suggested that interactions with mycorrhiza at the root level lead to an increased defensive capacity of olive roots and the aerial parts the results presented in this study show that stimuli stemming from am symbiosis are perceived by the olive plant leading to a slight induction of various compounds in roots fructose galactose arabinose rhamnose sucrose myo inositol sorbitol xylitol hydroxytyrosol tyrosol some flavonoids oleuropein verbascoside see mechri et al 2020a ja zeatin n7 glucoside dihydrozeatin n9 glucoside n6 isopentenyladenine n7 glucoside and n6 isopentenyladenine n9 glucoside and leaves rhamnose fructose glucose mannitol catechin luteolin 7 o glucoside oleuropein and trans zr these compounds are referred to as the priming fingerprint and a subset of these metabolic compounds may be common to several stimuli mauch mani et al 2017 we suggested that this metabolism reprograming is responsible for the increasing mycorrhizal olive tolerance to water deficit stress importantly am fungi colonization are able to mount a more robust defense against water deficit stress by inducing spectacular increase of mannitol and oleuropein in olive roots see mechri et al 2020a and leaves these two compounds have been strongly implicated in olive plant defense against drought salt and cold tolerance conde et al 2011 eggleston and legendre 2003 mechri et al 2020a ortega garcía and peragón 2009 increased a has been considered as a plant strategy for water deficit stress tolerance ruiz lozano et al 1995 similarly changes in gs has been reported to be mechanisms by which mycorrhizal colonization increase water deficit resistance ruiz lozano et al 1995 maintaining a high gs allows the plant a higher co2 photosynthesis uptake sheng et al 2008 the results obtained in this study from a and gs measurements showed that mycorrhizal olive plants maintained a higher levels of a than nm stressed plants concomitantly with higher gs and ѱstem the higher values of a in wsm plants compared to wsnm plants indicate that the photosynthetic apparatus of these plants was less damaged by the water deficit stress imposed this suggests that the benefit of colonization of olive roots by r irregularis goes beyond the simple water supply indeed ruiz lozano et al 2016 under water stress conditions observed that the am fungus r irregularis enhanced the photosynthetic efficiency the positive impact of am fungi colonization by r irregularis in improving water deficit tolerance was further supported by the net photosynthetic rate value obtained in the work of chitarra et al 2016 he et al 2017 indicated that am colonization by r irregularis can enhance a and reactive oxygen species scavenging capabilities and increase relative water content of leaves and roots to alleviate deficit stress in black locust robinia pseudoacacia l colonization of roots by r irregularis provoked a better accumulation of carbon metabolites in olive leaves such as arabinose rhamnose xylose glucose sucrose and consequently bigger tolerance to water deficit olive stress increased sugar levels in leaves of wsm plants can help to the conservation of sufficient carbon pool necessary for numerous significant pathways such as hormone and secondary metabolites o hara et al 2013 demonstrated that increased synthesis of sugar levels can generate an amelioration of signalling events mediated by phytohormones and kinases in the developmental events regulation in plants exposed to stress conditions therefore we suggest that am fungi colonization offer a holistic integration of stress tolerance strategies to support continued olive growth under water deficit stress conditions under water deficit stress olive plants colonized by r irregularis daom 197198 exhibited improved accumulation of iaa in their leaves mycorrhization therefore increased the flux into the pathway of auxin biosynthesis under water deficit stress this result suggests that iaa variation induced by am fungi colonization is an important mechanism involved in water deficit tolerance it has been reported that auxins positively modulate the reactive oxygen species ros metabolism aba responsive genes and metabolic homeostasis to enhance drought stress resistance phenotype chhaya et al 2021 shi et al 2014 as krasensky and jonak 2012 reviewed higher levels of some carbohydrates especially sugar alcohols and multiple sugars resulted by higher endogenous iaa level have a beneficial effect in response to water deficit stress we suggested that the adjustment of sugars and hormonal metabolic mechanisms in am olive plant might play some roles in auxin mediated water deficit stress resistance at least partly the plant hormone aba is considered as the stress hormone as it can regulate plant survival and development under drought stress conditions lim et al 2015 a role for aba in the mechanisms by which am fungi colonization affects stomata conductance under water stress was proposed by ruiz lozano et al 2016 in this study under water stress stress condition wsm olive plants exhibited significant lower level of aba in roots when comparing to non am plants in agreement with what was reported for solanum lycopersicum chitarra et al 2016 and knautia arvensis doubková et al 2013 an analogous situation was detected in the leaves where aba was decreased by 45 in water deficit stressed nm plants compared to am olive plants our results agree with previous reports showing that under water deficit stress the concentration of aba is lower in leaves of mycorrhizal than non mycorrhizal plants chitarra et al 2016 ouledali et al 2019 it has been proposed that non am plants probably faced more intense water deficit stress than am plants and accumulate produce more aba chitarra et al 2016 additionally aba has been reported to regulate am fungal colonization and participates to the arbuscules growth and functionality charpentier et al 2014 martín rodríguez et al 2016 as shown in our study a higher content of sa in am olive plants throughout water deficit stress with respect to control plants could recommend a better resistance of mycorrhizal plants to water deficit stress indeed plant phenolic compounds especially the secoiridoid oleuropein and osmolytes especially the polyol mannitol are the most abundant and important group of defensive compounds that mediate olive plant defense under drought stress conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a b as described that sa regulates biosynthesis of osmolytes li et al 2017 and induces accumulation of metabolites belonging to different structural classes including phenolics alkaloids terpenoids and others faried et al 2017 ullah et al 2018 interestingly higher induction of phenolic content was observed in plants treated with sa war et al 2011 possibly am fungi colonization generated a physiological water deficit for olive plants that lead to an activation of the enzymes of sa biosynthesis and suppression of those of its degradation and consequently might have resulted in the accumulation of higher level of mannitol and phenolic compounds in water deficit colonized olive plants water deficit stress provoked a diminution in leaf ja content in am plants whereas that in roots still unchanged when compared to the control several researchers found a stabilization in root ja contents after am fungi root colonization as was found here under water deficit conditions lópez ráez et al 2010 sánchez romera et al 2016 the lower level of ja in leaves of wsm when compared to the wsnm plants could be due to the long distance transport to distal olive tissues adolfsson et al 2017 these results suggested that a significant proportion of ja may be used 1 to adjust olive plant interactions with r irregularis under water deficit stress conditions it has been reported that ja play an important role in the am symbiosis lópez ráez et al 2010 2 to redistribute the nutrients in m roots and augment the olive root sink capacity resulting in the enhanced production of sugars in the leaves and their transfer to the roots hause et al 2007 the higher levels of mannitol and sucrose observed in wsm leaves when compared to the wsnm plants support this hypothesis it is recognized that the sugar alcohols mannitol and the disaccharide sucrose are the major phloem translocated carbohydrates in olive trees conde et al 2011 and 3 regulate the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in both olive leaves and roots adolfsson et al 2017 observed a decrease in ja level in leaves of am medicago truncatula accompanied by an improvement of luteolin glucoside and proanthodelphinidin it has been reported that the regulation of ja and sa in am symbiosis confers their potential role in the amelioration of plant performance under stress conditions via improvement in the synthesis of secondary metabolites hashem et al 2018 according to this experimental evidence colonization of olive roots by r irregularis and water deficit stress have both provoke the cytokinin molecules accumulation in roots and leaves cytokinins elevation is mainly accomplished by the overexpression of an isopentenyl transferase gene ameliorating root growth and increasing the antioxidant system activity and hence enhances drought tolerance xu et al 2016 through drought stress havlová et al 2008 observed in root tissues a significant accumulation of cytokinins as a consequent to a diminution in the activity of cytokinin oxidase dehydrogenase the drought stress inducible overexpression of isopentenyl transferase which is a key enzyme in isoprenoid cytokinins biosynthesis within plants peleg et al 2011 or the diminished cytokinins degradation by the decrease in the activity of cytokinin oxidase dehydrogenase havlová et al 2008 have been mostly accomplished by accumulation of protective compounds which ultimately leads to increased drought tolerance in plants chhaya et al 2021 we suggested that am fungi affect phenolic compound metabolism and consequently water deficit stress resistance in olea europaea via modification of cytokinin concentration a number of studies have reported that the concentration and the type of cytokinin could influence secondary metabolome accumulation in in vitro plant cultures for example tdz thidiazuron at a concentration of 1 µm enhanced the content of luteolin luteolin 7 o glucoside and verbascoside in scutellaria altissima shoot culture grzegorczyk karolak et al 2017 dević et al 2006 observed that bap 6 benzylaminopurine at a concentration of 4 mm increased the content of secoiridoids in gentiana asclepiadea shoot culture bap also increased the isoflavone glucoside in genista tinctoria shoot culture while kinetin at a concentration of 0 5 mm enhanced the content of isoflavonoid aglycones luczkiewicz et al 2014 in the current study the reduced levels of aba and ja and the increased levels of iaa sa and cytokinin in leaves of wsm olive plants may be considered key determinants of olive water deficit stress tolerance we suggested that this hormonal profile contribute to the acquired olive resistance by increasing the metabolic pathways for the synthesis of molecules like oleuropein verbascoside apigenin 7 o glucoside and mannitol it has been reported that these molecules have major roles in the regulation of plant growth subjected to water deficit stress conditions falahi et al 2018 hojati et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a b thus modulation of endogenous plant hormones under am symbiosis appears to be a promising approach for protecting olive plants against the adverse impact of water deficit stress 4 4 r irregularis mediated alleviation of olive plant water deficit stress as indicated by mannitol oleuropein ratio consistent with our hypothesis both the intensity of olive plant stress responses to a lower water supply and the positive role of am fungi symbiosis in plant water deficit stress tolerance were clearly indicated by the olea europaea tissue concentration of mannitol and oleuropein specifically mannitol and oleuropein concentrations increased in response to colonization of olive roots by r irregularis and diminishing water supply thus variation of mannitol oleuropein status in the olea europaea may be considered as an important priming stimulus in this study r irregularis appears to have up regulated the activity of specific pathways involved in the sysnthesis of sugars and phenolic compounds the accumulation of oleuropein and mannitol may protect the olive plant proteins nucleic acids lipids pigments and membranes against denaturation caused by the excess levels of reactive oxygen species das and roychoudhury 2014 lee et al 2009 shen et al 1997 a number of studies have shown that mannitol and oleuropein have great potential to inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species ros that may result from drought petridis et al 2012 shen et al 1997 we suggest that the increased antioxidant defense system in am fungi inoculated olive plants helps to maintain ros levels that do not cause protein and membrane denaturation but rather function in integrating various developmental processes these systems include the interaction of sugar phenolic compounds and several phytohormones that regulate the pathways for maintaining an optimal concentration of ros the results presented in this study showed that the leaves of am plants has lower levels of mannitol oleuropein ratio under stress conditions a similar situation was observed in the roots where the mannitol oleuropein ratio decreased significantly in wsm roots when compared to the wsnm plants mechri et al 2020a these results suggest that am symbiosis 1 stimulate the synthesis of oleuropein which can increase olive plant tolerance to water deficit stress accumulation of oleuropein in olive leaves has been observed in many olea europaea cultivars subjected to various abiotic stresses mechri et al 2020a b ortega garcía and peragón 2009 petridis et al 2012 and 2 enhance the accumulation of oleuropein potentially beneficial to human health in olive plant tissues oleuropein has been reported as a well established antithrombotic and anti atherogenic antiviral hepatoprotective antioxidant antimicrobial and potential anti cancer activities asgharzade et al 2020 barbaro et al 2014 castejón et al 2017 the importance of oleuropein and mannitol in the water deficit stress reaction of olea europaea has been extensively reported conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2019 mechri et al 2020a b petridis et al 2012 but why am fungi increased the flux into the accumulation of oleuropein in olive roots mechri et al 2020a and leaves rather than the accumulation of mannitol in the response mechanisms to water deficit stress remains an open question 5 conclusion in conclusion we showed that colonization of olive roots by r irregularis daom 197198 decreases the negative impacts of water deficit stress in olive plants by varying the phenylpropanoid sugars and hormonal profiles that may underlie their ameliorated tolerance to water deficit stress the obtained results confirm the protective role of am symbiosis toward olive plants under water deficit stress conditions and their potential application as a sustainable approach in agriculture the integration of hormone in olive plant responses against water related stresses as well as their interaction with sugars and phenolic compounds is also demonstrated in this work displaying a dissimilar behavior depending on the presence or absence of am fungi colonization however further research is required to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms of this hormone polyphenols sugars crosstalk and how it is modulated by am fungi symbiosis declaration of competing interest the

9241,olive trees olea europaea l in natural environments are increasingly being subjected to abiotic stresses such as water deficit arbuscular mycorrhizal am symbioses can improve olive tolerance to water deficit in the current study to elucidate the role of am fungi in regulating water deficit resistance in olive the effects of am fungi rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 on gas exchange stem water potential phytohormones carbohydrates and individual phenolic compounds were studied in potted culture under well watered and water deficit stressed conditions results showed a negative impact of mycorrhizal fungi on abscisic acid aba and salicylic acid sa contents in roots on the other hand many intermediaries in primary and secondary were among the compounds accumulating more in am leaves mainly sugar alcohols mannitol flavan 3 ols catechin flavones luteolin 7 o glucoside secoiridoid oleuropein these enhancements were higher under water deficit stressed conditions maintaining high phenolic especially oleuropein and sugars especially mannitol levels in mycorrhizal stressed olive plants prevented stem water potential to decline to critical value which did not exceed 2 mpa compared to their relative non mycorrhizal stressed plants 3 8 mpa we showed that colonization of olive roots by rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 significantly reduced the deleterious effect of water deficit stress by up regulating the primary and secondary metabolism and preserving a high stem water potential level keywords arbuscular mycorrhizas hormone phenolic compounds olea europaea water deficit data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction olive tree olea europaea l is a tree with high ecological nutritional and economic values extensively widespread in the mediterranean basin olive oils and fruits are rich in proteins lipids carbohydrates and secondary metabolites guo et al 2018 in addition to the minor compounds present in fruits and olive oils such as sterols tocopherol pigments chlorophyll and carotene squalene and phenols the elevated monounsaturated fatty acids content confer their healthy and nutritional benefits guo et al 2018 among the environmental factors affecting the development and growth of olive tree water defcit could be considered as a major one fernández 2014 olives are recognized with their resistance to water deficit stress when they face high temperatures low availability of water in soil and scarce precipitation especially during summer fernández 2014 olea europaea fight back the detrimental effects of water deficit stress by a sequence of physiological and biochemical mechanisms to avoid desiccation such as regulating root water uptake a procedure involving aquaporins calvo polanco et al 2016 transcription factors regulation calvo polanco et al 2019 and inducing osmotic adjustments and antioxidant activity conde et al 2011 denaxa et al 2020 more recently various phenylpropanoid metabolites such as secoiridoid flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives are postulated to contribute to the antioxidant protection in the olive tree against drought conditions mechri et al 2020a b in olive leaves oleuropein is the most predominant secoiridoid and verbascoside is the most abundant compound from the hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives michel et al 2015 flavonoids include the flavones flavan 3 ols and flavonols tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol are the most important phenolic alcohols michel et al 2015 organoleptic properties of table olives and olive oils are vigorously influenced with these compounds ghanbari et al 2012 they also play primordial role in the defense against excessive generation of reactive oxygen species agati et al 2012 and it has been proposed that their accumulation was stimulated in olive fruits and leaves under drought stress mechri et al 2020b valente et al 2020 also olive leaves comprise elevated levels of sugars glucose fructose galactose and sucrose and polyols myo inositol and mannitol mechri et al 2020a both sugars and phenolic compounds participate in the protection of olive plant against drought stress and salt conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a some studies suggested that sugars and phenolic compounds protect the plant cells from oxidative stress by inhibiting the production of harmful reactive oxygen species ros like superoxide ions hydrogen peroxide hydroxyl ions and other free radicals shen et al 1997 nakabayashi and saito 2015 the accumulation of metabolic compounds like sugars polyphenols is further modulated by phytohormones like abscisic acid indole acetic acid cytokinins jasmonates and salicylic acid grzegorczyk karolak et al 2017 sharma et al 2019 phytohormones as it has been reported could affect positively or negatively the plant water deficit tolerance ullah et al 2018 verma et al 2016 interaction between individual hormone groups considering a novel group of plant hormones karrikins is enormously important and can participate in plant tolerance to drought stress antala et al 2020 sharma et al 2019 it has been shown that in plants exposed to drought hormone concentration in the cells depends on many factors such as stress severity drought duration and ability of individual species to respond to the water deficit stress sharma et al 2019 verma et al 2016 the need of novel strategies to improve and understand olive trees towards water deficit conditions is a major issue in order to avoid the decline of their performance in the context of climate change predictions of water scarcity in this context associations of olea europaea with soil beneficial microbes like arbuscular mycorrhizal am fungi believed on the resistance of olive plants via the environmental variations which assure to those plants possibilities of adaptation and surviving as an example rhizophagus irregularis daom 197198 is a rapid colonizer of roots and produces a high number of spores in a short time period lenoir et al 2016 maillet et al 2011 demonstrated that r irregularis daom 197198 secretes lipochitooligosaccharides symbiotic signals which stimulate am formation in plant species of diverse families the extraradical hyphal exudates of r irregularis daom 197198 have been shown to support phosphate solubilizing bacteria growth and activity taktek et al 2015 the concentrations of mg k and na were positively associated with p concentration in the extraradical hyphae developing in the hyphal compartment of r irregularis daom 197198 zhang et al 2016 therefore am fungi plants generally show better p n mg and k levels it has also been reported that the fungus daom 197198 gets sugars from the olive plant and reciprocally they support the host plant in the procurement of water and mineral nutrients mainly phosphorus potassium calcium iron manganese and zinc tekaya et al 2017 am symbiosis resulted in increased photosynthetic rates transpiration and stomatal conductance a better leaf water potential and improved gas exchange under water deficit stress latef et al 2016 nevertheless the activation of many signals like cytokinins auxine gibberellins jasmonic acid abscisic acid and ethylene could be induced by the am fungus plant association pozo et al 2015 auxin and cytokinins are counted as positive growth regulators and jasmonic acid salicylic acid and abscisic acid are defined as stress hormones kosová et al 2012 it has been reported that these phytohormones are the most important signal substances in modulating physiological responses for drought tolerance in major crop plants chhaya et al 2021 zou et al 2017 support the hypothesis that the adaptation of mycorrhizal plants increase under water deficit stress more than non mycorrhizal ones this is potentially associated with auxine methyl jasmonate nitric oxide and calmodulin levels mycorrhizal phaseolus vulgaris plants had relatively higher auxin and abscisic acid contents than non mycorrhizal under water deficit stress and well watered sánchez romera et al 2016 ouledali et al 2019 proved that the inoculation of olive plants with different am fungal species decreased the abscisic acid content under drought conditions little is known about the response of olea europaea phytohormones to mycorrhization under water deficit stressed conditions therefore the aim of this work was to study the effect of the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 on root and leaf phytohormone levels of olive tree olea europaea l under well watered and water deficit stress conditions we previously showed that the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 is a rapid colonizer of olive plant roots and generates a high number of intraradical structures including vesicules intraradical hyphae and arbuscules mechri et al 2014 2020 phenolic compounds and sugar composition were also measured in m and nm olive leaves to our knowledge this research is the first reporting the hormonal rearrangement in mycorrhizal olive roots and leaves and their potential functions under drought stress condition 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and experimental description a greenhouse

its moisture content at field capacity and at permanent wilting point of 21 and 10 respectively thus the available water content in the soil was about 11 during re potting 1000 spores of r irregularis daom 197198 were directly placed under the olive plantlets roots mycorrhizal m and non mycorrhizal nm olive trees growth under natural daylight during 9 months under greenhouse conditions in order to maintain the level of moisture in the potted olive plantlets higher than 65 of the soil available water content equivalent to soil moisture of 17 olive plantlets were irrigated every second day we used for irrigation a tape water marked by a salinity 1 2 g l 1 ph 7 8 k 5 6 mg l 1 and ca 103 mg l 1 nine months after planting three mycorrhizal and three non mycorrhizal olive trees were harvested and subjected to microscopic observations and evaluation of mycorrhizal were assessed to verify that mycorrhizal symbiosis has been well established in our experiments four treatments were proposed by crossing two water conditions well watered ww and water stress ws with 2 am fungi inoculations mycorrhizal m and non mycorrhizal nm the four treatments were i well watered olive plants without am

technologies inc at the end of experiment olive plants were harvested and leave and root samples were collected from each treatment 2 2 mycorrhizal colonization measurement mycorrhizal colonization was assessed on fresh olive root subsamples from wwm and wwnm before water treatment to verify that mycorrhizal symbiosis has been well established mycorrhizal colonization was also evaluated from wwm wwnm wsm and wsnm plants at the end of the experiment olive roots were carefully water washed cut into 1 cm olive root pieces digested with koh 10 and stained with trypan blue 0 05 phillips and hayman

statistical analyses the analysis of the experimental data was established using 18 0 program spss inc chicago il usa the differences among treatments were established using duncan test and one way analysis of variance a two way anova was applied water stress am symbiosis and interaction between water stress and am symbiosis to confirm whether the effects of water stress and mycorrhizal symbiosis or their interaction had any significant influence on the results all reported data were presented as means standard deviation sd 3 results 3 1 effects of water deficit on am root colonization the roots of non am olive plants were observed before water treatment confirming the absence of mycorrhizae the presence of fungal structures was confirmed in roots of olive plants colonized with r irregularis daom 197198 see mechri et al 2020a fig 1 at the end of the experiment water stress significantly decreased the intensity of mycorrhizal colonization m and the abundance of arbuscules a in the olive tree root system 39 and 50 respectively fig 1 3 2 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on olive physiological performance the net co2 assimilation rate in wwm plants was significantly higher than that of wwnm plants however no significant variations were observed in stem water potential ѱstem and stomatal conductance values of control and am colonized plants maintained in unstressed conditions during the experimental period olive plant growth was also significantly influenced by water stress conditions as evidenced with the reduction in net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance by 45 and 37 respectively wsnm compared to the control wwnm fig 2 unstressed plants maintained stem water potential ѱstem level at 1 3 mpa while it declined in response to water deficit and wsnm plants reached severe ws status about 3 8 mpa fig 2 it was evident from fig 2 that colonization of olive roots by r irregularis maximized the values for the net co2 assimilation rate a stomatal conductance gs and stem water potential ѱstem under water deficit conditions in response to am symbiosis we observed increases of 26 a 47 ѱstem and 31 gs when compared with the values obtained with the wsnm olive plants two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly p 0 05 affected net co2 assimilation rate gs and ѱstem exceptions were water deficit stress x am symbiosis interaction for net co2 assimilation rate and stomatal conductance supplementary appendix table s1 3 3 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on sugar composition in olive leaves one of the major pathways affected in mycorrhizal leaves was the metabolism of sugars rhamnose fructose glucose and mannitol were consistently more concentrated in mycorrhizal leaves colonized by r irregularis contrastingly arabinose xylose galactose sucrose xylitol sorbitol and myo inositol did not appear to be significantly influenced by am fungi colonization table 1 the leaf sugar composition of olive plants was also influenced by water stress conditions water deficit stress significantly increased the mannitol sucrose galactose and xylitol concentrations whereas it decreased the glucose rhamnose xylose and fructose content when subjecting olea europaea to water deficit stress colonization of roots by r irregularis significantly increased the contents of arabinose rhamnose xylose glucose sucrose myo inositol and mannitol in leaves table 1 however the levels of fructose galactose xylitol and sorbitol were not significantly affected by mycorrhizal colonization under water stress conditions table 1 two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction enormously p 0 05 influenced arabinose rhamnose xylose fructose galactose glucose sucrose xylitol sorbitol myo inositol and mannitol concentrations particularities were water deficit for rhamnose and sorbitol am symbiosis for xylitol and galactose and water deficit x am symbiosis interaction for xylitol galactose glucose and sorbitol supplementary appendix table s2 3 4 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on phenolic composition in olive leaves it was evident from table 2 that secoiridoid oleuropein flavones especially luteolin 7 o glucoside and apigenin 7 o glucoside and hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives verbascoside were the major identified phenolic compounds in the leaves of wwm and wwnm olive plants mycorrhizal symbiosis did not disturb all the flavonoids in the same way am fungi colonization enormously augmented the concentration of oleuropein catechin and luteolin 7 o glucoside however the levels of luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin and quercetin did not appear to be enormously affected by mycorrhizal symbiosis table 2 the leaf phenolic compounds of olive plants were also influenced by water stress conditions water deficit stress caused a significant increase in the level of oleuropein luteolin 7 o glucoside and apigenin 7 o glucoside by 58 41 and 31 respectively when compared to control in leaves of wsnm olive plants an important augmentation in hydroxytyrosol tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin quercetin pinoresinol and verbascoside was also consistently observed water deficit stressed olive plants inoculated with am fungi caused differential changes in the leaf concentrations of phenolic compounds colonization of olive roots by r irregularis increased the levels of oleuropein verbascoside hydroxytyrosol tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o rutinoside luteolin 7 o glucoside apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin quercetin and pinoresinol under water deficit stress conditions but the increase of tyrosol apigenin 7 o glucoside apigenin and pinoresinol was not significant two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly p 0 05 affected hydroxytyrosol tyrosol oleuropein verbascoside pinoresinol and all the identified flavonoid compounds exceptions were am symbiosis for tyrosol apigenin 7 o glucoside pinoresinol and apigenin and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for tyrosol catechin luteolin 7 o glucoside luteolin 7 o rutinoside apigenin 7 o glucoside quercetin apigenin and mannitol oleuropein ratio supplementary appendix table s3 3 5 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on mannitol oleuropein ratio table 1 and table 2 revealed that in the leaves of wsnm and wsm olive plants the major sugar and phenolic compounds were mannitol and oleuropein respectively thus these compounds and their ratios can be used as metabolic stress indicators our results showed that am fungal symbiosis decreased significantly the mannitol oleuropein ratio when compared to the control fig 3 application of water deficit stress revealed shifts in the mannitol oleuropein ratio the mannitol oleuropein ratio in wsnm leaf samples was 28 lower than in wwnm samples demonstrating the enhancement of the biosynthesis of oleuropein under water deficit stressed conditions fig 3 significant water stress and am symbiosis effects p 0 05 were also observed for mannitol oleuropein ratio fig 3 the results exposed in this work showed a significant decrease in the mannitol oleuropein ratio present in the leaves of wsm plants when compared to those of wsnm ones proposing a principal role assisted by r irregularis in the metabolic pathway of oleuropein under water stress 3 6 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on iaa aba sa and ja concentrations in olive leaves and roots quantitative analysis of iaa in olive leaves and roots revealed no significant differences between m and nm plants fig 4 inoculation with am fungi decreased the aba and sa root contents when compared to the wwnm plants while mycorrhizal symbiosis did not alter the aba and sa contents of leaves fig 4 an increase in the ja content was observed in roots of wwm plants by 18 when compared to the wwnm plants while am colonization did not alter the ja content of olive leaves large changes also were observed within the leaf and root hormonal profiles following application of water deficit stress leaves and roots shared a common water deficit induced increasing trend of iaa fig 4 leaf and root aba contents were also influenced by water stress treatment water deficit caused an increase in aba content in leaves and roots of wsnm plants by 80 and 79 respectively compared to wwnm olive plants fig 4 similarly to iaa and aba the sa content was significantly higher in leaves and roots of stressed plants by 36 and 15 respectively than in irrigated control plants fig 4 in leaves of wsnm plants a 18 increase in ja content was observed under water deficit stress condition compared with control on the contrary a decrease of ja content was detected in roots of wsnm olive plants fig 4 water deficit stressed olive plants inoculated with am fungi resulted in differential changes in the endogenous concentrations of leaf and root hormones sa content was remarkably augmented in leaves and roots of wsm plants by 23 and 18 respectively compared to wsnm plants highlighting the important role of mycorrhizal colonization in enhancing sa accumulation under water deficit stress accumulation of iaa also increased considerably in leaves of mycorrhizal stressed olive plants as a consequence of water deficit however quantitative analysis of iaa in roots of olive plants did not expose any considerable differences between m and nm plants under stress conditions fig 4 as revealed by the results exposed in this work the tendency of leaf and root aba concentrations was dissimilar to that of sa and iaa consecutive to a water deficit stress the concentrations of aba decreased meaningfully aba concentrations in leaves and roots of wsm plants were 45 and 36 lower than in leaves and roots of wsnm plants respectively fig 4 similarly to aba ja content was decreased in leaves of wsm plants by 52 when compared to wsnm olive plants however the levels of ja in roots of m and nm olive plants were not meaningfully affected by water deficit stress fig 4 two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly affected iaa aba ja and sa p 0 05 exceptions were water stress for ja am symbiosis for sa and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ip n9 g supplementary appendix table s4 in roots the two factors water stress and am symbiosis and their interaction also significantly affected iaa aba ja and sa and cytokinins p 0 05 exceptions were am symbiosis for iaa and sa and water stress x am symbiosis interaction for iaa aba and ja supplementary appendix table s4 3 7 effects of am fungi colonization and water deficit on cytokinin concentrations in olive leaves and roots higher total amounts of cytokinins were found in both leaves and roots of wwm when compared to the wwnm plants fig 5a b it is important to note that leaves and roots of m plants contained 37 and 33 higher levels of cytokinins than leaves and roots of nm olive plants fig 4a b uplcms ms analysis revealed that the cytokinin profiles in olive leaves and roots differed markedly trans zr and ip n9 g were the predominant isoprenoid cytokinins detected in leaves of olive plants fig 6a whereas ipa z n7 g dhz n9 g zn 9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g were the main isoprenoid cytokinins detected in roots of olive plants fig 6b in leaves colonization caused a significant increase in the level of trans zr however the level of ip n9 g did not appear to be significantly influenced by mycorrhizal symbiosis fig 6a in roots am colonization did not affect all the isoprenoid cytokinins in the same way the levels of z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g increased significantly in the roots of wwm plants however the levels of ipa and zn 9 g did not appear to be significantly influenced by mycorrhization fig 6b the study demonstrated an important augmentation in the total amounts of cytokinins in both leaves fig 5a and roots fig 5b after application of water stress in leaves ip n9 g level increased in water deficit stressed olive plants by 64 when compared to the control however trans zr which was present in the leaves of wwnm plants was not detected under water stress conditions fig 6a in roots of wsnm plants significantly higher values were detected for z n7 g 61 dhz n9 g 68 zn 9 g 75 ip n7 g 56 and ip n9 g 60 remarkably ipa which was present in the olive roots under irrigated non stressful conditions was not detected under water deficit stress conditions fig 6b this strong hormonal pathway rearrangement in the response mechanisms to water deficit is seemingly relevant for enhanced tolerance to stress the total amounts of isoprenoid cytokinins in both leaves and roots of m plants were also affected by water deficit stress when compared to the nm plants leaves and roots of wsm olive plants accumulated respectively 21 and 22 more cytokinins than in wsnm plants fig 5a b the results presented in this study showed that the interaction between drought and mycorrhiza affected markedly the content of trans zr whereas the trans zr was undetected in the leaves of non mycorrhizal stressed control plants colonization of olive roots by r irregularis resulted in the apparition of trans zr fig 6a it is important to note that leaves of wsm olive plants contained 17 higher levels of ip n9 g than in those of wsnm plants fig 5a application of water deficit stress did not affect the concentrations of z n7 g and ip n7 g in wsm roots when compared to those in wsnm ones however dhz n9 g zn 9 g and ip n9 g contents increased respectively by 18 33 and 37 in roots of water deficit stressed m plants compared to water deficit stressed non am plants showing the importance of r irregularis role in hormonal metabolic reprogramming under drought stress conditions fig 6b it is important to note that water deficit stress affected the biosynthetic pathways of ipa and roots of wsm and wsnm plants did not contain this cytokinin fig 6b two way anova analysis revealed that water stress am symbiosis and their interaction significantly affected cytokinins in leaves p 0 05 exceptions were water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ip n9 g supplementary appendix table s4 in roots the two factors water stress and am symbiosis and their interaction also significantly affected cytokinins p 0 05 exceptions were water stress x am symbiosis interaction for ja z n7 g dhz n9 g and ip n7 g supplementary appendix table s4 4 discussion water stress adversely affect olive plant physiology growth and productivity fernández 2014 along evolution olea europaea have evolved mechanisms to flexibly adapt to these harsh environments fernández 2014 one of these approaches is the establishment of mycorrhizal symbiosis mechri et al 2014 this mutualistic symbiosis presents a principal component aiding olive plants to cope with adversative environmental conditions calvo polanco et al 2019 mechri et al 2020a interestingly we showed here for the first time that am fungi colonization enhanced drought resistance in olea europaea by modifying the profiles of sugars phenylpropanoids and hormones in roots and leaves the positive effects of am symbioses on the development and growth of plants under water deficit stress have been exposed in numerous plant species such as apple carob lettuce and tomato huang et al 2020 ruiz lozano et al 2016 we recently showed that am fungi enhanced water deficit resistance in olive by inducing the accumulation of mannitol and oleuropein in roots mechri et al 2020a however in the latter experiment the hormonal profile was not studied we studied here for the first time the effects of the am fungus r irregularis daom 197198 on the levels of iaa aba ja sa and isoprenoid cytokinins in olive roots and leaves under well watered and water deficit stressed conditions phenolic and sugar compositions were also assessed in m and nm olive leaves 4 1 r irregularis daom 197198 induced priming and resistance of olive plant defense to water deficit stress the results presented in this study showed that mycorrhizae put roots of the olive plant in a warned state known as priming which allows earlier and enhanced defense responses to water deficit compared to non mycorrhizal plants we previously showed a strong reorganization of the phenylpropanoids sugars and hormonal profile in olive roots as a consequence of am colonization in the absence of stress mechri et al 2020a which apparently pivotal for successful defense against water deficit stress the olive plant response to mycorrhizal colonisation produced a characteristic root hormonal profile while the iaa levels remained unaltered in the roots of m plants compared with nm plants ja z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g increased in contrast significant decreases in the levels of aba and sa were found this metabolic reprogramming apparently reinforces the possibility that am symbiosis induced resistance taken place through priming in the present study we observed that the levels of auxin in roots did not differ significantly between wwnm and wwm olive plants similarly danneberg et al 1993 shaul keinan et al 2002 and torelli et al 2000 did not find that the auxin contents in maize zea mays tabacco nicotiana tabacum and leek allium porrum roots differed according to whether or not they were colonized with a glomus species mohan raj et al 2016 tested in vitro various indole 3 acetic acid and indole 3 butyric acid concentrations with daucus carota inoculated with r irregulare and observed a slight decrease in both spore numbers and root colonization the reason for the lack of appreciable changes in the level of auxin observed in this study could be that this particular hormone does not play a major role during colonization of olive roots by r irregularis we observed an increase in the concentrations of ja in root of am olive plants colonized by r irregularis which apparently important priming stimulus a primed response of ja was observed in am tomato upon caterpillar feeding or mechanical wounding jung et al 2012 the reason for the increased level of ja in am h vulgare has been attributed to the osmotic stress caused by the increased level of sugars transported from the leaves to the roots of am plants hause et al 2007 in this study the increased concentration of sugars in roots of wwm olive plants may be able to induce the genes expression which are responsible for the production of enzymes producing ja miransari et al 2014 ja and its derivatives are believed to play a key role in the root fungal colonization and activation of the plant immune responses adolfsson et al 2017 jung et al 2012 lópez ráez et al 2010 this activation can lead to an induced resistance and increased defensive capacity of systemic parts of the olive plant in response to abiotic and biotic stress jung et al 2012 other findings have reported null or reduced effects on am fungi colonization in plants treated with exogenous ja bedini et al 2018 additionally it has been reported that ja signaling might differentially affect am symbiosis and development by performing different roles in early and late stages of colonization foo et al 2013 we also observed a decline in concentrations of sa in roots of am olive plants this result suggests that sa seems to have a negative effect on am fungi colonization and it is plausible that am symbiosis requires inhibition of certain sa regulated responses in this regard our result corroborates with those of herrera medina et al 2003 who suggested that sa has inhibitory effects on root colonization by g mosseae and g intraradices it is known that sa and ja signalling pathways are antagonist proietti et al 2013 during am fungi colonization induction of plant defense responses occurs potentially through cross talk between sa and ja dependent signaling pathways mauch mani et al 2017 this induced resistance may impact plant responses to drought stress by priming the olive tissues for a more efficient activation of defense mechanisms our results showed that the colonization of olea europaea by am fungi influences the accumulation of aba in olive roots compared to nm ones indeed in the roots of wwm lower aba content was observed when compared to wwnm olive plants suggesting the role of r irregularis in improving the olive plant water balance under non stressful conditions as aba is able to control the activities of guard cells surrounding the stomata miransari et al 2014 additionally aba has been shown to increase the susceptibility of plants to mycorrhizal colonization and contributes to the development of arbuscules and their functionality charpentier et al 2014 martín rodríguez et al 2016 the results presented in this study showed that roots of am olive plants accumulate more cytokinins than nm olive plants in this regard our result corroborate with those of cosme et al 2016 who claimed that the positive effects of am fungi on the cytokinins levels in both leaves and roots might be required to restrict the carbon availability from the plant roots to the am fungi thus averting parasitism increase of fungal carbon demand to the point where it may depress plant growth by fungus cytokinins are also known to promote branching and cell division adolfsson et al 2017 hence the observed increase of z n7 g dhz n9 g ip n7 g and ip n9 g may be the factor involved in remodeling the root architecture in wwm plants an elevated concentration of cytokinin in am olive roots may provoke additional biochemical activity in the colonized plants some of which could be related to mineral uptake of roots and olive plant growth and development bedini et al 2018 cortleven et al 2019 4 2 the primed response is not restricted to the olive root system the results presented in this study showed that the primed response is not restricted to the olive root system we found a strong reorganization of the phenolic compound and sugar profiles of olive leaves as a consequence of mycorrhizal symbiosis in the absence of water defcit stress which apparently important priming stimulus our experiment showed that the pools of rhamnose fructose glucose and mannitol were higher in wwm compared with wwnm olive leaves this effect has been previously related to a higher carbon mobilization and requirements in mycorrhizal plants bárzana et al 2015 in addition am olive plants seem to maintain a higher metabolic activity and can be use the soluble sugars in order to form flavonoids especially catechin and luteolin 7 o glucoside and secoiridoids see table 2 a positive correlation between rates of sugars and phenolic metabolism was demonstrated by arnold et al 2004 in our previous study we have demonstrated that am colonization of olea europaea influences the carbon assimilation and allocation and increases the rate of photosynthesis in olive trees tekaya et al 2017 thereby possibly affecting the source sink relations that may influence the primary and secondary metabolism in mycorrhizal olive plants there is experimental evidence of the role of the phenylpropanoids and sugar metabolic pathway in priming of olive plant defenses by mycorrhizas such a suggestion appears to be further corroborated by the spectacular increase of oleuropein and mannitol in mycorrhizal plants under water deficit stress the importance of oleuropein and mannitol in the water deficit stresses reaction of olives was supported by petridis et al 2012 and conde et al 2011 moreover the results presented in this study showed that maintaining high oleuropein and mannitol levels in wsm plants prevented stem water potential ѱstem to decline to critical value which did not exceed 2 mpa compared to their relative wsnm plants 3 8 mpa other compounds with primed pattern after water deficit stress in olive am plants are the flavan 3 ol catechin and the flavone luteolin 7 o glucoside these two compounds were found to accumulate in leaves of wwm plants similarly an elevated concentration of luteolin 7 o glucoside was observed in shoots of mycorrhized salix purpurea aliferis et al 2015 and medicago truncatula adolfsson et al 2017 the flavonoid pathway is known to be involved in several processes associated with plant stress adaptation agati et al 2012 fini et al 2011 a potential contribution of catechin to olive plant protection against water deficit stress is supported by reports of the increased salinity tolerance achieved after exogenous application of catechin to sweet pepper and tomato plants yiu et al 2011 2012 the results obtained in this work revealed that the induction of resistance does not necessarily require moderate accumulation of metabolites our experiments showed that the level of iaa sa and ip n9 g in leaves did not appear to be enormously affected by symbiosis however am colonization of olea europaea boosted the iaa sa and ip n9 g increase during water deficit stress similar results have been reported by aroca et al 2013 who showed amplified accumulation of the aba in mycorrhizal lettuce plants upon salt stress whereas aba concentrations may be unaltered or even lower in mycorrhizal plants under favorable conditions in our recent previous study we have observed that under non stress conditions mannitol concentration may be unaltered in mycorrhizal olive root plants however under water stress the increase in mannitol content is higher in m compared with nm plants and is likely to lead to primed stress responses mechri et al 2020a under non stress conditions total isoprenoid cytokinins content were found at meaningfully elevated concentrations in wwm leaves than in the non am olive plants the obtained results are in agree with those of numerous earlier investigations chanclud and morel 2016 danneberg et al 1993 martínez medina et al 2011 noting that the elevated level of cytokinin in olive leaves of m plants could be related to translocation from the olive roots the hormone synthesis could be provoked by the colonization of roots by r irregularis rather than to de novo synthesis in the leaves shaul keinan et al 2002 most importantly while the iaa aba ja sa and ip n9 g levels persisted unchanged in the leaves of wwm plants when comparing with wwnm plants trans zr increased differences in zr compounds between m and nm plants have been earlier described by drüge and schonbeck 1993 shaul keinan et al 2002 and adolfsson et al 2017 it has been reported that trans zeatin protects arabidopsis plant against photoperiod stress frank et al 2020 an elevated level of cytokinin in the leaves may elicit additional biochemical activity in mycorrhizal olive plants some of which could be due to plant development growth and acclimation to drought stress ullah et al 2018 4 3 r irregularis daom 197198 enhanced water deficit resistance in olea europaea experimental data did not show a general increase in am colonization under such conditions but mycorrhizal olive plants perform better under water deficit stress mechri et al 2020a previous investigations have shown that the main stages of the am fungi development cycle sporulation germination and colonization could be hampered by the presence of water deficit stress fouad et al 2014 lenoir et al 2016 we suggested that interactions with mycorrhiza at the root level lead to an increased defensive capacity of olive roots and the aerial parts the results presented in this study show that stimuli stemming from am symbiosis are perceived by the olive plant leading to a slight induction of various compounds in roots fructose galactose arabinose rhamnose sucrose myo inositol sorbitol xylitol hydroxytyrosol tyrosol some flavonoids oleuropein verbascoside see mechri et al 2020a ja zeatin n7 glucoside dihydrozeatin n9 glucoside n6 isopentenyladenine n7 glucoside and n6 isopentenyladenine n9 glucoside and leaves rhamnose fructose glucose mannitol catechin luteolin 7 o glucoside oleuropein and trans zr these compounds are referred to as the priming fingerprint and a subset of these metabolic compounds may be common to several stimuli mauch mani et al 2017 we suggested that this metabolism reprograming is responsible for the increasing mycorrhizal olive tolerance to water deficit stress importantly am fungi colonization are able to mount a more robust defense against water deficit stress by inducing spectacular increase of mannitol and oleuropein in olive roots see mechri et al 2020a and leaves these two compounds have been strongly implicated in olive plant defense against drought salt and cold tolerance conde et al 2011 eggleston and legendre 2003 mechri et al 2020a ortega garcía and peragón 2009 increased a has been considered as a plant strategy for water deficit stress tolerance ruiz lozano et al 1995 similarly changes in gs has been reported to be mechanisms by which mycorrhizal colonization increase water deficit resistance ruiz lozano et al 1995 maintaining a high gs allows the plant a higher co2 photosynthesis uptake sheng et al 2008 the results obtained in this study from a and gs measurements showed that mycorrhizal olive plants maintained a higher levels of a than nm stressed plants concomitantly with higher gs and ѱstem the higher values of a in wsm plants compared to wsnm plants indicate that the photosynthetic apparatus of these plants was less damaged by the water deficit stress imposed this suggests that the benefit of colonization of olive roots by r irregularis goes beyond the simple water supply indeed ruiz lozano et al 2016 under water stress conditions observed that the am fungus r irregularis enhanced the photosynthetic efficiency the positive impact of am fungi colonization by r irregularis in improving water deficit tolerance was further supported by the net photosynthetic rate value obtained in the work of chitarra et al 2016 he et al 2017 indicated that am colonization by r irregularis can enhance a and reactive oxygen species scavenging capabilities and increase relative water content of leaves and roots to alleviate deficit stress in black locust robinia pseudoacacia l colonization of roots by r irregularis provoked a better accumulation of carbon metabolites in olive leaves such as arabinose rhamnose xylose glucose sucrose and consequently bigger tolerance to water deficit olive stress increased sugar levels in leaves of wsm plants can help to the conservation of sufficient carbon pool necessary for numerous significant pathways such as hormone and secondary metabolites o hara et al 2013 demonstrated that increased synthesis of sugar levels can generate an amelioration of signalling events mediated by phytohormones and kinases in the developmental events regulation in plants exposed to stress conditions therefore we suggest that am fungi colonization offer a holistic integration of stress tolerance strategies to support continued olive growth under water deficit stress conditions under water deficit stress olive plants colonized by r irregularis daom 197198 exhibited improved accumulation of iaa in their leaves mycorrhization therefore increased the flux into the pathway of auxin biosynthesis under water deficit stress this result suggests that iaa variation induced by am fungi colonization is an important mechanism involved in water deficit tolerance it has been reported that auxins positively modulate the reactive oxygen species ros metabolism aba responsive genes and metabolic homeostasis to enhance drought stress resistance phenotype chhaya et al 2021 shi et al 2014 as krasensky and jonak 2012 reviewed higher levels of some carbohydrates especially sugar alcohols and multiple sugars resulted by higher endogenous iaa level have a beneficial effect in response to water deficit stress we suggested that the adjustment of sugars and hormonal metabolic mechanisms in am olive plant might play some roles in auxin mediated water deficit stress resistance at least partly the plant hormone aba is considered as the stress hormone as it can regulate plant survival and development under drought stress conditions lim et al 2015 a role for aba in the mechanisms by which am fungi colonization affects stomata conductance under water stress was proposed by ruiz lozano et al 2016 in this study under water stress stress condition wsm olive plants exhibited significant lower level of aba in roots when comparing to non am plants in agreement with what was reported for solanum lycopersicum chitarra et al 2016 and knautia arvensis doubková et al 2013 an analogous situation was detected in the leaves where aba was decreased by 45 in water deficit stressed nm plants compared to am olive plants our results agree with previous reports showing that under water deficit stress the concentration of aba is lower in leaves of mycorrhizal than non mycorrhizal plants chitarra et al 2016 ouledali et al 2019 it has been proposed that non am plants probably faced more intense water deficit stress than am plants and accumulate produce more aba chitarra et al 2016 additionally aba has been reported to regulate am fungal colonization and participates to the arbuscules growth and functionality charpentier et al 2014 martín rodríguez et al 2016 as shown in our study a higher content of sa in am olive plants throughout water deficit stress with respect to control plants could recommend a better resistance of mycorrhizal plants to water deficit stress indeed plant phenolic compounds especially the secoiridoid oleuropein and osmolytes especially the polyol mannitol are the most abundant and important group of defensive compounds that mediate olive plant defense under drought stress conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a b as described that sa regulates biosynthesis of osmolytes li et al 2017 and induces accumulation of metabolites belonging to different structural classes including phenolics alkaloids terpenoids and others faried et al 2017 ullah et al 2018 interestingly higher induction of phenolic content was observed in plants treated with sa war et al 2011 possibly am fungi colonization generated a physiological water deficit for olive plants that lead to an activation of the enzymes of sa biosynthesis and suppression of those of its degradation and consequently might have resulted in the accumulation of higher level of mannitol and phenolic compounds in water deficit colonized olive plants water deficit stress provoked a diminution in leaf ja content in am plants whereas that in roots still unchanged when compared to the control several researchers found a stabilization in root ja contents after am fungi root colonization as was found here under water deficit conditions lópez ráez et al 2010 sánchez romera et al 2016 the lower level of ja in leaves of wsm when compared to the wsnm plants could be due to the long distance transport to distal olive tissues adolfsson et al 2017 these results suggested that a significant proportion of ja may be used 1 to adjust olive plant interactions with r irregularis under water deficit stress conditions it has been reported that ja play an important role in the am symbiosis lópez ráez et al 2010 2 to redistribute the nutrients in m roots and augment the olive root sink capacity resulting in the enhanced production of sugars in the leaves and their transfer to the roots hause et al 2007 the higher levels of mannitol and sucrose observed in wsm leaves when compared to the wsnm plants support this hypothesis it is recognized that the sugar alcohols mannitol and the disaccharide sucrose are the major phloem translocated carbohydrates in olive trees conde et al 2011 and 3 regulate the expression of genes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis in both olive leaves and roots adolfsson et al 2017 observed a decrease in ja level in leaves of am medicago truncatula accompanied by an improvement of luteolin glucoside and proanthodelphinidin it has been reported that the regulation of ja and sa in am symbiosis confers their potential role in the amelioration of plant performance under stress conditions via improvement in the synthesis of secondary metabolites hashem et al 2018 according to this experimental evidence colonization of olive roots by r irregularis and water deficit stress have both provoke the cytokinin molecules accumulation in roots and leaves cytokinins elevation is mainly accomplished by the overexpression of an isopentenyl transferase gene ameliorating root growth and increasing the antioxidant system activity and hence enhances drought tolerance xu et al 2016 through drought stress havlová et al 2008 observed in root tissues a significant accumulation of cytokinins as a consequent to a diminution in the activity of cytokinin oxidase dehydrogenase the drought stress inducible overexpression of isopentenyl transferase which is a key enzyme in isoprenoid cytokinins biosynthesis within plants peleg et al 2011 or the diminished cytokinins degradation by the decrease in the activity of cytokinin oxidase dehydrogenase havlová et al 2008 have been mostly accomplished by accumulation of protective compounds which ultimately leads to increased drought tolerance in plants chhaya et al 2021 we suggested that am fungi affect phenolic compound metabolism and consequently water deficit stress resistance in olea europaea via modification of cytokinin concentration a number of studies have reported that the concentration and the type of cytokinin could influence secondary metabolome accumulation in in vitro plant cultures for example tdz thidiazuron at a concentration of 1 µm enhanced the content of luteolin luteolin 7 o glucoside and verbascoside in scutellaria altissima shoot culture grzegorczyk karolak et al 2017 dević et al 2006 observed that bap 6 benzylaminopurine at a concentration of 4 mm increased the content of secoiridoids in gentiana asclepiadea shoot culture bap also increased the isoflavone glucoside in genista tinctoria shoot culture while kinetin at a concentration of 0 5 mm enhanced the content of isoflavonoid aglycones luczkiewicz et al 2014 in the current study the reduced levels of aba and ja and the increased levels of iaa sa and cytokinin in leaves of wsm olive plants may be considered key determinants of olive water deficit stress tolerance we suggested that this hormonal profile contribute to the acquired olive resistance by increasing the metabolic pathways for the synthesis of molecules like oleuropein verbascoside apigenin 7 o glucoside and mannitol it has been reported that these molecules have major roles in the regulation of plant growth subjected to water deficit stress conditions falahi et al 2018 hojati et al 2011 mechri et al 2020a b thus modulation of endogenous plant hormones under am symbiosis appears to be a promising approach for protecting olive plants against the adverse impact of water deficit stress 4 4 r irregularis mediated alleviation of olive plant water deficit stress as indicated by mannitol oleuropein ratio consistent with our hypothesis both the intensity of olive plant stress responses to a lower water supply and the positive role of am fungi symbiosis in plant water deficit stress tolerance were clearly indicated by the olea europaea tissue concentration of mannitol and oleuropein specifically mannitol and oleuropein concentrations increased in response to colonization of olive roots by r irregularis and diminishing water supply thus variation of mannitol oleuropein status in the olea europaea may be considered as an important priming stimulus in this study r irregularis appears to have up regulated the activity of specific pathways involved in the sysnthesis of sugars and phenolic compounds the accumulation of oleuropein and mannitol may protect the olive plant proteins nucleic acids lipids pigments and membranes against denaturation caused by the excess levels of reactive oxygen species das and roychoudhury 2014 lee et al 2009 shen et al 1997 a number of studies have shown that mannitol and oleuropein have great potential to inhibit the generation of reactive oxygen species ros that may result from drought petridis et al 2012 shen et al 1997 we suggest that the increased antioxidant defense system in am fungi inoculated olive plants helps to maintain ros levels that do not cause protein and membrane denaturation but rather function in integrating various developmental processes these systems include the interaction of sugar phenolic compounds and several phytohormones that regulate the pathways for maintaining an optimal concentration of ros the results presented in this study showed that the leaves of am plants has lower levels of mannitol oleuropein ratio under stress conditions a similar situation was observed in the roots where the mannitol oleuropein ratio decreased significantly in wsm roots when compared to the wsnm plants mechri et al 2020a these results suggest that am symbiosis 1 stimulate the synthesis of oleuropein which can increase olive plant tolerance to water deficit stress accumulation of oleuropein in olive leaves has been observed in many olea europaea cultivars subjected to various abiotic stresses mechri et al 2020a b ortega garcía and peragón 2009 petridis et al 2012 and 2 enhance the accumulation of oleuropein potentially beneficial to human health in olive plant tissues oleuropein has been reported as a well established antithrombotic and anti atherogenic antiviral hepatoprotective antioxidant antimicrobial and potential anti cancer activities asgharzade et al 2020 barbaro et al 2014 castejón et al 2017 the importance of oleuropein and mannitol in the water deficit stress reaction of olea europaea has been extensively reported conde et al 2011 mechri et al 2019 mechri et al 2020a b petridis et al 2012 but why am fungi increased the flux into the accumulation of oleuropein in olive roots mechri et al 2020a and leaves rather than the accumulation of mannitol in the response mechanisms to water deficit stress remains an open question 5 conclusion in conclusion we showed that colonization of olive roots by r irregularis daom 197198 decreases the negative impacts of water deficit stress in olive plants by varying the phenylpropanoid sugars and hormonal profiles that may underlie their ameliorated tolerance to water deficit stress the obtained results confirm the protective role of am symbiosis toward olive plants under water deficit stress conditions and their potential application as a sustainable approach in agriculture the integration of hormone in olive plant responses against water related stresses as well as their interaction with sugars and phenolic compounds is also demonstrated in this work displaying a dissimilar behavior depending on the presence or absence of am fungi colonization however further research is required to elucidate the intrinsic mechanisms of this hormone polyphenols sugars crosstalk and how it is modulated by am fungi symbiosis declaration of competing interest the

9242,water quality deterioration such as eutrophication can contribute to the degradation of farm pond ecosystems threatening numerous ecological services and socioeconomic benefits however the variability of water quality and the complexity of influencing variables pose large uncertainties for pond management practices and watershed planning this study integrated a self organizing map som

variability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction farm ponds a type of small water body found throughout southern china play an important role in agricultural production and ecosystem services such as irrigation aquaculture flood regulation pollutant retention and biological habitat regulation chen et al 2019 cui et al 2022 the diversity and robustness of farm pond ecological functions are largely determined by water quality e g degree of eutrophication and are impacted by hydrological biogeochemical and anthropogenic aquatic terrestrial interactions hill et al 2021 however stressors such as rapid urbanization agricultural intensification and climate change have harmed ecosystem services in recent years therefore it is essential to understand the variations in water quality and the synergistic impacts of the pond s internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management in order to restore and enhance ecological service functions usio et al 2017 chen et al 2021 this understanding is also a prerequisite for establishing sustainable management practices to prevent degradation and damage of farm ponds ponds are usually regarded as pollution sinks due to the interception of surface runoff and the retention and removal of pollutants via sedimentation plant uptake microbial decomposition and sediment adsorption veraart et al 2011 sugiyama and hama 2013 usio el 2017 cui et al 2022 in the most intensive agricultural landscape in southern china a large amount of fertilizer input causes pollutants such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p to enter the ponds through hydrological processes chen et al 2019 the water quality of farm ponds on the other hand is more vulnerable to external stressors due to their limited volume shallow water depth and comparatively low pollutant dilution capacity hill et al 2021 also point source pollution like livestock farming aquaculture and domestic sewage accelerates nutrient enrichment in ponds however eutrophication can turn the pond from a pollutant sink in the surrounding landscape to a pollutant source in the downstream waters chen et al 2021 deterioration in water quality can potentially weaken the ecological service functions of ponds for instance a higher ammonia content increases water ph and is harmful to fish and invertebrates chen et al 2019 furthermore the water quality of farm ponds is vital for agricultural irrigation because it affects the quality of produce and may cause health concerns li et al 2020 as a result evaluating water quality variations not only serves to reveal the dynamic shifting of roles transformation of source sink pollution but also clarifies the current conditions of pond aquatic ecosystems to aid in the formulation of suitable management targets owing to the nonlinearity and complexities of water quality data which feature noise redundancy internal correlations and outliers nonlinear analysis techniques are generally required to simplify and cluster the data in order to achieve meaningful measurement evaluations li et al 2018 self organizing maps som in particular as an unsupervised clustering technique based on artificial neural networks is capable of extracting high dimensional characteristics of complicated data and is widely used in the clustering of varied ecological environment data vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 previous studies have confirmed that variations in water quality in farm ponds are regulated by internal characteristics such as water storage capacity water physicochemical properties vegetation and sediment lischeid et al 2018 chen et al 2021 external environmental factors such as meteorology landscape patterns topography and soil properties of the pond catchment usio et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and agronomic management such as aquaculture irrigation and aquatic vegetation management li et al 2019 cui et al 2022 the relationships between water quality variations and the above characteristic variables can be extracted using various statistical methods such as multiple regression correlation analysis redundancy analysis mixed effect models and regression tree models complex interactions between characteristic factors and their synergistic effects on water quality are prevalent for example fertilization and irrigation may weaken or even obscure the correlation between land use and pond water quality li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 revealed that rainfall had a negative impact on pond water quality when coupled with impervious land use while dilution effects were observed when associated with water land use however these methods tend to focus on the relationship between predictors and responses which makes it difficult to detect the interaction between factors and potential influence paths therefore further studies and quantification methods are needed to appropriately depict multiple water quality impacts and reaction processes in farm ponds lischeid et al 2018 this study aimed to i examine the spatiotemporal variations of water quality in farm ponds in southern china ii identify the interactions and synergistic effects of the internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management on pond water quality variations and iii detect the key influencers and pathways to propose effective management practices to address these objectives we conducted monitoring and data collection for 39 typical farm ponds within an intensive agricultural landscape in the dongting lake basin using the following statistical approach a self organizing map som was first employed to identify variations in n and p concentrations in farm ponds then partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was used to construct the influence paths of all variables on the variations followed by evaluation of the performance and significance of these influences as well as the consequences for rural planning and pond management the results of this study may aid in understanding pollution migration in catchments and fate in ponds as well as in identifying spatiotemporal pollution hotspots which can aid in management and conservation efforts in the context of farm pond water quality and ecological degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the jinjing river watershed

ponds and residential land the forest is mainly composed of non commercial secondary masson pine pinus massoniana l woodlands and is mostly distributed on the hills agricultural land is mostly distributed in the valleys and floodplains along streams and is mainly used for planting double cropping rice vegetables and other crops that require high fertilizer inputs the average fertilizer application rate in paddy field was 250 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 65 kg p ha 1 yr 1 while in tea plantation it was 450 kg n ha 1 yr 1and 8 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 wang et al 2020 meng et al 2021 the study watershed 134 4 km2 contains more than 2000 ponds which were extracted from a 5 m resolution satellite image and are scattered around agricultural land villages and foothills most of these ponds are used to store rainwater and irrigate adjacent farmlands and tea plantations while some ponds near or within the villages are also used for collecting domestic sewage daily washing and aquaculture most ponds are relatively independent and are not connected by ditches or canals based on historical image data and field investigations 39 ponds were selected as sampling sites fig 1 these ponds have existed since the 1930 s and have not been blocked or deliberately destroyed by sludge the characteristics of these sample ponds and the land use within the catchment are provided in table s1 2 2 water and site parameters 2 2 1 landscape characteristics of pond catchment to obtain the landscape characteristics of the pond catchment the catchment boundaries were first extracted from digital elevation model dem data using arcgis 10 2 software esri redland ca usa and combined with the dinf algorithm tarboton 1997 then the land use vector data were converted to grids at a 5 m spatial resolution and the landscape composition of the catchment was identified topographic characteristics of the pond catchment such as average elevation and slope were extracted and calculated using the dem data referring to previous studies meng et al 2021 2022 ten commonly used landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape configuration at the catchment level table 1 these metrics can reflect the area edge shape aggregation and diversity of patches which have specific ecological significance and practical applications in landscape optimisation based on the digital raster maps the corresponding landscape metrics were calculated using the fragstats v4 2 program mcgarigal and marks 1995 2 2 2 sample collection and analysis water samples from 39 selected ponds were collected monthly from june 2017 to may 2018 to ensure the accuracy of the water quality water samples from the surface middle and bottom were obtained and blended from the centre and end of the pond water temperature temp ph dissolved oxygen do and redox potential eh were determined on site using an hq430 multiparameter meter hach loveland colorado usa pond depth depth was also measured water sample analysis was generally completed 24 h after collection otherwise the samples were stored at 18 c before the analysis the samples were thoroughly mixed and divided into equal parts part of the raw sample was used to determine the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the total suspended solids tss of the raw samples were determined using an ss 2z suspended solid sensor haizheng shanghai china the second aliquot was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane millipore sigma burlington massachusetts usa to determine the total dissolved nutrients including total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and soluble reactive phosphorus srp all the above water quality parameters were analysed following standard methods china epa 2002 in addition particulate nitrogen pn and particulate phosphorus pp were calculated from the differences between tn and tdn as well as tp and tdp similarly dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated from the difference between tdn and dissolved inorganic n i e din no3 n no2 n nh4 n dissolved organic phosphorus dop was derived from the difference between tdp and srp according to the preset square grid sampling scheme sample site spacing of 50 100 m 1397 surface soil samples depth of 20 cm were collected to determine soil properties in the study watershed all samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc was determined using the k2cr2o7 h2so4 oxidation titration method nelson and sommers 1983 total soil nitrogen tsn was determined using an automated flow injector system tecator fia star 5000 analyser foss tecator höganäs sweden after digestion with k2cr2o7 h2so4 total soil p tsp and available soil p olsen p were determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method after h2so4 hclo4 digestion and nahco3 extraction respectively the spatial distribution of soil properties soc tsn olsen p and tsp and their molar ratios soil c to n ratio soil cnr soil c to p ratio soil cpr and soil n to p ratio soil npr were estimated using a geographically weighted regression gwr model fotheringham et al 1998 arcgis software was used to determine the area averaged soil properties in the pond catchment detailed information is listed in table 1 to collect meteorological data a standard and three micro weather stations intelment advantage dynamax inc usa were installed in the watershed fig 1 2 2 3 pond management pond management practices such as irrigation aquaculture and feeding were investigated at monthly intervals the survey showed that grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella was the main aquaculture fish and its management was extensive and the fish were only fed grass macrophytes were not observed in any of the ponds because of irrigation or aquaculture in addition since most ponds were dredged before monitoring sediment samples were not collected the descriptions and summary statistics of the management variables are presented in table 1 2 3 statistical analyses first spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to test the data independence of all sampling sites a som was developed to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of n and p concentrations based on the above results redundancy analysis rda and pls sem were deployed to link the variation of water n and p with pond internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management to identify the influence paths and key influencing factors the detailed procedure is as follows 2 3 1 spatial autocorrelation analysis as a correlation coefficient to measure overall spatial autocorrelation the global moran s i can measure the correlation in a signal among nearby locations in space with values between 1 and 1 moran 1950 a value of 1 or 1 indicates a negative or positive spatial autocorrelation respectively while a value of 0 indicates perfect randomness 2 3 2 self organizing map som as an unsupervised machine learning technique som can be used for efficient clustering and low dimensional typically two dimensional visualization of high dimensional target data while preserving the topology of the dataset kohonen 2001 similar to most artificial neural networks som is composed of an input layer and an outer layer and operates in two modes training i e competitive learning and mapping the implementation process of som can be summarized in two stages 1 training and mapping for visualization to show the relationship between data points and 2 clustering it subsequently first the input space with ρ dimensions defined as an input space with ρ variables is represented as a map space with two dimensions through iterative training in this study input data included tn pn no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tp pp srp and dop from 39 ponds over a 12 month period and the number of samples of each form n and p was 468 the map space consisted of n output neurons nodes which were arranged as a two dimensional hexagonal array the determination of the map space structure including the neuron number and ratio of the map side lengths is provided in the supplementary material text s1 second combined with the unified distance matrix u matrix and partitional clustering method i e k means algorithm the clustering boundaries of the som map were defined to obtain the subset information of the output neurons the above two methods determine the boundary and number of clusters according to the node colors on the map and the davies bouldin index dbi respectively davies and bouldin 1979 li et al 2018 generally the optimal cluster number is when the dbi index is minimal the som algorithm was performed using the som toolbox v2 1 http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox for matlab which was developed by the laboratory of information and computer science helsinki university of technology 2 3 3 redundancy analysis rda first according to the verification results of the kolmogorov smirnov test log x 1 transformation of the data was performed to satisfy the normality hypothesis second the gradient axis was tested using detrended correspondence analysis dca to determine the use of rda or canonical correlation analysis cca van den wollenberg 1977 since the gradient axis was 3 0 rda was selected to explore the impact of characterization indicators of internal factors external environment and agronomic management on the variations in pond water n and p concentrations the results are expressed as biplots where the effect of the influencing factors on n and p variations was evaluated by the angle and length of the arrows the above analyses were performed using canoco 5 0 software microcomputer power company ithaca ny usa 2 3 4 partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem as a distinct method for analysing composite based path models pls sem was used to analyse the complex interrelationships between pond water quality i e n and p concentrations and other latent variables i e landscape composition configuration topography management soil meteorology and water physicochemical properties the indicators selected by rda were developed as measurements for the latent variables the main reason for choosing pls sem is that this study aims to explore the complex relationship between latent variables that have never been tested previously in addition the model exhibits favorable behavior in dealing with complex model structures and multicollinearity of indicators and does not need to impose distributional assumptions on the data e g normal distribution hair et al 2019 the path model containing all potential variables was tested and constructed the smartpls 3 3 3 software ringle et al 2015 first the internal consistency reliability indicator reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity of the measurement model were tested using the criteria indices including cronbach s alpha ca composite reliability cr indicator loadings average variance extracted ave and heterotrait monotrait ratio htmt the statistical significance standard errors and p values of the model path coefficients was then evaluated using the fitting distribution generated by bootstrapping 5000 re samples the predictive relevance of the endogenous variables was subsequently assessed using the coefficients of determination r 2 and predictive relevance q 2 additionally the overall prediction performance of the structural model was estimated using global goodness of fit gof the specific assessment criteria for the above indices are provided in table s2 based on the pls sem results an importance performance map analysis ipma was conducted to identify the importance and performance of all indicators in explaining the dependent variables i e n and p concentrations the importance value was calculated from the total effect of the indicator on the structure of the dependent variable the performance value was derived from the indicators mean value of the rescaled data with a value of 100 indicating the highest performance ringle and sarstedt 2016 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of n and p concentrations during the study period the global moran s i value was 0 002 0 287 p 0 062 0 864 indicating that the water n and p of the sample ponds showed random and weak spatial autocorrelation table s3 therefore the proximity of sample sites due to the small watershed scale does not interfere with the identification of spatiotemporal variation in n and p concentrations according to the determining criterion of minimising qe and te and avoiding a large number of empty neurons 112 14 8 neurons were the optimal structure of the som table s4 following the optimal structure the component plane of the 10 som variables is displayed in fig 2a through the visual investigation of color gradients all n and p forms showed a clear tendency that is high values appeared in the lower regions and gradually decreased upward however the slight difference is that the maximum values of all forms of n are concentrated in the lower right corner while the high values of all forms of p except srp were distributed in the lower corner of both sides fig 2a these results indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between the parameters of all n and p forms and the spatiotemporal patterns of different n or p forms were consistent based on the cluster boundaries generated by the u matrix fig 2a and the minimum value of the dbi fig 2b the neuron units on the map were classified into five clusters fig 2c to reduce the influence of outliers medians were used instead of means to evaluate similarities and differences among clusters the numerical characteristics of the variables in each cluster median quartile range outliers and extreme values are presented in fig 3 the results showed significant differences between clusters for each variable table s5 specifically the median n tn pn no3 n no2 n nh4 n and don and srp concentrations in cluster v were significantly higher than those in the other clusters whereas clusters iii and v had significantly higher p tp pp and dop concentrations p 0 05 the concentrations of dissolved inorganic n din and p srp in clusters i iv were low and no3 n and nh4 n showed no significant differences between clusters to parse the spatiotemporal characteristics the variables of the above clusters were traced back to their original sampling times and sites fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of pond water quality pond water samples in the northern area of the watershed mostly belonged to cluster i and ii clusters iii iv and v were primarily sampled in the southern region in the ponds of commercial tea plantations in the southwest region pond nos 2 6 7 8 and 9 clusters iv and v accounted for more than 50 of the total samples using various period division criteria i e hydrology farming and meteorology season for temporal grouping the five clusters temporal patterns are shown in fig 5 approximately 72 66 of the samples in cluster i belonged to the planting or dry season with the primary overlapping period being rain planting summer and dry planting autumn with increasing cluster number the proportion of samples in the dry and fallow seasons increased gradually and around 83 of samples in cluster v were at the intersection of the dry and fallow seasons notably for cluster ⅲ with significantly higher p concentrations the fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring periods accounted for the same percentage of the total 3 2 relationship between n p variation and influencing factors the rda results revealed that various pond internal external and agronomic management characterization indicators had significant effects on the variations in water n and p table s6 as shown in fig 6 as the representation factors of landscape composition percentage agricultural land agri and percentage residential land resi were positively correlated with the variations in water n and p whereas percentage forest land forest only had a significant negative impact on n concentrations for landscape configuration the metrics of the largest patch index lpi and contagion index contag had negative effects on n and p this indicates that the greater the fragmentation and dispersion of patches in the pond catchment the greater the n and p concentrations in the water in agronomic management fish farming can significantly increase n and p concentrations whereas irrigation has the opposite effect in terms of water physicochemical properties only water temperature and depth exhibited significant negative effects that is a decrease in water depth and temperature led to an increase in n and p concentrations in addition catchment soil properties only had significant effects on water p concentrations with tsp and soil cpr having positive and negative effects respectively rain was significantly negatively correlated with all forms of n and p except for pp 3 3 validation and evaluation of the structural model factors that significantly influenced both n and p concentrations were employed as indicators to describe the linked latent variables based on the rda results based on previous studies boardman et al 2019 li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 liu et al 2021 shen et al 2021 we hypothesized that landscape composition soil and water physicochemical properties and management have direct effects on n and p concentrations while topography landscape configuration and meteorology have a hierarchical effect on n and p concentrations via paths of the above variables the model s validation findings revealed that all the criterion indices including ca cr ave and htmt were within the standard range suggesting that the measurement models were valid and reliable table s7 the r 2 and q 2 of n and p variables were 0 54 and 0 35 respectively and the integrated model s gof values were 0 65 indicating that the model had a moderate ability to interpret and predict the variations of n and p concentrations fig 7 3 4 influence path and importance of factors on n and p concentrations the p values standard errors and path coefficients were generated by bootstrapping with 5000 subsamples to verify hypothetical paths fig 7 the results showed that the latent variables of landscape composition soil and pond management had significant positive direct effects on the n and p concentrations p 0 001 while the effects of pond physicochemical properties were the opposite β n 0 27 β p 0 28 p 0 001 for external environmental factors landscape composition and soil had multi mediation effects and they both fully mediated the effects of topography and configuration on n and p concentrations similarly physicochemical properties acted as mediators between meteorology and n and p concentrations in addition meteorology positively moderated the paths of soil p and composition n p β 0 11 0 16 and 0 09 p 0 001 indicating that meteorology intensifies the effect of soil and land use on n and p concentrations for example for every additional standard deviation of meteorology the slope of the soil to p concentrations will increase by 0 11 standard deviations table 2 presents the total effects between each latent variable and n and p concentrations calculated from the sum of the direct and indirect effects the results showed that the total effects of landscape composition on n and p concentrations were higher than those of the other latent variables in addition the total effect of soil on p concentration was the lowest among all latent variables furthermore the importance performance diagrams fig 8 developed by the ipma revealed that agri resi and rain were the primary indicators affecting n and p concentrations however their performance was slightly below average when compared to other indicators the depth carried a similar importance but had a considerably higher performance however fish farming had the highest performance values despite having medium importance scores 4 discussion using a combination of som and pls sem this study evaluated the effects of pond internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management on water n and p variations the results from typical farm ponds in subtropical southern china showed that there were interactive effects mediation and moderation effects between pond internal characteristics and external environmental factors and that a synergistic effect with agronomic management resulted in spatiotemporal variability of n and p concentrations in the following sections we discuss the following 1 the interaction of the influencing factors and their impact on pond n and p variations 2 the transition in landscape source and sink function caused by variability in pollution status and 3 management strategies to enhance pond ecological functions by improving water quality 4 1 influence of internal characteristics external environments and agronomic management in theory pond nutrient dynamics are determined simultaneously by catchment environment internal characteristics and agronomic management the results of pls sem analyses revealed that the synergistic effect of both within pond and external processes could explain 60 2 2 9 and 54 2 3 1 of the n and p variations respectively fig 7 confirming the above perspective the external environment primarily determines the input of nutrients into the pond as external environmental representation variables selected by the unrestricted permutation test landscape composition agri and resi configuration lpi and contag topography elevation and slope and soil chemical properties tsp and soil cpr were strongly correlated with n and p concentrations landscape composition directly or indirectly determines the input of nutrients to the receiving waters previous studies have identified fertilizer runoff and domestic sewage as major sources of n and p pollution in rural water bodies li et al 2018 chen et al 2021 meng et al 2021 this is consistent with our findings that is the quantification of land composition through agri and resi reflects n and p input densities it should be pointed out that tea plantations were classified as agricultural land owing to non negligible n and p contributions where local farmers tend to apply excessive fertilizer to ensure yields 450 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 meng et al 2021 meanwhile the abrupt reduction in vegetation coverage aggravates the erosion and loss of soil n and p zhang et al 2020 residential land exhibited the same importance as agricultural land despite its smaller area percentage fig 8 this is due to the lack of unified sewage collection and treatment facilities or poor maintenance of existing facilities in the rural areas of subtropical hilly regions in china thus farm ponds assume the role of domestic sewage collection especially during the dry season and fallow period ongley et al 2010 landscape configuration can not only reflect land use features but also weight nutrient loadings by altering hydrological processes boardman et al 2019 the rda results indicated that the fragmentation and dispersion of patches at the landscape level i e catchment scale increased pond n and p concentrations fig 6 generally landscape configuration features at the landscape level are mostly determined by dominant land use the increase in patch fragmentation and dispersion in the forest dominated catchment indicates that the disturbance of human activities is more disruptive to nature forcing the natural ecosystem to shift toward the agricultural type buyantuyev et al 2010 meng et al 2021 in addition fragmented and scattered patches are more susceptible to soil erosion resulting in nutrient migration and loss of surface runoff particularly in the particulate form this was clearly reflected in the configuration composition soil p concentration path fig 7 soil serves as a source sink and transport medium for nutrients from catchments to the receiving ponds although soil tsn was negatively correlated with n concentration it was not significant in the unrestricted permutation test p 0 05 and could not be used to construct latent variables in addition the total effect of the soil variables was lower than that of the other variables table 2 this might be attributed to nutrient deposition retention and removal in front ditch networks weakening the relationship between soil properties and pond n and p collins et al 2016 shen et al 2021 interestingly both tsp and soil cpr were significantly associated with pond p concentrations ecosystem stoichiometric ratios reflect the severity of autotrophic nutrient constraints and the degree of heterotrophic nutrient limitation sterner and elser 2017 these ratios can affect the water quality given that the c p ratio of decomposable organic matter is normally negatively related to its decomposition rate constant zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 our findings indicate that pond p input may be closely related to soil organic matter decomposition the effects of topography on pond n and p concentrations were mediated by landscape patterns and soil according to pls sem findings this is consistent with the hypothesis that topography constrains landscape patterns and regulates the geographical distribution of soil through energy and matter redistribution liu et al 2021 as we observed paddy fields and residential land usually accounted for a larger proportion of the total area in pond catchments with low elevation and gentle terrain while forests were mostly distributed in high elevation regions consequently farm ponds located near streams in lowland areas are more susceptible to n and p pollution a special case is the ponds at the foot of tea plantations which serve as hotspots for particulate nutrients by slowing water velocity and trapping sediments meng et al 2021 according to the total effect results in table 2 pond intrinsic characteristics e g water physicochemical properties also have a significant regulatory effect on n and p concentrations the importance and performance of water depth in the model fig 8 indicate that the enrichment or dilution effects caused by changes in water volume have a significant impact on n and p concentrations meanwhile the relatively high water depth is conducive to resisting external hydrologic disturbance and bioturbation activities of fish avoiding an increase in nutrient content due to sediment resuspension usio el 2017 zhang et al 2020 although water temperature is negatively correlated with n and p concentrations their respective regulatory mechanisms are different for example temperature affects microbial enzymatic activity which is crucial for n conversion and degradation veraart et al 2011 in particular during the colder winter months biological processes are restricted leading to net accumulation of nutrients in the pond zhang et al 2020 simultaneously temperature can regulate the p concentration by influencing the deposition process a higher temperature enhances the adsorption of po4 p onto sediments sugiyama and hama 2013 rainfall indirectly affected the transit and fate of n and p from terrene to receiving ponds through the mediation of internal characteristics and its regulation of external environments the positive regulation of rainfall on the soil p and composition n and p paths in the model reflects that rainfall is the main trigger of nps in particular soil p loss is more sensitive to rainfall for instance tsp loss on tea plantation slopes would be aggravated by intense rainfall events which is consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2020 rainfall has a significantly more complicated impact on the tn in ponds because it can activate complex biogeochemical processes for example although rain can trigger n loss it can also facilitate biogeochemical n removal in ponds by providing anaerobic conditions for denitrification or by enhancing n processing in microbial active zones liao et al 2016 this is evidenced by the low tn peak of the yearly trends in wet years bachmair et al 2012 furthermore owing to the dilution effect caused by the increased water volume rainfall seems to have an adverse effect on pond n and p concentrations in general as shown in table 2 the total effect of rainfall on n and p concentrations was 0 18 and 0 19 respectively pond n and p concentrations are directly influenced not only by terrestrial sources but also by agronomic management such as aquaculture or intermittent pumping for irrigation li et al 2019 from the perspective of water resources and nutrient cycling irrigation provides an efficient pathway for recycling and n and p removal yin and shah 2001 and pond p appears to be more sensitive to pumping processes based on the model results fig 8 in earlier studies of the liuchahe watershed the total mass of tp reclaimed from ponds by irrigation surpassed 70 kg yr 1 indicating that irrigation is an effective p recycling strategy yin and shah 2001 in this study the number of irrigation applications during the rice growing season was normally 4 8 times however because most ponds also feature aquaculture a single pumping usually does not exceed 30 of the pond capacity to satisfy the water level of aquaculture as a result irrigation rarely leads to a significant increase in pond n and p concentrations caused by the enrichment effect the highest performance scores of fish farming indicate that aquaculture has the potential to degrade water quality although most managers did not purposefully provide artificial feed to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella they applied human and livestock excrement to promote fish growth in summary the n and p concentrations in ponds changed as a result of a mixture of internal and external influences and focusing on a single factor may overlook the mixing effects of other critical variables distorting the results 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of water quality identifying the pollution status and seasonal hotspots of n and p in farm ponds can provide critical information about their contributions to sink and source impacts on the contamination status of downstream water bodies refined catchment management and pollution reduction chen et al 2021 cui et al 2022 som analysis highlighted n and p status except for cluster ⅰ the average tn concentration 2 97 mg l 1 in the remaining four clusters exceeded the threshold of level v surface water quality 2 00 mg l 1 china epa 2002 while p status tp 0 34 mg l 1 pp 0 22 mg l 1 exhibited similar degradation in comparison to comparable ponds in germany tn and tp 50 quantiles of 1 96 and 0 24 mg l 1 lischeid et al 2018 france tn and tp averaged 1 32 and 0 27 mg l 1 respectively wezel et al 2013 and japan tn and tp averaged 1 32 and 0 13 mg l 1 respectively usio et al 2017 our data exemplify the substantial pollution risks of farm ponds affected by intensive agriculture and humid subtropical climates in central south china additionally there was high intra annual heterogeneity in the water n and p in the pond with high n levels mainly appearing in the fallow dry winter period and high p levels typically occurring in both the fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring periods spatially high n and p levels tended to occur in ponds with a high proportion of agricultural and residential land ponds with commercial tea plantations were spatiotemporal hotspots of n pollution risk due to the local nitrogen application pattern that is substantial amounts of base fertilizer were applied from november to march to ensure spring tea production generally ponds with strong nutrient removal and interception capacities are regarded as pollution sinks cui et al 2022 since farm ponds are generally in critical source areas and have hydrological connections to the river network significant spatiotemporal variability would result in periodic source sink reversals in which they would become the source of nutrients in downstream water during the high n and p levels chen et al 2021 due to the low groundwater table during the fallow dry winter period the combination of bottom percolation and lateral seepage could lead to the diffusion of high n and p concentrations in pond water into groundwater or aquifers and migration downstream through baseflow muendo et al 2005 in addition the fact that particulate p was the main form of p in this period implies that more dissolved p may have been lost with the percolation water from the ponds zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that pond p hotspots are also prone to occur during the planting rain spring period while the model results suggested that a combination of dilution agronomic management i e pumping irrigation and biogeochemistry could generally counteract the adverse impacts of rainfall driven p loss in the catchment on pond water quality strong pulse inputs caused by storm flow during overlapping periods of planting and rainy seasons can still significantly increase pond p concentrations in particular precipitation shortly following fertilization can significantly increase the risk of catchment p especially pp and dop movement king et al 2015 4 3 implications for management as a biological physicochemical and ecological hotspot in the catchment improving water quality through management practices is critical for the restoration and enhancement of farm pond ecological functions usio et al 2017 shen et al 2021 the model results revealed that pond management should be performed at both within pond and catchment scales the considerable effects of agri and resi on pond water imply that nutrient input should be minimized by restricting agricultural expansion e g prohibiting the massive conversion of forests to tea plantations and strengthening domestic sewage treatment fig 8 given the protection of farmland in china the development of environmentally friendly farming precise agronomic management and the establishment of best management practices e g buffer strips on preferred hydrological pathways can achieve the same benefit as decreasing agri within pond management should prioritize fish farming and water depth variations according to ipma it is challenging to improve water quality by banning aquaculture unless the needs of stakeholders are met thus it is essential to explore ways to compensate farmers for revenue loss by endowing farm ponds with new functions and economic value such as increasing biodiversity and recreational functions chen et al 2019 recycling irrigation can be used during the rice season it permits nutrient water in the pond rice system to stay in the fields more frequently while preserving the pond water depth li et al 2020 simultaneously the large soil water interface of the rice field facilitates sedimentation and denitrification in addition a previous study revealed that macrophytes play an important role in maintaining clear water in shallow ponds through absorption suppression of sediment resuspension and denitrification usio et al 2017 therefore regular planting and harvesting of macrophytes should be incorporated into pond management practices 5 conclusions as rural landscapes are widely distributed in the subtropics of china farm ponds profoundly affect the hydrology and nutrient cycles in the catchment but are faced with the elimination of ecological functions caused by water quality degradation the results indicated that the 39 monitoring farm ponds had high pollution risk and spatiotemporal variability of n and p and that they may reverse from sinks to sources of pollutants during the overlapping periods of fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring based on the constructed sem model there were interacting effects mediation and moderation effects between the pond internal characteristics and external environmental factors and synergistic effect with agronomic management explained 60 2 2 9 and 54 2 3 1 of the n and p variations respectively the total effects of landscape composition on the variations of n and p were higher than those of other latent variables while agricultural and residential area percentage rainfall water depth and fish farming were relatively important among all indicators these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms driving nitrogen and phosphorus variations in farm ponds and can be used as guidance for farm pond management in similar agricultural and geo climatic situations the limitation of this study is that the pond internal characteristics were only defined by the physical and chemical parameters of the water body and other elements such as sediment phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates were not incorporated similarly indicator characterization of external environmental factors and agronomic management can be improved additionally to repair farm pond degradation it is essential to further couple the process based model and identify the

production and ecosystem services such as irrigation aquaculture flood regulation pollutant retention and biological habitat regulation chen et al 2019 cui et al 2022 the diversity and robustness of farm pond ecological functions are largely determined by water quality e g degree of eutrophication and are impacted by hydrological biogeochemical and anthropogenic aquatic terrestrial interactions hill et al 2021 however stressors such as rapid urbanization agricultural intensification and climate change have harmed ecosystem services in recent years therefore it is essential to understand the variations in water quality and the synergistic impacts of the pond s internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management in order to restore and enhance ecological service functions usio et al 2017 chen et al 2021 this understanding is also a prerequisite for establishing sustainable management practices to prevent degradation and damage of farm ponds ponds are usually regarded as pollution sinks due to the interception of surface runoff and the retention and removal of pollutants via sedimentation plant uptake microbial decomposition and sediment adsorption veraart et al 2011 sugiyama and hama 2013 usio el 2017 cui et al 2022 in the most intensive agricultural landscape in southern china a large amount of fertilizer input causes pollutants such as nitrogen n and phosphorus p to enter the ponds through hydrological processes chen et al 2019 the water quality of farm ponds on the other hand is more vulnerable to external stressors due to their limited volume shallow water depth and comparatively low pollutant dilution capacity hill et al 2021 also point source pollution like livestock farming aquaculture and domestic sewage accelerates nutrient enrichment in ponds however eutrophication can turn the pond from a pollutant sink in the surrounding landscape to a pollutant source in the downstream waters chen et al 2021 deterioration in water quality can potentially weaken the ecological service functions of ponds for instance a higher ammonia content increases water ph and is harmful to fish and invertebrates chen et al 2019 furthermore the water quality of farm ponds is vital for agricultural irrigation because it affects the quality of produce and may cause health concerns li et al 2020 as a result evaluating water quality variations not only serves to reveal the dynamic shifting of roles transformation of source sink pollution but also clarifies the current conditions of pond aquatic ecosystems to aid in the formulation of suitable management targets owing to the nonlinearity and complexities of water quality data which feature noise redundancy internal correlations and outliers nonlinear analysis techniques are generally required to simplify and cluster the data in order to achieve meaningful measurement evaluations li et al 2018 self organizing maps som in particular as an unsupervised clustering technique based on artificial neural networks is capable of extracting high dimensional characteristics of complicated data and is widely used in the clustering of varied ecological environment data vesanto and alhoniemi 2000 previous studies have confirmed that variations in water quality in farm ponds are regulated by internal characteristics such as water storage capacity water physicochemical properties vegetation and sediment lischeid et al 2018 chen et al 2021 external environmental factors such as meteorology landscape patterns topography and soil properties of the pond catchment usio et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 and agronomic management such as aquaculture irrigation and aquatic vegetation management li et al 2019 cui et al 2022 the relationships between water quality variations and the above characteristic variables can be extracted using various statistical methods such as multiple regression correlation analysis redundancy analysis mixed effect models and regression tree models complex interactions between characteristic factors and their synergistic effects on water quality are prevalent for example fertilization and irrigation may weaken or even obscure the correlation between land use and pond water quality li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 revealed that rainfall had a negative impact on pond water quality when coupled with impervious land use while dilution effects were observed when associated with water land use however these methods tend to focus on the relationship between predictors and responses which makes it difficult to detect the interaction between factors and potential influence paths therefore further studies and quantification methods are needed to appropriately depict multiple water quality impacts and reaction processes in farm ponds lischeid et al 2018 this study aimed to i examine the spatiotemporal variations of water quality in farm ponds in southern china ii identify the interactions and synergistic effects of the internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management on pond water quality variations and iii detect the key influencers and pathways to propose effective management practices to address these objectives we conducted monitoring and data collection for 39 typical farm ponds within an intensive agricultural landscape in the dongting lake basin using the following statistical approach a self organizing map som was first employed to identify variations in n and p concentrations in farm ponds then partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem was used to construct the influence paths of all variables on the variations followed by evaluation of the performance and significance of these influences as well as the consequences for rural planning and pond management the results of this study may aid in understanding pollution migration in catchments and fate in ponds as well as in identifying spatiotemporal pollution hotspots which can aid in management and conservation efforts in the context of farm pond water quality and ecological degradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in the jinjing river watershed 27 55 28 40 n 112 56 113 36 e which is the headwater of dongting lake in the middle reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 the study area has a typical subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and precipitation of 17 5 c and 1330 mm respectively 1979 2019 the rainy season april august accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation the terrain is rugged and hilly with an average slope of 17 6 and elevation of 136 m the soil is derived from quaternary red earth and highly weathered granite is rich in iron and aluminium oxides and can be classified as ferrosols and anthrosols the soil layer was thin averaging 1 8 2 0 m with high permeability in addition the depth of shallow groundwater is approximately 0 6 1 8 m the study watershed was in an intensive agricultural landscape that can represent the agricultural socio economic and natural conditions of the dongting lake basin the main land uses are agricultural land paddy field dry land and tea plantations forests ponds and residential land the forest is mainly composed of non commercial secondary masson pine pinus massoniana l woodlands and is mostly distributed on the hills agricultural land is mostly distributed in the valleys and floodplains along streams and is mainly used for planting double cropping rice vegetables and other crops that require high fertilizer inputs the average fertilizer application rate in paddy field was 250 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 65 kg p ha 1 yr 1 while in tea plantation it was 450 kg n ha 1 yr 1and 8 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 wang et al 2020 meng et al 2021 the study watershed 134 4 km2 contains more than 2000 ponds which were extracted from a 5 m resolution satellite image and are scattered around agricultural land villages and foothills most of these ponds are used to store rainwater and irrigate adjacent farmlands and tea plantations while some ponds near or within the villages are also used for collecting domestic sewage daily washing and aquaculture most ponds are relatively independent and are not connected by ditches or canals based on historical image data and field investigations 39 ponds were selected as sampling sites fig 1 these ponds have existed since the 1930 s and have not been blocked or deliberately destroyed by sludge the characteristics of these sample ponds and the land use within the catchment are provided in table s1 2 2 water and site parameters 2 2 1 landscape characteristics of pond catchment to obtain the landscape characteristics of the pond catchment the catchment boundaries were first extracted from digital elevation model dem data using arcgis 10 2 software esri redland ca usa and combined with the dinf algorithm tarboton 1997 then the land use vector data were converted to grids at a 5 m spatial resolution and the landscape composition of the catchment was identified topographic characteristics of the pond catchment such as average elevation and slope were extracted and calculated using the dem data referring to previous studies meng et al 2021 2022 ten commonly used landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape configuration at the catchment level table 1 these metrics can reflect the area edge shape aggregation and diversity of patches which have specific ecological significance and practical applications in landscape optimisation based on the digital raster maps the corresponding landscape metrics were calculated using the fragstats v4 2 program mcgarigal and marks 1995 2 2 2 sample collection and analysis water samples from 39 selected ponds were collected monthly from june 2017 to may 2018 to ensure the accuracy of the water quality water samples from the surface middle and bottom were obtained and blended from the centre and end of the pond water temperature temp ph dissolved oxygen do and redox potential eh were determined on site using an hq430 multiparameter meter hach loveland colorado usa pond depth depth was also measured water sample analysis was generally completed 24 h after collection otherwise the samples were stored at 18 c before the analysis the samples were thoroughly mixed and divided into equal parts part of the raw sample was used to determine the concentrations of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp the total suspended solids tss of the raw samples were determined using an ss 2z suspended solid sensor haizheng shanghai china the second aliquot was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane millipore sigma burlington massachusetts usa to determine the total dissolved nutrients including total dissolved nitrogen tdn total dissolved phosphorus tdp nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and soluble reactive phosphorus srp all the above water quality parameters were analysed following standard methods china epa 2002 in addition particulate nitrogen pn and particulate phosphorus pp were calculated from the differences between tn and tdn as well as tp and tdp similarly dissolved organic nitrogen don was calculated from the difference between tdn and dissolved inorganic n i e din no3 n no2 n nh4 n dissolved organic phosphorus dop was derived from the difference between tdp and srp according to the preset square grid sampling scheme sample site spacing of 50 100 m 1397 surface soil samples depth of 20 cm were collected to determine soil properties in the study watershed all samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve soil organic carbon soc was determined using the k2cr2o7 h2so4 oxidation titration method nelson and sommers 1983 total soil nitrogen tsn was determined using an automated flow injector system tecator fia star 5000 analyser foss tecator höganäs sweden after digestion with k2cr2o7 h2so4 total soil p tsp and available soil p olsen p were determined using the molybdenum antimony colorimetric method after h2so4 hclo4 digestion and nahco3 extraction respectively the spatial distribution of soil properties soc tsn olsen p and tsp and their molar ratios soil c to n ratio soil cnr soil c to p ratio soil cpr and soil n to p ratio soil npr were estimated using a geographically weighted regression gwr model fotheringham et al 1998 arcgis software was used to determine the area averaged soil properties in the pond catchment detailed information is listed in table 1 to collect meteorological data a standard and three micro weather stations intelment advantage dynamax inc usa were installed in the watershed fig 1 2 2 3 pond management pond management practices such as irrigation aquaculture and feeding were investigated at monthly intervals the survey showed that grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella was the main aquaculture fish and its management was extensive and the fish were only fed grass macrophytes were not observed in any of the ponds because of irrigation or aquaculture in addition since most ponds were dredged before monitoring sediment samples were not collected the descriptions and summary statistics of the management variables are presented in table 1 2 3 statistical analyses first spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to test the data independence of all sampling sites a som was developed to identify the spatiotemporal patterns of n and p concentrations based on the above results redundancy analysis rda and pls sem were deployed to link the variation of water n and p with pond internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management to identify the influence paths and key influencing factors the detailed procedure is as follows 2 3 1 spatial autocorrelation analysis as a correlation coefficient to measure overall spatial autocorrelation the global moran s i can measure the correlation in a signal among nearby locations in space with values between 1 and 1 moran 1950 a value of 1 or 1 indicates a negative or positive spatial autocorrelation respectively while a value of 0 indicates perfect randomness 2 3 2 self organizing map som as an unsupervised machine learning technique som can be used for efficient clustering and low dimensional typically two dimensional visualization of high dimensional target data while preserving the topology of the dataset kohonen 2001 similar to most artificial neural networks som is composed of an input layer and an outer layer and operates in two modes training i e competitive learning and mapping the implementation process of som can be summarized in two stages 1 training and mapping for visualization to show the relationship between data points and 2 clustering it subsequently first the input space with ρ dimensions defined as an input space with ρ variables is represented as a map space with two dimensions through iterative training in this study input data included tn pn no3 n no2 n nh4 n don tp pp srp and dop from 39 ponds over a 12 month period and the number of samples of each form n and p was 468 the map space consisted of n output neurons nodes which were arranged as a two dimensional hexagonal array the determination of the map space structure including the neuron number and ratio of the map side lengths is provided in the supplementary material text s1 second combined with the unified distance matrix u matrix and partitional clustering method i e k means algorithm the clustering boundaries of the som map were defined to obtain the subset information of the output neurons the above two methods determine the boundary and number of clusters according to the node colors on the map and the davies bouldin index dbi respectively davies and bouldin 1979 li et al 2018 generally the optimal cluster number is when the dbi index is minimal the som algorithm was performed using the som toolbox v2 1 http www cis hut fi projects somtoolbox for matlab which was developed by the laboratory of information and computer science helsinki university of technology 2 3 3 redundancy analysis rda first according to the verification results of the kolmogorov smirnov test log x 1 transformation of the data was performed to satisfy the normality hypothesis second the gradient axis was tested using detrended correspondence analysis dca to determine the use of rda or canonical correlation analysis cca van den wollenberg 1977 since the gradient axis was 3 0 rda was selected to explore the impact of characterization indicators of internal factors external environment and agronomic management on the variations in pond water n and p concentrations the results are expressed as biplots where the effect of the influencing factors on n and p variations was evaluated by the angle and length of the arrows the above analyses were performed using canoco 5 0 software microcomputer power company ithaca ny usa 2 3 4 partial least squares structural equation modeling pls sem as a distinct method for analysing composite based path models pls sem was used to analyse the complex interrelationships between pond water quality i e n and p concentrations and other latent variables i e landscape composition configuration topography management soil meteorology and water physicochemical properties the indicators selected by rda were developed as measurements for the latent variables the main reason for choosing pls sem is that this study aims to explore the complex relationship between latent variables that have never been tested previously in addition the model exhibits favorable behavior in dealing with complex model structures and multicollinearity of indicators and does not need to impose distributional assumptions on the data e g normal distribution hair et al 2019 the path model containing all potential variables was tested and constructed the smartpls 3 3 3 software ringle et al 2015 first the internal consistency reliability indicator reliability convergent validity and discriminant validity of the measurement model were tested using the criteria indices including cronbach s alpha ca composite reliability cr indicator loadings average variance extracted ave and heterotrait monotrait ratio htmt the statistical significance standard errors and p values of the model path coefficients was then evaluated using the fitting distribution generated by bootstrapping 5000 re samples the predictive relevance of the endogenous variables was subsequently assessed using the coefficients of determination r 2 and predictive relevance q 2 additionally the overall prediction performance of the structural model was estimated using global goodness of fit gof the specific assessment criteria for the above indices are provided in table s2 based on the pls sem results an importance performance map analysis ipma was conducted to identify the importance and performance of all indicators in explaining the dependent variables i e n and p concentrations the importance value was calculated from the total effect of the indicator on the structure of the dependent variable the performance value was derived from the indicators mean value of the rescaled data with a value of 100 indicating the highest performance ringle and sarstedt 2016 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal variation of n and p concentrations during the study period the global moran s i value was 0 002 0 287 p 0 062 0 864 indicating that the water n and p of the sample ponds showed random and weak spatial autocorrelation table s3 therefore the proximity of sample sites due to the small watershed scale does not interfere with the identification of spatiotemporal variation in n and p concentrations according to the determining criterion of minimising qe and te and avoiding a large number of empty neurons 112 14 8 neurons were the optimal structure of the som table s4 following the optimal structure the component plane of the 10 som variables is displayed in fig 2a through the visual investigation of color gradients all n and p forms showed a clear tendency that is high values appeared in the lower regions and gradually decreased upward however the slight difference is that the maximum values of all forms of n are concentrated in the lower right corner while the high values of all forms of p except srp were distributed in the lower corner of both sides fig 2a these results indicated that there was a strong positive correlation between the parameters of all n and p forms and the spatiotemporal patterns of different n or p forms were consistent based on the cluster boundaries generated by the u matrix fig 2a and the minimum value of the dbi fig 2b the neuron units on the map were classified into five clusters fig 2c to reduce the influence of outliers medians were used instead of means to evaluate similarities and differences among clusters the numerical characteristics of the variables in each cluster median quartile range outliers and extreme values are presented in fig 3 the results showed significant differences between clusters for each variable table s5 specifically the median n tn pn no3 n no2 n nh4 n and don and srp concentrations in cluster v were significantly higher than those in the other clusters whereas clusters iii and v had significantly higher p tp pp and dop concentrations p 0 05 the concentrations of dissolved inorganic n din and p srp in clusters i iv were low and no3 n and nh4 n showed no significant differences between clusters to parse the spatiotemporal characteristics the variables of the above clusters were traced back to their original sampling times and sites fig 4 shows the spatial patterns of pond water quality pond water samples in the northern area of the watershed mostly belonged to cluster i and ii clusters iii iv and v were primarily sampled in the southern region in the ponds of commercial tea plantations in the southwest region pond nos 2 6 7 8 and 9 clusters iv and v accounted for more than 50 of the total samples using various period division criteria i e hydrology farming and meteorology season for temporal grouping the five clusters temporal patterns are shown in fig 5 approximately 72 66 of the samples in cluster i belonged to the planting or dry season with the primary overlapping period being rain planting summer and dry planting autumn with increasing cluster number the proportion of samples in the dry and fallow seasons increased gradually and around 83 of samples in cluster v were at the intersection of the dry and fallow seasons notably for cluster ⅲ with significantly higher p concentrations the fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring periods accounted for the same percentage of the total 3 2 relationship between n p variation and influencing factors the rda results revealed that various pond internal external and agronomic management characterization indicators had significant effects on the variations in water n and p table s6 as shown in fig 6 as the representation factors of landscape composition percentage agricultural land agri and percentage residential land resi were positively correlated with the variations in water n and p whereas percentage forest land forest only had a significant negative impact on n concentrations for landscape configuration the metrics of the largest patch index lpi and contagion index contag had negative effects on n and p this indicates that the greater the fragmentation and dispersion of patches in the pond catchment the greater the n and p concentrations in the water in agronomic management fish farming can significantly increase n and p concentrations whereas irrigation has the opposite effect in terms of water physicochemical properties only water temperature and depth exhibited significant negative effects that is a decrease in water depth and temperature led to an increase in n and p concentrations in addition catchment soil properties only had significant effects on water p concentrations with tsp and soil cpr having positive and negative effects respectively rain was significantly negatively correlated with all forms of n and p except for pp 3 3 validation and evaluation of the structural model factors that significantly influenced both n and p concentrations were employed as indicators to describe the linked latent variables based on the rda results based on previous studies boardman et al 2019 li et al 2019 chen et al 2021 liu et al 2021 shen et al 2021 we hypothesized that landscape composition soil and water physicochemical properties and management have direct effects on n and p concentrations while topography landscape configuration and meteorology have a hierarchical effect on n and p concentrations via paths of the above variables the model s validation findings revealed that all the criterion indices including ca cr ave and htmt were within the standard range suggesting that the measurement models were valid and reliable table s7 the r 2 and q 2 of n and p variables were 0 54 and 0 35 respectively and the integrated model s gof values were 0 65 indicating that the model had a moderate ability to interpret and predict the variations of n and p concentrations fig 7 3 4 influence path and importance of factors on n and p concentrations the p values standard errors and path coefficients were generated by bootstrapping with 5000 subsamples to verify hypothetical paths fig 7 the results showed that the latent variables of landscape composition soil and pond management had significant positive direct effects on the n and p concentrations p 0 001 while the effects of pond physicochemical properties were the opposite β n 0 27 β p 0 28 p 0 001 for external environmental factors landscape composition and soil had multi mediation effects and they both fully mediated the effects of topography and configuration on n and p concentrations similarly physicochemical properties acted as mediators between meteorology and n and p concentrations in addition meteorology positively moderated the paths of soil p and composition n p β 0 11 0 16 and 0 09 p 0 001 indicating that meteorology intensifies the effect of soil and land use on n and p concentrations for example for every additional standard deviation of meteorology the slope of the soil to p concentrations will increase by 0 11 standard deviations table 2 presents the total effects between each latent variable and n and p concentrations calculated from the sum of the direct and indirect effects the results showed that the total effects of landscape composition on n and p concentrations were higher than those of the other latent variables in addition the total effect of soil on p concentration was the lowest among all latent variables furthermore the importance performance diagrams fig 8 developed by the ipma revealed that agri resi and rain were the primary indicators affecting n and p concentrations however their performance was slightly below average when compared to other indicators the depth carried a similar importance but had a considerably higher performance however fish farming had the highest performance values despite having medium importance scores 4 discussion using a combination of som and pls sem this study evaluated the effects of pond internal characteristics external environmental factors and agronomic management on water n and p variations the results from typical farm ponds in subtropical southern china showed that there were interactive effects mediation and moderation effects between pond internal characteristics and external environmental factors and that a synergistic effect with agronomic management resulted in spatiotemporal variability of n and p concentrations in the following sections we discuss the following 1 the interaction of the influencing factors and their impact on pond n and p variations 2 the transition in landscape source and sink function caused by variability in pollution status and 3 management strategies to enhance pond ecological functions by improving water quality 4 1 influence of internal characteristics external environments and agronomic management in theory pond nutrient dynamics are determined simultaneously by catchment environment internal characteristics and agronomic management the results of pls sem analyses revealed that the synergistic effect of both within pond and external processes could explain 60 2 2 9 and 54 2 3 1 of the n and p variations respectively fig 7 confirming the above perspective the external environment primarily determines the input of nutrients into the pond as external environmental representation variables selected by the unrestricted permutation test landscape composition agri and resi configuration lpi and contag topography elevation and slope and soil chemical properties tsp and soil cpr were strongly correlated with n and p concentrations landscape composition directly or indirectly determines the input of nutrients to the receiving waters previous studies have identified fertilizer runoff and domestic sewage as major sources of n and p pollution in rural water bodies li et al 2018 chen et al 2021 meng et al 2021 this is consistent with our findings that is the quantification of land composition through agri and resi reflects n and p input densities it should be pointed out that tea plantations were classified as agricultural land owing to non negligible n and p contributions where local farmers tend to apply excessive fertilizer to ensure yields 450 kg n ha 1 yr 1 and 8 5 kg p ha 1 yr 1 meng et al 2021 meanwhile the abrupt reduction in vegetation coverage aggravates the erosion and loss of soil n and p zhang et al 2020 residential land exhibited the same importance as agricultural land despite its smaller area percentage fig 8 this is due to the lack of unified sewage collection and treatment facilities or poor maintenance of existing facilities in the rural areas of subtropical hilly regions in china thus farm ponds assume the role of domestic sewage collection especially during the dry season and fallow period ongley et al 2010 landscape configuration can not only reflect land use features but also weight nutrient loadings by altering hydrological processes boardman et al 2019 the rda results indicated that the fragmentation and dispersion of patches at the landscape level i e catchment scale increased pond n and p concentrations fig 6 generally landscape configuration features at the landscape level are mostly determined by dominant land use the increase in patch fragmentation and dispersion in the forest dominated catchment indicates that the disturbance of human activities is more disruptive to nature forcing the natural ecosystem to shift toward the agricultural type buyantuyev et al 2010 meng et al 2021 in addition fragmented and scattered patches are more susceptible to soil erosion resulting in nutrient migration and loss of surface runoff particularly in the particulate form this was clearly reflected in the configuration composition soil p concentration path fig 7 soil serves as a source sink and transport medium for nutrients from catchments to the receiving ponds although soil tsn was negatively correlated with n concentration it was not significant in the unrestricted permutation test p 0 05 and could not be used to construct latent variables in addition the total effect of the soil variables was lower than that of the other variables table 2 this might be attributed to nutrient deposition retention and removal in front ditch networks weakening the relationship between soil properties and pond n and p collins et al 2016 shen et al 2021 interestingly both tsp and soil cpr were significantly associated with pond p concentrations ecosystem stoichiometric ratios reflect the severity of autotrophic nutrient constraints and the degree of heterotrophic nutrient limitation sterner and elser 2017 these ratios can affect the water quality given that the c p ratio of decomposable organic matter is normally negatively related to its decomposition rate constant zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 our findings indicate that pond p input may be closely related to soil organic matter decomposition the effects of topography on pond n and p concentrations were mediated by landscape patterns and soil according to pls sem findings this is consistent with the hypothesis that topography constrains landscape patterns and regulates the geographical distribution of soil through energy and matter redistribution liu et al 2021 as we observed paddy fields and residential land usually accounted for a larger proportion of the total area in pond catchments with low elevation and gentle terrain while forests were mostly distributed in high elevation regions consequently farm ponds located near streams in lowland areas are more susceptible to n and p pollution a special case is the ponds at the foot of tea plantations which serve as hotspots for particulate nutrients by slowing water velocity and trapping sediments meng et al 2021 according to the total effect results in table 2 pond intrinsic characteristics e g water physicochemical properties also have a significant regulatory effect on n and p concentrations the importance and performance of water depth in the model fig 8 indicate that the enrichment or dilution effects caused by changes in water volume have a significant impact on n and p concentrations meanwhile the relatively high water depth is conducive to resisting external hydrologic disturbance and bioturbation activities of fish avoiding an increase in nutrient content due to sediment resuspension usio el 2017 zhang et al 2020 although water temperature is negatively correlated with n and p concentrations their respective regulatory mechanisms are different for example temperature affects microbial enzymatic activity which is crucial for n conversion and degradation veraart et al 2011 in particular during the colder winter months biological processes are restricted leading to net accumulation of nutrients in the pond zhang et al 2020 simultaneously temperature can regulate the p concentration by influencing the deposition process a higher temperature enhances the adsorption of po4 p onto sediments sugiyama and hama 2013 rainfall indirectly affected the transit and fate of n and p from terrene to receiving ponds through the mediation of internal characteristics and its regulation of external environments the positive regulation of rainfall on the soil p and composition n and p paths in the model reflects that rainfall is the main trigger of nps in particular soil p loss is more sensitive to rainfall for instance tsp loss on tea plantation slopes would be aggravated by intense rainfall events which is consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2020 rainfall has a significantly more complicated impact on the tn in ponds because it can activate complex biogeochemical processes for example although rain can trigger n loss it can also facilitate biogeochemical n removal in ponds by providing anaerobic conditions for denitrification or by enhancing n processing in microbial active zones liao et al 2016 this is evidenced by the low tn peak of the yearly trends in wet years bachmair et al 2012 furthermore owing to the dilution effect caused by the increased water volume rainfall seems to have an adverse effect on pond n and p concentrations in general as shown in table 2 the total effect of rainfall on n and p concentrations was 0 18 and 0 19 respectively pond n and p concentrations are directly influenced not only by terrestrial sources but also by agronomic management such as aquaculture or intermittent pumping for irrigation li et al 2019 from the perspective of water resources and nutrient cycling irrigation provides an efficient pathway for recycling and n and p removal yin and shah 2001 and pond p appears to be more sensitive to pumping processes based on the model results fig 8 in earlier studies of the liuchahe watershed the total mass of tp reclaimed from ponds by irrigation surpassed 70 kg yr 1 indicating that irrigation is an effective p recycling strategy yin and shah 2001 in this study the number of irrigation applications during the rice growing season was normally 4 8 times however because most ponds also feature aquaculture a single pumping usually does not exceed 30 of the pond capacity to satisfy the water level of aquaculture as a result irrigation rarely leads to a significant increase in pond n and p concentrations caused by the enrichment effect the highest performance scores of fish farming indicate that aquaculture has the potential to degrade water quality although most managers did not purposefully provide artificial feed to grass carp ctenopharyngodon idella they applied human and livestock excrement to promote fish growth in summary the n and p concentrations in ponds changed as a result of a mixture of internal and external influences and focusing on a single factor may overlook the mixing effects of other critical variables distorting the results 4 2 spatiotemporal patterns of water quality identifying the pollution status and seasonal hotspots of n and p in farm ponds can provide critical information about their contributions to sink and source impacts on the contamination status of downstream water bodies refined catchment management and pollution reduction chen et al 2021 cui et al 2022 som analysis highlighted n and p status except for cluster ⅰ the average tn concentration 2 97 mg l 1 in the remaining four clusters exceeded the threshold of level v surface water quality 2 00 mg l 1 china epa 2002 while p status tp 0 34 mg l 1 pp 0 22 mg l 1 exhibited similar degradation in comparison to comparable ponds in germany tn and tp 50 quantiles of 1 96 and 0 24 mg l 1 lischeid et al 2018 france tn and tp averaged 1 32 and 0 27 mg l 1 respectively wezel et al 2013 and japan tn and tp averaged 1 32 and 0 13 mg l 1 respectively usio et al 2017 our data exemplify the substantial pollution risks of farm ponds affected by intensive agriculture and humid subtropical climates in central south china additionally there was high intra annual heterogeneity in the water n and p in the pond with high n levels mainly appearing in the fallow dry winter period and high p levels typically occurring in both the fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring periods spatially high n and p levels tended to occur in ponds with a high proportion of agricultural and residential land ponds with commercial tea plantations were spatiotemporal hotspots of n pollution risk due to the local nitrogen application pattern that is substantial amounts of base fertilizer were applied from november to march to ensure spring tea production generally ponds with strong nutrient removal and interception capacities are regarded as pollution sinks cui et al 2022 since farm ponds are generally in critical source areas and have hydrological connections to the river network significant spatiotemporal variability would result in periodic source sink reversals in which they would become the source of nutrients in downstream water during the high n and p levels chen et al 2021 due to the low groundwater table during the fallow dry winter period the combination of bottom percolation and lateral seepage could lead to the diffusion of high n and p concentrations in pond water into groundwater or aquifers and migration downstream through baseflow muendo et al 2005 in addition the fact that particulate p was the main form of p in this period implies that more dissolved p may have been lost with the percolation water from the ponds zhang et al 2020 it should be noted that pond p hotspots are also prone to occur during the planting rain spring period while the model results suggested that a combination of dilution agronomic management i e pumping irrigation and biogeochemistry could generally counteract the adverse impacts of rainfall driven p loss in the catchment on pond water quality strong pulse inputs caused by storm flow during overlapping periods of planting and rainy seasons can still significantly increase pond p concentrations in particular precipitation shortly following fertilization can significantly increase the risk of catchment p especially pp and dop movement king et al 2015 4 3 implications for management as a biological physicochemical and ecological hotspot in the catchment improving water quality through management practices is critical for the restoration and enhancement of farm pond ecological functions usio et al 2017 shen et al 2021 the model results revealed that pond management should be performed at both within pond and catchment scales the considerable effects of agri and resi on pond water imply that nutrient input should be minimized by restricting agricultural expansion e g prohibiting the massive conversion of forests to tea plantations and strengthening domestic sewage treatment fig 8 given the protection of farmland in china the development of environmentally friendly farming precise agronomic management and the establishment of best management practices e g buffer strips on preferred hydrological pathways can achieve the same benefit as decreasing agri within pond management should prioritize fish farming and water depth variations according to ipma it is challenging to improve water quality by banning aquaculture unless the needs of stakeholders are met thus it is essential to explore ways to compensate farmers for revenue loss by endowing farm ponds with new functions and economic value such as increasing biodiversity and recreational functions chen et al 2019 recycling irrigation can be used during the rice season it permits nutrient water in the pond rice system to stay in the fields more frequently while preserving the pond water depth li et al 2020 simultaneously the large soil water interface of the rice field facilitates sedimentation and denitrification in addition a previous study revealed that macrophytes play an important role in maintaining clear water in shallow ponds through absorption suppression of sediment resuspension and denitrification usio et al 2017 therefore regular planting and harvesting of macrophytes should be incorporated into pond management practices 5 conclusions as rural landscapes are widely distributed in the subtropics of china farm ponds profoundly affect the hydrology and nutrient cycles in the catchment but are faced with the elimination of ecological functions caused by water quality degradation the results indicated that the 39 monitoring farm ponds had high pollution risk and spatiotemporal variability of n and p and that they may reverse from sinks to sources of pollutants during the overlapping periods of fallow dry winter and planting rainy spring based on the constructed sem model there were interacting effects mediation and moderation effects between the pond internal characteristics and external environmental factors and synergistic effect with agronomic management explained 60 2 2 9 and 54 2 3 1 of the n and p variations respectively the total effects of landscape composition on the variations of n and p were higher than those of other latent variables while agricultural and residential area percentage rainfall water depth and fish farming were relatively important among all indicators these findings provide new insights into the mechanisms driving nitrogen and phosphorus variations in farm ponds and can be used as guidance for farm pond management in similar agricultural and geo climatic situations the limitation of this study is that the pond internal characteristics were only defined by the physical and chemical parameters of the water body and other elements such as sediment phytoplankton and macroinvertebrates were not incorporated similarly indicator characterization of external environmental factors and agronomic management can be improved additionally to repair farm pond degradation it is essential to further couple the process based model and identify the

9243,assessing and optimizing crop management strategies e g irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization is critical for the sustainable production of crops currently crop simulation models combined with experimental data have been proved to be effective tools herein the fao aquacrop model was calibrated and validated based on field measured data during two consecutive growing seasons 2020 and 2021 for predicting canopy cover cc aboveground biomass and soil water content swc mm on a daily scale and for simulating final fruit yield evapotranspiration et mm and water productivity wp kg m 3 on a seasonal scale under plastic film mulch condition the two year experiment included three irrigation levels 60 80 and 100 et0 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration and five n fertilizer rates 0 180 270 360 and 450 kg n ha 1 in general the aquacrop model adequately simulated the dynamic changes of cherry tomato cc aboveground biomass and final fruit yield nonetheless the model severely overestimated swc especially under full irrigation in the two year experiment and the simulation accuracy gradually increased with the increase of n rate for et it was largely underestimated with the decrease in irrigation level and n rate the simulation accuracy improved and the impact of water stress was stronger than that of nitrogen stress the simulation accuracy of wp decreased as irrigation level and n rate increased the optimal integrated regime was deficit irrigation of 80 et0 combined with n rate of 360 kg ha 1 i80n360 which obtained 98 24 of potential yield while significantly decreasing water input the simulation of the mulched module and parameters of the aquacrop model crop transpiration water productivity etc should be further optimized and verified if these improvements can be made the aquacrop model can be used in the decision making of irrigation and n fertilization strategies of cherry tomato under plastic film mulch condition keywords aquacrop cherry tomato canopy cover aboveground biomass soil water content 1 introduction the rapid rise of global population increased the demand of horticultural crop production in many countries and regions erkossa and seleshi 2010 gorjian et al 2021 greenhouse cultivation expanded in recent decades is widely considered one of the sustainable solutions to ensure food security even in adverse weather conditions castilla 2013 nishad and krupa 2022 however greenhouse industry as a high water fertilizers and energy input sector is currently facing severe challenges to increase global production with the goal of reducing energy and different resources inputs marcelis et al 2019 cherry tomato is a popular horticultural crop that is economically productive nutritious and tasty tieman et al 2017 which is widely grown in china united states and southern europe mostly under greenhouse conditions mori et al 2008 water and n are critical factors restricting crop growth and ultimately determining crop production li et al 2021 therefore for better crop yields and economic profitability farmers empirically provide excessive water and fertilizer for cherry tomato however the spread of cherry tomato cultivation combined with relatively high water demand and water deficit sensitivity raises the issue of water resources shortage especially in arid and semi arid areas at the same time the excessive application of n fertilizer beyond the crop demand and low fertilizer utilization efficiency causes undesirable consequences such as soil acidification guo et al 2010 leaching of nitrogen into groundwater min et al 2012 thompson et al 2020 and emission of nitrous oxide he et al 2009 in the context of increasing water scarcity and the spread of non point source pollution from irrational fertilization application finding sustainable ways to improve crop water and fertilizer productivity is increasing important in greenhouse system deficit irrigation is commonly considered a valuable strategy to manage soil moisture for crop production wu et al 2022b in addition the drip fertigation system can significantly promote crop n uptake increase n use efficiency and reduce the loss of soil no3 n and the risk of no3 n moving to deeper soil layers chilundo et al 2017 wang et al 2018 to date researchers have optimized deficit irrigation and n application on tomato cammarano et al 2020 hu et al 2021 li et al 2021 volpi et al 2022 wu et al 2022 accordingly scientific and rational management of water and n fertilizer is essential for cherry tomato to enhance crop yields with minimal water and fertilizer inputs however although field experiment studies explaining the effects of experimental factors on crop growth could be designed problems such as the thorough understanding of the crop responses of experimental factors during the whole growth season and the high cost and time consuming still restrict the measurement considering such limitations the combination of crop simulation models with experimental data have proved to be a persuasive tool for low cost and efficient understanding of the interactions in experimental factors araya et al 2016 li et al 2018 van gaelen et al 2015 hereby many crop growth simulation models of different complexities have been increasingly developed and applied as companies provide support tools based on simulation and prediction using experimental data abedinpour 2021 körner 2019 viz aquacrop raes et al 2009 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 dessat jones et al 2003 wofost de wit et al 2019 and apsim keating et al 2003 these crop simulation models could well simulate the responses of crops to various environmental conditions and management scenarios feng et al 2022 in comparison to other models the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 proposed by fao seem particularly attractive to estimate crop cc biomass as well as final yield under varied water inputs feng et al 2022 and optimize irrigation strategies in varied climatic environments owing to its balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness abi saab et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2015a nowadays many studies have been conducted to estimate aquacrop performance on crop growth yield and soil water available to facilitate farm management ahmadi et al 2015a ran et al 2018 for example amiri 2016 tested the integrated strategies of water and nitrogen fertilization for rice by aquacrop and found a satisfactory result between predicted and observed grain yield and biomass similarly abedinpour 2021 tested aquacrop model for wheat under water nitrogen interactions and found a good agreement between the field observed and model simulated soil water content at 30 cm soil depth and the predicted grain and biomass yield under moderate water stressed conditions were more accurate than those under full or rainfed conditions palumbo et al 2012 and katerji et al 2013 reported an acceptable result between the simulated evapotranspiration and measured values in tomato under full irrigation in conclusion although aquacrop performed well in simulating the process of crop growth its performance varied considerably from many factors such as local climate and soil data field management parameters crop parameters and initial boundary conditions of the experiment because aquacrop is a water driven simulation model many previous studies mainly focused on the model validation and parameter optimization under various water deficit regimes while the results validation of fertilization regimes was minimal in addition aquacrop has its own coverage module but the initial consideration of agricultural coverage and farming technology is insufficient the soil temperature module is also missing which is largely affected by the film mulching to date there has been few model simulation and verification of different irrigation and n fertilizer regimes on greenhouse vegetables under plastic film mulching condition based on aquacrop model therefore taking the high cost and time consuming field researches and the variability of aquacrop due to different experimental conditions into consideration the purposes was to 1 calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for greenhouse cherry tomato by field observed data under different water and n fertilizer regimes 2 evaluate the performance of aquacrop in simulating the effects of the integrated strategies of film mulched drip irrigation amount and n rates on soil water storage cc aboveground biomass and final fruit yield 3 find out the optimal integrated regimes of water and n regimes for greenhouse cherry tomato under film mulched drip fertigation scenarios 4 determine the effectiveness and limitations of the model in practical applications to provide guidance for the application of the model in greenhouse crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 greenhouse experimental description a two year greenhouse cherry tomato pink rose m 2 experiment was conducted during the spring summer growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 at the experimental station of northwest a f university located in yangling 34 20 n 108 04 e at an elevation of 521 m shaanxi province northwest china this cultivar a hybrid variety has quite good characteristics including high temperature resistance cold resistance and overall good resistance the detailed greenhouse weather conditions during the two growing seasons are shown in fig 1 the chemical properties of the 0 60 cm soil are as follow soil texture silty clay loam field capacity 25 mass moisture content permanent wilting point 8 5 mass

nitrogen 78 0 mg kg 1 total nitrogen 0 85 g kg 1 available phosphorus 21 7 mg kg 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was a 3 5 three irrigation levels and five n rates factorial design with a randomized block replicated two times the irrigation levels included 100 et0 i100 80 et0 i80 and 60 et0 i60 where et0 was the reference evapotranspiration the n rates consisted of 450 kg n ha 1 n450 360 kg n ha 1 n360 270 kg n ha 1 n270 180 kg n ha 1 n180 and 0 kg n ha 1 n0 each experiment plot was 1 25 m wide and 6 m long cherry tomato was transplanted with both row and plant spacing of 40 cm on 18th march in 2020 and 9th march in 2021 and the harvest date was 29th june in 2020 and 2nd july in 2021 before treating all treatments received the same irrigation amount 25 mm to ensure the survival rate of seedlings in this study the irrigation interval was appropriately seven days and the amounts were determined according to et0 calculated by the modified penman monteith equation as described in chen et al 2007 the treatments event was achieved through drip irrigation tubes drip tube agrifim in line emitters 2 l h 1 spaced 0 3 m and drip fertilization equipment the equipment was mainly composed of water pump rotary wing water meter proportional fertilization pump and water transmission and distribution piping system etc and was controlled by hydraulic proportional fertilization pump device for fertilizer all phosphate fertilizer 180 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 40 of the total potassium fertilizer 120 kg ha 1 k2o were integrated to the topsoil about 20 cm before transplanting the remaining potassium fertilizer 180 kg ha 1 k2o and all n fertilizer urea were applied as topdressing fertilizer the specific dates of irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 1 except for irrigation and fertilization others agronomic managements weed pest control pollination and so on were the same following the local practices each plant kept four ears of cherry tomato fruits 2 3 plant sampling and calculations the actual evapotranspiration et was estimated using a simplified soil water balance formula lhomme and katerji 1991 et δw i where i is the irrigation amount mm and δ w is the difference in soil water storage in the 0 50 cm soil profile mm wp was calculated as the ratio of total dry fruit yield to et deng et al 2013 the red ripen fruits from the first to the fourth truss were harvested in sequence from six marked plants in each treatment the total yield was determined from the average yield per plant and planting density soil samples under the dripper 20 cm and 40 cm horizontally from the dripper were collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 50 cm using an auger on the day before each irrigation event in each treatment the gravimetric swc was determined by the oven drying method and its value for each treatment was taken from the average of swc at the same depth at the three sampling points thereafter the volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying gravimetric swc with the corresponding soil bulk density furthermore the swc of each treatment was also measured by trime installed horizontally into the soil under the dripper 20 cm and 40 cm from the dripper between each irrigation event which was calibrated by measuring the gravimetric swc the aboveground dry biomass and leaf area index lai cm2 cm 2 were monitored six times throughout the growing season which was 23 43 57 70 84 103 days after transplanting in 2020 and 30 47 61 75 88 115 days after transplanting in 2021 on each sampling date three representative plants per treatment were collected to obtain the in season aboveground dry biomass hereafter the plant was dismembered and each organ was over dried at 105 for 0 5 h and then at 60 until constant weight the fruit dry biomass was the sum of dry fruits on the sampling day and the accumulation of harvested dry fruits before the sampling date the leaf area was also determined with the punch weighing method qiao 2002 and lai was the ratio of total leaf area to the occupied land area watson 1947 subsequently canopy cover cc was converted by the lai data using the following formula hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 2 4 model description the aquacrop model developed by the fao is a widely used water driven crop model which simulates crop yield and biomass in response to water based on a function of water consumption raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the deficit status in the model could be presented by limited canopy expansion accelerated canopy senescence stomata closure alternated harvest index and water productivity huang et al 2022 daily crop transpiration tr mm day 1 is separated from et0 mm day 1 by cc values see eq 2 soon afterwards the aboveground biomass agb t ha 1 is converted in this model from tr using the normalized water productivity wp g m 2 see eq 3 wellens et al 2022 crop yield y t ha 1 is calculated from final aboveground biomass and harvest index hi see eq 4 2 tr k s cc k c et 0 3 agb wp i 1 n t ri et 0 i 4 y hi agb where wp is the water productivity normalized for et0 and air co2 concentration g m 2 tri and et0i are the crop transpiration mm day 1 and reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 of the ith day ks is the soil water stress coefficient cc is the canopy cover adjusted for microadvection kc is the coefficient for crop transpiration mm raes et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 meanwhile a semi quantitative method was adopted in the model to determine the expected effects of soil fertility stress on crop biomass production huang et al 2022 2 5 model parameterization calibration validation in aquacrop model the input weather parameters such as daily maximum and minimum air temperature were directly obtained from an automatic weather station located in the greenhouse the et0 was calculated in advance through the corrected penman monteith equation by chen et al 2007 using the acquired meteorological data and then directly put into the model the co2 file was built with the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp4 5 provided by the model obviously it was not possible to measure all the data so some default values or data provided by the model were selected for these parameters the irrigation and fertilization timing and amounts are shown in table 1 regarding the crop file it consisted of two parts of parameters including conservative and non conservative types table 2 among them the conservative parameters were relatively stable with slight changes in time management practices and geographic locations and their values were all provided in the model reference manual for tomato montoya et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2019 in contrast the non conservative parameters varied significantly with the year site and variety and were determined by the experiment the model could be run in growth degree day or calendar day mode and the calendar day mode was adopted the crop phonological period data input during the parameter calibration process is critical to accurately assessing of the crop development therefore dates of main phonological stages of the i100n360 treatment non stressed were detailed observed during the two growing seasons and directly put into the model necessarily these parameters were further fine tuned by the trial and error method until the simulated value of the canopy cover and biomass resembled the fitted values several important parameters such as wp reference harvest index hi0 soil water stress parameters and so on were adjusted by the trial and error method within the range of value provided by the manual and adjusted basing i100n360 treatment non stressed raes et al 2009 additionally fertility stress parameters were calibrated using field data from five n fertilizer treatments under full irrigation treatments i100 in 2021 table 3 data from the other treatments in 2021 and from all treatments in 2020 were used for model validation some default parameters included in the manual were adopted directly moreover the specific process of parameters tuning refers to vanuytrecht et al 2014 2 6 model performance evaluation there were five statistical indicators used to evaluate the aquacrop model performance during the calibration and validation including coefficient of determination r2 willmott index of agreement d root mean squared error rmse normalized root men square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef 6 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 8 nrmse 100 o rmse 9 ef 1 i 1

simulated and observed values respectively the closer r2 and d values were to 1 and the closer rmse and nrmse values were to 0 the better agreement between the simulated and observed data the simulation effect was divided into excellent good acceptable and poor when the nrmse was less than 10 from 10 to 20 from 20 to 30 and greater than 30 jamieson et al 1991 the values of the ef ranged from negative infinity to 1 ef 1 indicated a perfect fit while ef 0 suggested the model was only as accurate as the mean of the observed data and ef 0 suggested the mean of the observed data was a better prediction than the model ran et al 2018 3 results 3 1 canopy cover in the two experiment years the dynamic of cc throughout the growing season across all treatments was similar fig 2 moreover aquacrop could well capture the trend of cc development under all treatments as shown in high r2 0 94 d 0 97 and ef 0 85 values and low nrmse 4 5 nrmse 15 7 and rmse 2 6 rmse 6 7 table 4 specifically the simulation accuracy of full irrigation level i100 was slightly better than that of the other deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 in 2021 however in 2020 the simulation accuracy of all treatments showed no significant difference similarly the model had a relatively better simulation performance under high n fertilizer treatments than that of the low n fertilizer treatments in 2021 in contrast the differences among various n fertilizer treatments were negligible in 2020 the maximum cc occurred appropriately 70 days after transplanting in 2020 which was about 5 days earlier than that in 2021 largely due to the shortened growth period resulting from higher air temperature obviously the model simulated cc quite precisely in 2021 while there was overestimation during the validation 2020 one of the observed discrepancies was a slight underestimation cc until appropriately 30 and 43 days after transplanting in 2020 and 2021 respectively 3 2 aboveground biomass the simulated and actual development of aboveground biomass in all treatments were in high agreement with high r2 0 94 d 0 96 and ef 0 85 values and low values of nrmse 9 7 nrmse 27 1 and rmse 0 3 t ha 1 nrmse 1 3 t ha 1 table 4 however aquacrop slightly underestimated aboveground biomass in all treatments at the mid season stage fig 3 by comparing various irrigation treatments the simulation accuracy increased with the decreasing irrigation level with regard to the performance of aquacrop in simulating aboveground biomass at different n fertilizer application rates the discrepancies between field observed and model simulated values decreased with the decrease of n fertilizer application rates 3 3 soil water content the whole trends of the field observed and model simulated swc under varying irrigation and n fertilizer levels were basically consistent fig 4 however in general swc had a poor impact on the simulation capability and the statistical indicators of swc ranged from 6 50 mm to 33 2 mm rmse from 5 7 to 27 8 nrmse from 0 22 to 0 94 r2 except for i100n0 from 0 27 to 0 92 d and from 19 69 to 0 63 ef table 4 by comparing the various irrigation treatments the severe deficit irrigation treatment i60 had a better simulation performance as indicated by higher r2 0 42 0 94 d 0 76 0 92 and lower rmse 7 1 mm 11 3 mm nrmse 6 6 10 the highest simulation error in swc was observed in full irrigation treatments i100 than that of other water deficient treatments i80 and i60 during the two growing seasons at mid season and late season growth stages the model gradually overestimated the swc values in full irrigation treatment i100 in 2020 and 2021 and the whole stage of medium water stress treatment i80 in 2020 however the simulations of other water stress treatments were relatively satisfactory in 2021 however there was a general overestimation trend in swc in the severe deficit irrigation treatment i60 in 2020 at early and mid season stages and an underestimation at the late season stage for the n fertilizer treatments the simulation accuracy gradually increased as the nitrogen rate increased the best simulation performance occurred in n450 treatment 0 62 r2 0 85 0 71 d 0 88 0 13 ef 0 28 and 6 9 mm rmse 10 2 mm 5 9 nrmse 9 4 in 2021 and n360 treatment 0 42 r2 0 83 0 50 d 0 75 5 19 ef 0 97 and 7 9 mm rmse 14 9 mm 8 1 nrmse 11 7 in 2020 3 4 final fruit yield aboveground biomass seasonal et and wp the comparisons between simulated and observed final yield aboveground biomass et and wp across the two experiment years are presented in table 5 and fig 5 the agreement between simulated and measured yield was good in 2020 and 2021 with a relatively small deviation 13 51 dev 20 34 table 5 in addition the total r2 rmse nrmse d and ef values were 0 77 0 34 t ha 1 8 18 0 88 and 0 68 in 2021 and the corresponding values were 0 77 0 26 t ha 1 5 53 0 93 and 0 70 in 2020 nevertheless the slopes of the linear regression between the observed and simulated final yield in 2020 and 2021 were lower than the ideal 1 1 line by 40 3 and 8 2 respectively indicating that aquacrop somewhat underestimated the cherry tomato yield and the simulation performance on the yield was slightly better in 2021 than that in 2020 fig 5 the yield of the full irrigation level i100 was slightly overestimated while that of the deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 were most slightly underestimated in 2021 however in 2020 the yield was most slightly overestimated the simulation performance of different irrigation levels varied with experiment year and the worst simulation effect was observed in i80 treatment dev 4 77 in 2021 while i80 treatment in 2020 was best dev 0 19 regarding n fertilizer treatments the simulation performance of the high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 dev 2 73 in 2020 and 0 17 in 2021 was better than low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 dev 11 57 in 2020 and 2 22 in 2021 in the two years the deviations dev comparison between the simulated and measured final aboveground biomass showed a maximum difference of 14 24 which indicated a satisfactory result table 5 the good fit was also reflected by the high r2 ef and d of 0 91 0 77 and 0 92 in 2020 and 0 92 0 91 and 0 98 in 2021 respectively and low nrmse and rmse of 7 01 and 0 53 t ha 1 in 2020 and 3 40 and 0 28 t ha 1 in 2021 respectively according to the slopes of the linear regression they were lower than the ideal by 40 3 and 8 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively representing that aquacrop underestimated the cherry tomato yield and the simulated result was better in 2021 than that in 2020 fig 5 in comparison with the mode performance among three irrigation levels there was an accurate estimation in full irrigation treatment i100 with the lowest dev in the range of 0 60 0 05 in 2021 table 5 besides an acceptable estimation result was obtained in the other deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 in 2021 however the simulation accuracy of aboveground biomass comparatively decreased in 2020 with a higher dev value dev 1 60 than that in 2021 dev 0 68 from the simulation effects of the two years the simulation results of the severe deficit irrigation i60 were worst among them the largest estimation errors occurred in the i60n0 treatment regarding the simulation performance of et the r2 rmse nrmse d and ef was 0 69 37 08 mm 21 26 0 54 and 1 43 in 2020 and 0 92 25 75 mm 15 27 0 65 and 0 42 in 2021 respectively the slopes of the linear regression were largely lower than the ideal by 77 8 in 2020 and 63 6 in 2021 demonstrating that the model poorly underestimated et fig 5 the model estimated et was largely lower than the measured data at full and medium irrigation levels i100 and i80 with dev ranging from 28 09 to 12 35 table 5 nevertheless in case of low irrigation treatments dev was smaller than 8 91 obtaining an acceptable result the more irrigation and n fertilizer application rates the worse simulation result moreover the effect of water stress was greater than that of nitrogen stress the average dev value of et in 2020 17 13 was comparatively lower than that in 2021 11 94 and hereby the simulation accuracy in 2021 was better than that in 2020 aquacrop only explained 22 in 2020 and 19 in 2021 of the variation r2 0 22 and 0 19 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in the simulated wp fig 5 and therefore was judged poor simulation in addition the poor simulation performance of wp by aquacrop was also confirmed by other statistical values low ef 0 62 and 0 15 in 2020 and 2021 respectively and d 0 08 and 0 70 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in terms of seasonal wp aquacrop systematically overestimated wp in the two year experiment 11 29 dev 67 34 especially in the severe deficit irrigation treatments on average 13 26 and 0 56 in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 besides the simulation accuracy decreased with decreasing irrigation water stress and the simulation effects of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were relatively ideal compared with high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 3 5 scenarios and analysis generally the cherry tomato yield increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation levels and n fertilizer rates fig 6 the largest yield was obtained in 120 et0 in combination with 360 kg n ha 1 i120n360 the yield of i80n360 was 98 24 of the potential yield in the two year experiment in comparison with i60 i80 i100 and i120 increased yield by 8 76 9 67 and 9 78 respectively while the corresponding values of wp were decreased by 0 15 0 61 and 0 53 respectively additionally compared to that of n0 yield of n180 n270 n360 and n450 were increased by 8 24 12 72 27 80 and 27 07 respectively the corresponding increments of wp were 4 62 7 06 19 07 and 18 56 respectively the irrigation and n fertilizer regimes were optimized according to the high yield and wp in conclusion among these scenarios the irrigation level of 80 et0 combined with 360 kg n ha 1 i80n360 was the optimal treatment 4 discussion 4 1 canopy cover the aquacrop model primarily uses the dynamic simulation of canopy cover cc to represent crops growth feng et al 2022 during parameterization the soil water stress coefficient affecting canopy cove cure such as the canopy expansion ksp exp lower and ksp exp upper stomatal closure ksp sto and early canopy senescence ksp sen recommended in the reference manual of aquacrop model for tomato were directly adopted however the initial canopy cover cc0 maximum canopy cover ccx phenological period and root depth were adjusted based on the two year field data which were closely related to canopy cover table 2 the phenological period in the greenhouse was shorter than that in the open field because the greenhouse had higher air temperature besides the maximum root depth was fixed at 0 5 m based on the observed data which was shallower than the root depth recommended by the model 2 m the reason was likely related to the influence of film mulch and drip irrigation we found the simulation effect of various irrigation and n fertilizer levels showed slight difference and satisfactory performance in simulating cc was obtained for all treatments r2 0 94 d 0 97 ef 0 85 4 5 nrmse 15 7 and 2 6 rmse 6 7 fig 2 and table 4 similarly tan et al 2018 also noted that aquacrop satisfactorily simulated cc under various film mulched drip irrigation treatments in three validation seasons r2 0 89 rmse 1 06 and d 0 92 on the contrary previously reported literature has demonstrated the simulation of cc was poor in the case of severe water shortages scenarios katerji et al 2013 sandhu and irmak 2019b they analyzed that the senescence under severe water stress while the growth rate of the observed cc slowed down when water stress occurred in a short period of time feng et al 2022 visually the effect of water stress largely contributed to the duration and intensity of water shortage and in this study the water stress did not cause the significantly decrease in cc herein we also found that a slight underestimation of cc until appropriately 30 and 43 days after transplanting in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 2 and table 4 similar result was also demonstrated by tan et al 2018 the differences could be attributed to that the positive effects of plastic film mulch on soil moisture and temperature were not considered in the model thereby causing more intense water stress in the simulation than that in the actual conditions moreover the cc remained at a very high level during the harvest period while the cc of grain crops showed a sharp decay at harvest abedinpour et al 2012 ran et al 2017 huang et al 2022 this may be attributed to the fact that the cherry tomato variety used in this study was of infinite growth type and only four spikes of fruits were retained during the experiment during simulation the time from senescence to maturity period of cherry tomato was much shorter than that of grain crops 4 2 aboveground biomass with respect to aboveground biomass simulation despite some slight underestimation in the middle growth seasons of the two year experiment the aquacrop provided a feasible and accurate simulation fig 3 which was confirmed by the high r2 0 94 d 0 96 and ef 0 85 values and low value of nrmse 9 7 nrmse 27 1 and rmse 0 3 nrmse 1 3 table 4 the obtained results were in agreement with the previous findings hsiao et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019a taking different n application rates into consideration the simulation results of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were overestimated under medium and severe water stress treatments when compared with field observed values akumaga et al 2017 and ranjbar et al 2019 previously explained that the overestimation might be due to algorithm and structure of aquacrop which was enginered to simulate potentially aboveground biomass under ideal conditions akumaga et al 2017 in addition due to the property of n fertilizer the fertilization interval also had a significant impact on aboveground biomass simulation while the factor was not taken into consideration in aquacrop rahimikhoob et al 2021 4 3 soil water content regarding aquacrop for swc simulations in 0 50 cm soil profile a clear and poor overestimation of swc was evident in most water and n fertilizer treatments in both seasons fig 4 and table 4 which was similar to the findings of hsiao et al 2009 and nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 the possible reasons might be that aquacrop model did not take the evaporation resulting from film hole and film breakage into consideration and used less precise crop coefficient for tr sandhu and irmak 2019a tan et al 2018 in practice the soil water under the plastic film could evaporate through the nearby holes and breakage meanwhile the value of swc for each treatment input into the model was taken from the average of swc at the three sampling points but the model used the wetted soil surface to distinguish different irrigation methods raes et al 2009 which made it difficult to simulate the complex water movement under drip irrigation the water content of each soil layer was not well simulated when irrigation occurred besides the inaccurate simulation of root development based on the assumption in the model might be another possible reason for the unsatisfactory result of swc tan et al 2018 however feng et al 2022 concluded that the simulated soil water storage values of film mulched drip irrigation for maize were lower than the measured values in this regard researches could not reach a completely consistent conclusion the reason may be that the soil structure of the experiment site was different and the model could not take the variability of soil structure into consideration meanwhile the accuracy of simulation achieved by the aquacrop model for severe water stress treatment i60 was higher when compared with the other treatments fig 4 and table 4 which was consistent with feng et al 2022 and nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 4 4 final fruit yield seasonal et and wp the simulated values of final yield fitted the measured data with good accuracy because of the high correlation r2 0 77 in 2020 and 2021 and low deviation 10 05 dev 20 34 and 13 51 dev 4 60 in 2020 and 2021 respectively additionally according to the linear regression between the measured and simulated final yield the slopes were lower than the ideal 1 1 line by 40 3 and 8 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 5 and table 5 which was consistent with the results proposed by guo et al 2018 and tan et al 2018 who concluded that aquacrop obviously underestimated yield under the mulched treatment the inaccuracy in simulation of yield was largely attributed to the errors in estimation of evaporation and transpiration sandhu and irmak 2019a and the inadequate distribution of etc in evaporation and transpiration paredes et al 2014 in addition a better simulation performance of final yield was obtained under high n fertilizer treatments table 5 since in this case hi ought to vary rather not react to nitrogen wu et al 2022a additionally n deficient treatments prevented the increase of canopy cover during vegetative growth period similar to the decrease of canopy cover under water stress conditions which ultimately reduced the crop yield ahmadi et al 2015a heng et al 2009 in the two year experiment the model systematically underestimated seasonal et fig 5 which agreed well with the results previous proposed by oiganji et al 2016 ran et al 2017 yang et al 2015 and katerji et al 2013 meanwhile the field measured and model simulated et values differed as much as 0 31 58 05 mm table 5 obviously it was a high prediction error range in model simulations especially considering the application of aquacrop in water stress regions one possible explanation of errors in simulated et was the soil water content simulation uncertainty paredes et al 2014 another reason might be the transpiration crop coefficient kc tr was more dependent on the canopy cover curve and water stress had the least effect on transpiration so the relationship between kc tr and canopy cover ratio needed to be corrected paredes et al 2014 ran et al 2017 additionally the inaccurate division of transpiration and evaporation components in aquacrop resulted in unsatisfactory simulation of et sandhu and irmak 2019a however adeboye et al 2021 found the inconsistent results of that aquacrop could satisfactorily modulate evapotranspiration and yield in varied nitrogen regimes it was inconsistent with the results obtained in this study might be owing to the diverse crop and initial soil nitrogen contents nevertheless in this study aquacrop underestimated et under all treatments and the more n fertilizer application the worse simulation result table 5 the principle source of uncertainties was that the model assumed the effect of n fertilizer stress being the same throughout the entire growth period while n fertilizer effect of different growth period also greatly affected et wu et al 2022a the slope values of the linear regression were 0 27 in 2020 and 0 33 in 2021 and indicated that aquacrop overestimated wp in the two year experiment fig 5 during the simulation of wp the differences between simulated and measured values were also assumed on the basis of deviations which ranged from 2 53 to 67 34 in 2020 and from 11 29 30 72 in 2021 table 5 meanwhile the low ef ef 0 62 and 0 15 in 2020 and 2021 respectively and d d 0 08 and 0 70 in 2020 and 2021 respectively also indicated the poor performance fig 5 similarly greaves and wang 2016 and katerji et al 2013 concluded that poor simulation of aquacrop for water use efficiency in contrast abedinpour et al 2012 and heng et al 2009 simulated wp by aquacrop and resulted small difference between the model simulated and field observed values wp was mainly governed by evaporation and transpiration components of crop evapotranspiration however the lack of experimental data separating evaporation and transpiration components limits the investigations to assessing the performance of the model on water utilization by using separate evaporation and transpiration values in this study the poorest simulation performance was obtained under severe deficit irrigation treatments 11 29 dev 7 37 and 2 53 dev 22 27 in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 5 besides evett and tolk 2009 also found the similar results and indicated that aquacrop could adequately simulate water use efficiency under well watered scenarios but not under water stress scenarios the simulation effects of low n fertilizer treatments were relatively ideal compared with high n fertilizer treatments table 5 the main source of errors was that the over application of n wuld increase the concentration of soil solution leading to the rise of soil osmotic potential and prevent the root system from absorbing water kang et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 4 5 limitations and suggestions compared with the open field the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse were higher but the wind speed and solar radiation were lower the fao penman monteith equation was not applicable to greenhouse crops therefore the et0 was calculated through the corrected penman monteith formula by chen et al 2007 for greenhouse and then put into the model in this study however there are still some errors in this formula and the calculation of evapotranspiration for greenhouse crops still needs further research besides the data of co2 concentration in the greenhouse was missing the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp4 5 was used to build the co2 file in this study however unlike in the open field the growth stage of cherry tomato weather conditions whether the greenhouse is ventilated or not and spatial location all affect the co2 concentration in the greenhouse the research in this area needs to be further strengthened in addition only one crop variety and experiment site was used to simulate and validate the mulched module of aquacrop in the future it is necessary to simulate and verify different crop varieties and experiment sites so as to improve the application of aquacrop model in the mulched module what s more further research about the improvement of the mulched module needs to be undertaken the mulched module only considers the effects of soil evaporation and the warming effect of film mulching has not been taken into consideration which largely affects the crop growth and development meanwhile the model ignores the changes of covering materials and the area of plant which could largely affect the soil evaporation the parameters of aquacrop model crop transpiration water productivity etc can be further optimized and verified by measuring the transpiration of crops through field observed data to improve simulation accuracy in this study although aquacrop was a good predictor of canopy cover aboveground biomass and final yield under all treatments the differences between model simulated and field measured data could not reach a consistent conclusion therefore in the future experiments it is necessary to increase the frequency of field measured data and improve the application of the model in the growth of plastic film mulch cherry tomato after fully mastering various data 5 conclusions the aquacrop model performed well in simulating the dynamic changes of canopy cover aboveground biomass and final yield for greenhouse cherry tomato under plastic film mulch condition nevertheless unsatisfactory results were obtained for the simulation of soil water content seasonal evapotranspiration and water productivity the model severely overestimated soil water content especially under full irrigation conditions and the simulation accuracy gradually increased as the nitrogen rate increased for seasonal evapotranspiration it was largely underestimated with the decreasing irrigation level and n fertilizer rate the simulation accuracy increased and the effect of water stress was higher than that of nitrogen deficiency a decreasing accuracy in simulating water productivity was obtained when water stress decreased and the simulation values of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were much closer to the actual measurement when compared with high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 the optimal integrated regime was deficit irrigation of 80 et0 combined with n rate of 360 kg ha 1 which not only obtained appropriately 98 24 of the potential yield but also substantially decreased

9243,assessing and optimizing crop management strategies e g irrigation and nitrogen n fertilization is critical for the sustainable production of crops currently crop simulation models combined with experimental data have been proved to be effective tools herein the fao aquacrop model was calibrated and validated based on field measured data during two consecutive growing seasons 2020 and 2021 for predicting canopy cover cc aboveground biomass and soil water content swc mm on a daily scale and for simulating final fruit yield evapotranspiration et mm and water productivity wp kg m 3 on a seasonal scale under plastic film mulch condition the two year experiment included three irrigation levels 60 80 and 100 et0 where et0 is the reference evapotranspiration and five n fertilizer rates 0 180 270 360 and 450 kg n ha 1 in general the aquacrop model adequately simulated the dynamic changes of cherry tomato cc aboveground biomass and final fruit yield nonetheless the model severely overestimated swc especially under full irrigation in the two year experiment and the simulation accuracy gradually increased with the increase of n rate for et it was largely underestimated with the decrease in irrigation level and n rate the simulation accuracy improved and the impact of water stress was stronger than that of nitrogen stress the simulation accuracy of wp decreased as irrigation level and n rate increased the optimal integrated regime was deficit irrigation of 80 et0 combined with n rate of 360 kg ha 1 i80n360 which obtained 98 24 of potential yield while significantly decreasing water input the simulation of the mulched module and parameters of the aquacrop model crop transpiration water productivity etc should be further optimized and verified if these improvements can be made the aquacrop model can be used in the decision making of irrigation and n fertilization strategies of cherry tomato under plastic film mulch condition keywords aquacrop cherry tomato canopy cover aboveground biomass soil water content 1 introduction the rapid rise of global population increased the demand of horticultural crop production in many countries and regions erkossa and seleshi 2010 gorjian et al 2021 greenhouse cultivation expanded in recent decades is widely considered one of the sustainable solutions to ensure food security even in adverse weather conditions castilla 2013 nishad and krupa 2022 however greenhouse industry as a high water fertilizers and energy input sector is currently facing severe challenges to increase global production with the goal of reducing energy and different resources inputs marcelis et al 2019 cherry tomato is a popular horticultural crop that is economically productive nutritious and tasty tieman et al 2017 which is widely grown in china united states and southern europe mostly under greenhouse conditions mori et al 2008 water and n are critical factors restricting crop growth and ultimately determining crop production li et al 2021 therefore for better crop yields and economic profitability farmers empirically provide excessive water and fertilizer for cherry tomato however the spread of cherry tomato cultivation combined with relatively high water demand and water deficit sensitivity raises the issue of water resources shortage especially in arid and semi arid areas at the same time the excessive application of n fertilizer beyond the crop demand and low fertilizer utilization efficiency causes undesirable consequences such as soil acidification guo et al 2010 leaching of nitrogen into groundwater min et al 2012 thompson et al 2020 and emission of nitrous oxide he et al 2009 in the context of increasing water scarcity and the spread of non point source pollution from irrational fertilization application finding sustainable ways to improve crop water and fertilizer productivity is increasing important in greenhouse system deficit irrigation is commonly considered a valuable strategy to manage soil moisture for crop production wu et al 2022b in addition the drip fertigation system can significantly promote crop n uptake increase n use efficiency and reduce the loss of soil no3 n and the risk of no3 n moving to deeper soil layers chilundo et al 2017 wang et al 2018 to date researchers have optimized deficit irrigation and n application on tomato cammarano et al 2020 hu et al 2021 li et al 2021 volpi et al 2022 wu et al 2022 accordingly scientific and rational management of water and n fertilizer is essential for cherry tomato to enhance crop yields with minimal water and fertilizer inputs however although field experiment studies explaining the effects of experimental factors on crop growth could be designed problems such as the thorough understanding of the crop responses of experimental factors during the whole growth season and the high cost and time consuming still restrict the measurement considering such limitations the combination of crop simulation models with experimental data have proved to be a persuasive tool for low cost and efficient understanding of the interactions in experimental factors araya et al 2016 li et al 2018 van gaelen et al 2015 hereby many crop growth simulation models of different complexities have been increasingly developed and applied as companies provide support tools based on simulation and prediction using experimental data abedinpour 2021 körner 2019 viz aquacrop raes et al 2009 cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 dessat jones et al 2003 wofost de wit et al 2019 and apsim keating et al 2003 these crop simulation models could well simulate the responses of crops to various environmental conditions and management scenarios feng et al 2022 in comparison to other models the aquacrop model raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 proposed by fao seem particularly attractive to estimate crop cc biomass as well as final yield under varied water inputs feng et al 2022 and optimize irrigation strategies in varied climatic environments owing to its balance between simplicity accuracy and robustness abi saab et al 2015 ahmadi et al 2015a nowadays many studies have been conducted to estimate aquacrop performance on crop growth yield and soil water available to facilitate farm management ahmadi et al 2015a ran et al 2018 for example amiri 2016 tested the integrated strategies of water and nitrogen fertilization for rice by aquacrop and found a satisfactory result between predicted and observed grain yield and biomass similarly abedinpour 2021 tested aquacrop model for wheat under water nitrogen interactions and found a good agreement between the field observed and model simulated soil water content at 30 cm soil depth and the predicted grain and biomass yield under moderate water stressed conditions were more accurate than those under full or rainfed conditions palumbo et al 2012 and katerji et al 2013 reported an acceptable result between the simulated evapotranspiration and measured values in tomato under full irrigation in conclusion although aquacrop performed well in simulating the process of crop growth its performance varied considerably from many factors such as local climate and soil data field management parameters crop parameters and initial boundary conditions of the experiment because aquacrop is a water driven simulation model many previous studies mainly focused on the model validation and parameter optimization under various water deficit regimes while the results validation of fertilization regimes was minimal in addition aquacrop has its own coverage module but the initial consideration of agricultural coverage and farming technology is insufficient the soil temperature module is also missing which is largely affected by the film mulching to date there has been few model simulation and verification of different irrigation and n fertilizer regimes on greenhouse vegetables under plastic film mulching condition based on aquacrop model therefore taking the high cost and time consuming field researches and the variability of aquacrop due to different experimental conditions into consideration the purposes was to 1 calibrate and validate the aquacrop model for greenhouse cherry tomato by field observed data under different water and n fertilizer regimes 2 evaluate the performance of aquacrop in simulating the effects of the integrated strategies of film mulched drip irrigation amount and n rates on soil water storage cc aboveground biomass and final fruit yield 3 find out the optimal integrated regimes of water and n regimes for greenhouse cherry tomato under film mulched drip fertigation scenarios 4 determine the effectiveness and limitations of the model in practical applications to provide guidance for the application of the model in greenhouse crops 2 materials and methods 2 1 greenhouse experimental description a two year greenhouse cherry tomato pink rose m 2 experiment was conducted during the spring summer growing seasons in 2020 and 2021 at the experimental station of northwest a f university located in yangling 34 20 n 108 04 e at an elevation of 521 m shaanxi province northwest china this cultivar a hybrid variety has quite good characteristics including high temperature resistance cold resistance and overall good resistance the detailed greenhouse weather conditions during the two growing seasons are shown in fig 1 the chemical properties of the 0 60 cm soil are as follow soil texture silty clay loam field capacity 25 mass moisture content permanent wilting point 8 5 mass

randomized block replicated two times the irrigation levels included 100 et0 i100 80 et0 i80 and 60 et0 i60 where et0 was the reference evapotranspiration the n rates consisted of 450 kg n ha 1 n450 360 kg n ha 1 n360 270 kg n ha 1 n270 180 kg n ha 1 n180 and 0 kg n ha 1 n0 each experiment plot was 1 25 m wide and 6 m long cherry tomato was transplanted with both row and plant spacing of 40 cm on 18th march in 2020 and 9th march in 2021 and the harvest date was 29th june in 2020 and 2nd july in 2021 before treating all treatments received the same irrigation amount 25 mm to ensure the survival rate of seedlings in this study the irrigation interval was appropriately seven days and the amounts were determined according to et0 calculated by the modified penman monteith equation as described in chen et al 2007 the treatments event was achieved through drip irrigation tubes drip tube agrifim in line emitters 2 l h 1 spaced 0 3 m and drip fertilization equipment the equipment was mainly composed of water pump rotary wing water meter proportional fertilization pump and water transmission and distribution piping system etc and was controlled by hydraulic proportional fertilization pump device for fertilizer all phosphate fertilizer 180 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 40 of the total potassium fertilizer 120 kg ha 1 k2o were integrated to the topsoil about 20 cm before transplanting the remaining potassium fertilizer 180 kg ha 1 k2o and all n fertilizer urea were applied as topdressing fertilizer the specific dates of irrigation and fertilization are shown in table 1 except for irrigation and fertilization others agronomic managements weed pest control pollination and so on were the same following the local practices each plant kept four ears of cherry tomato fruits 2 3 plant sampling and calculations the actual evapotranspiration et was estimated using a simplified soil water balance formula lhomme and katerji 1991 et δw i where i is the irrigation amount mm and δ w is the difference in soil water storage in the 0 50 cm soil profile mm wp was calculated as the ratio of total dry fruit yield to et deng et al 2013 the red ripen fruits from the first to the fourth truss were harvested in sequence from six marked plants in each treatment the total yield was determined from the average yield per plant and planting density soil samples under the dripper 20 cm and 40 cm horizontally from the dripper were collected at 10 cm intervals to a depth of 50 cm using an auger on the day before each irrigation event in each treatment the gravimetric swc was determined by the oven drying method and its value for each treatment was taken from the average of swc at the same depth at the three sampling points thereafter the volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying gravimetric swc with the corresponding soil bulk density furthermore the swc of each treatment was also measured by trime installed horizontally into the soil under the dripper 20 cm and 40 cm from the dripper between each irrigation event which was calibrated by measuring the gravimetric swc the aboveground dry biomass and leaf area index lai cm2 cm 2 were monitored six times throughout the growing season which was 23 43 57 70 84 103 days after transplanting in 2020 and 30 47 61 75 88 115 days after transplanting in 2021 on each sampling date three representative plants per treatment were collected to obtain the in season aboveground dry biomass hereafter the plant was dismembered and each organ was over dried at 105 for 0 5 h and then at 60 until constant weight the fruit dry biomass was the sum of dry fruits on the sampling day and the accumulation of harvested dry fruits before the sampling date the leaf area was also determined with the punch weighing method qiao 2002 and lai was the ratio of total leaf area to the occupied land area watson 1947 subsequently canopy cover cc was converted by the lai data using the following formula hsiao et al 2009 1 cc 1 005 1 exp 0 6 lai 1 2 2 4 model description the aquacrop model developed by the fao is a widely used water driven crop model which simulates crop yield and biomass in response to water based on a function of water consumption raes et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 the deficit status in the model could be presented by limited canopy expansion accelerated canopy senescence stomata closure alternated harvest index and water productivity huang et al 2022 daily crop transpiration tr mm day 1 is separated from et0 mm day 1 by cc values see eq 2 soon afterwards the aboveground biomass agb t ha 1 is converted

evapotranspiration mm day 1 of the ith day ks is the soil water stress coefficient cc is the canopy cover adjusted for microadvection kc is the coefficient for crop transpiration mm raes et al 2009 tsakmakis et al 2019 meanwhile a semi quantitative method was adopted in the model to determine the expected effects of soil fertility stress on crop biomass production huang et al 2022 2 5 model parameterization calibration validation in aquacrop model the input weather parameters such as daily maximum and minimum air temperature were directly obtained from an automatic weather station located in the greenhouse the et0 was calculated in advance through the corrected penman monteith equation by chen et al 2007 using the acquired meteorological data and then directly put into the model the co2 file was built with the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp4 5 provided by the model obviously it was not possible to measure all the data so some default values or data provided by the model were selected for these parameters the irrigation and fertilization timing and amounts are shown in table 1 regarding the crop file it consisted of two parts of parameters including conservative and non conservative types table 2 among them the conservative parameters were relatively stable with slight changes in time management practices and geographic locations and their values were all provided in the model reference manual for tomato montoya et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2019 in contrast the non conservative parameters varied significantly with the year site and variety and were determined by the experiment the model could be run in growth degree day or calendar day mode and the calendar day mode was adopted the crop phonological period data input during the parameter calibration process is critical to accurately assessing of the crop development therefore dates of main phonological stages of the i100n360 treatment non stressed were detailed observed during the two growing seasons and directly put into the model necessarily these parameters were further fine tuned by the trial and error method until the simulated value of the canopy cover and biomass resembled the fitted values several important parameters such as wp reference harvest index hi0 soil water stress parameters and so on were adjusted by the trial and error method within the range of value provided by the manual and adjusted basing i100n360 treatment non stressed raes et al 2009 additionally fertility stress parameters were calibrated using field data from five n fertilizer treatments under full irrigation treatments i100 in 2021 table 3 data from the other treatments in 2021 and from all treatments in 2020 were used for model validation some default parameters included in the manual were adopted directly moreover the specific process of parameters tuning refers to vanuytrecht et al 2014 2 6 model performance evaluation there were five statistical indicators used to evaluate the aquacrop model performance during the calibration and validation including coefficient of determination r2 willmott index of agreement d root mean squared error rmse normalized root men square error nrmse and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient ef 6 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 7 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 8 nrmse 100 o rmse 9 ef 1 i 1

simulated and observed values respectively the closer r2 and d values were to 1 and the closer rmse and nrmse values were to 0 the better agreement between the simulated and observed data the simulation effect was divided into excellent good acceptable and poor when the nrmse was less than 10 from 10 to 20 from 20 to 30 and greater than 30 jamieson et al 1991 the values of the ef ranged from negative infinity to 1 ef 1 indicated a perfect fit while ef 0 suggested the model was only as accurate as the mean of the observed data and ef 0 suggested the mean of the observed data was a better prediction than the model ran et al 2018 3 results 3 1 canopy cover in the two experiment years the dynamic of cc throughout the growing season across all treatments was similar fig 2 moreover aquacrop could well capture the trend of cc development under all treatments as shown in high r2 0 94 d 0 97 and ef 0 85 values and low nrmse 4 5 nrmse 15 7 and rmse 2 6 rmse 6 7 table 4 specifically the simulation accuracy of full irrigation level i100 was slightly better than that of the other deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 in 2021 however in 2020 the simulation accuracy of all treatments showed no significant difference similarly the model had a relatively better simulation performance under high n fertilizer treatments than that of the low n fertilizer treatments in 2021 in contrast the differences among various n fertilizer treatments were negligible in 2020 the maximum cc occurred appropriately 70 days after transplanting in 2020 which was about 5 days earlier than that in 2021 largely due to the shortened growth period resulting from higher air temperature obviously the model simulated cc quite precisely in 2021 while there was overestimation during the validation 2020 one of the observed discrepancies was a slight underestimation cc until appropriately 30 and 43 days after transplanting in 2020 and 2021 respectively 3 2 aboveground biomass the simulated and actual development of aboveground biomass in all treatments were in high agreement with high r2 0 94 d 0 96 and ef 0 85 values and low values of nrmse 9 7 nrmse 27 1 and rmse 0 3 t ha 1 nrmse 1 3 t ha 1 table 4 however aquacrop slightly underestimated aboveground biomass in all treatments at the mid season stage fig 3 by comparing various irrigation treatments the simulation accuracy increased with the decreasing irrigation level with regard to the performance of aquacrop in simulating aboveground biomass at different n fertilizer application rates the discrepancies between field observed and model simulated values decreased with the decrease of n fertilizer application rates 3 3 soil water content the whole trends of the field observed and model simulated swc under varying irrigation and n fertilizer levels were basically consistent fig 4 however in general swc had a poor impact on the simulation capability and the statistical indicators of swc ranged from 6 50 mm to 33 2 mm rmse from 5 7 to 27 8 nrmse from 0 22 to 0 94 r2 except for i100n0 from 0 27 to 0 92 d and from 19 69 to 0 63 ef table 4 by comparing the various irrigation treatments the severe deficit irrigation treatment i60 had a better simulation performance as indicated by higher r2 0 42 0 94 d 0 76 0 92 and lower rmse 7 1 mm 11 3 mm nrmse 6 6 10 the highest simulation error in swc was observed in full irrigation treatments i100 than that of other water deficient treatments i80 and i60 during the two growing seasons at mid season and late season growth stages the model gradually overestimated the swc values in full irrigation treatment i100 in 2020 and 2021 and the whole stage of medium water stress treatment i80 in 2020 however the simulations of other water stress treatments were relatively satisfactory in 2021 however there was a general overestimation trend in swc in the severe deficit irrigation treatment i60 in 2020 at early and mid season stages and an underestimation at the late season stage for the n fertilizer treatments the simulation accuracy gradually increased as the nitrogen rate increased the best simulation performance occurred in n450

4 final fruit yield aboveground biomass seasonal et and wp the comparisons between simulated and observed final yield aboveground biomass et and wp across the two experiment years are presented in table 5 and fig 5 the agreement between simulated and measured yield was good in 2020 and 2021 with a relatively small deviation 13 51 dev 20 34 table 5 in addition the total r2 rmse nrmse d and ef values were 0 77 0 34 t ha 1 8 18 0 88 and 0 68 in 2021 and the corresponding values were 0 77 0 26 t ha 1 5 53 0 93 and 0 70 in 2020 nevertheless the slopes of the linear regression between the observed and simulated final yield in 2020 and 2021 were lower than the ideal 1 1 line by 40 3 and 8 2 respectively indicating that aquacrop somewhat underestimated the cherry tomato yield and the simulation performance on the yield was slightly better in 2021 than that in 2020 fig 5 the yield of the full irrigation level i100 was slightly overestimated while that of the deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 were most slightly underestimated in 2021 however in 2020 the yield was most slightly overestimated the simulation performance of different irrigation levels varied with experiment year and the worst simulation effect was observed in i80 treatment dev 4 77 in 2021 while i80 treatment in 2020 was best dev 0 19 regarding n fertilizer treatments the simulation performance of the high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 dev 2 73 in 2020 and 0 17 in 2021 was better than low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 dev 11 57 in 2020 and 2 22 in 2021 in the two years the deviations dev comparison between the simulated and measured final aboveground biomass showed a maximum difference of 14 24 which indicated a satisfactory result table 5 the good fit was also reflected by the high r2 ef and d of 0 91 0 77 and 0 92 in 2020 and 0 92 0 91 and 0 98 in 2021 respectively and low nrmse and rmse of 7 01 and 0 53 t ha 1 in 2020 and 3 40 and 0 28 t ha 1 in 2021 respectively according to the slopes of the linear regression they were lower than the ideal by 40 3 and 8 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively representing that aquacrop underestimated the cherry tomato yield and the simulated result was better in 2021 than that in 2020 fig 5 in comparison with the mode performance among three irrigation levels there was an accurate estimation in full irrigation treatment i100 with the lowest dev in the range of 0 60 0 05 in 2021 table 5 besides an acceptable estimation result was obtained in the other deficit irrigation treatments i80 and i60 in 2021 however the simulation accuracy of aboveground biomass comparatively decreased in 2020 with a higher dev value dev 1 60 than that in 2021 dev 0 68 from the simulation effects of the two years the simulation results of the severe deficit irrigation i60 were worst among them the largest estimation errors occurred in the i60n0 treatment regarding the simulation performance of et the r2 rmse nrmse d and ef was 0 69 37 08 mm 21 26 0 54 and 1 43 in 2020 and 0 92 25 75 mm 15 27 0 65 and 0 42 in 2021 respectively the slopes of the linear regression were largely lower than the ideal by 77 8 in 2020 and 63 6 in 2021 demonstrating that the model poorly underestimated et fig 5 the model estimated et was largely lower than the measured data at full and medium irrigation levels i100 and i80 with dev ranging from 28 09 to 12 35 table 5 nevertheless in case of low irrigation treatments dev was smaller than 8 91 obtaining an acceptable result the more irrigation and n fertilizer application rates the worse simulation result moreover the effect of water stress was greater than that of nitrogen stress the average dev value of et in 2020 17 13 was comparatively lower than that in 2021 11 94 and hereby the simulation accuracy in 2021 was better than that in 2020 aquacrop only explained 22 in 2020 and 19 in 2021 of the variation r2 0 22 and 0 19 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in the simulated wp fig 5 and therefore was judged poor simulation in addition the poor simulation performance of wp by aquacrop was also confirmed by other statistical values low ef 0 62 and 0 15 in 2020 and 2021 respectively and d 0 08 and 0 70 in 2020 and 2021 respectively in terms of seasonal wp aquacrop systematically overestimated wp in the two year experiment 11 29 dev 67 34 especially in the severe deficit irrigation treatments on average 13 26 and 0 56 in 2020 and 2021 respectively table 5 besides the simulation accuracy decreased with decreasing irrigation water stress and the simulation effects of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were relatively ideal compared with high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 3 5 scenarios and analysis generally the cherry tomato yield increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation levels and n fertilizer rates fig 6 the largest yield was obtained in 120 et0 in combination with 360 kg n ha 1 i120n360 the yield of i80n360 was 98 24 of the potential yield in the two year experiment in comparison with i60 i80 i100 and i120 increased yield by 8 76 9 67 and 9 78 respectively while the corresponding values of wp were decreased by 0 15 0 61 and 0 53 respectively additionally compared to that of n0 yield of n180 n270 n360 and n450 were increased by 8 24 12 72 27 80 and 27 07 respectively the corresponding increments of wp were 4 62 7 06 19 07 and 18 56 respectively the irrigation and n fertilizer regimes were optimized according to the high yield and wp in conclusion among these scenarios the irrigation level of 80 et0 combined with 360 kg n ha 1 i80n360 was the optimal treatment 4 discussion 4 1 canopy cover the aquacrop model primarily uses the dynamic simulation of canopy cover cc to represent crops growth feng et al 2022 during parameterization the soil water stress coefficient affecting canopy cove cure such as the canopy expansion ksp exp lower and ksp exp upper stomatal closure ksp sto and early canopy senescence ksp sen recommended in the reference manual of aquacrop model for tomato were directly adopted however the initial canopy cover cc0 maximum canopy cover ccx phenological period and root depth were adjusted based on the two year field data which were closely related to canopy cover table 2 the phenological period in the greenhouse was shorter than that in the open field because the greenhouse had higher air temperature besides the maximum root depth was fixed at 0 5 m based on the observed data which was shallower than the root depth recommended by the model 2 m the reason was likely related to the influence of film mulch and drip irrigation we found the simulation effect of various irrigation and n fertilizer levels showed slight difference and satisfactory performance in simulating cc was obtained for all treatments r2 0 94 d 0 97 ef 0 85 4 5 nrmse 15 7 and 2 6 rmse 6 7 fig 2 and table 4 similarly tan et al 2018 also noted that aquacrop satisfactorily simulated cc under various film mulched drip irrigation treatments in three validation seasons r2 0 89 rmse 1 06 and d 0 92 on the contrary previously reported literature has demonstrated the simulation of cc was poor in the case of severe water shortages scenarios katerji et al 2013 sandhu and irmak 2019b they analyzed that the senescence under severe water stress while the growth rate of the observed cc slowed down when water stress occurred in a short period of time feng et al 2022 visually the effect of water stress largely contributed to the duration and intensity of water shortage and in this study the water stress did not cause the significantly decrease in cc herein we also found that a slight underestimation of cc until appropriately 30 and 43 days after transplanting in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 2 and table 4 similar result was also demonstrated by tan et al 2018 the differences could be attributed to that the positive effects of plastic film mulch on soil moisture and temperature were not considered in the model thereby causing more intense water stress in the simulation than that in the actual conditions moreover the cc remained at a very high level during the harvest period while the cc of grain crops showed a sharp decay at harvest abedinpour et al 2012 ran et al 2017 huang et al 2022 this may be attributed to the fact that the cherry tomato variety used in this study was of infinite growth type and only four spikes of fruits were retained during the experiment during simulation the time from senescence to maturity period of cherry tomato was much shorter than that of grain crops 4 2 aboveground biomass with respect to aboveground biomass simulation despite some slight underestimation in the middle growth seasons of the two year experiment the aquacrop provided a feasible and accurate simulation fig 3 which was confirmed by the high r2 0 94 d 0 96 and ef 0 85 values and low value of nrmse 9 7 nrmse 27 1 and rmse 0 3 nrmse 1 3 table 4 the obtained results were in agreement with the previous findings hsiao et al 2009 sandhu and irmak 2019a taking different n application rates into consideration the simulation results of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were overestimated under medium and severe water stress treatments when compared with field observed values akumaga et al 2017 and ranjbar et al 2019 previously explained that the overestimation might be due to algorithm and structure of aquacrop which was enginered to simulate potentially aboveground biomass under ideal conditions akumaga et al 2017 in addition due to the property of n fertilizer the fertilization interval also had a significant impact on aboveground biomass simulation while the factor was not taken into consideration in aquacrop rahimikhoob et al 2021 4 3 soil water content regarding aquacrop for swc simulations in 0 50 cm soil profile a clear and poor overestimation of swc was evident in most water and n fertilizer treatments in both seasons fig 4 and table 4 which was similar to the findings of hsiao et al 2009 and nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 the possible reasons might be that aquacrop model did not take the evaporation resulting from film hole and film breakage into consideration and used less precise crop coefficient for tr sandhu and irmak 2019a tan et al 2018 in practice the soil water under the plastic film could evaporate through the nearby holes and breakage meanwhile the value of swc for each treatment input into the model was taken from the average of swc at the three sampling points but the model used the wetted soil surface to distinguish different irrigation methods raes et al 2009 which made it difficult to simulate the complex water movement under drip irrigation the water content of each soil layer was not well simulated when irrigation occurred besides the inaccurate simulation of root development based on the assumption in the model might be another possible reason for the unsatisfactory result of swc tan et al 2018 however feng et al 2022 concluded that the simulated soil water storage values of film mulched drip irrigation for maize were lower than the measured values in this regard researches could not reach a completely consistent conclusion the reason may be that the soil structure of the experiment site was different and the model could not take the variability of soil structure into consideration meanwhile the accuracy of simulation achieved by the aquacrop model for severe water stress treatment i60 was higher when compared with the other treatments fig 4 and table 4 which was consistent with feng et al 2022 and nyakudya and stroosnijder 2014 4 4 final fruit yield seasonal et and wp the simulated values of final yield fitted the measured data with good accuracy because of the high correlation r2 0 77 in 2020 and 2021 and low deviation 10 05 dev 20 34 and 13 51 dev 4 60 in 2020 and 2021 respectively additionally according to the linear regression between the measured and simulated final yield the slopes were lower than the ideal 1 1 line by 40 3 and 8 2 in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 5 and table 5 which was consistent with the results proposed by guo et al 2018 and tan et al 2018 who concluded that aquacrop obviously underestimated yield under the mulched treatment the inaccuracy in simulation of yield was largely attributed to the errors in estimation of evaporation and transpiration sandhu and irmak 2019a and the inadequate distribution of etc in evaporation and transpiration paredes et al 2014 in addition a better simulation performance of final yield was obtained under high n fertilizer treatments table 5 since in this case hi ought to vary rather not react to nitrogen wu et al 2022a additionally n deficient treatments prevented the increase of canopy cover during vegetative growth period similar to the decrease of canopy cover under water stress conditions which ultimately reduced the crop yield ahmadi et al 2015a heng et al 2009 in the two year experiment the model systematically underestimated seasonal et fig 5 which agreed well with the results previous proposed by oiganji et al 2016 ran et al 2017 yang et al 2015 and katerji et al 2013 meanwhile the field measured and model simulated et values differed as much as 0 31 58 05 mm table 5 obviously it was a high prediction error range in model simulations especially considering the application of aquacrop in water stress regions one possible explanation of errors in simulated et was the soil water content simulation uncertainty paredes et al 2014 another reason might be the transpiration crop coefficient kc tr was more dependent on the canopy cover curve and water stress had the least effect on transpiration so the relationship between kc tr and canopy cover ratio needed to be corrected paredes et al 2014 ran et al 2017 additionally the inaccurate division of transpiration and evaporation components in aquacrop resulted in unsatisfactory simulation of et sandhu and irmak 2019a however adeboye et al 2021 found the inconsistent results of that aquacrop could satisfactorily modulate evapotranspiration and yield in varied nitrogen regimes it was inconsistent with the results obtained in this study might be owing to the diverse crop and initial soil nitrogen contents nevertheless in this study aquacrop underestimated et under all treatments and the more n fertilizer application the worse simulation result table 5 the principle source of uncertainties was that the model assumed the effect of n fertilizer stress being the same throughout the entire growth period while n fertilizer effect of different growth period also greatly affected et wu et al 2022a the slope values of the linear regression were 0 27 in 2020 and 0 33 in 2021 and indicated that aquacrop overestimated wp in the two year experiment fig 5 during the simulation of wp the differences between simulated and measured values were also assumed on the basis of deviations which ranged from 2 53 to 67 34 in 2020 and from 11 29 30 72 in 2021 table 5 meanwhile the low ef ef 0 62 and 0 15 in 2020 and 2021 respectively and d d 0 08 and 0 70 in 2020 and 2021 respectively also indicated the poor performance fig 5 similarly greaves and wang 2016 and katerji et al 2013 concluded that poor simulation of aquacrop for water use efficiency in contrast abedinpour et al 2012 and heng et al 2009 simulated wp by aquacrop and resulted small difference between the model simulated and field observed values wp was mainly governed by evaporation and transpiration components of crop evapotranspiration however the lack of experimental data separating evaporation and transpiration components limits the investigations to assessing the performance of the model on water utilization by using separate evaporation and transpiration values in this study the poorest simulation performance was obtained under severe deficit irrigation treatments 11 29 dev 7 37 and 2 53 dev 22 27 in 2020 and 2021 respectively fig 5 besides evett and tolk 2009 also found the similar results and indicated that aquacrop could adequately simulate water use efficiency under well watered scenarios but not under water stress scenarios the simulation effects of low n fertilizer treatments were relatively ideal compared with high n fertilizer treatments table 5 the main source of errors was that the over application of n wuld increase the concentration of soil solution leading to the rise of soil osmotic potential and prevent the root system from absorbing water kang et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 4 5 limitations and suggestions compared with the open field the temperature and humidity in the greenhouse were higher but the wind speed and solar radiation were lower the fao penman monteith equation was not applicable to greenhouse crops therefore the et0 was calculated through the corrected penman monteith formula by chen et al 2007 for greenhouse and then put into the model in this study however there are still some errors in this formula and the calculation of evapotranspiration for greenhouse crops still needs further research besides the data of co2 concentration in the greenhouse was missing the yearly atmospheric co2 concentration ipcc rcp4 5 was used to build the co2 file in this study however unlike in the open field the growth stage of cherry tomato weather conditions whether the greenhouse is ventilated or not and spatial location all affect the co2 concentration in the greenhouse the research in this area needs to be further strengthened in addition only one crop variety and experiment site was used to simulate and validate the mulched module of aquacrop in the future it is necessary to simulate and verify different crop varieties and experiment sites so as to improve the application of aquacrop model in the mulched module what s more further research about the improvement of the mulched module needs to be undertaken the mulched module only considers the effects of soil evaporation and the warming effect of film mulching has not been taken into consideration which largely affects the crop growth and development meanwhile the model ignores the changes of covering materials and the area of plant which could largely affect the soil evaporation the parameters of aquacrop model crop transpiration water productivity etc can be further optimized and verified by measuring the transpiration of crops through field observed data to improve simulation accuracy in this study although aquacrop was a good predictor of canopy cover aboveground biomass and final yield under all treatments the differences between model simulated and field measured data could not reach a consistent conclusion therefore in the future experiments it is necessary to increase the frequency of field measured data and improve the application of the model in the growth of plastic film mulch cherry tomato after fully mastering various data 5 conclusions the aquacrop model performed well in simulating the dynamic changes of canopy cover aboveground biomass and final yield for greenhouse cherry tomato under plastic film mulch condition nevertheless unsatisfactory results were obtained for the simulation of soil water content seasonal evapotranspiration and water productivity the model severely overestimated soil water content especially under full irrigation conditions and the simulation accuracy gradually increased as the nitrogen rate increased for seasonal evapotranspiration it was largely underestimated with the decreasing irrigation level and n fertilizer rate the simulation accuracy increased and the effect of water stress was higher than that of nitrogen deficiency a decreasing accuracy in simulating water productivity was obtained when water stress decreased and the simulation values of low n fertilizer treatments n0 and n180 were much closer to the actual measurement when compared with high n fertilizer treatments n360 and n450 the optimal integrated regime was deficit irrigation of 80 et0 combined with n rate of 360 kg ha 1 which not only obtained appropriately 98 24 of the potential yield but also substantially decreased

9244,rooibos aspalathus linearis a herbal tea crop and a member of the plant family fabaceae grows in a narrow ecological range under mediterranean conditions in south africa s fynbos biome there is growing uncertainty on the sustainability of rooibos production under rain fed conditions in a region which is expected to get warmer and drier in future no accurate quantitative information currently exists on how the water use growth and yield of this crop is affected by environmental factors especially climate and soils this paucity of data reduces the ability of farmers to develop effective strategies to cope and adapt to the negative effects of climate variability and change the aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal changes in the energy and water balance of rooibos fields and to establish how this relates to crop yield an open path eddy covariance system was used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration eta and energy balance components over two growing seasons while sap flow was monitored using stem heat balance sap flow gauges these data were used to develop and test a simple eta and yield model which was applied to estimate changes in crop water use and yield under the predicted future climatic conditions more than 36 of the annual total eta 338 mm was consumed during the first three months of the growing season september to november driven by residual soil moisture from the winter rains crop transpiration accounted for only 16 of eta early in the growing season rising to almost 100 during the summer dry months daily peak transpiration at maximum canopy cover barely reached 1 0 mm suggesting that this crop uses very little water six climate change models were used to simulate crop water use and yield for the far future under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario all the models predicted increases in both the annual eta and yield by between 8 and 16 in the period 1961 2099 this study reveals that implementing water conservation and weed management practices early in the growing season can save substantial amounts of soil moisture which can sustain rooibos production under low rainfall conditions keywords climate change crop yield evapotranspiration soil moisture water use model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change models predict increasingly drier future conditions in the mediterranean regions due to the increasing frequency and severity of droughts midgley and lötze 2011 medecc 2020 rain fed agriculture is expected to be most severely affected by climate variability and change vanschoenwinkel and van passel 2018 so there is need for effective water conservation strategies for sustainable crop production development of these strategies requires accurate quantitative information on crop water use and how this relates to yield dzikiti et al 2018 fries et al 2020 yet little information currently exists on the water use of rain fed crops such as rooibos aspalathus linearis burm f r dahlgren whose prime production areas are expected to receive less rainfall in future lotter et al 2014 there is also need for detailed information on the partitioning of evapotranspiration eta between crop transpiration beneficial water use weed water consumption and soil evaporation non beneficial water uses to identify opportunities to reduce water losses moran et al 2009 kool et al 2014 fries et al 2020 rooibos is an important crop in the semi arid parts of south africa contributing to economic development and sustaining livelihoods of mostly poor rural communities lötter 2015 van schalkwyk 2018 the rooibos plant is a shrub which grows in the greater cederberg region of the western and northern cape provinces of south africa fig 1 due to its unique soil and climatic requirements this crop has not been successfully cultivated in other parts of the world van wyk 2008 about 95 of the rooibos is produced from commercially cultivated varieties while the remainder is harvested from wild populations joubert et al 2016 global demand for rooibos tea and pharmaceuticals is supplied from a single production area that is approximately 200 km x 100 km in extent lotter and le maitre 2014 this makes rooibos products unique as their availability depends on conditions in the small growing region waarts and kuit 2010 joubert et al 2016 the current production area is semi arid with a mediterranean type climate characterized by low and erratic rains that fall during winter from may to august the atmospheric evaporative demand during the active growing season september to february is very high with the annual total reference evapotranspiration often exceeding 1 400 mm smartagri 2014 adequate water is therefore critical to support physiological processes such as transpiration and photosynthesis for optimal growth and production lambers et al 2008 taiz et al 2018 rooibos is also adapted to sandy acidic well drained and nutrient poor soils cowling et al 2003 adaramola 2021 although this crop is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions future projections of increasing temperatures and lower rainfall in the cape may have significant consequences for rooibos production smartagri 2014 van schalkwyk 2018 evidence from greenhouse studies with young potted plants suggests that the growth and yield of this crop can be severely reduced under high levels of soil water deficit adaramola 2021 however there is need for field experiments to accurately predict the response of the rooibos crop to changes in environmental conditions to close these important information gaps this study had the following objectives 1 to understand the seasonal water and energy balance dynamics of rooibos fields and how they relate to yield 2 to quantify the partitioning of eta into its constituent components and to determine the factors that influence the partitioning under rain fed conditions in a semi arid environment and 3 to predict potential changes in the water use and yield of rooibos based on the projected future climatic conditions in the growing area the data collected in this study were used to develop and test an evapotranspiration and yield model the model can be used not only to transfer the results of this study to other rooibos growing areas but also to predict the potential impacts of climate change on rooibos crop water use and yield as evapotranspiration is expected to increase in the mediterranean regions in future it is important to quantify crop water use for improved water use efficiency many techniques have been developed to quantify eta in crop fields evapotranspiration can be measured directly using micrometeorological methods such as the eddy covariance paço et al 2006 dzikiti et al 2018 gush et al 2019 bowen ratio and using lysimeters lópez urrea 2006 indirect methods such as the soil water budget rallo et al 2017 volschenk 2017 and the surface energy balance approaches such as the surface renewal snyder et al 2008 and scintillometry cammalleri et al 2010 have also been used to estimate eta of field crops the surface renewal and scintillometry methods only measure the sensible heat flux component of the surface energy balance net radiation and soil heat flux measurements are required so that eta can be calculated as the residual term in the shortened surface energy balance equation dzikiti et al 2014 these eta measurement techniques are rarely used for practical water resources management due to the high costs and complexity instead the reference evapotranspiration is often calculated from readily available weather data and adjusted with appropriate crop coefficients allen et al 1998 concurrent measurements of eta and transpiration measured either using sap flow monitoring allows information on the partitioning of eta to be derived as the difference between the two fluxes dzikiti et al 2018 gush et al 2019 ntshidi et al 2020 this study applies these techniques to assess the seasonal dynamics in the energy and water use patterns in rain fed rooibos fields to provide insights on best practices for conserving water according to moran et al 2009 there are few experimental studies of water use partitioning in dryland ecosystems and even fewer multi year measurements to quantify the sources of variability in eta partitioning this information is critical for rooibos farmers to develop climate change adaptation strategies through implementing effective water conservation methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and plant material the study was conducted in two prime rooibos producing areas in the western cape province of south africa between 2019 and 2021 the first study site was located close to the town of porterville coordinates 33 2 17 20 s 18 58 13 18 e which is situated about 150 km to the northeast of cape town metropolitan fig 1 data collection at this site commenced in march 2019 and ended after harvest in february 2020 as the farmer changed his land use from rooibos cultivation to fruit tree crops the size of the field was about 25 ha the crops were planted in rows with a north south orientation plant spacing was about 60 cm within rows and 1 5 m between rows giving a plant density of just over 11 111 plants per hectare the field was planted on flat terrain in 2016 and harvesting was done for the first time in 2017 harvesting of rooibos is done annually when the plants are between 1 5 and 2 0 m tall from end of january to mid february depending on the variety this is done by cutting the above ground portion both leaves and twigs about 50 cm from the ground and this operation is done manually the following season s crop will regenerate from the remaining stub a dense cover of weeds grew in between the plant rows in spring sustained by residual moisture from the winter rains most of the weeds dried in summer by early december due to the severe soil water deficit except for a few hardy species the second study site coordinates 32 9 52 86 s 18 48 39 03 e was located close to the town of clanwilliam situated more than 250 km to the north of the city of cape town fig 1 data collection at this site started in august 2020 and ended in july 2021 the rooibos crop at this study site was established in the winter of 2018 when seedlings were transplanted into cultivated fields the seedlings do not receive any irrigation and therefore sufficient late winter and spring rainfall is critical to ensure establishment and survival through the first summer richards and lamont 1996 the rooibos at this site was harvested for the first time about 10 months after planting in july 2019 the first harvest delivered a very small yield but it stimulated the main stem to subdivide to form a number of strong side shoots the first proper harvest took place 18 months after planting thereafter the plants were harvested annually harvest during the course of this project was in feb 2021 the field size at clanwilliam was much larger than at porterville being approximately 225 ha and planted on relatively flat and homogenous terrain 2 2 climate and soil measurements climate at both sites was according to the köppen climate classification system subtype csa which represents the hot summer mediterranean climate more than 70 of the rain falls during the winter months may to august mostly as cold fronts emanating from the nearby indian and atlantic oceans the clanwilliam site had a long term annual average rainfall of about 230 mm while porterville had slightly higher rainfall averaging around 300 mm smartagri 2014 the long term 1950 2015 average minimum temperatures at both sites were around 0 c in winter while the maximum recorded temperatures approached 48 c in summer weather data for this study were collected from automatic weather stations operated by the agricultural research council arc of south africa the stations were located within 10 km of both the clanwilliam and porterville sites data collected included the maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed and direction rainfall and solar irradiance all measurements were made hourly throughout the study period the weather stations were located on short grass surfaces and the sensors were mounted at 2 0 m height above the ground the meteorological variables were used to calculate the daily reference evapotranspiration eto in this study we estimated eto using the penman monteith equation modified to include values for grass parameters according to allen et al 1998 this is defined as evapotranspiration from a short grass surface that is healthy actively growing not short of water and uniformly covering the surface soils at the clanwilliam site were deep exceeding 5 m comprising predominantly of well drained sand with a low ph between 3 0 and 3 8 the average texture of the soil in the depth range 0 120 cm was about 93 sand no silt and about 7 clay the water holding capacity in the soil profile was about 80 mm m relative to the total available water soil type at the porterville site was predominantly sandy in the topsoil profile in the 0 30 cm depth range comprising 91 sand 2 silt and 7 clay this transitioned to sandy loam around the 60 80 cm depth comprising about 70 sand 14 silt and 16 clay beyond the 100 cm depth the soils were sandy clay in texture with 49 sand 6 silt and 45 clay the soil at porterville was much shallower due to the presence of an impenetrable shale layer about 2 3 m below the surface the soil properties were determined at a commercial laboratory in cape town the volumetric soil water content in the root zone of the rooibos was measured at each of the two sites at 30 60 80 and 120 cm depths using soil water content reflectometer probes model cs616 campbell scientific utah usa calibrated on similar soils by volschenk 2017 one set of sensors was installed within the plant row and another in the middle of the rows to quantify the plant water uptake patterns a linear average of the soil water content at the two sensors positions was used in the calculations as the plant rows were quite close to each other the measurements were not replicated due to equipment shortages roots of the rooibos plants were detected at the 1 0 m depth suggesting that the species is capable of extracting water from deeper layers in the soil profile 2 3 growth and yield measurements once planted the rooibos crop can grow over several years but harvesting is done at least once annually growth of the crop was monitored monthly from september until harvest in january february every year growth parameters monitored included the plant height canopy width and the leaf area index lai the lai defined as m2 of leaf area projected on a m2 of ground area was measured using a leaf area meter model li 2000 li cor inc nebraska usa the lai of the weeds was also quantified by randomly cutting weeds to ground level in four quadrants each measuring 50 cm 50 cm on the field floor the actual leaf area of the weeds in each quadrant was measured in the laboratory using a leaf area meter model li 3000 li cor inc nebraska usa measurement of the leaf area index of the weeds was stopped in early december when the weeds dried 2 4 transpiration evapotranspiration and energy balance measurements transpiration of the rooibos crop was measured using miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges model sgb13 and sgb16 dynamax houston usa baker and van bavel 1987 calibration of this method on woody plants using the cut stem method is described by steppe et al 2005 given that each rooibos bush had multiple stems one sap flow gauge was installed per branch in a selected shrub four sap flow sensors were installed on the branches of four separate shrubs more plants could not be instrumented due to equipment limitations while this presents a limitation the data however has qualitative value as the sap flow of rooibos plants has not been measured before to avoid further stressing the plants which already grew under very hot conditions the sap flow sensors were moved from one plant to another once a month a different radial sheath conductance van bavel and van bavel 1987 was calculated for the sap flow gauges for each new plant installation to ensure an accurate energy balance determination the field scale transpiration t in equivalent water depth units was derived from the sap flow measurements as 1 t i 1 4 sf i a i n lai 10 mm d 1 where sf i and a i are the daily total branch sap flow in cm3 d 1 and the transpiring leaf area in cm2 at the end of the sap flow instrumented branch therefore sf i a i represents the sap flow of each instrumented branch normalized with the leaf area of that branch cm3 of water per cm2 of leaf area per day n is the number of measurements 4 so that an average sf i a i is calculated and lai is the leaf area index for the field the factor of 10 in eq 1 converts cm d 1 to mm d 1 the whole field evapotranspiration eta and energy balance were measured using an open path eddy covariance system the system comprised of a sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell sci inc utah usa which measured the wind speed in 3d the concentration of atmospheric water vapour and carbon dioxide were measured using an infrared gas analyser irga model li 7500a li cor inc nebraska usa all the sensors were connected to a cr5000 data logger manufactured by campbell scientific the high frequency data collected at 10 hz were stored on 2 gb memory cards additional sensors included a net radiometer model cnr1 kipp zonen the netherlands which measured the net radiation absorbed by the field two clusters of soil heat flux plates model hukseflux the netherlands installed at 8 cm depth below the surface soil averaging thermocouples model tcav campbell sci inc utah usa were installed above the soil heat flux plates at 2 and 6 cm depths from the surface to correct the measured fluxes for the energy stored by the soil above the plates the irga and sonic anemometers were installed at about 3 0 m above the ground on an 8 0 m flux tower located in the middle of the field crop canopy height increased from about 0 50 m at both sites at the beginning of the measurements to between 2 2 m at clanwilliam and 2 5 m at porterville at harvest advanced processing of the high frequency eddy covariance data was done using the eddypro v 6 2 0 software li cor inc nebraska usa to correct for fluctuations in air density lack of sensor levelness coordinate rotation sensor separation etc and for the changes in the sensor height above the canopy due to plant growth lastly the eddy covariance data were corrected for lack of energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method as described by cammalleri et al 2010 2 5 modelling water use and yield of rooibos the daily evapotranspiration eta by the rooibos crop was modelled using a simple combination penman monteith equation in which 2 eta 0 408 r n g γ 900 ta 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 r s r a mm d 1 where δ kpa k 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure vs air temperature curve rn

heat and humidity transfer which were calculated as zom 0 123 x h and zoh 0 1 x h respectively the surface resistance was considered to be variable influenced by two stress factors namely the soil water deficit f θ and the vapour pressure deficit of the air f vpd both stress factors have values between 0 and 1 the functional form of the surface resistance equation was expressed according to jarvis et al 1976 as 8 g s g m f θ f vpd mms 1 where gs is the surface conductance gs 1 rs gm is the maximum unstressed surface conductance which was obtained by model optimization the stress factors

content at the field capacity θ wp is the volumetric soil water content at the permanent wilting point and β is a curvature function for the soil water stress factor the model was calibrated using data collected from the porterville site and validated using the data from clanwilliam parameter β was obtained through model optimization and different values ca 1 1 and 2 5 were obtained for the porterville and clanwilliam sites respectively given the different soil types the rest of the model parameters are summarized in table 1 yield data in tons per hectare was obtained from the farm at the end of the growing season estimates of the yield were modelled using the approach by stewart et al 1977 according to this method the relative yield reduction 1 ya ym is related to the relative

yield for the crop is around 3 0 t ha 1 johan brand pers comm this value was used for ym at both sites dzikiti et al 2014 used a large aperture boundary layer scintillometer to measure the evapotranspiration of dryland sandstone fynbos a plant species that is similar in growth form to rooibos and it also grows under mediterranean conditions in the cape floral region the average crop coefficient kc calculated as the slope of the actual evapotranspiration against eto curve was about 0 52 we used this value to estimate etm as the product of the annual total eto and the crop coefficient and we got ky values of 1 31 and 0 99 for porterville and clanwilliam respectively with an average of 1 14 for the two sites 2 6 climate change scenarios climate change data were obtained from climate model simulations spanning the historic and future climate 1960 2100 these simulations were performed at a quasi uniform 50 km horizontal grid using the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro mcgregor and dix 2001 the ccam model is a variable resolution global climate model gcm and it is used in this study to realistically simulate the climate system teleconnection to southern africa the ccam cable model runs use bias adjusted sea surface temperatures ssts and sea ice concentration from six gcm models as lower boundary forcing mcgregor and dix 2001 the gcms used are namely the community climate and earth system simulator acs 1 0 national centre for meteorological research coupled global climate model version 5 cnr cm5 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory coupled model gfd cm3 the max planck institute coupled earth system model mpi esm lr the norwegian earth system model nor esm1 m and the community climate system model ccs m4 all the gcm outputs used as ccam cable forcing data formed part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase five cmip5 and the assessment report five ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the forcing cmip5 models were based on their ability to provide a good representation of the el niño southern oscillation enso attributes all model runs were performed with ccam cable prescribed with atmospheric greenhouse gas co2 sulphate and ozone concentration trajectories under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 the scenario is commonly referred to as the business as usual scenario representing the 90th percentile of the policy scenarios used in cmip5 rcp8 5 is also associated with high baseline emissions and low mitigation for the 21st century the extraction of site specific meteorological data including near air surface 2 m temperature wind speed and precipitation from gridded modelled fields was achieved through an inverse distance weighted remapping using climate data operator cdo the rooibos water use yield model developed using the measured data in this study was applied under potential scenarios of future climate change in the rooibos producing areas in the western cape daily climate data from the six climate change models abbreviated acs 85 ccs 85 cnr 85 mpi 85 nor 85 and gfd 85 which assume the rcp 8 5 emission scenario were used to estimate potential changes in the future water requirements and yield as the climate changes according to lotter and le maitre 2014 this emission scenario is most appropriate for the rooibos growing area as it reflects the actual trajectory of emissions that are already ahead of the higher end of the emissions scenario these data were used to simulate future changes in crop water requirements between the baseline period 1960 1969 and the far future scenarios 2089 2099 for each of the six models 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and soil moisture dynamics 3 1 1 porterville site a summary of the monthly weather conditions at porterville during the 2019 2020 growing season is shown in fig 2 a d the mean monthly solar radiation peaked in summer december at about 28 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest values were recorded in winter in july at about 9 5 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2a the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 37 4 and 3 5 c reached in december and july respectively fig 2b as expected the maximum relative humidity reached 100 on rainy days while the minimum values dropped to close to 10 during dry summer days the mean monthly vapour pressure deficit of the air peaked at about 5 0 kpa with maximum values for individual hot and dry days reaching up to 9 0 kpa on these days the maximum reference evapotranspiration eto was as high as 8 4 mm d 1 december had the highest eto total of 196 mm while rainfall for that month was only 5 8 mm july 2019 was the wettest month receiving about 87 8 mm total rainfall during the winter months may to august was around 222 mm which represented about 66 of the total annual rainfall april 2019 to march 2020 received at porterville which was about 335 mm the annual total reference evapotranspiration was more than four times greater than the rainfall at around 1 448 mm 3 1 2 clanwilliam study site monthly trends in the daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity reference evapotranspiration and rain fall for each month at clanwilliam are shown in fig 2 e h these data were collected from august 2020 to july 2021 the maximum daily solar radiation was slightly higher than at porterville peaking at around 32 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest was in winter averaging about 10 5 mj m 2 d 1 the maximum air temperature was around 43 c reached in february 2021 while the lowest value was about 0 8 c reached in july 2021 the minimum relative humidity frequently dropped below 10 indicating the extremely dry conditions experienced in the study area especially in the summer months peak reference evapotranspiration was around 8 0 mm d 1 june 2021 was the wettest month receiving approximately 36 mm of rainfall while no rain was recorded in december 2020 and february 2021 respectively the atmospheric evaporative demand was greatest in january 2021 totaling 202 mm the annual total reference evapotranspiration was about 1 450 mm which was almost 12 times greater than the rainfall total of only 113 mm 3 2 surface energy balance and canopy growth the seasonal changes in the surface energy balance early in the growing season in spring september 2021 and towards the end of the growing season in summer january are shown in fig 3a and b the available energy rn g is either converted to sensible heat h used to warm the air or it is converted into the latent heat flux λe i e the energy equivalent of evapotranspiration it is apparent in fig 3a that in spring the available energy was partitioned almost equally between the sensible and latent heat fluxes evapotranspiration rates were fairly high supported by evaporation from the relatively wet soils and transpiration from the dense cover of weeds water use by the rooibos plants was fairly low at this time since new shoots and leaves had not sprouted yet energy balance closure was around 70 fig 3b and this was corrected according to the approach by cammalleri et al 2010 however as the soil dried and the weeds senesced in summer it is clear from fig 3c that most of the available energy was converted to sensible heat and very little was used as evapotranspiration despite the fact the rooibos canopy cover was increasing as shown in fig 4 this suggests that water use by the rooibos crop itself was very little even at maximum canopy cover most of the evapotranspiration measured emanated from the soil and weeds early in the growing season the peak latent and soil heat fluxes were in the range 25 50 w m 2 in summer when canopy cover of the rooibos crop was highest fig 3c in addition the energy balance closure in summer showed a significant hysteresis effect fig 3d between the morning to afternoon and afternoon to evening trajectories the closure error could be partly explained by heat storage although other factors may have contributed the maximum leaf area index of the field 2 5 was measured in spring mostly due to the dense weed cover early in the season the lai of the rooibos was less than 0 50 rising to just over 1 0 in summer fig 4 the effective lai for the field was calculated as the algebraic sum of the rooibos and weeds lais 3 3 rooibos water use and water use partitioning the daily trend in water use and reference evapotranspiration of the rooibos field from august 2020 to august 2021 is shown in fig 5a the seasonal course of the atmospheric evaporative demand depicted by the reference evapotranspiration did not match that of the rooibos transpiration and the actual evapotranspiration eta the actual eta peaked early in the growing season in spring driven by the residual moisture from the winter rains associated with higher soil water content fig 5b the moist soil and transpiration from the dense cover of weeds were the major sources of evapotranspiration the contribution of the actual rooibos transpiration to the total eta early in the growing season was less than 16 as shown in fig 5a peak rooibos transpiration was reached in mid december at values close to 1 0 mm d 1 before the average soil water content in the root zone dropped below 4 fig 5b during the dry season from november onwards crop transpiration was the major source of etc and the order of magnitude of the two fluxes were almost similar fig 5a evapotranspiration became substantially higher than transpiration only after rain events as on 04 and 16 march 2021 when soil evaporation increased dramatically the contribution of the field floor evaporation to daily total eta declined from a peak of around 84 early in the growing season in late spring september october to negligible values in summer when rooibos transpiration became the dominant contributor to eta the eta eto ratio ranged from about 0 6 in late spring when water was readily available to less than 0 1 in summer these data are for the clanwilliam study site and similar results were observed at porterville the data in fig 6a shows that transpiration of the rooibos increased as the radiation intensity increased however a hysteresis effect was evident between the transpiration and the rising and falling radiation levels transpiration rates increased at low vpd levels but there was evidence of the stomata closing at the threshold vpd values between 1 5 and 2 0 kpa fig 6b the response of the rooibos transpiration to the soil water deficit was somewhat unexpected high levels of soil water deficit did not necessarily lead to low transpiration rates probably because of the dependence of the crop on groundwater fig 6c archer e al 2009 van schalkwyk 2018 the measured annual total evapotranspiration was 338 mm at porterville and about 290 mm at clanwilliam the actual yield was however higher at clanwilliam 1 18 t ha 1 compared to 0 84 t ha 1 at porterville the water productivity calculated as the yield fresh mass per cubic meter of water consumed as evapotranspiration was 0 25 kg m 3 at porterville and slightly higher at clanwilliam at 0 41 kg m 3 3 4 modelling rooibos water use and impacts of climate change it is apparent from fig 7 that the model simulated the field net radiation rn fairly accurately being within 10 of the measured values comparison of the measured and modelled eta for the rooibos field is shown in fig 8 with the grey line indicating the measured values and the associated error ranges assumed to be about 10 of the measured values according to allen et al 2011 overall the modelled eta were within 15 of the measured values however significant errors occurred after rain events due to difficulties in accurately modelling the surface conductance term when eta spiked in addition the small values of the eta fluxes made the daily simulations to be quite difficult so we present the data as weekly totals the poor prediction of eta at the end of the growing season from may to july 2021 could be a result of higher soil evaporation due to the winter rainfall may to august received in the study area all the six climate change models predicted an increase in both the maximum and minimum air temperatures for the study area between the baseline period 1961 1970 and the far future 2089 2099 expected increases are in the range 4 5 ⁰c and this will inevitably increase the atmospheric evaporative demand quite significantly the reference evapotranspiration was projected to rise by between 11 and 18 while both the annual evapotranspiration fig 9 and the yield were expected to increase by between 8 and 16 as summarized in table 3 depending on the model used the increase in actual evapotranspiration is expected to be slightly lower than that of eto because of the projected higher vpd due to the rising air temperatures and the declining relative humidity the vpd stress is therefore expected to increase causing stomatal closure and thus reducing the evapotranspiration 4 discussion this study investigated the water use dynamics of rain fed rooibos fields over two growing seasons in an environment that is expected to experience increasingly dry conditions in future due to climate variability and change lötter 2015 while rooibos is a hardy species capable of growing and thriving in hot arid environments little is known about how the species might respond to more frequent droughts recent evidence from laboratory experiments with potted rooibos plants indicated significant reductions in growth and yield when soil water deficit increased in the root zone adaramola 2021 similar findings were reported by lotter et al 2014 who measured significantly lower stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthesis rates in greenhouse grown rooibos that experienced severe water deficit stress the lack of detailed information on the water use by rain fed crops like rooibos is a major limiting factor in the development of strategies to cope with droughts archer et al 2009 an understanding of how evapotranspiration is partitioned between crop transpiration and field floor evaporation and what drives this partitioning is also important in order to identify opportunities to conserve water moran et al 2009 for most field crops peak water consumption occurs when canopy cover is maximum hadebe 2017 dzikiti et al 2018 sandhu and irmak 2019 this study however showed that for rooibos a large proportion of water is lost early in the growing season when crop canopy cover is still relatively small most of the field floor evaporative losses occurred via evaporation from the soil and through transpiration by weeds which depleted the soil moisture reserves this study is the first to quantify the sap flow and eta of rooibos plants under field conditions these data illustrate that transpiration of rooibos plants remained quite low throughout the growing season for various reasons early in the season the small transpiring leaf area and the low atmospheric evaporative demand were the main factors limiting transpiration when soil moisture was still relatively abundant from the late winter early spring rains however whole field evapotranspiration was highest around this time driven mostly by field floor evaporative losses non beneficial water use later in the season the low soil moisture levels were the main factors limiting transpiration which barely reached 1 0 mm d 1 at peak canopy cover lai 1 0 m2 m 2 some studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between crop yield and cumulative transpiration steduto et al 2012 this is because plants open their stomata to transpire in exchange for co2 gain taiz et al 2018 therefore it is quite likely that the yield of the rooibos observed at the two study sites were significantly lower than the potential yield if water availability was not limiting independent evidence of the low water consumption rates of the rooibos fields was obtained from the surface energy balance data early in the growing season a significant proportion of the available energy was converted into the latent heat flux due to higher evapotranspiration rates in summer more than 70 of the available energy were converted to sensible heat with a very small proportion used to evaporate the water latent heat even though the rooibos crop had reached its maximum canopy cover the sap flow derived transpiration accounted for almost all of the measured eta in summer suggesting that the rooibos crops were the main source of water use other studies have shown that rooibos plants develop a deep root system to access groundwater when soil water availability is limited archer et al 2009 it is probable that the low transpiration rates measured in summer were derived from groundwater given the very low available soil water and the fact that rooibos tends to have a deep root system results from this study suggest that water conservation strategies should be implemented early in the growing season to ensure that soil water reserves are not depleted before peak crop water demand is reached early removal of weeds is critical as some studies e g ntshidi et al 2020 have shown that these can consume large quantities of water despite the low water use rates evapotranspiration could be modeled reasonably well with a simple big leaf penman monteith pm model the model was calibrated and validated with the field measured data collected from two study sites climate data from six climate change models applied to the rooibos producing areas were used in the pm model to estimate potential changes in crop water requirements in the coming decades all the models suggest that evapotranspiration will increase but at a rate slower than the rate of increase in the atmospheric evaporative demand 5 conclusions this study confirmed the widely held view that rooibos crops consume very little water this was done through detailed measurements of the actual plant transpiration whole field evapotranspiration crop growth and the environmental factors that drive water use annual total evapotranspiration rates at the two study sites were 290 and 338 mm respectively and these are significantly lower than that of most perennial crops the study also provided important insights that can assist with conserving soil moisture from the winter rains which are expected to decrease significantly in future due to climate change maximum evapotranspiration occurred early in the growing season before crop growth had reached its peak minimizing these losses should be the target of water conservation measures it is probable that better water conservation strategies can lead to higher rooibos yields and sustainable production as the climate becomes drier in the coming decades despite the low etc fluxes the penman monteith model can be applied to give reasonable estimates of water use by rooibos crops

9244,rooibos aspalathus linearis a herbal tea crop and a member of the plant family fabaceae grows in a narrow ecological range under mediterranean conditions in south africa s fynbos biome there is growing uncertainty on the sustainability of rooibos production under rain fed conditions in a region which is expected to get warmer and drier in future no accurate quantitative information currently exists on how the water use growth and yield of this crop is affected by environmental factors especially climate and soils this paucity of data reduces the ability of farmers to develop effective strategies to cope and adapt to the negative effects of climate variability and change the aim of this study was to investigate the seasonal changes in the energy and water balance of rooibos fields and to establish how this relates to crop yield an open path eddy covariance system was used to quantify the actual evapotranspiration eta and energy balance components over two growing seasons while sap flow was monitored using stem heat balance sap flow gauges these data were used to develop and test a simple eta and yield model which was applied to estimate changes in crop water use and yield under the predicted future climatic conditions more than 36 of the annual total eta 338 mm was consumed during the first three months of the growing season september to november driven by residual soil moisture from the winter rains crop transpiration accounted for only 16 of eta early in the growing season rising to almost 100 during the summer dry months daily peak transpiration at maximum canopy cover barely reached 1 0 mm suggesting that this crop uses very little water six climate change models were used to simulate crop water use and yield for the far future under the rcp 8 5 emission scenario all the models predicted increases in both the annual eta and yield by between 8 and 16 in the period 1961 2099 this study reveals that implementing water conservation and weed management practices early in the growing season can save substantial amounts of soil moisture which can sustain rooibos production under low rainfall conditions keywords climate change crop yield evapotranspiration soil moisture water use model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate change models predict increasingly drier future conditions in the mediterranean regions due to the increasing frequency and severity of droughts midgley and lötze 2011 medecc 2020 rain fed agriculture is expected to be most severely affected by climate variability and change vanschoenwinkel and van passel 2018 so there is need for effective water conservation strategies for sustainable crop production development of these strategies requires accurate quantitative information on crop water use and how this relates to yield dzikiti et al 2018 fries et al 2020 yet little information currently exists on the water use of rain fed crops such as rooibos aspalathus linearis burm f r dahlgren whose prime production areas are expected to receive less rainfall in future lotter et al 2014 there is also need for detailed information on the partitioning of evapotranspiration eta between crop transpiration beneficial water use weed water consumption and soil evaporation non beneficial water uses to identify opportunities to reduce water losses moran et al 2009 kool et al 2014 fries et al 2020 rooibos is an important crop in the semi arid parts of south africa contributing to economic development and sustaining livelihoods of mostly poor rural communities lötter 2015 van schalkwyk 2018 the rooibos plant is a shrub which grows in the greater cederberg region of the western and northern cape provinces of south africa fig 1 due to its unique soil and climatic requirements this crop has not been successfully cultivated in other parts of the world van wyk 2008 about 95 of the rooibos is produced from commercially cultivated varieties while the remainder is harvested from wild populations joubert et al 2016 global demand for rooibos tea and pharmaceuticals is supplied from a single production area that is approximately 200 km x 100 km in extent lotter and le maitre 2014 this makes rooibos products unique as their availability depends on conditions in the small growing region waarts and kuit 2010 joubert et al 2016 the current production area is semi arid with a mediterranean type climate characterized by low and erratic rains that fall during winter from may to august the atmospheric evaporative demand during the active growing season september to february is very high with the annual total reference evapotranspiration often exceeding 1 400 mm smartagri 2014 adequate water is therefore critical to support physiological processes such as transpiration and photosynthesis for optimal growth and production lambers et al 2008 taiz et al 2018 rooibos is also adapted to sandy acidic well drained and nutrient poor soils cowling et al 2003 adaramola 2021 although this crop is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions future projections of increasing temperatures and lower rainfall in the cape may have significant consequences for rooibos production smartagri 2014 van schalkwyk 2018 evidence from greenhouse studies with young potted plants suggests that the growth and yield of this crop can be severely reduced under high levels of soil water deficit adaramola 2021 however there is need for field experiments to accurately predict the response of the rooibos crop to changes in environmental conditions to close these important information gaps this study had the following objectives 1 to understand the seasonal water and energy balance dynamics of rooibos fields and how they relate to yield 2 to quantify the partitioning of eta into its constituent components and to determine the factors that influence the partitioning under rain fed conditions in a semi arid environment and 3 to predict potential changes in the water use and yield of rooibos based on the projected future climatic conditions in the growing area the data collected in this study were used to develop and test an evapotranspiration and yield model the model can be used not only to transfer the results of this study to other rooibos growing areas but also to predict the potential impacts of climate change on rooibos crop water use and yield as evapotranspiration is expected to increase in the mediterranean regions in future it is important to quantify crop water use for improved water use efficiency many techniques have been developed to quantify eta in crop fields evapotranspiration can be measured directly using micrometeorological methods such as the eddy covariance paço et al 2006 dzikiti et al 2018 gush et al 2019 bowen ratio and using lysimeters lópez urrea 2006 indirect methods such as the soil water budget rallo et al 2017 volschenk 2017 and the surface energy balance approaches such as the surface renewal snyder et al 2008 and scintillometry cammalleri et al 2010 have also been used to estimate eta of field crops the surface renewal and scintillometry methods only measure the sensible heat flux component of the surface energy balance net radiation and soil heat flux measurements are required so that eta can be calculated as the residual term in the shortened surface energy balance equation dzikiti et al 2014 these eta measurement techniques are rarely used for practical water resources management due to the high costs and complexity instead the reference evapotranspiration is often calculated from readily available weather data and adjusted with appropriate crop coefficients allen et al 1998 concurrent measurements of eta and transpiration measured either using sap flow monitoring allows information on the partitioning of eta to be derived as the difference between the two fluxes dzikiti et al 2018 gush et al 2019 ntshidi et al 2020 this study applies these techniques to assess the seasonal dynamics in the energy and water use patterns in rain fed rooibos fields to provide insights on best practices for conserving water according to moran et al 2009 there are few experimental studies of water use partitioning in dryland ecosystems and even fewer multi year measurements to quantify the sources of variability in eta partitioning this information is critical for rooibos farmers to develop climate change adaptation strategies through implementing effective water conservation methods 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and plant material the study was conducted in two prime rooibos producing areas in the western cape province of south africa between 2019 and 2021 the first study site was located close to the town of porterville coordinates 33 2 17 20 s 18 58 13 18 e which is situated about 150 km to the northeast of cape town metropolitan fig 1 data collection at this site commenced in march 2019 and ended after harvest in february 2020 as the farmer changed his land use from rooibos cultivation to fruit tree crops the size of the field was about 25 ha the crops were planted in rows with a north south orientation plant spacing was about 60 cm within rows and 1 5 m between rows giving a plant density of just over 11 111 plants per hectare the field was planted on flat terrain in 2016 and harvesting was done for the first time in 2017 harvesting of rooibos is done annually when the plants are between 1 5 and 2 0 m tall from end of january to mid february depending on the variety this is done by cutting the above ground portion both leaves and twigs about 50 cm from the ground and this operation is done manually the following season s crop will regenerate from the remaining stub a dense cover of weeds grew in between the plant rows in spring sustained by residual moisture from the winter rains most of the weeds dried in summer by early december due to the severe soil water deficit except for a few hardy species the second study site coordinates 32 9 52 86 s 18 48 39 03 e was located close to the town of clanwilliam situated more than 250 km to the north of the city of cape town fig 1 data collection at this site started in august 2020 and ended in july 2021 the rooibos crop at this study site was established in the winter of 2018 when seedlings were transplanted into cultivated fields the seedlings do not receive any irrigation and therefore sufficient late winter and spring rainfall is critical to ensure establishment and survival through the first summer richards and lamont 1996 the rooibos at this site was harvested for the first time about 10 months after planting in july 2019 the first harvest delivered a very small yield but it stimulated the main stem to subdivide to form a number of strong side shoots the first proper harvest took place 18 months after planting thereafter the plants were harvested annually harvest during the course of this project was in feb 2021 the field size at clanwilliam was much larger than at porterville being approximately 225 ha and planted on relatively flat and homogenous terrain 2 2 climate and soil measurements climate at both sites was according to the köppen climate classification system subtype csa which represents the hot summer mediterranean climate more than 70 of the rain falls during the winter months may to august mostly as cold fronts emanating from the nearby indian and atlantic oceans the clanwilliam site had a long term annual average rainfall of about 230 mm while porterville had slightly higher rainfall averaging around 300 mm smartagri 2014 the long term 1950 2015 average minimum temperatures at both sites were around 0 c in winter while the maximum recorded temperatures approached 48 c in summer weather data for this study were collected from automatic weather stations operated by the agricultural research council arc of south africa the stations were located within 10 km of both the clanwilliam and porterville sites data collected included the maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity wind speed and direction rainfall and solar irradiance all measurements were made hourly throughout the study period the weather stations were located on short grass surfaces and the sensors were mounted at 2 0 m height above the ground the meteorological variables were used to calculate the daily reference evapotranspiration eto in this study we estimated eto using the penman monteith equation modified to include values for grass parameters according to allen et al 1998 this is defined as evapotranspiration from a short grass surface that is healthy actively growing not short of water and uniformly covering the surface soils at the clanwilliam site were deep exceeding 5 m comprising predominantly of well drained sand with a low ph between 3 0 and 3 8 the average texture of the soil in the depth range 0 120 cm was about 93 sand no silt and about 7 clay the water holding capacity in the soil profile was about 80 mm m relative to the total available water soil type at the porterville site was predominantly sandy in the topsoil profile in the 0 30 cm depth range comprising 91 sand 2 silt and 7 clay this transitioned to sandy loam around the 60 80 cm depth comprising about 70 sand 14 silt and 16 clay beyond the 100 cm depth the soils were sandy clay in texture with 49 sand 6 silt and 45 clay the soil at porterville was much shallower due to the presence of an impenetrable shale layer about 2 3 m below the surface the soil properties were determined at a commercial laboratory in cape town the volumetric soil water content in the root zone of the rooibos was measured at each of the two sites at 30 60 80 and 120 cm depths using soil water content reflectometer probes model cs616 campbell scientific utah usa calibrated on similar soils by volschenk 2017 one set of sensors was installed within the plant row and another in the middle of the rows to quantify the plant water uptake patterns a linear average of the soil water content at the two sensors positions was used in the calculations as the plant rows were quite close to each other the measurements were not replicated due to equipment shortages roots of the rooibos plants were detected at the 1 0 m depth suggesting that the species is capable of extracting water from deeper layers in the soil profile 2 3 growth and yield measurements once planted the rooibos crop can grow over several years but harvesting is done at least once annually growth of the crop was monitored monthly from september until harvest in january february every year growth parameters monitored included the plant height canopy width and the leaf area index lai the lai defined as m2 of leaf area projected on a m2 of ground area was measured using a leaf area meter model li 2000 li cor inc nebraska usa the lai of the weeds was also quantified by randomly cutting weeds to ground level in four quadrants each measuring 50 cm 50 cm on the field floor the actual leaf area of the weeds in each quadrant was measured in the laboratory using a leaf area meter model li 3000 li cor inc nebraska usa measurement of the leaf area index of the weeds was stopped in early december when the weeds dried 2 4 transpiration evapotranspiration and energy balance measurements transpiration of the rooibos crop was measured using miniature stem heat balance sap flow gauges model sgb13 and sgb16 dynamax houston usa baker and van bavel 1987 calibration of this method on woody plants using the cut stem method is described by steppe et al 2005 given that each rooibos bush had multiple stems one sap flow gauge was installed per branch in a selected shrub four sap flow sensors were installed on the branches of four separate shrubs more plants could not be instrumented due to equipment limitations while this presents a limitation the data however has qualitative value as the sap flow of rooibos plants has not been measured before to avoid further stressing the plants which already grew under very hot conditions the sap flow sensors were moved from one plant to another once a month a different radial sheath conductance van bavel and van bavel 1987 was calculated for the sap flow gauges for each new plant installation to ensure an accurate energy balance determination the field scale transpiration t in equivalent water depth units was derived from the sap flow measurements as 1 t i 1 4 sf i a i n lai 10 mm d 1 where sf i and a i are the daily total branch sap flow in cm3 d 1 and the transpiring leaf area in cm2 at the end of the sap flow instrumented branch therefore sf i a i represents the sap flow of each instrumented branch normalized with the leaf area of that branch cm3 of water per cm2 of leaf area per day n is the number of measurements 4 so that an average sf i a i is calculated and lai is the leaf area index for the field the factor of 10 in eq 1 converts cm d 1 to mm d 1 the whole field evapotranspiration eta and energy balance were measured using an open path eddy covariance system the system comprised of a sonic anemometer model csat3 campbell sci inc utah usa which measured the wind speed in 3d the concentration of atmospheric water vapour and carbon dioxide were measured using an infrared gas analyser irga model li 7500a li cor inc nebraska usa all the sensors were connected to a cr5000 data logger manufactured by campbell scientific the high frequency data collected at 10 hz were stored on 2 gb memory cards additional sensors included a net radiometer model cnr1 kipp zonen the netherlands which measured the net radiation absorbed by the field two clusters of soil heat flux plates model hukseflux the netherlands installed at 8 cm depth below the surface soil averaging thermocouples model tcav campbell sci inc utah usa were installed above the soil heat flux plates at 2 and 6 cm depths from the surface to correct the measured fluxes for the energy stored by the soil above the plates the irga and sonic anemometers were installed at about 3 0 m above the ground on an 8 0 m flux tower located in the middle of the field crop canopy height increased from about 0 50 m at both sites at the beginning of the measurements to between 2 2 m at clanwilliam and 2 5 m at porterville at harvest advanced processing of the high frequency eddy covariance data was done using the eddypro v 6 2 0 software li cor inc nebraska usa to correct for fluctuations in air density lack of sensor levelness coordinate rotation sensor separation etc and for the changes in the sensor height above the canopy due to plant growth lastly the eddy covariance data were corrected for lack of energy balance closure using the bowen ratio method as described by cammalleri et al 2010 2 5 modelling water use and yield of rooibos the daily evapotranspiration eta by the rooibos crop was modelled using a simple combination penman monteith equation in which 2 eta 0 408 r n g γ 900 ta 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 r s r a mm d 1 where δ kpa k 1 is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure vs air temperature curve rn

heat and humidity transfer which were calculated as zom 0 123 x h and zoh 0 1 x h respectively the surface resistance was considered to be variable influenced by two stress factors namely the soil water deficit f θ and the vapour pressure deficit of the air f vpd both stress factors have values between 0 and 1 the functional form of the surface resistance equation was expressed according to jarvis et al 1976 as 8 g s g m f θ f vpd mms 1 where gs is the surface conductance gs 1 rs gm is the maximum unstressed surface conductance which was obtained by model optimization the stress factors were calculated as 9 f vpd e k vpd vpd 10 f θ θ θ wp θ fc θ wp β where θ is the average volumetric soil water content over the entire root zone for a given day θ fc is the volumetric soil water content at the field capacity θ wp is the volumetric soil water content at the permanent wilting point and β is a curvature function for the soil water stress factor the model was calibrated using data collected from the porterville site and validated using the data from clanwilliam parameter β was obtained through model optimization and different values ca 1 1 and 2 5 were obtained for the porterville and clanwilliam sites respectively given the different soil types the rest of the model parameters are summarized in table 1 yield data in tons per hectare was obtained from the farm at the end of the growing season estimates of the yield were modelled using the approach by stewart et al 1977 according to this method the relative yield reduction 1 ya ym is related to the relative

the maximum annual evapotranspiration mm and ky is a water yield response factor the information used to derive ky is summarized in table 2 according to the rooibos council of south africa the maximum yield for the crop is around 3 0 t ha 1 johan brand pers comm this value was used for ym at both sites dzikiti et al 2014 used a large aperture boundary layer scintillometer to measure the evapotranspiration of dryland sandstone fynbos a plant species that is similar in growth form to rooibos and it also grows under mediterranean conditions in the cape floral region the average crop coefficient kc calculated as the slope of the actual evapotranspiration against eto curve was about 0 52 we used this value to estimate etm as the product of the annual total eto and the crop coefficient and we got ky values of 1 31 and 0 99 for porterville and clanwilliam respectively with an average of 1 14 for the two sites 2 6 climate change scenarios climate change data were obtained from climate model simulations spanning the historic and future climate 1960 2100 these simulations were performed at a quasi uniform 50 km horizontal grid using the conformal cubic atmospheric model ccam developed by the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organization csiro mcgregor and dix 2001 the ccam model is a variable resolution global climate model gcm and it is used in this study to realistically simulate the climate system teleconnection to southern africa the ccam cable model runs use bias adjusted sea surface temperatures ssts and sea ice concentration from six gcm models as lower boundary forcing mcgregor and dix 2001 the gcms used are namely the community climate and earth system simulator acs 1 0 national centre for meteorological research coupled global climate model version 5 cnr cm5 the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory coupled model gfd cm3 the max planck institute coupled earth system model mpi esm lr the norwegian earth system model nor esm1 m and the community climate system model ccs m4 all the gcm outputs used as ccam cable forcing data formed part of the coupled model intercomparison project phase five cmip5 and the assessment report five ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc the forcing cmip5 models were based on their ability to provide a good representation of the el niño southern oscillation enso attributes all model runs were performed with ccam cable prescribed with atmospheric greenhouse gas co2 sulphate and ozone concentration trajectories under the representative concentration pathway 8 5 rcp8 5 the scenario is commonly referred to as the business as usual scenario representing the 90th percentile of the policy scenarios used in cmip5 rcp8 5 is also associated with high baseline emissions and low mitigation for the 21st century the extraction of site specific meteorological data including near air surface 2 m temperature wind speed and precipitation from gridded modelled fields was achieved through an inverse distance weighted remapping using climate data operator cdo the rooibos water use yield model developed using the measured data in this study was applied under potential scenarios of future climate change in the rooibos producing areas in the western cape daily climate data from the six climate change models abbreviated acs 85 ccs 85 cnr 85 mpi 85 nor 85 and gfd 85 which assume the rcp 8 5 emission scenario were used to estimate potential changes in the future water requirements and yield as the climate changes according to lotter and le maitre 2014 this emission scenario is most appropriate for the rooibos growing area as it reflects the actual trajectory of emissions that are already ahead of the higher end of the emissions scenario these data were used to simulate future changes in crop water requirements between the baseline period 1960 1969 and the far future scenarios 2089 2099 for each of the six models 3 results 3 1 weather conditions and soil moisture dynamics 3 1 1 porterville site a summary of the monthly weather conditions at porterville during the 2019 2020 growing season is shown in fig 2 a d the mean monthly solar radiation peaked in summer december at about 28 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest values were recorded in winter in july at about 9 5 mj m 2 d 1 fig 2a the maximum and minimum temperatures recorded were 37 4 and 3 5 c reached in december and july respectively fig 2b as expected the maximum relative humidity reached 100 on rainy days while the minimum values dropped to close to 10 during dry summer days the mean monthly vapour pressure deficit of the air peaked at about 5 0 kpa with maximum values for individual hot and dry days reaching up to 9 0 kpa on these days the maximum reference evapotranspiration eto was as high as 8 4 mm d 1 december had the highest eto total of 196 mm while rainfall for that month was only 5 8 mm july 2019 was the wettest month receiving about 87 8 mm total rainfall during the winter months may to august was around 222 mm which represented about 66 of the total annual rainfall april 2019 to march 2020 received at porterville which was about 335 mm the annual total reference evapotranspiration was more than four times greater than the rainfall at around 1 448 mm 3 1 2 clanwilliam study site monthly trends in the daily solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperature maximum and minimum relative humidity reference evapotranspiration and rain fall for each month at clanwilliam are shown in fig 2 e h these data were collected from august 2020 to july 2021 the maximum daily solar radiation was slightly higher than at porterville peaking at around 32 mj m 2 d 1 while the lowest was in winter averaging about 10 5 mj m 2 d 1 the maximum air temperature was around 43 c reached in february 2021 while the lowest value was about 0 8 c reached in july 2021 the minimum relative humidity frequently dropped below 10 indicating the extremely dry conditions experienced in the study area especially in the summer months peak reference evapotranspiration was around 8 0 mm d 1 june 2021 was the wettest month receiving approximately 36 mm of rainfall while no rain was recorded in december 2020 and february 2021 respectively the atmospheric evaporative demand was greatest in january 2021 totaling 202 mm the annual total reference evapotranspiration was about 1 450 mm which was almost 12 times greater than the rainfall total of only 113 mm 3 2 surface energy balance and canopy growth the seasonal changes in the surface energy balance early in the growing season in spring september 2021 and towards the end of the growing season in summer january are shown in fig 3a and b the available energy rn g is either converted to sensible heat h used to warm the air or it is converted into the latent heat flux λe i e the energy equivalent of evapotranspiration it is apparent in fig 3a that in spring the available energy was partitioned almost equally between the sensible and latent heat fluxes evapotranspiration rates were fairly high supported by evaporation from the relatively wet soils and transpiration from the dense cover of weeds water use by the rooibos plants was fairly low at this time since new shoots and leaves had not sprouted yet energy balance closure was around 70 fig 3b and this was corrected according to the approach by cammalleri et al 2010 however as the soil dried and the weeds senesced in summer it is clear from fig 3c that most of the available energy was converted to sensible heat and very little was used as evapotranspiration despite the fact the rooibos canopy cover was increasing as shown in fig 4 this suggests that water use by the rooibos crop itself was very little even at maximum canopy cover most of the evapotranspiration measured emanated from the soil and weeds early in the growing season the peak latent and soil heat fluxes were in the range 25 50 w m 2 in summer when canopy cover of the rooibos crop was highest fig 3c in addition the energy balance closure in summer showed a significant hysteresis effect fig 3d between the morning to afternoon and afternoon to evening trajectories the closure error could be partly explained by heat storage although other factors may have contributed the maximum leaf area index of the field 2 5 was measured in spring mostly due to the dense weed cover early in the season the lai of the rooibos was less than 0 50 rising to just over 1 0 in summer fig 4 the effective lai for the field was calculated as the algebraic sum of the rooibos and weeds lais 3 3 rooibos water use and water use partitioning the daily trend in water use and reference evapotranspiration of the rooibos field from august 2020 to august 2021 is shown in fig 5a the seasonal course of the atmospheric evaporative demand depicted by the reference evapotranspiration did not match that of the rooibos transpiration and the actual evapotranspiration eta the actual eta peaked early in the growing season in spring driven by the residual moisture from the winter rains associated with higher soil water content fig 5b the moist soil and transpiration from the dense cover of weeds were the major sources of evapotranspiration the contribution of the actual rooibos transpiration to the total eta early in the growing season was less than 16 as shown in fig 5a peak rooibos transpiration was reached in mid december at values close to 1 0 mm d 1 before the average soil water content in the root zone dropped below 4 fig 5b during the dry season from november onwards crop transpiration was the major source of etc and the order of magnitude of the two fluxes were almost similar fig 5a evapotranspiration became substantially higher than transpiration only after rain events as on 04 and 16 march 2021 when soil evaporation increased dramatically the contribution of the field floor evaporation to daily total eta declined from a peak of around 84 early in the growing season in late spring september october to negligible values in summer when rooibos transpiration became the dominant contributor to eta the eta eto ratio ranged from about 0 6 in late spring when water was readily available to less than 0 1 in summer these data are for the clanwilliam study site and similar results were observed at porterville the data in fig 6a shows that transpiration of the rooibos increased as the radiation intensity increased however a hysteresis effect was evident between the transpiration and the rising and falling radiation levels transpiration rates increased at low vpd levels but there was evidence of the stomata closing at the threshold vpd values between 1 5 and 2 0 kpa fig 6b the response of the rooibos transpiration to the soil water deficit was somewhat unexpected high levels of soil water deficit did not necessarily lead to low transpiration rates probably because of the dependence of the crop on groundwater fig 6c archer e al 2009 van schalkwyk 2018 the measured annual total evapotranspiration was 338 mm at porterville and about 290 mm at clanwilliam the actual yield was however higher at clanwilliam 1 18 t ha 1 compared to 0 84 t ha 1 at porterville the water productivity calculated as the yield fresh mass per cubic meter of water consumed as evapotranspiration was 0 25 kg m 3 at porterville and slightly higher at clanwilliam at 0 41 kg m 3 3 4 modelling rooibos water use and impacts of climate change it is apparent from fig 7 that the model simulated the field net radiation rn fairly accurately being within 10 of the measured values comparison of the measured and modelled eta for the rooibos field is shown in fig 8 with the grey line indicating the measured values and the associated error ranges assumed to be about 10 of the measured values according to allen et al 2011 overall the modelled eta were within 15 of the measured values however significant errors occurred after rain events due to difficulties in accurately modelling the surface conductance term when eta spiked in addition the small values of the eta fluxes made the daily simulations to be quite difficult so we present the data as weekly totals the poor prediction of eta at the end of the growing season from may to july 2021 could be a result of higher soil evaporation due to the winter rainfall may to august received in the study area all the six climate change models predicted an increase in both the maximum and minimum air temperatures for the study area between the baseline period 1961 1970 and the far future 2089 2099 expected increases are in the range 4 5 ⁰c and this will inevitably increase the atmospheric evaporative demand quite significantly the reference evapotranspiration was projected to rise by between 11 and 18 while both the annual evapotranspiration fig 9 and the yield were expected to increase by between 8 and 16 as summarized in table 3 depending on the model used the increase in actual evapotranspiration is expected to be slightly lower than that of eto because of the projected higher vpd due to the rising air temperatures and the declining relative humidity the vpd stress is therefore expected to increase causing stomatal closure and thus reducing the evapotranspiration 4 discussion this study investigated the water use dynamics of rain fed rooibos fields over two growing seasons in an environment that is expected to experience increasingly dry conditions in future due to climate variability and change lötter 2015 while rooibos is a hardy species capable of growing and thriving in hot arid environments little is known about how the species might respond to more frequent droughts recent evidence from laboratory experiments with potted rooibos plants indicated significant reductions in growth and yield when soil water deficit increased in the root zone adaramola 2021 similar findings were reported by lotter et al 2014 who measured significantly lower stomatal conductance transpiration and photosynthesis rates in greenhouse grown rooibos that experienced severe water deficit stress the lack of detailed information on the water use by rain fed crops like rooibos is a major limiting factor in the development of strategies to cope with droughts archer et al 2009 an understanding of how evapotranspiration is partitioned between crop transpiration and field floor evaporation and what drives this partitioning is also important in order to identify opportunities to conserve water moran et al 2009 for most field crops peak water consumption occurs when canopy cover is maximum hadebe 2017 dzikiti et al 2018 sandhu and irmak 2019 this study however showed that for rooibos a large proportion of water is lost early in the growing season when crop canopy cover is still relatively small most of the field floor evaporative losses occurred via evaporation from the soil and through transpiration by weeds which depleted the soil moisture reserves this study is the first to quantify the sap flow and eta of rooibos plants under field conditions these data illustrate that transpiration of rooibos plants remained quite low throughout the growing season for various reasons early in the season the small transpiring leaf area and the low atmospheric evaporative demand were the main factors limiting transpiration when soil moisture was still relatively abundant from the late winter early spring rains however whole field evapotranspiration was highest around this time driven mostly by field floor evaporative losses non beneficial water use later in the season the low soil moisture levels were the main factors limiting transpiration which barely reached 1 0 mm d 1 at peak canopy cover lai 1 0 m2 m 2 some studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between crop yield and cumulative transpiration steduto et al 2012 this is because plants open their stomata to transpire in exchange for co2 gain taiz et al 2018 therefore it is quite likely that the yield of the rooibos observed at the two study sites were significantly lower than the potential yield if water availability was not limiting independent evidence of the low water consumption rates of the rooibos fields was obtained from the surface energy balance data early in the growing season a significant proportion of the available energy was converted into the latent heat flux due to higher evapotranspiration rates in summer more than 70 of the available energy were converted to sensible heat with a very small proportion used to evaporate the water latent heat even though the rooibos crop had reached its maximum canopy cover the sap flow derived transpiration accounted for almost all of the measured eta in summer suggesting that the rooibos crops were the main source of water use other studies have shown that rooibos plants develop a deep root system to access groundwater when soil water availability is limited archer et al 2009 it is probable that the low transpiration rates measured in summer were derived from groundwater given the very low available soil water and the fact that rooibos tends to have a deep root system results from this study suggest that water conservation strategies should be implemented early in the growing season to ensure that soil water reserves are not depleted before peak crop water demand is reached early removal of weeds is critical as some studies e g ntshidi et al 2020 have shown that these can consume large quantities of water despite the low water use rates evapotranspiration could be modeled reasonably well with a simple big leaf penman monteith pm model the model was calibrated and validated with the field measured data collected from two study sites climate data from six climate change models applied to the rooibos producing areas were used in the pm model to estimate potential changes in crop water requirements in the coming decades all the models suggest that evapotranspiration will increase but at a rate slower than the rate of increase in the atmospheric evaporative demand 5 conclusions this study confirmed the widely held view that rooibos crops consume very little water this was done through detailed measurements of the actual plant transpiration whole field evapotranspiration crop growth and the environmental factors that drive water use annual total evapotranspiration rates at the two study sites were 290 and 338 mm respectively and these are significantly lower than that of most perennial crops the study also provided important insights that can assist with conserving soil moisture from the winter rains which are expected to decrease significantly in future due to climate change maximum evapotranspiration occurred early in the growing season before crop growth had reached its peak minimizing these losses should be the target of water conservation measures it is probable that better water conservation strategies can lead to higher rooibos yields and sustainable production as the climate becomes drier in the coming decades despite the low etc fluxes the penman monteith model can be applied to give reasonable estimates of water use by rooibos crops this model can be applied not only to predict future crop water requirements but also to estimate the water use of the rooibos in other growing regions declaration of competing interest the authors
