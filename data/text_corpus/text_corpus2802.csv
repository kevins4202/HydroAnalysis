14010,ozone decomposition into free radicals which can be facilitated by enhancing electron transfer between ozone and catalyst is an important segment in catalytic ozonation we doped cerium uniformly on γ al2o3 with an impregnation calcination method to enhance electron transfer in catalytic ozonation of phenol in aqueous solution the removal efficiency of phenol is raised from 39 7 by ozonation alone to 46 3 by catalytic ozonation with ce al2o3 in 50 min reaction a higher ce3 ce4 ratio in ce al2o3 witnesses a higher electron transfer rate in catalytic ozonation and thus a higher degradation efficiency of phenol illustrating that the activity of ce al2o3 depends on the valence state of ce the electron transfer cycle is formed by the electron donation from ce3 to ozone molecule and the electron acceptance of ce4 from adjacent lattice oxygen after getting the electron the ozone molecule is decomposed to generate free radical of oh on the surface of ce al2o3 the continuous flow experiments exhibit a stable and high catalytic activity of ce al2o3 for catalytic ozonation implying the feasibility in practical application keywords ce al2o3 electron transfer catalytic ozonation free radicals phenol 1 introduction water and wastewater treatment technologies have a promising application due to the shortage of water resources 1 some technologies such as adsorption flocculation biotechnology are usually used in traditional water treatment process but cannot meet the requirements due to the improvement of discharge standards 2 therefore advanced oxidation processes aops which can promote the radicals production to mineralize pollutants to a great extent is regarded as a potential water and wastewater treatment technology 3 the aops include fenton oxidation photocatalytic oxidation 4 ozonation ultrasonic oxidation wet oxidation and supercritical water oxidation 5 among which ozonation has gained wide attention due to its advantage of less pollution 6 ozonation with high selectivity tends to attack high electron cloud density groups such as unsaturated groups cannot achieve permineralization of pollutant 7 while catalytic ozonation technology can improve the removal of organic pollutant and even refractory organic pollutants by generating radicals with higher oxidation redcuction potentials 8 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation has realized the industrialization of ozonation due to the separability of catalysts and the urgent need in engineering is to fabricate catalysts with high activity and stability so as to achieve high efficiency for the removal of organic pollutants from water or wastewater 9 10 noble metals e g ru pd and ag act as efficient redox catalysts to interact strongly with ozone molecules for promoting free radicals production 11 12 which is an critical step for catalytic ozonation in consideration of economy noble metals are substituted by transition metals or rare earth such as mn ti ni al co fe cu zn v ce la and pr 13 16 among which ce is a promising substituted catalyst due to its special structure of 4f orbit and high electron transfer capacity based on a fast ce3 ce4 cycle 17 18 the cerium oxide presents pretty catalytic performance on the ozonation of oxalic acid aniline reactive blue dye and p nitrophenol 19 21 it is reported that the active component of catalyst with lower valence state presents higher removal rate of organic pollutant in catalytic ozonation process 22 and the interaction of materials can influence the electronic states 23 for example the valence state of mn varies from 2 4 of mn al2o3 to 2 8 of mn tio2 and even to 3 8 of mn sio2 due to the stronger interaction between porous material with mn acetate precursor 24 therefore the highly dispersed cerium loaded on al2o3 with low valence state is fabricated to donate much electron to ozone and promotes its decomposition into free radicals for degradation of organic pollutant here we prepare catalyst of the ce al2o3 for ozonation of phenol and probe into the electron transfer mechanism aiming to develop a catalyst with excellent activity and stability for catalytic ozonation in engineering 2 material and methods 2 1 materials commercial alumina spherules γ al2o3 in the size of 1 2 mm were acquired from xinxiang chemical co ltd henan china cerium iii nitrate hexahydrate phenol 4 aminoantipyrine indigotrisulfonic acid potassium salt and potassium hexacyanoferrate were obtained from aladdin chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china unless otherwise noted the chemicals in the experiments were analytical reagent grade and used without pretreatment all solutions were prepared with deionized water 2 2 catalyst preparation and catalytic ozonation experiments cerium doped alumina ce al2o3 was prepared with an impregnation calcination method the commercial alumina spherules were washed with deionized water dried at 120 c for 2 h and then calcinated at 600 c for 2 h to remove the impurities a certain concentration of cerium nitrate solution was configured with deionized water then the alumina spherules were immersed in cerium nitrate solution under stirring rate of 150 r min at 30 c for 8 h the mixtures were calcinated at 500 c for 4 h after drying at 120 c for 2 h and then cooled naturally to indoor temperature the catalytic ozonation experiments were operated in a 0 60 l closed cylindrical pyrex column h 30 cm φ 5 cm with a semi batch mode at 25 1 c fig s1 in a typical procedure 0 20 l of phenol aqueous solution at the concentration of 51 0 1 0 mg l and 5 0 g of catalyst were dosed into the column ozone generated from pure oxygen 0 6 l min by an ozone generator azco htu500e canada was continuously aerated into the aqueous solution by a titanium alloy diffuser fitted at the bottom of column and the residual off gas was trapped with ki solution the samples sampled at certain time intervals were immediately filtered with a 0 45 μm millipore filter for analysis the control experiments were conducted in accordance with the procedure described above the stability of the catalyst was estimated by a continuous flow mode which operated in the same device fig s1 the operation conditions were kept in the same with those of semi batch mode except that the addition of catalyst was increased to 30 g and the continuous flow was kept at 0 3 l h with phenol concentration of 51 0 1 0 mg l 2 3 characterization of catalyst the phase of catalyst was identified with an x ray diffractometer xrd panalytical x pert pro netherlands with radiation source of cu kα λ 0 15406 nm in the 2θ 10 80 ranges at a scanning step of 4 min the morphology and structure of catalyst was obtained by scanning electron microscope sem hitachi s 4800 japan equipped with energy dispersed x ray spectroscopy edx for identifying the distribution of elements on the surface of catalyst the specific surface areas and pore size distribution of catalyst were measured on nitrogen adsorption apparatus bet beijing jwgb jw bk132 f china after pretreatment at 200 c for 2 h the valence states of ce on the surface of catalyst were determined by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250 thermo vg scientific american with monochromatic al kα radiation as the x ray source 1486 6 ev and all xps spectra were calibrated with the signal of c1s line 284 8 ev fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir iraffinity 1 shimadzu japan was conducted using spectrometer over the frequency range of 400 4000 cm 1 at a resolution of 4 cm 1 to determine whether there exists organic adsorbed on the surface of catalyst the cyclic voltammetry was examined by an electrochemical workstation cv chi660e chenhua china with a three electrode system consisted of a platinum wire as counter electrode a silver silver chloride electrode as the reference and catalyst modified conductive glass as working electrode the cyclic voltammetry behavior of catalyst was measured at 0 1 m na2so4 solution 80 ml spiked with 1 mm k3 fe cn 6 1 ml to account for electron transfer property in catalytic ozonation process h2 temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr was carried out on an automatic multipurpose adsorption instrument tp 5079 xianquan china equipped with a custom made thermal conductivity detector tcd before testing the sample was purged by pure he gas at 400 c for 1 h and subsequently cooled to room temperature then sample was saturated in 6 vol h2 n2 gas with a flow rate of 30 ml min and then heated from room temperature to 800 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the catalysts fig 1 a exhibits the wide angle xrd patterns of al2o3 and ce al2o3 both samples present 2θ diffraction peaks at 37 6 46 1 and 67 0 which correspond to γ al2o3 jcpds 10 0425 the loading of cerium on alumina brings about the appearance of three weak characteristic peaks at 28 5 47 5 and 56 3 in accordance with the planes of 1 1 1 2 2 0 and 3 1 1 of cubic cerianite jcpds 34 0394 proving that cerium is successfully doped on porous alumina the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of al2o3 and ce al2o3 are shown in fig 1 b with an inset to exhibit the pore size distribution which is believed to influence the diffusion of ozone or organics in catalytic ozonation process 25 both isotherms belong to type iv with a distinct hysteresis loop in the relative pressure p p0 range of 0 5 1 0 indicating the mesoporous structure of al2o3 and ce al2o3 after doping with cerium on the surface of porous alumina the specific surface area of the sample decreases from 194 2 m2 g to 177 1 m2 g while the pore diameter transfers slightly toward bigger one a slight change of the porous structure implys the uniform distribution of cerium on the surface of al2o3 which is clearly observed in sem images and edx element mappings fig 1 c 3 2 catalytic performance of ce al2o3 the contribution of adsorption oxygen oxidation ozonation and catalytic ozonation to phenol removal are shown in fig 2 a the equilibrium adsorption value of phenol by ce al2o3 is 0 088 mg g ce al2o3 after 50 min under n2 bubbling only 2 0 mg l about 3 9 of initial phenol concentration is removed under oxygen bubbling after 50 min the ozonation removes 39 7 mg l of phenol while the addition of al2o3 promotes the removal of phenol to 43 0 mg l after 50 min the catalytic ozonation by ce al2o3 further improves the removal efficiency to 46 3 mg l illustrating that the ce loading strengthens the catalytic ozonation of phenol except for the phenol removal the ozone decomposition in aqueous solution shown in fig 2 b also demonstrates the catalytic performance of ce al2o3 in the continuous bubbling of ozone the ozone concentration in aqueous solution is kept stable at 4 0 0 2 mg l as soon as 5 g of ce al2o3 is added in aqueous solution the ozone concentration is reduced sharply and then kept at 3 2 0 2 mg l the interaction of ce al2o3 and ozone which contributes the decomposition of ozone into free radicals is demonstrated by ftir fig 2 c after the treatment of ce al2o3 by ozone a new spectral feature at 1380 cm 1 appears assigning to surface oxygen species produced by the interaction between ozone and catalyst 26 27 3 3 catalytic active sites of ce al2o3 the adsorption and decomposition of ozone on the catalyst of ce al2o3 are in relation to its surface chemical properties which can be adjusted by calcination 28 29 the catalytic activities of ce al2o3 calcinated at different temperatures are depicted in fig 3 a the phenol removal exhibit similar profile in presence of al2o3 ce al2o3 400 c ce al2o3 500 c and ce al2o3 600 c among which the al2o3 presents the lowest phenol removal at 50 min the phenol removal is increased after the addition of ce al2o3 and the ce al2o3 calcinated at 500 c presents the best catalytic activity given the essence for ozonation of organic pollutant is eletron transfer the addition of catalyst in ozonation is expected to increase electron transfer 30 therefore the cyclic voltammetry behavior of al2o3 and ce al2o3 calcinated at different temperatures are measured to testify the electron transfer property and the results are shown in fig 3 b the well defined cyclic voltammograms of al2o3 and ce al2o3 are observed the ce al2o3 presents better electron transfer property than al2o3 due to the higher of peak current and smaller electrical potential difference δep the increase of current and the decrease of δep follow the order al2o3 ce al2o3 400 c ce al2o3 600 c and ce al2o3 500 c the ce al2o3 calcinated at 500 c has the highest current peak and the lowest δep resulted from a labile cycle of ce3 ce4 which can be illustrated by xps fig 3 c the ce 3d xps spectra calibrated by c 1s peak designated at 284 6 ev are deconvoluted into six features for ce iv at 882 3 0 2 888 6 0 3 898 1 0 2 900 6 0 2 906 9 0 3 and 916 4 0 2 ev and two peaks for ce iii at 885 2 0 3 and 903 5 0 3 ev 19 31 displaying a good fitting with the experimental data the semi quantitative results listed in table s1 indicate that the ratio of ce3 ce4 varies with the calcination temperature and the ce al2o3 calcinated at 500 c is obviously endowed with the highest ce3 ce4 ratio corresponding to the best catalytic activity the o 1s spectra of ce al2o3 fig 3 d show that the peaks at 529 9 0 2 531 5 0 2 and 533 0 0 2 ev are assigned to the lattice oxygen hydroxyl and adsorbed h2o respectively 32 the ce al2o3 calcinated at 500 c contains the most abundant lattice oxygen species which render the reduction of ce4 to ce3 19 accompanying with the formation of oxygen vacancies by ce 4 o 2 ce 4 ce 3 ce 3 1 2 o 2 where represents the oxygen vacancy the h2 tpr is measured to investigate the reducibility of ce al2o3 fig 3 e the pronounced h2 desorption peaks at 650 c and 730 c demonstrate that the al2o3 is difficult to be reduced the initial reduction peak of ce al2o3 is lower than that of al2o3 due to the load of cerium oxide two reduction peaks of which center at 310 630 c and 615 885 c ascribing to the reduction of ce4 on the surface and the bulk of cerium oxide respectively 19 it is evidently that the initial reduction temperature of al2o3 and ce al2o3 decreases in the order of al2o3 ce al2o3 400 c ce al2o3 600 c ce al2o3 500 c stating that the interaction of cerium and porous alumina lowers the initial reduction peak and in fact improves the reducibility of ce al2o3 in brief the ce al2o3 catalyst with higher ce3 ce4 ratio and surface lattice oxygen has higher electron transfer property resulting in better catalytic activity for ozonation of phenol fig 3 a d 3 4 mechanism of ozonation catalyzed by ce al2o3 the free radicals produced in catalytic ozonation are evaluated by quenching experiments with tert butanol tba and po4 3 and the results are shown in fig 4 tert butanol as a typical oh scavenger has a high reaction rate constant of 6 108 m 1 s 1 with oh and a low reaction rate constant of 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 with o3 33 which mainly capture the oh in bulk solution po4 3 is a strong lewis base and has a strong affinity with lewis acid of catalyst to alleviate the surface reaction occurring on the surface of catalyst a 50 mg l tba causes the decrease of phenol removal by 4 4 mg l in ozonation and by 6 7 mg l in catalytic ozonation implying oh radicals are generated by ce al2o3 a 50 mg l po4 3 increases the phenol removal in ozonation due to the ph increase caused by the hydrolysis of po4 3 in solution but restrains the phenol removal in catalytic ozonation declaring that the surface reactions between reactants and ce al2o3 are inhibited fig 4 b therefore the phenol degradation by oh in catalytic ozonation occurs both on the surface of the catalyst and the bulk solution 32 the mechanism involving ozone decomposition to generated free radicals based on the cycle of ce3 ce4 is sketched in fig 5 ozone molecules diffuse from bulk solution to the liquid film covering on the surface of catalyst and capture the electrons from ce3 with a simultaneous oxidation of ce3 to ce4 thereafter the ce4 is reoxidized to ce3 by accepting electrons from lattice oxygen the electron transfer between ozone and ce al2o3 facilitates the ozone decomposition into free radicals to oxidize phenol the ce al2o3 is also used in photodegradation of phenol and the changes of valence state between ce3 and ce4 capture the photogenerated electrons to reduce the electron and hole recombination 34 that is the preferred catalysts are those with effective electron transfer in catalytic process 3 5 stability of ce al2o3 performance the performance stability is an important indicator to catalyst for its practical application a continuous flow test is conducted to evaluate the stability of ce al2o3 fig 6 a shows the inflow phenol concentration is 51 0 1 0 mg l and the outflow concentration in ozonation is 37 1 0 mg l with a removal efficiency of 27 4 whereas the outflow concentration after 200 h in catalytic ozonaiton is 27 1 0 mg l with the removal efficiency of 47 0 the catalytic performance of ce al2o3 tends to be stable after 200 h and the slowdown of the catalytic ozonation activity of ce al2o3 in the first 200 h are discussed based on the characterization of fresh and used catalyst xps fig 6 b and table s2 indicates that the ratio of ce3 ce4 on the used catalyst is 22 5 while the fresh one is 35 9 that is why ce al2o3 in the first 200 h shows a drop in catalytic performance the ftir spectra fig 6 c exhibit that two peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1693 cm 1 which are ascribed to the antisymmetric mode of c o for carboxylic acids or aldehydes and acetate salts are detected in the used catalyst other than fresh one indicating the coverage of ce al2o3 by the micromolecule organic acids from phenol degradation has an adverse effect on the catalytic ozonation of phenol as soon as the electron circle among ozone molecules catalyst and organics reaches equilibrium state the ce al2o3 presents in a stable performance 32 4 conclusions ce al2o3 has a good performance for catalytic ozonation of phenol in aqueous solution a higher ce3 ce4 ratio of ce al2o3 achieves a higher catalytic performance and thus the higher degradation efficiency of phenol the electron cycle composed by the electron donation from ce3 to ozone molecule and the electron acceptance of ce4 from adjacent lattice oxygen facilitates the ozone decomposition into free radicals to oxide phenol ce al2o3 exhibits a stable and high performance for catalytic ozonation implying a

resulting in better catalytic activity for ozonation of phenol fig 3 a d 3 4 mechanism of ozonation catalyzed by ce al2o3 the free radicals produced in catalytic ozonation are evaluated by quenching experiments with tert butanol tba and po4 3 and the results are shown in fig 4 tert butanol as a typical oh scavenger has a high reaction rate constant of 6 108 m 1 s 1 with oh and a low reaction rate constant of 3 10 3 m 1 s 1 with o3 33 which mainly capture the oh in bulk solution po4 3 is a strong lewis base and has a strong affinity with lewis acid of catalyst to alleviate the surface reaction occurring on the surface of catalyst a 50 mg l tba causes the decrease of phenol removal by 4 4 mg l in ozonation and by 6 7 mg l in catalytic ozonation implying oh radicals are generated by ce al2o3 a 50 mg l po4 3 increases the phenol removal in ozonation due to the ph increase caused by the hydrolysis of po4 3 in solution but restrains the phenol removal in catalytic ozonation declaring that the surface reactions between reactants and ce al2o3 are inhibited fig 4 b therefore the phenol degradation by oh in catalytic ozonation occurs both on the surface of the catalyst and the bulk solution 32 the mechanism involving ozone decomposition to generated free radicals based on the cycle of ce3 ce4 is sketched in fig 5 ozone molecules diffuse from bulk solution to the liquid film covering on the surface of catalyst and capture the electrons from ce3 with a simultaneous oxidation of ce3 to ce4 thereafter the ce4 is reoxidized to ce3 by accepting electrons from lattice oxygen the electron transfer between ozone and ce al2o3 facilitates the ozone decomposition into free radicals to oxidize phenol the ce al2o3 is also used in photodegradation of phenol and the changes of valence state between ce3 and ce4 capture the photogenerated electrons to reduce the electron and hole recombination 34 that is the preferred catalysts are those with effective electron transfer in catalytic process 3 5 stability of ce al2o3 performance the performance stability is an important indicator to catalyst for its practical application a continuous flow test is conducted to evaluate the stability of ce al2o3 fig 6 a shows the inflow phenol concentration is 51 0 1 0 mg l and the outflow concentration in ozonation is 37 1 0 mg l with a removal efficiency of 27 4 whereas the outflow concentration after 200 h in catalytic ozonaiton is 27 1 0 mg l with the removal efficiency of 47 0 the catalytic performance of ce al2o3 tends to be stable after 200 h and the slowdown of the catalytic ozonation activity of ce al2o3 in the first 200 h are discussed based on the characterization of fresh and used catalyst xps fig 6 b and table s2 indicates that the ratio of ce3 ce4 on the used catalyst is 22 5 while the fresh one is 35 9 that is why ce al2o3 in the first 200 h shows a drop in catalytic performance the ftir spectra fig 6 c exhibit that two peaks at 1450 cm 1 and 1693 cm 1 which are ascribed to the antisymmetric mode of c o for carboxylic acids or aldehydes and acetate salts are detected in the used catalyst other than fresh one indicating the coverage of ce al2o3 by the micromolecule organic acids from phenol degradation has an adverse effect on the catalytic ozonation of phenol as soon as the electron circle among ozone molecules catalyst and organics reaches equilibrium state the ce al2o3 presents in a stable performance 32 4 conclusions ce al2o3 has a good performance for catalytic ozonation of phenol in aqueous solution a higher ce3 ce4 ratio of ce al2o3 achieves a higher catalytic performance and thus the higher degradation efficiency of phenol the electron cycle composed by the electron donation from ce3 to ozone molecule and the electron acceptance of ce4 from adjacent lattice oxygen facilitates the ozone decomposition into free radicals to oxide phenol ce al2o3 exhibits a stable and high performance for catalytic ozonation implying a

aap has been recognized as a mature technology in the gas industry for treating acid gases such as co2 sox etc 25 27 in this respect the objective of this preliminary study at lab scale was to

digestion of animal manure by air stripping rendering simultaneously the anaerobic digestate as environmentally friendlier for agricultural land applications furthermore the alkaline aqueous effluent from the latter air stripping process is neutralized in an environmentally friendly manner while at the same time it also acts as a supplementary biogas scrubbing agent finally the additional advantage of this process is that no energy intensive regeneration step is required since ammonia is converted at ambient conditions to a useful end product fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1

anaerobic digestate and to precipitate the solids as a coagulation flocculation agent an elevated ph value of 12 0 0 1 was chosen for improved clarification of the anaerobic digestate and effective ammonia air stripping after sedimentation the solids were separated and the supernatant liquid was filtrated by a common filter details about the exact experimental procedure can be found elsewhere 12 28 2 3 air stripping of ammonia followed by water absorption 2 3 1 materials ammonia air stripping took place in a packed tower installation which consisted of a water jacketed glass column of a height of 1 35 m and an internal diameter of 8 cm glass made cylinders of the raschig ring type of a size of 1 cm and a thickness of 2 mm were utilized as the packing material the packing bed had a total height of 0 95 m temperature was maintained constant at 45 1 c by means of a water bath and an external water coil the water bath was also connected to a heat exchanger in order to pre heat the wastewater influent prior to its entrance into the packed tower an electric blower hiblow hp 120 and a peristaltic pump watson marlow 501u were utilized for air supply 3180 l h 1 standard value by the manufacturer and wastewater inflow 1 0 13 l h 1 respectively the end of the wastewater inlet pipe was connected to a hole tube for a better distribution of the wastewater on the packing material the aqueous effluent was collected from the bottom of the packed tower manually using a control valve finally lime treated anaerobic digestate was utilized as the inflow aqueous solution for the experiments in order to obtain an air flow of the highest possible in practice ammonia content corresponding to around 6 0 6 5 g l of ammonium in the anaerobic digestate the latter anaerobic digestate was enriched by adding ammonium chloride the ammonia rich air flow from the exit top of the air stripper was divided into two air flow lines the first line was guided into the atmosphere and the second one into the water scrubber installation at the bottom of the packed bed after it had been cooled down to around 20 1 c by a water glass coiled reflux condenser prior to entering the scrubber the volumetric air flow was regulated by means of air flow rotameters at 150 to 1500 l h 1 the wet scrubber packed tower consisted of a glass column of a total height of 70 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm constant recirculation of the aqueous ammonia solution at 0 5 1 0 l min 1 counter currently contacting the air was provided using a water pump the above described packing material raschig ring was also utilized while the packed bed height was equal to 20 cm deionized water was utilized to keep the ph of the recirculating aqueous ammonia solution at the desired value ph 11 5 11 8 by means of a ph regulator and a small peristaltic pump aqueous ammonia solutions at increasing concentrations 1 5 5 w v were collected from the bottom of the packed tower manually using a control valve in order to be utilized for the biogas scrubbing experiments the latter aqueous ammonia solutions were obtained by fixing the value of the ph regulator at the proper level finally ammonia concentration in the air flow was determined using the special ammonia dräger tubes made in germany the flowsheet and a photo of the air stripper wet scrubber installation are presented in fig 1 2 3 2 experimental procedure lime treated anaerobic digestate was initially introduced into the air stripper while the temperature was regulated at the desired level 45 1 c after initiating the air flow into the stripper at a gas to liquid ratio qair ql equal to 2000 and after stabilization of the operating temperature the system was left to operate for 15 min before taking air and aqueous effluent samples a time period that was more than enough for the system to reach steady state conditions aqueous effluent from the bottom of the air stripper was collected in order to be used for biogas scrubbing stripping factor s comprises one of the most important parameters of air stripping process eq 1 29 1 s q a i r q l h where h henry constant for ammonia dimensionless a function of temperature t kelvin given by eq 2 30 2 h 0 0006 e 4340 1 293 1 t in practice the stripping factor is usually regulated in the range s 3 5 14 29 hence a g l ratio equal to 2000 as in our case gives a very satisfactory value to the stripping factor as derived by eqs 1 and 2 s 3 84 for t 45 c part of the ammonia rich air flow from the above air stripping process and after it had been cooled down to 20 1 c was directed to the bottom of the scrubber s packing bed at 1500 l h 1 till the ph of the recirculating water in the scrubber reached the value of 10 0 1 corresponding to an aqueous ammonia concentration of 0 001 w v the ph was thereafter kept constant by means of the ph regulator and deionized water the experimental run continued by investigating ammonia absorption in the scrubber under constant ph 10 0 1 air samples from the top of the scrubber were analyzed for ammonia concentration at several volumetric air flow values 10 min of continues operation at the desired volumetric air flow value was more than enough for the system to reach steady state conditions the ph of the recirculating aqueous ammonia solution was then fixed at increasing values ph 11 5 11 8 and the system was operated at high air flow 1500 l h 1 until adequate amounts of concentrated aqueous ammonia solutions were collected 1 5 and 5 w v highly concentrated aqueous ammonia 25 w w was also added in the recirculating solution for faster production of the latter ammonia solutions due to low air flow rate finally absorption of gaseous ammonia was once more investigated at a high aqueous ammonia concentration this time 5 w v it s been well established that during the absorption process gas film resistance controls for highly soluble gases 31 ammonia as indeed a highly soluble gas has its main resistance in the gas phase taking into account the above fact and assuming steady state conditions as well as ammonia being an ideal gas the following simplified equation can be applied for the calculation of ammonia s overall mass transfer coefficient kg α eq 3 after solving the respective mass balance equation this is a case of a fast reaction in liquid film with high reactant concentration dissolved gaseous

scrubbing of biogas by co2 and h2s chemical absorption 2 4 1 materials the above described air stripper installation fig 1 was converted to a wet scrubber set up temperature was maintained constant at 25 1 c this time by means of the water bath and the external water coil the aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v and the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate counter currently contacted the gas phase and were then collected from the bottom of the packed tower synthetic gas 80 n2 20 co2 as well as real biogas from the anaerobic digestion pilot plant pfr were utilized for the study a pressure regulator and air flow rotameters were employed to inject the synthetic gas into the wet scrubber set up at the desired volumetric air flow while the scrubbed gas was then rejected into the atmosphere moreover real biogas was collected in special 400 l bags an air pump was employed in order to inject the biogas into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 the flowsheet of the wet scrubber set up is presented in fig 2 2 4 2 experimental procedure the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate was initially introduced into the wet scrubber installation at a constant flowrate 12 3 l h 1 the synthetic gas was then injected into the above scrubber installation at different volumetric flow rates 150 to 1500 l h 1 at each volumetric gas flow rate the system was left to run for at least 10 min air samples were then collected from the exit top of the wet scrubber in order to be analyzed for carbon dioxide concentration using a biogas analyzer gas data gfm435 made in uk samples from the aqueous effluent were also selected from the bottom of the wet scrubber and their ph was recorded the above experiments were then repeated using this time real biogas at constant volumetric air flow 1000 l h 1 apart from carbon dioxide hydrogen sulfide h2s concentration was also determined in the air samples by the above mentioned biogas analyzer gas data gfm435 finally the synthetic and real biogas scrubbing experiments were repeated utilizing this time the aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v the extent of total ammonia slip was also reported in the latter experiments by analyzing the ammonia concentration in the air exit using the special ammonia dräger tubes 2 5 wastewater analytical methods apha standard methods 32 were utilized for wastewater raw and treated anaerobic digestate physicochemical analysis total alkalinity was measured by titration with standardized sulfuric acid h2so4 solution using end point indicator methyl orange and or a ph meter hanna hi 83141 cod was calculated using a cod digestion unit velp scientifica according to the open reflux method titration with ferrous ammonium sulphate was preferred over photometric analysis 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 air stripping of ammonia followed by water absorption air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate resulted in the production of an ammonia rich air flow with a concentration of 4000 100 ppm ammonia in the air was measured 4 times during the course of the experiment giving a constant value moreover the air stripping aqueous effluent was almost totally depleted of ammonia over 99 absorption of ammonia in the wet scrubber by deionized water was then investigated at a continuous mode and at ambient conditions p 1 atm t 20 1 c furthermore the latter absorption process was investigated at a low and a high aqueous ammonia concentration 0 001 and 5 w v respectively although the packed bed height was relatively small 20 cm high absorption efficiency was demonstrated by the scrubber set up as shown in fig 3 a over 90 in the diluted aqueous ammonia solution and 42 75 in the concentrated one for all volumetric air flow rates incorporating all the respective experimental data in eq 3 ammonia overall mass transfer coefficient kgα was calculated at several volumetric air flow values for the two different aqueous ammonia concentrations fig 3b as expected kgα increased substantially by increasing the volumetric air flow rate moreover kgα was approximated as a function of superficial air velocity with a high degree of accuracy fig 3b the kgα coefficient varied with air velocity to the n power where n ranged from 0 505 to 0 885 this range is close enough to the exponents reported in literature 33 36 as also expected performing the experiment at a high aqueous ammonia concentration 5 w v as opposed to 0 001 w v resulted in much lower kgα values due to substantial decrease of the ammonia mass transfer driving force hence at 5 w v the concentration of dissolved gaseous ammonia in the aqueous phase became important and so did liquid bulk resistance leading so to reduced kgα values 31 from eq 4 and for an air flow rate qair of 1500 l h 1 the packed bed height of the wet scrubber fig 1 for almost complete ammonia capture e g 5 ppm of ammonia in air exit is equal to 0 53 m and 2 35 m for aqueous ammonia solution of 0 001 w v ph 10 0 0 1 and 5 w v ph 11 6 0 1 respectively taking into consideration the above experimental results it is evident that extracting ammonia from lime treated anaerobic digestate and producing an aqueous ammonia solution of the desired concentration is indeed technically feasible the total volumetric flow of the latter solution depends entirely upon the volumetric flow of the anaerobic digestate its respective ammonia concentration and the concentration of the final aqueous ammonia solution the latter experimental data will be used for the design of a semi industrial air stripper wet scrubber installation targeting at total ammonia capture and at the production of an aqueous ammonia solution that will be used for the upgrading of biogas 3 4 semi industrial plant operation design 3 2 air stripping aqueous effluent neutralization by co2 absorption synthetic gas 80 n2 20 co2 was initially used at increasing volumetric flow rate in order to study co2 absorption and the respective neutralization of the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate as demonstrated in fig 4 the latter air stripping aqueous effluent can be neutralized ph 8 5 0 1 even at the minimum synthetic gas flow rate concurrently and as expected absorption of co2 reaches its maximum efficiency 36 increasing synthetic gas flow rate results in the decreasing of co2 absorption while the ph of the aqueous effluent reaches its minimum possible value ph 6 8 0 1 real biogas 62 ch4 38 co2 h2s 1880 ppm was also pumped into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 resulting in total neutralization of the aqueous effluent ph 6 8 0 1 as in the above case synthetic gas carbon dioxide absorption rate was only minor less than 0 5 however the concentration of hydrogen sulphide h2s was drastically reduced 100 ppm neutralization of the ammonia air stripping aqueous effluent by real biogas seems indeed to be a very cost effective and environmentally friendly technique 3 3 absorption of co2 in aqueous ammonia solutions biogas scrubbing the aqueous ammonia solution of 1 5 w v was initially utilized in order to scrub the synthetic gas fig 5 a presents the results of carbon dioxide absorption at an increasing gas to liquid volumetric flow rate ratio while the drop of the aqueous effluent ph is respectively demonstrated in fig 5b less than 1 of carbon dioxide remained in the synthetic gas at a low gas flow rate 150 l h 1 while an absorption efficiency of more than 50 was depicted at the highest gas flow rate 1500 l h 1 from fig 5b it is evident that the remaining alkaline aqueous effluent with a ph 9 5 even at the highest gas flow rate has the potential of greater absorption efficiency e g by increasing the packed bed height finally an ammonia slip of 150 500 ppm was recorded by increasing gas flow rate from 150 to 1500 l h 1 respectively real biogas 62 ch4 38 co2 h2s 1880 ppm was then introduced into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 upgraded biogas exited the wet scrubber having a composition of 86 ch4 14 co2 while the ph of the aqueous effluent dropped down to the value of 9 70 the latter results come in straight accordance with the above synthetic gas experiment fig 5 furthermore hydrogen sulphide was completely removed all the above experiments were then repeated using this time the 5 w v aqueous ammonia solution almost complete carbon dioxide absorption was observed at all gas to liquid volumetric flow rate ratios utilizing the synthetic gas fig 6 a while the ph of the aqueous effluent remained high at all times ph 10 20 fig 6b moreover real biogas was entirely converted to biomethane 99 ch4 1 co2 with also total removal of hydrogen sulphide however a higher amount of gaseous ammonia escaped this time from the exit of the wet scrubber from 2500 ppm at low gas flow rate to 10 000 ppm at the highest flow rate 3 4 semi industrial plant operation design apart from the 50 kw pilot plant pfr that has been already under operation for about a year now a 250 kw semi industrial plant is currently under construction in the local industrial area xanthi greece the latter semi industrial plant is also targeting at the production of biogas by the anaerobic digestion of animal manure mixtures in a 350 m3 plug flow reactor based upon the above experimental results a simulation of the real operational conditions of ammonia air stripper wet scrubber and biogas wet scrubber units is given in the flowsheets of fig 7 and fig 8 the construction of the above flowsheets is based on the following parameters anaerobic digestate flow rate ql 120 m3 d 1 5 m3 h 1 biogas flow rate qbg 3000 m3 d 1 125 m3

efficiency 90 ammonia wet scrubber operational temperature 25 c ammonia capture in wet scrubber 100 biogas wet scrubber unit operational conditions ambient ammonia concentration varies depending on the type of animal manure mixture the above value 2 g l 1 was chosen as future average concentration in the anaerobic digestate condensed water from cooling the hot air stripping flow comprises roughly 2 3 of the water amount needed for the production of the aqueous ammonia solution therefore condensed water is designed to be recycled fig 7 the 1 5 w v aqueous ammonia solution was preferred due to less ammonia slip problems the air stripping alkaline aqueous effluent is expected to capture ammonia entirely from biogas in the respective wet scrubber unit fig 8 however and for safety reasons an acid scrubber utilizing dilute sulphuric acid was added in the end of the wet scrubbing line ensuring total ammonia capture in order to maximize scrubbing efficiency and to avoid flooding problems the air stripping aqueous effluent was split into 5 equal flowrate lines one for each wet scrubber the biogas after passing through all the wet scrubber towers is then dehydrated in a cooling system finally it passes through an activated carbon column before combustion fig 8 furthermore experiments proved that by adding ferrous sulphate in the animal manure mixture 500 mg kg cod before the anaerobic digestion hydrogen sulphide h2s concentration in biogas can be kept at a low level 500 600 ppm according to our lab experimental results the upgraded biogas is expected to reach a composition of at least 85 ch4 15 co2 and to be clear of hydrogen sulphide adding minor quantities of caustic soda solution in the air stripping aqueous effluent would ensure the above expected results fig 8 ammonium bicarbonate aqueous solution is produced in the first wet scrubber where aqueous ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide due to the unstable nature of the latter chemical compound and the possible threat to the environment this chemical is considered hazardous by the 2012 osha hazard communication standard 29 cfr 1910 1200 37 a decision was made to convert it to the more stable and environmentally safe ammonium sulphate solution reacting with sulphuric acid solution in an open to atmosphere fast stirring tank fig 8 presenting the technical details of the latter flowsheets fig 7 and 8 would be out of the scope of this paper full description of the 250 kw semi industrial plant operation will be given in a future publication 4 conclusions aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v were produced from air stripping of a lime treated anaerobic digestate from the anaerobic digestion of animal manure utilizing pure deionized water as the scrubbing agent the latter aqueous ammonia solutions proved very effective acting as biogas scrubbers absorbing carbon dioxide substantially over 90 while removing hydrogen sulfide completely the alkaline aqueous effluent of the air stripping process was neutralized by the biogas in a cost effective and an environmentally friendly manner the latter air stripping aqueous effluent can also be utilized as a supplementary scrubbing

aap has been recognized as a mature technology in the gas industry for treating acid gases such as co2 sox etc 25 27 in this respect the objective of this preliminary study at lab scale was to investigate the performance of aqueous ammonia as scrubbing agent for the upgrading of biogas removing both co2 and h2s moreover ammonia was extracted from the same biogas producing process anaerobic digestion of animal manure by air stripping rendering simultaneously the anaerobic digestate as environmentally friendlier for agricultural land applications furthermore the alkaline aqueous effluent from the latter air stripping process is neutralized in an environmentally friendly manner while at the same time it also acts as a supplementary biogas scrubbing agent finally the additional advantage of this process is that no energy intensive regeneration step is required since ammonia is converted at ambient conditions to a useful end product fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1

months of operation dec 2019 jan 2020 are given in table 1 2 2 lime treatment solids settling commercial hydrated lime ca oh 2 in the form of a 50 solids slurry was utilized to raise the ph of the anaerobic digestate and to precipitate the solids as a coagulation flocculation agent an elevated ph value of 12 0 0 1 was chosen for improved clarification of the anaerobic digestate and effective ammonia air stripping after sedimentation the solids were separated and the supernatant liquid was filtrated by a common filter details about the exact experimental procedure can be found elsewhere 12 28 2 3 air stripping of ammonia followed by water absorption 2 3 1 materials ammonia air stripping took place in a packed tower installation which consisted of a water jacketed glass column of a height of 1 35 m and an internal diameter of 8 cm glass made cylinders of the raschig ring type of a size of 1 cm and a thickness of 2 mm were utilized as the packing material the packing bed had a total height of 0 95 m temperature was maintained constant at 45 1 c by means of a water bath and an external water coil the water bath was also connected to a heat exchanger in order to pre heat the wastewater influent prior to its entrance into the packed tower an electric blower hiblow hp 120 and a peristaltic pump watson marlow 501u were utilized for air supply 3180 l h 1 standard value by the manufacturer and wastewater inflow 1 0 13 l h 1 respectively the end of the wastewater inlet pipe was connected to a hole tube for a better distribution of the wastewater on the packing material the aqueous effluent was collected from the bottom of the packed tower manually using a control valve finally lime treated anaerobic digestate was utilized as the inflow aqueous solution for the experiments in order to obtain an air flow of the highest possible in practice ammonia content corresponding to around 6 0 6 5 g l of ammonium in the anaerobic digestate the latter anaerobic digestate was enriched by adding ammonium chloride the ammonia rich air flow from the exit top of the air stripper was divided into two air flow lines the first line was guided into the atmosphere and the second one into the water scrubber installation at the bottom of the packed bed after it had been cooled down to around 20 1 c by a water glass coiled reflux condenser prior to entering the scrubber the volumetric air flow was regulated by means of air flow rotameters at 150 to 1500 l h 1 the wet scrubber packed tower consisted of a glass column of a total height of 70 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm constant recirculation of the aqueous ammonia solution at 0 5 1 0 l min 1 counter currently contacting the air was provided using a water pump the above described packing material raschig ring was also utilized while the packed bed height was equal to 20 cm deionized water was utilized to keep the ph of the recirculating aqueous ammonia solution at the desired value ph 11 5 11 8 by means of a ph regulator and a small peristaltic pump aqueous ammonia solutions at increasing concentrations 1 5 5 w v were collected from the bottom of the packed tower manually using a control valve in order to be utilized for the biogas scrubbing experiments the latter aqueous ammonia solutions were obtained by fixing the value of the ph regulator at the proper level finally ammonia concentration in the air flow was determined using the special ammonia dräger tubes made in germany the flowsheet and a photo of the air stripper wet scrubber installation are presented in fig 1 2 3 2 experimental procedure lime treated anaerobic digestate was initially introduced into the air stripper while the temperature was regulated at the desired level 45 1 c after initiating the air flow into the stripper at a gas to liquid ratio qair ql equal to 2000 and after stabilization of the operating temperature the system was left to operate for 15 min before taking air and aqueous effluent samples a time period that was more than enough for the system to reach steady state conditions aqueous effluent from the bottom of the air stripper was collected in order to be used for biogas scrubbing stripping factor s comprises one of the most important parameters of air stripping process eq 1 29 1 s q a i r q l h where h henry constant for ammonia dimensionless a function of temperature t kelvin given by eq 2 30 2 h 0 0006 e 4340 1 293 1 t in practice the stripping factor is usually regulated in the range s 3 5 14 29 hence a g l ratio equal to 2000 as in our case gives a very satisfactory value to the stripping factor as derived by eqs 1 and 2 s 3 84 for t 45 c part of the ammonia rich air flow from the above air stripping process and after it had been cooled down to 20 1 c was directed to the bottom of the scrubber s packing bed at 1500 l h 1 till the ph of the recirculating water in the scrubber reached the value of 10 0 1 corresponding to an aqueous ammonia concentration of 0 001 w v the ph was thereafter kept constant by means of the ph regulator and deionized water the experimental run continued by investigating ammonia absorption in the scrubber under constant ph 10 0 1 air samples from the top of the scrubber were analyzed for ammonia concentration at several volumetric air flow values 10 min of continues operation at the desired volumetric air flow value was more than enough for the system to reach steady state conditions the ph of the recirculating aqueous ammonia solution was then fixed at increasing values ph 11 5 11 8 and the system was operated at high air flow 1500 l h 1 until adequate amounts of concentrated aqueous ammonia solutions were collected 1 5 and 5 w v highly concentrated aqueous ammonia 25 w w was also added in the recirculating solution for faster production of the latter ammonia solutions due to low air flow rate finally absorption of gaseous ammonia was once more investigated at a high aqueous ammonia concentration this time 5 w v it s been well established that during the absorption process gas film resistance controls for highly soluble gases 31 ammonia as indeed a highly soluble gas has its main resistance in the gas phase taking into account the above fact and assuming steady state conditions as well as ammonia being an ideal gas the following simplified equation can be applied for the calculation of ammonia s overall mass transfer coefficient kg α eq 3 after solving the respective mass balance equation this is a case of a fast reaction in liquid film with high reactant concentration dissolved gaseous

scrubbing of biogas by co2 and h2s chemical absorption 2 4 1 materials the above described air stripper installation fig 1 was converted to a wet scrubber set up temperature was maintained constant at 25 1 c this time by means of the water bath and the external water coil the aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v and the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate counter currently contacted the gas phase and were then collected from the bottom of the packed tower synthetic gas 80 n2 20 co2 as well as real biogas from the anaerobic digestion pilot plant pfr were utilized for the study a pressure regulator and air flow rotameters were employed to inject the synthetic gas into the wet scrubber set up at the desired volumetric air flow while the scrubbed gas was then rejected into the atmosphere moreover real biogas was collected in special 400 l bags an air pump was employed in order to inject the biogas into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 the flowsheet of the wet scrubber set up is presented in fig 2 2 4 2 experimental procedure the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate was initially introduced into the wet scrubber installation at a constant flowrate 12 3 l h 1 the synthetic gas was then injected into the above scrubber installation at different volumetric flow rates 150 to 1500 l h 1 at each volumetric gas flow rate the system was left to run for at least 10 min air samples were then collected from the exit top of the wet scrubber in order to be analyzed for carbon dioxide concentration using a biogas analyzer gas data gfm435 made in uk samples from the aqueous effluent were also selected from the bottom of the wet scrubber and their ph was recorded the above experiments were then repeated using this time real biogas at constant volumetric air flow 1000 l h 1 apart from carbon dioxide hydrogen sulfide h2s concentration was also determined in the air samples by the above mentioned biogas analyzer gas data gfm435 finally the synthetic and real biogas scrubbing experiments were repeated utilizing this time the aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v the extent of total ammonia slip was also reported in the latter experiments by analyzing the ammonia concentration in the air exit using the special ammonia dräger tubes 2 5 wastewater analytical methods apha standard methods 32 were utilized for wastewater raw and treated anaerobic digestate physicochemical analysis total alkalinity was measured by titration with standardized sulfuric acid h2so4 solution using end point indicator methyl orange and or a ph meter hanna hi 83141 cod was calculated using a cod digestion unit velp scientifica according to the open reflux method titration with ferrous ammonium sulphate was preferred over photometric analysis 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 air stripping of ammonia followed by water absorption air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate resulted in the production of an ammonia rich air flow with a concentration of 4000 100 ppm ammonia in the air was measured 4 times during the course of the experiment giving a constant value moreover the air stripping aqueous effluent was almost totally depleted of ammonia over 99 absorption of ammonia in the wet scrubber by deionized water was then investigated at a continuous mode and at ambient conditions p 1 atm t 20 1 c furthermore the latter absorption process was investigated at a low and a high aqueous ammonia concentration 0 001 and 5 w v respectively although the packed bed height was relatively small 20 cm high absorption efficiency was demonstrated by the scrubber set up as shown in fig 3 a over 90 in the diluted aqueous ammonia solution and 42 75 in the concentrated one for all volumetric air flow rates incorporating all the respective experimental data in eq 3 ammonia overall mass transfer coefficient kgα was calculated at several volumetric air flow values for the two different aqueous ammonia concentrations fig 3b as expected kgα increased substantially by increasing the volumetric air flow rate moreover kgα was approximated as a function of superficial air velocity with a high degree of accuracy fig 3b the kgα coefficient varied with air velocity to the n power where n ranged from 0 505 to 0 885 this range is close enough to the exponents reported in literature 33 36 as also expected performing the experiment at a high aqueous ammonia concentration 5 w v as opposed to 0 001 w v resulted in much lower kgα values due to substantial decrease of the ammonia mass transfer driving force hence at 5 w v the concentration of dissolved gaseous ammonia in the aqueous phase became important and so did liquid bulk resistance leading so to reduced kgα values 31 from eq 4 and for an air flow rate qair of 1500 l h 1 the packed bed height of the wet scrubber fig 1 for almost complete ammonia capture e g 5 ppm of ammonia in air exit is equal to 0 53 m and 2 35 m for aqueous ammonia solution of 0 001 w v ph 10 0 0 1 and 5 w v ph 11 6 0 1 respectively taking into consideration the above experimental results it is evident that extracting ammonia from lime treated anaerobic digestate and producing an aqueous ammonia solution of the desired concentration is indeed technically feasible the total volumetric flow of the latter solution depends entirely upon the volumetric flow of the anaerobic digestate its respective ammonia concentration and the concentration of the final aqueous ammonia solution the latter experimental data will be used for the design of a semi industrial air stripper wet scrubber installation targeting at total ammonia capture and at the production of an aqueous ammonia solution that will be used for the upgrading of biogas 3 4 semi industrial plant operation design 3 2 air stripping aqueous effluent neutralization by co2 absorption synthetic gas 80 n2 20 co2 was initially used at increasing volumetric flow rate in order to study co2 absorption and the respective neutralization of the alkaline aqueous effluent from air stripping of the lime treated anaerobic digestate as demonstrated in fig 4 the latter air stripping aqueous effluent can be neutralized ph 8 5 0 1 even at the minimum synthetic gas flow rate concurrently and as expected absorption of co2 reaches its maximum efficiency 36 increasing synthetic gas flow rate results in the decreasing of co2 absorption while the ph of the aqueous effluent reaches its minimum possible value ph 6 8 0 1 real biogas 62 ch4 38 co2 h2s 1880 ppm was also pumped into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 resulting in total neutralization of the aqueous effluent ph 6 8 0 1 as in the above case synthetic gas carbon dioxide absorption rate was only minor less than 0 5 however the concentration of hydrogen sulphide h2s was drastically reduced 100 ppm neutralization of the ammonia air stripping aqueous effluent by real biogas seems indeed to be a very cost effective and environmentally friendly technique 3 3 absorption of co2 in aqueous ammonia solutions biogas scrubbing the aqueous ammonia solution of 1 5 w v was initially utilized in order to scrub the synthetic gas fig 5 a presents the results of carbon dioxide absorption at an increasing gas to liquid volumetric flow rate ratio while the drop of the aqueous effluent ph is respectively demonstrated in fig 5b less than 1 of carbon dioxide remained in the synthetic gas at a low gas flow rate 150 l h 1 while an absorption efficiency of more than 50 was depicted at the highest gas flow rate 1500 l h 1 from fig 5b it is evident that the remaining alkaline aqueous effluent with a ph 9 5 even at the highest gas flow rate has the potential of greater absorption efficiency e g by increasing the packed bed height finally an ammonia slip of 150 500 ppm was recorded by increasing gas flow rate from 150 to 1500 l h 1 respectively real biogas 62 ch4 38 co2 h2s 1880 ppm was then introduced into the wet scrubber at a flow rate of 1000 l h 1 upgraded biogas exited the wet scrubber having a composition of 86 ch4 14 co2 while the ph of the aqueous effluent dropped down to the value of 9 70 the latter results come in straight accordance with the above synthetic gas experiment fig 5 furthermore hydrogen sulphide was completely removed all the above experiments were then repeated using this time the 5 w v aqueous ammonia solution almost complete carbon dioxide absorption was observed at all gas to liquid volumetric flow rate ratios utilizing the synthetic gas fig 6 a while the ph of the aqueous effluent remained high at all times ph 10 20 fig 6b moreover real biogas was entirely converted to biomethane 99 ch4 1 co2 with also total removal of hydrogen sulphide however a higher amount of gaseous ammonia escaped this time from the exit of the wet scrubber from 2500 ppm at low gas flow rate to 10 000 ppm at the highest flow rate 3 4 semi industrial plant operation design apart from the 50 kw pilot plant pfr that has been already under operation for about a year now a 250 kw semi industrial plant is currently under construction in the local industrial area xanthi greece the latter semi industrial plant is also targeting at the production of biogas by the anaerobic digestion of animal manure mixtures in a 350 m3 plug flow reactor based upon the above experimental results a simulation of the real operational conditions of ammonia air stripper wet scrubber and biogas wet scrubber units is given in the flowsheets of fig 7 and fig 8 the construction of the above flowsheets is based on the following parameters anaerobic digestate flow rate ql 120 m3 d 1 5 m3 h 1 biogas flow rate qbg 3000 m3 d 1 125 m3 h 1 ammonia concentration in anaerobic digestate 2 g l 1 air stripper operational temperature 45 c air to liquid anaerobic digestate volumetric flow rate ratio qair ql 2000 ammonia air stripping efficiency 90 ammonia wet scrubber operational temperature 25 c ammonia capture in wet scrubber 100 biogas wet scrubber unit operational conditions ambient ammonia concentration varies depending on the type of animal manure mixture the above value 2 g l 1 was chosen as future average concentration in the anaerobic digestate condensed water from cooling the hot air stripping flow comprises roughly 2 3 of the water amount needed for the production of the aqueous ammonia solution therefore condensed water is designed to be recycled fig 7 the 1 5 w v aqueous ammonia solution was preferred due to less ammonia slip problems the air stripping alkaline aqueous effluent is expected to capture ammonia entirely from biogas in the respective wet scrubber unit fig 8 however and for safety reasons an acid scrubber utilizing dilute sulphuric acid was added in the end of the wet scrubbing line ensuring total ammonia capture in order to maximize scrubbing efficiency and to avoid flooding problems the air stripping aqueous effluent was split into 5 equal flowrate lines one for each wet scrubber the biogas after passing through all the wet scrubber towers is then dehydrated in a cooling system finally it passes through an activated carbon column before combustion fig 8 furthermore experiments proved that by adding ferrous sulphate in the animal manure mixture 500 mg kg cod before the anaerobic digestion hydrogen sulphide h2s concentration in biogas can be kept at a low level 500 600 ppm according to our lab experimental results the upgraded biogas is expected to reach a composition of at least 85 ch4 15 co2 and to be clear of hydrogen sulphide adding minor quantities of caustic soda solution in the air stripping aqueous effluent would ensure the above expected results fig 8 ammonium bicarbonate aqueous solution is produced in the first wet scrubber where aqueous ammonia reacts with carbon dioxide due to the unstable nature of the latter chemical compound and the possible threat to the environment this chemical is considered hazardous by the 2012 osha hazard communication standard 29 cfr 1910 1200 37 a decision was made to convert it to the more stable and environmentally safe ammonium sulphate solution reacting with sulphuric acid solution in an open to atmosphere fast stirring tank fig 8 presenting the technical details of the latter flowsheets fig 7 and 8 would be out of the scope of this paper full description of the 250 kw semi industrial plant operation will be given in a future publication 4 conclusions aqueous ammonia solutions 1 5 and 5 w v were produced from air stripping of a lime treated anaerobic digestate from the anaerobic digestion of animal manure utilizing pure deionized water as the scrubbing agent the latter aqueous ammonia solutions proved very effective acting as biogas scrubbers absorbing carbon dioxide substantially over 90 while removing hydrogen sulfide completely the alkaline aqueous effluent of the air stripping process was neutralized by the biogas in a cost effective and an environmentally friendly manner the latter air stripping aqueous effluent can also be utilized as a supplementary scrubbing agent removing co2 and h2s partially while it can also capture ammonia that escapes from the first wet scrubber stage based upon the experimental data the flowsheets of ammonia air stripping wet

14012,the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethazine smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation was studied the results exhibited that bi2o3 tio2 pac composite prepared by two stage calcination method contained of rutile and anatase mixed crystal phases and it had visible light response capability in addition bi2o3 tio2 pac had a certain adsorption capacity for smx sdz and smt and its saturated adsorption mass was 30 88 11 28 and 26 24 mg g respectively compared to photolysis and adsorption process the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the three sulfonamides were significantly improved and more than 99 of photocatalytic degradation efficiency was achieved the epr measurements showed that both hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 were produced in the photocatalytic process however trapping experiments confirmed that photo generated hole h played a lead role in the photocatalytic degradation of smx contrarily the o2 was the main oxidative species for sdz and smt degradation furthermore the effects of initial ph of solution sodium bicarbonate humic acid and natural water lake and river water on the photocatalytic degradation were investigated the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamides were discussed there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring extrusion of so2 while similar pathways existed in the process of sulfanilamide degradation such as the breaking of sn bond and the cracking of n containing benzene ring keywords solar light sulfonamides photocatalytic degradation pathway bi2o3 tio2 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in industrial medical veterinary and agricultural fields due to their ability to selectively inhibit or affect the biological functions of animals plants and microorganisms at low concentrations 1 3 at present sulfonamide antibiotics are one of the common pollutants in surface water 4 6 the use of sulfonamides is causing unexpected harm to the environment 5 when sulfonamides enter the environment they will lead to drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria and cause extremely serious harm to aquatic organisms in the environment and even human health 7 8 in recent years in order to remove trace sulfonamide antibiotics from water environment researchers have developed a variety of treatment methods including biological physical and chemical oxidation 9 10 compared with other methods chemical oxidation methods mainly achieve the purpose of degrading pollutants through chemical reactions which can completely degrade pollutants without producing drug resistant bacteria 11 chemical oxidation mainly employs redox reaction to remove pollutants to achieve water purification including ozone oxidation fenton technology and photocatalytic technology 12 14 ozone oxidation can be directly selective oxidation of organic pollutants with special functional group which can be decomposed and generate a strong oxidizing hydroxyl radicals to degradation of pollutants 15 however ozone is unstable and easy to produce the secondary pollution such as bromate and endanger human body health 16 18 compared with ozone fenton oxidation is not affected by external conditions and the reaction is easy to control which facilitates the removal of micro pollutants in the water environment 19 but a homogeneous fenton system requires a very low ph condition while the non homogeneous system will produce a lot of iron sludge which will increase the subsequent treatment cost 20 21 compared with other advanced oxidation process aops semiconductor photocatalytic technology is a rapidly emerging water treatment technology which has the advantages of less energy consumption low cost non toxic and light secondary pollution and is considered to be the most promising green environmental protection technology 22 24 however in the current photocatalytic technology the light source used is divided into uv light and visible light because the ratio of visible light in solar light is much higher than that of uv 25 26 hence the development of photocatalysts with visible light response is the key to realize the application of photocatalytic technology in addition the commonly used photocatalysts such as nano tio2 are difficult to separate in water 27 28 therefore in previous studies we developed a photocatalysts with bismuth oxide doped tio2 supported on activated carbon which has photocatalytic degradation efficiency for smt in water under visible light irradiation 29 however due to the differences in functional groups of sulfonamides their own properties are different 30 therefore different aops also have great differences in the degradation characteristics and bond breaking positions of sulfonamides dong et al degraded sulfamethazine by chlorination method 8 and the degradation pathway was completely different from the research of agi bi4v2o11 photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethazine 7 furthermore the mechanism and efficiency of the same phocatalytic oxidation technology for the degradation of different sulfonamides are different song et al used g c3n4 photocatalytic degradation of four sulfadiazines among which the degradation efficiency and mechanism of pyrimidines were completely different from oxazoles 31 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanism of action of bi2o3 tio2 pac on different types of sulfonamides and the effect of water quality conditions on their degradation efficiency this can provide a research basis for the subsequent improvement of material properties of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite and the removal of sulfonamides from actual water bodies by combining with other water treatment processes and provide necessary support for engineering applications in this study in order to clarify the mechanism on the degradation of sulfonamides in water and improve its photocatalytic degradation efficiency bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was prepared by sol hydrothermal two stage calcination the smx sdz and smt were used as target pollutants to investigate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalyst with different water quality parameters by solar light irradiation furthermore the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of bi2o3 tio2 pac for different sulfonamides were explored and the degradation intermediate products and degradation pathway were analyzed so as to judge the difference of photocatalytic

phase of the lc ms was a 70 30 mixture of methanol and ultrapure water 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 to investigate reaction oxidation species epr spectra were collected at ambient temperature 25 c in duplicate or triplicate on a jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized bi2o3 tio2 pac the xrd patterns were adopted to identify the crystal phase of bi2o3 tio2 pac which results were showed in fig 1 a for the standard pdf card jcpds 71 1166 76 0323 88 1173 and 74 1633 the prepared bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was mainly consisted with anatase rutile mixed phase the percentage of rutile in the anatase rutile mixtures was ca 31 wt which was determined by spurrs and myer s equation 33 the content of bi2o3 phase was relatively low though it was also observed in xrd patterns in addition the pac was an amorphous phase in bi2o3 tio2 pac composite due to the calcination with high temperature the average crystal size of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was ca 48 nm which was estimated by scherrer s formula besides the band gap energy of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was 2 58 ev which determined from the formula plot of αhν 1 2 versus the photo energy hν 34 as showed in fig 1 b furthermore the results of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps brunauer emmett teller surface area and barrett joyner halenda pores size distribution bet bjh scanning electron microscope sem and high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem analysis were showed in supplementary document 3 2 role of bi2o3 tio2 pac in the photocatalytic degradation process in the process of degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics by bi2o3 tio2 pac except of the free radicals and holes generated by the catalyst irradiated by solar light to degrade target pollutants by oxidation photolysis of sulfonamide antibiotics under solar light and adsorption removal of the catalyst were also involved therefore in order to explore the role of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic oxidation in the degradation process of sulfonamide antibiotics we investigated the degradation effects of dark adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic oxidation under solar light irradiation after adsorption saturation on three kinds of antibiotics as shown in fig 2 as can be seen the three sulfonamides almost did not degrade when only solar light irradiation was used however when bi2o3 tio2 pac carried out dark adsorption reaction on three kinds of antibiotics the removal effect could reach 20 30 for fig 2 d the adsorption saturation time of bi2o3 tio2 pac on smx sdz and smt was about 30 min and the saturated adsorption mass was 30 88 11 28 and 26 24 mg g respectively in addition the concentration of all three pollutants decreased with the extension of reaction time by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic under the solar light irradiation after 30 min of reaction the smx degradation rate has reached about 100 however sdz degradation rate could reach 100 after 60 min of reaction while smt removal rate was only 75 the reason may be due to the differences in the self structure and characteristics of the three sulfonamides as well as the differences in the active oxygen species that play a major role in the photocatalytic degradation process 35 3 3 adsorption characteristics the adsorption process was influenced with the interaction controlled by the exchange and share of electrons between catalysts and smt 36 the adsorption kinetic processes of bi2o3 tio2 pac were fitted by pfo pso and intra particle diffusion the results were shown in fig 3 and table 1 the regression coefficient r2 of pso was greater than that of pfo and intra particle diffusion the saturated adsorption amount and reaction rate increase with the increase of the initial smt concentration when the pso was used to fit in summary the pso model satisfied the existing adsorption situation and the adsorption of active sites was more likely to be the dominant factor and the chemical reaction was the vital factor for adsorption the r2 of the intra particle diffusion was larger and the internal diffusion took up a certain proportion langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption process as shown in fig s6 and table s2 the r2 of langmuir and freundlich models can well describe the isothermal adsorption process of smt on prepared composite which indicated that monolayer adsorption and multilayer adsorption existed simultaneously the r2 of langmuir model was larger indicating that monolayer adsorption and surface adsorption predominated 37 3 4 main active species in the photocatalytic degradation process the identification of oh in aqueous solution was performed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr without adding contaminants as shown in the fig 4 a in the absence of solar light irradiation there was no characteristic peak corresponding to dmpo oh and in the erp spectrum indicated that no oh will be generated in the absence of light irradiation of bi2o3 tio2 pac however after solar light irradiation 20 s the epr spectrum with an intensity ration of 1 2 2 1 quartet signal was obvious observed which corresponded to the dmpo oh 38 meanwhile the o2 was identified in methanol solution the result was showed in the fig 4 b without solar light irradiation there was no signal attached by dmpo o2 emerged in epr spectrum while the result similarly to oh when the bi2o3 tio2 pac composite under solar light irradiation 20 s a four line special signal with intensity ration of 1 1 1 1 generated in epr spectrum 39 which corresponded to the peak of dmpo o2 this results indicated the oh and o2 were generated in bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic reaction process with solar light irradiation to investigate whether active oxygen free radicals in the process of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides are involved in the reaction the isopropyl alcohol ipa benzoquinone bq and disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 2na were added to the reaction system receptivity through the evaluation of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency to determine the oh o2 and h in bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of different sulfonamides under solar light irradiation 40 as can be seen from fig 4 c e the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac to sulfonamides under solar light irradiation can be inhibited by all three trapping agents and the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreased with the increase of the trapping agent dosage this result exhibited that oh o2 and h all played an important role in the process in photocatalytic degradation of three sulfonamides by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation but the three kinds of reactive oxygen species played a different role in the degradation of different sulfonamides the fitting results of the kinetic equations of photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides were shown in fig 5 and table 2 from the regression coefficient r2 of each reaction curve it can be seen that the photocatalytic degradation reaction was well described by the a pseudo first order kinetic model the influence of the type and concentration of trapping agents on the reaction rate k of photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides by bi2o3 tio2 pac was similar to that of the photocatalytic efficiency when bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degraded smx h played a major role relative to o2 and oh however when bi2o3 tio2 pac degraded sdz and smt the o2 played a greater role than h and oh 3 5 evaluation of photocatalytic degradation efficiencies 3 5 1 effect of solution ph solution ph plays an important role in the bi2o3 tio2 pac degradation of sulfonamides which can affect the oxidation capacity of the photocatalytic reaction system under the excitation of solar light irradiation the photo gendered electrons e of bi2o3 tio2 pac can jump to the conduction band thus generating h in the valence band then as shown in eq 9 dissolved oxygen in water can combine with e to form o2 in the presence of hydrogen ions h in an aqueous solution o2 combine with h and e to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which can eventually react with e to transform into oh as shown in eq 10 and 11 however when hydroxide ions oh are present in an aqueous solution h will also combine with oh to form oh as shown in eq 12 9 o2 e o2 10 o2 2h e h2o2 11 h2o2 e oh oh 12 h oh oh in order to investigate the influence of solution ph on bi2o3 tio2 pac on the solution of three sulfonamide antibiotics under solar light irradiation the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively for photocatalytic experiment and the results were shown in fig 6 when the initial ph of the solution changed between 3 0 and 11 0 the degradation efficiency of the three sulfonamides changed but the degrade rate of the three sulfonamide antibiotics could reach more than 85 as can be seen from fig 6 a the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smx decreased with the increase of the initial ph of the solution this is mainly due to ph affects the species and distribution of reactive oxygen species ros in the system and the existing form of smx resulting in different degradation efficiency of smx under different ph the h are the main reactive oxygen species in the degradation process of smx so when the ph of the solution increases the oh concentration in the aqueous solution increases eq 12 so that the reaction h with oh increase leading to a relative decrease in the number of h participating in the photocatalytic reaction although the increase of ph contributes to the increase of the content of oh it is not the main reactive oxygen species for smx degradation thus inhibiting the photocatalytic degradation efficiency on the contrary the photocatalytic degradation trend of sdz and smt was opposite to that of smx and their degradation efficiency increased with the increase of the initial ph of solution as shown in fig 6 b and c this is mainly because o2 is the main ros in the photocatalytic degradation of sdz and smt when the ph of the solution increases the concentration of h in the aqueous solution decreases thus reducing the consumption of o2 in the reaction with h showed in eq 10 leading to the relative increase of o2 in the photocatalytic reaction at the same time when the ph of solution increases the existing form of sulfonamide antibiotics gradually changes from positive ion form to negative ion form and the negative ion form of smt and sdz exhibit low photochemical activity and stable form 41 finally the degradation efficiency of sdz and smt increased with the increase of solution ph 3 5 2 effect of humic acid natural organic matter usually refers to the metabolites produced by decomposing plants and animals in the natural cycle mainly including tannic acid lignin and humic substances 42 humic substances has the highest content in surface water mainly including fulvic acid and humic acid ha ha generally exists widely in natural water and its content is relatively high some organic functional groups of ha can consume oxidants which will have a negative impact on the degradation effect therefore we took humic acid as an important factor to investigate its effect on photocatalytic degradation of different sulfonamide antibiotics in this experiment the effect of different ha dosage 0 0 5 2 5 mg l on photocatalytic degradation of bi2o3 tio2 pac on three sulfonamide antibiotics was investigated under the condition that the initial ph of the solution was 7 0 as can be seen from the fig 7 a c when the dosage of ha increased from 0 to 5 mg l the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and rate of the three sulfonamide antibiotics gradually decreased this may be due to the following reasons ha can compete with sulfanilamide antibiotics to ros produced by photocatalytic process 43 in addition ha can absorb photons the amount of photons utilized by bi2o3 tio2 pac is reduced which leads to the inhibition of subsequent photocatalytic reactions 44 furthermore because the photocatalytic reaction process conduction on the surface of the catalyst ha competed with sulfonamide antibiotics for adsorption by bi2o3 tio2 pac leading to a decrease in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics 45 although ha had an overall inhibitory effect on bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics the degradation efficiency of smx sdz and smt at the end of the photocatalytic reaction 60 90 and120 minutes at the dosage of 5 mg l of ha was more than 70 which indicated the high efficiency and robustness of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic system 3 5 3 effect of hco3 the hco3 is an inorganic anions commonly found existed in natural water which is also an important trapping agent for ros 46 it can react with oh as shown in eq 13 and 14 the hco3 can react with the oh to form the co3 compared with oh co3 has weak oxidation which generally leads to poor degradation effect in addition from eq 15 hco3 can also react with h to general co3 47 from the fig 8 when different concentrations of hco3 0 5 5 mm were added in the solution with initial ph of 7 0 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac in three sulfonamide antibiotics was studied as shown in fig 8 a the degradation rate of smx decreased when the concentration of hco3 increased from 0 mm to 5 mm on the one hand it may be because the h is the main ros for photocatalytic degradation of smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac the increase in the amount of hco3 increased the consumption of h while the oxidation capacity of generated co3 was weak so the conversion of h to co3 resulted in the reduction of smx degradation rate on the other hand the ph of the solution increased from 7 0 to 8 7 after added hco3 according to the influence rule of ph it can be seen that higher ph value can inhibit smx degradation on the contrary the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sdz and smt increased with the dosage of hco3 increased as shown in fig 8 b and c this may be due to the fact that oh is not the main ros for the degradation of sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac while the co3 generated in the reaction process is involved in the degradation of sdz and smt leading to the improvement of the degradation effect in addition the increase in ph leads to an increase in the content of oh which improves the photocatalytic degradation efficiency which has been discussed in the previous section for cl and so4 2 in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was shown in supplementary file and fig s7 13 hco3 oh co3 h2o 14 co3 2 oh co3 oh 15 hco3 h co3 3 5 4 effect of natural water in order to investigate the degradation effect of bi2o3 tio2 pac on sulfonamide antibiotics in natural water water samples were taken from tonghui river and lianshi lake of beijing respectively the fig 9 showed the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of three sulfonamide antibiotics by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation as can be seen from the fig 9 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac on smx sdz and smt in natural water is lower than that in deionized water this may be due to the complexity of organic compounds in natural water which compete with sulfanilamide antibiotics for ros thus inhibiting the degradation efficiency of sulfanilamide antibiotics in addition the degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics in lake water was higher than that in river water because the organic index of river water doc and uv254 was higher than that in lake water seen in fig s1 moreover high turbidity in river water will also increase light scattering thus reducing the utilization rate of bi2o3 tio2 pac to photons however the overall degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamide antibiotics in natural water is greater than 69 which indicated that bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic technology was feasible for the degradation of these substances in actual water bodies 3 6 identification of intermediates and comparison proposed degradation pathways in order to better understand the photocatalytic degradation process and mechanism of smx sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation the lc ms technology was used to identify the intermediate products of three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics in the reaction process in the photocatalytic degradation of smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac a total of six products were detected by gradient elution method as shown in fig s8 a total of 6 signal peaks were captured in esi mode among which four signal peaks 3 6 appeared in the 0 min sample where the base peak in the mass spectrum corresponding to signal peak 6 was m z 253 8 which was consistent with the molecular weight of smx the signal peak of 3 5 only decreases in the subsequent reaction indicating that it is likely to be the impurity in the sample in esi mode a total of seven signal peaks were captured but the response values of the signal peaks were all very low which made it difficult to accurately judge the base peaks through multiple argumentation only the structure of the signal peak 3 7 is inferred which is mutually verified with the ms spectra in esi mode the structural formulas of the five intermediate products a e were shown in table 3 in the process of photocatalytic degradation of sdz by bi2o3 tio2 pac it can be seen that six signal peaks detected in esi mode seen from figs s9 a and b the mass spectrum of peaks 1 2 and 3 had obvious ion peak while the mass spectrogram were m z 250 8 of the signal peaks for 4 5 and 6 molecular ion peaks of the sdz other ion peak response was very low in esi mode there were 4 distinct peaks among which only signal peak 1 corresponds to signal peak 3 in esi mode indicating that products of all other signal peaks 2 4 were containing sulfonic groups in the sample of 0 min the main signal peak detected by esi mode was signal peak 3 and the corresponding base peak in the ms was m z 250 8 and the substance was sdz in esi mode signal peaks of 1 3 and 4 were appeared where the base peak corresponding to signal peak 1 in ms was m z 248 7 which was the result of sdz h the base peak of the signal peak 3 corresponding to the ms was m z 171 8 considering that the molecule contains sulfonic groups it can be inferred that the product was p amino penzene sulfonic acid by combining with the possible bond breaking mode of sdz with the development of reaction time the response of signal peak 1 in esi mode was significantly enhanced indicating that new products were generated and the base peak in the corresponding ms diagram was m z 186 7 in addition the ion peak in the ms diagram corresponding to signal peak 2 in esi mode was m z 202 9 with a difference of one oxygen atom from m z 186 7 therefore the intermediates were five intermediates of f j as shown in table 3 as can be seen from fig s10 in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac at the first time two obvious signal peaks 5 and 6 appeared in esi mode at 0 min of which signal peak 6 had the highest response the corresponding base peak in ms figure was m z 278 8 which was consistent with the molecular weight of smt the base peak in the ms diagram corresponding to the signal peak 5 is m z 264 8 which differs from the molecular weight of smt by 15 therefore it is judged that the signal peak 5 may be the demethylated product of smt or it may be the impurity of smt sample in which the raw material of smt synthesis considering that the concentration of smt only decreased in the subsequent reaction the signal peak of 5 was identified as the impurity in the sample in addition the base peak in the ms diagram corresponding to signal peaks 1 and 2 were m z 214 9 but the separation degree of the signal peaks of the two were very good which must be two different products under the esi mode the ms response value of signal peak 5 was too low to be analyzed which was similar to sdz the base peak in the ms corresponding to signal peak 4 was m z 276 8 which is smt peak 1 3 in the ms spectrum corresponding the base peak was m z 292 8 290 7 and 292 9 respectively where the molecular weights of the products corresponding to m z 292 8 and m z 292 9 were very close with a difference of 16 from the molecular weights of smt therefore the signal peaks 1 and 3 correspond to two products with one oxygen atom added respectively based on the action principle of ros the structures of the two products were deduced as shown in table 3 the material corresponding to the signal peak 2 was 14 different from smt which just met the increased molecular weight of nh2 oxidation to no according to the identification results of intermediate products of sulfonamide antibiotics produced by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation the degradation pathway were shown in fig 10 as can be seen the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics were similar such as the breaking of sn bond x1 z4 and t4 and the cracking of n containing benzene ring x2 z3 t5 13 17 48 49 in addition there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring z1 t1 and t2 extrusion of so2 z2 and t3 may be the result of superoxide radical action 11 20 21 50 the reason for this phenomenon should be that the main ros of smx degradation by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalysis were different from sdz and smt there are some differences in the structure of the three sulfonamides except that all of them contain p aminobenzene sulfonamide the structure of smx contains the oxazole ring with five memons and the n in the oxazole ring is the electron donor group the structure of sdz and smt is the pyrimidine ring of the six membered ring and the n in the pyrimidine ring is the electron absorbing group 51 in the process of photocatalytic degradation of sdz and smt o2 played a decisive role as o2 is an affinity free radical it is easy to react with materials with electron absorbing groups which is more conducive to degradation of these two sulfonamides the results also indicated that bi2o3 tio2 pac was more likely to degrade smx with fewer inter products and a simple degradation pathway however the degradation pathways of sdz and smt were complex and there were more kinds of degradation pathways and intermediates 4 conclusion in this study the photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides using bi2o3 tio2 pac prepared by two stage calcination method as photocatalyst under solar light irradiation has been proved to be an efficient treatment method for sulfonamides and its photocatalytic degradation efficiency and mechanism have been systematically studied it was found that different water quality parameters had obvious different effects on the degradation efficiency of smx sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac an increase of ph and hco3 concentration decreased the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smx contrarily improved the degradation efficiency of sdz and smt in addition when ha or natural water was employed in experiments the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamides was inhibited by high concentration of natural organic compounds it was proved by epr measurements and trapping experiments that the reactive oxygen species which play the main role in the photocatalytic degradation of sulfanilamide were different photocatalytic degradation of smx mainly involves h and o2 is the main reactive oxygen species for degradation of sdz and smt the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamide antibiotics were similar such as the breaking of sn bond and the cracking of n containing benzene ring furthermore there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring extrusion of so2 moreover the bi2o3 tio2 pac also exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamides in natural

14012,the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx sulfadiazine sdz and sulfamethazine smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation was studied the results exhibited that bi2o3 tio2 pac composite prepared by two stage calcination method contained of rutile and anatase mixed crystal phases and it had visible light response capability in addition bi2o3 tio2 pac had a certain adsorption capacity for smx sdz and smt and its saturated adsorption mass was 30 88 11 28 and 26 24 mg g respectively compared to photolysis and adsorption process the photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of the three sulfonamides were significantly improved and more than 99 of photocatalytic degradation efficiency was achieved the epr measurements showed that both hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide radicals o2 were produced in the photocatalytic process however trapping experiments confirmed that photo generated hole h played a lead role in the photocatalytic degradation of smx contrarily the o2 was the main oxidative species for sdz and smt degradation furthermore the effects of initial ph of solution sodium bicarbonate humic acid and natural water lake and river water on the photocatalytic degradation were investigated the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamides were discussed there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring extrusion of so2 while similar pathways existed in the process of sulfanilamide degradation such as the breaking of sn bond and the cracking of n containing benzene ring keywords solar light sulfonamides photocatalytic degradation pathway bi2o3 tio2 1 introduction antibiotics are widely used in industrial medical veterinary and agricultural fields due to their ability to selectively inhibit or affect the biological functions of animals plants and microorganisms at low concentrations 1 3 at present sulfonamide antibiotics are one of the common pollutants in surface water 4 6 the use of sulfonamides is causing unexpected harm to the environment 5 when sulfonamides enter the environment they will lead to drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria and cause extremely serious harm to aquatic organisms in the environment and even human health 7 8 in recent years in order to remove trace sulfonamide antibiotics from water environment researchers have developed a variety of treatment methods including biological physical and chemical oxidation 9 10 compared with other methods chemical oxidation methods mainly achieve the purpose of degrading pollutants through chemical reactions which can completely degrade pollutants without producing drug resistant bacteria 11 chemical oxidation mainly employs redox reaction to remove pollutants to achieve water purification including ozone oxidation fenton technology and photocatalytic technology 12 14 ozone oxidation can be directly selective oxidation of organic pollutants with special functional group which can be decomposed and generate a strong oxidizing hydroxyl radicals to degradation of pollutants 15 however ozone is unstable and easy to produce the secondary pollution such as bromate and endanger human body health 16 18 compared with ozone fenton oxidation is not affected by external conditions and the reaction is easy to control which facilitates the removal of micro pollutants in the water environment 19 but a homogeneous fenton system requires a very low ph condition while the non homogeneous system will produce a lot of iron sludge which will increase the subsequent treatment cost 20 21 compared with other advanced oxidation process aops semiconductor photocatalytic technology is a rapidly emerging water treatment technology which has the advantages of less energy consumption low cost non toxic and light secondary pollution and is considered to be the most promising green environmental protection technology 22 24 however in the current photocatalytic technology the light source used is divided into uv light and visible light because the ratio of visible light in solar light is much higher than that of uv 25 26 hence the development of photocatalysts with visible light response is the key to realize the application of photocatalytic technology in addition the commonly used photocatalysts such as nano tio2 are difficult to separate in water 27 28 therefore in previous studies we developed a photocatalysts with bismuth oxide doped tio2 supported on activated carbon which has photocatalytic degradation efficiency for smt in water under visible light irradiation 29 however due to the differences in functional groups of sulfonamides their own properties are different 30 therefore different aops also have great differences in the degradation characteristics and bond breaking positions of sulfonamides dong et al degraded sulfamethazine by chlorination method 8 and the degradation pathway was completely different from the research of agi bi4v2o11 photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethazine 7 furthermore the mechanism and efficiency of the same phocatalytic oxidation technology for the degradation of different sulfonamides are different song et al used g c3n4 photocatalytic degradation of four sulfadiazines among which the degradation efficiency and mechanism of pyrimidines were completely different from oxazoles 31 therefore it is necessary to understand the mechanism of action of bi2o3 tio2 pac on different types of sulfonamides and the effect of water quality conditions on their degradation efficiency this can provide a research basis for the subsequent improvement of material properties of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite and the removal of sulfonamides from actual water bodies by combining with other water treatment processes and provide necessary support for engineering applications in this study in order to clarify the mechanism on the degradation of sulfonamides in water and improve its photocatalytic degradation efficiency bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was prepared by sol hydrothermal two stage calcination the smx sdz and smt were used as target pollutants to investigate the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalyst with different water quality parameters by solar light irradiation furthermore the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of bi2o3 tio2 pac for different sulfonamides were explored and the degradation intermediate products and degradation pathway were analyzed so as to judge the difference of photocatalytic

alcohol 1 1 ratio and detection wavelength was 270 nm an agilent 1290 infinity 6460 lc qqq mass spectrometer lc ms was used to identify intermediates produced during sulfonamide degradation the mobile phase of the lc ms was a 70 30 mixture of methanol and ultrapure water 0 1 formic acid at a flow rate of 0 2 ml min 1 to investigate reaction oxidation species epr spectra were collected at ambient temperature 25 c in duplicate or triplicate on a jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the synthesized bi2o3 tio2 pac the xrd patterns were adopted to identify the crystal phase of bi2o3 tio2 pac which results were showed in fig 1 a for the standard pdf card jcpds 71 1166 76 0323 88 1173 and 74 1633 the prepared bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was mainly consisted with anatase rutile mixed phase the percentage of rutile in the anatase rutile mixtures was ca 31 wt which was determined by spurrs and myer s equation 33 the content of bi2o3 phase was relatively low though it was also observed in xrd patterns in addition the pac was an amorphous phase in bi2o3 tio2 pac composite due to the calcination with high temperature the average crystal size of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was ca 48 nm which was estimated by scherrer s formula besides the band gap energy of bi2o3 tio2 pac composite was 2 58 ev which determined from the formula plot of αhν 1 2 versus the photo energy hν 34 as showed in fig 1 b furthermore the results of x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps brunauer emmett teller surface area and barrett joyner halenda pores size distribution bet bjh scanning electron microscope sem and high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem analysis were showed in supplementary document 3 2 role of bi2o3 tio2 pac in the photocatalytic degradation process in the process of degradation of sulfonamide antibiotics by bi2o3 tio2 pac except of the free radicals and holes generated by the catalyst irradiated by solar light to degrade target pollutants by oxidation photolysis of sulfonamide antibiotics under solar light and adsorption removal of the catalyst were also involved therefore in order to explore the role of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic oxidation in the degradation process of sulfonamide antibiotics we investigated the degradation effects of dark adsorption photolysis and photocatalytic oxidation under solar light irradiation after adsorption saturation on three kinds of antibiotics as shown in fig 2 as can be seen the three sulfonamides almost did not degrade when only solar light irradiation was used however when bi2o3 tio2 pac carried out dark adsorption reaction on three kinds of antibiotics the removal effect could reach 20 30 for fig 2 d the adsorption saturation time of bi2o3 tio2 pac on smx sdz and smt was about 30 min and the saturated adsorption mass was 30 88 11 28 and 26 24 mg g respectively in addition the concentration of all three pollutants decreased with the extension of reaction time by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic under the solar light irradiation after 30 min of reaction the smx degradation rate has reached about 100 however sdz degradation rate could reach 100 after 60 min of reaction while smt removal rate was only 75 the reason may be due to the differences in the self structure and characteristics of the three sulfonamides as well as the differences in the active oxygen species that play a major role in the photocatalytic degradation process 35 3 3 adsorption characteristics the adsorption process was influenced with the interaction controlled by the exchange and share of electrons between catalysts and smt 36 the adsorption kinetic processes of bi2o3 tio2 pac were fitted by pfo pso and intra particle diffusion the results were shown in fig 3 and table 1 the regression coefficient r2 of pso was greater than that of pfo and intra particle diffusion the saturated adsorption amount and reaction rate increase with the increase of the initial smt concentration when the pso was used to fit in summary the pso model satisfied the existing adsorption situation and the adsorption of active sites was more likely to be the dominant factor and the chemical reaction was the vital factor for adsorption the r2 of the intra particle diffusion was larger and the internal diffusion took up a certain proportion langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to describe the adsorption process as shown in fig s6 and table s2 the r2 of langmuir and freundlich models can well describe the isothermal adsorption process of smt on prepared composite which indicated that monolayer adsorption and multilayer adsorption existed simultaneously the r2 of langmuir model was larger indicating that monolayer adsorption and surface adsorption predominated 37 3 4 main active species in the photocatalytic degradation process the identification of oh in aqueous solution was performed by electron paramagnetic resonance epr without adding contaminants as shown in the fig 4 a in the absence of solar light irradiation there was no characteristic peak corresponding to dmpo oh and in the erp spectrum indicated that no oh will be generated in the absence of light irradiation of bi2o3 tio2 pac however after solar light irradiation 20 s the epr spectrum with an intensity ration of 1 2 2 1 quartet signal was obvious observed which corresponded to the dmpo oh 38 meanwhile the o2 was identified in methanol solution the result was showed in the fig 4 b without solar light irradiation there was no signal attached by dmpo o2 emerged in epr spectrum while the result similarly to oh when the bi2o3 tio2 pac composite under solar light irradiation 20 s a four line special signal with intensity ration of 1 1 1 1 generated in epr spectrum 39 which corresponded to the peak of dmpo o2 this results indicated the oh and o2 were generated in bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic reaction process with solar light irradiation to investigate whether active oxygen free radicals in the process of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides are involved in the reaction the isopropyl alcohol ipa benzoquinone bq and disodium ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta 2na were added to the reaction system receptivity through the evaluation of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency to determine the oh o2 and h in bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of different sulfonamides under solar light irradiation 40 as can be seen from fig 4 c e the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac to sulfonamides under solar light irradiation can be inhibited by all three trapping agents and the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreased with the increase of the trapping agent dosage this result exhibited that oh o2 and h all played an important role in the process in photocatalytic degradation of three sulfonamides by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation but the three kinds of reactive oxygen species played a different role in the degradation of different sulfonamides the fitting results of the kinetic equations of photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides were shown in fig 5 and table 2 from the regression coefficient r2 of each reaction curve it can be seen that the photocatalytic degradation reaction was well described by the a pseudo first order kinetic model the influence of the type and concentration of trapping agents on the reaction rate k of photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides by bi2o3 tio2 pac was similar to that of the photocatalytic efficiency when bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degraded smx h played a major role relative to o2 and oh however when bi2o3 tio2 pac degraded sdz and smt the o2 played a greater role than h and oh 3 5 evaluation of photocatalytic degradation efficiencies 3 5 1 effect of solution ph solution ph plays an important role in the bi2o3 tio2 pac degradation of sulfonamides which can affect the oxidation capacity of the photocatalytic reaction system under the excitation of solar light irradiation the photo gendered electrons e of bi2o3 tio2 pac can jump to the conduction band thus generating h in the valence band then as shown in eq 9 dissolved oxygen in water can combine with e to form o2 in the presence of hydrogen ions h in an aqueous solution o2 combine with h and e to form hydrogen peroxide h2o2 which can eventually react with e to transform into oh as shown in eq 10 and 11 however when hydroxide ions oh are present in an aqueous solution h will also combine with oh to form oh as shown in eq 12 9 o2 e o2 10 o2 2h e h2o2 11 h2o2 e oh oh 12 h oh oh in order to investigate the influence of solution ph on bi2o3 tio2 pac on the solution of three sulfonamide antibiotics under solar light irradiation the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively for photocatalytic experiment and the results were shown in fig 6 when the initial ph of the solution changed between 3 0 and 11 0 the degradation efficiency of the three sulfonamides changed but the degrade rate of the three sulfonamide antibiotics could reach more than 85 as can be seen from fig 6 a the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smx decreased with the increase of the initial ph of the solution this is mainly due to ph affects the species and distribution of reactive oxygen species ros in the system and the existing form of smx resulting in different degradation efficiency of smx under different ph the h are the main reactive oxygen species in the degradation process of smx so when the ph of the solution increases the oh concentration in the aqueous solution increases eq 12 so that the reaction h with oh increase leading to a relative decrease in the number of h participating in the photocatalytic reaction although the increase of ph contributes to the increase of the content of oh it is not the main reactive oxygen species for smx degradation thus inhibiting the photocatalytic degradation efficiency on the contrary the photocatalytic degradation trend of sdz and smt was opposite to that of smx and their degradation efficiency increased with the increase of the initial ph of solution as shown in fig 6 b and c this is mainly because o2 is the main ros in the photocatalytic degradation of sdz and smt when the ph of the solution increases the concentration of h in the aqueous solution decreases thus reducing the consumption of o2 in the reaction with h showed in eq 10 leading to the relative increase of o2 in the photocatalytic reaction at the same time when the ph of solution increases the existing form of sulfonamide antibiotics gradually changes from positive ion form to negative ion form and the negative ion form of smt and sdz exhibit low photochemical activity and stable form 41 finally the degradation efficiency of sdz and smt increased with the increase of solution ph 3 5 2 effect of humic acid natural organic matter usually refers to the metabolites produced by decomposing plants and animals in the natural cycle mainly including tannic acid lignin and humic substances 42 humic substances has the highest content in surface water mainly including fulvic acid and humic acid ha ha generally exists widely in natural water and its content is relatively high some organic functional groups of ha can consume oxidants which will have a negative impact on the degradation effect therefore we took humic acid as an important factor to investigate its effect on photocatalytic degradation of different sulfonamide antibiotics in this experiment the effect of different ha dosage 0 0 5 2 5 mg l on photocatalytic degradation of bi2o3 tio2 pac on three sulfonamide antibiotics was investigated under the condition that the initial ph of the solution was 7 0 as can be seen from the fig 7 a c when the dosage of ha increased from 0 to 5 mg l the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and rate of the three sulfonamide antibiotics gradually decreased this may be due to the following reasons ha can compete with sulfanilamide antibiotics to ros produced by photocatalytic process 43 in addition ha can absorb photons the amount of photons utilized by bi2o3 tio2 pac is reduced which leads to the inhibition of subsequent photocatalytic reactions 44 furthermore because the photocatalytic reaction process conduction on the surface of the catalyst ha competed with sulfonamide antibiotics for adsorption by bi2o3 tio2 pac leading to a decrease in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics 45 although ha had an overall inhibitory effect on bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation of three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics the degradation efficiency of smx sdz and smt at the end of the photocatalytic reaction 60 90 and120 minutes at the dosage of 5 mg l of ha was more than 70 which indicated the high efficiency and robustness of bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic system 3 5 3 effect of hco3 the hco3 is an inorganic anions commonly found existed in natural water which is also an important trapping agent for ros 46 it can react with oh as shown in eq 13 and 14 the hco3 can react with the oh to form the co3 compared with oh co3 has weak oxidation which generally leads to poor degradation effect in addition from eq 15 hco3 can also react with h to general co3 47 from the fig 8 when different concentrations of hco3 0 5 5 mm were added in the solution with initial ph of 7 0 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac in three sulfonamide antibiotics was studied as shown in fig 8 a the degradation rate of smx decreased when the concentration of hco3 increased from 0 mm to 5 mm on the one hand it may be because the h is the main ros for photocatalytic degradation of smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac the increase in the amount of hco3 increased the consumption of h while the oxidation capacity of generated co3 was weak so the conversion of h to co3 resulted in the reduction of smx degradation rate on the other hand the ph of the solution increased from 7 0 to 8 7 after added hco3 according to the influence rule of ph it can be seen that higher ph value can inhibit smx degradation on the contrary the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sdz and smt increased with the dosage of hco3 increased as shown in fig 8 b and c this may be due to the fact that oh is not the main ros for the degradation of sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac while the co3 generated in the reaction process is involved in the degradation of sdz and smt leading to the improvement of the degradation effect in addition the increase in ph leads to an increase in the content of oh which improves the photocatalytic degradation efficiency which has been discussed in the previous section for cl and so4 2 in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was shown in supplementary file and fig s7 13 hco3 oh co3 h2o 14 co3 2 oh co3 oh 15 hco3 h co3 3 5 4 effect of natural water in order to investigate the degradation effect of bi2o3 tio2 pac on sulfonamide antibiotics in natural water water samples were taken from tonghui river and lianshi lake of beijing respectively the fig 9 showed the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of three sulfonamide antibiotics by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation as can be seen from the fig 9 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac on smx sdz and smt in natural water is lower than that in deionized water this may be due to the complexity of organic compounds in natural water which compete with sulfanilamide antibiotics for ros thus inhibiting the degradation efficiency of sulfanilamide antibiotics in addition the degradation efficiency of sulfonamide antibiotics in lake water was higher than that in river water because the organic index of river water doc and uv254 was higher than that in lake water seen in fig s1 moreover high turbidity in river water will also increase light scattering thus reducing the utilization rate of bi2o3 tio2 pac to photons however the overall degradation efficiency of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamide antibiotics in natural water is greater than 69 which indicated that bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic technology was feasible for the degradation of these substances in actual water bodies 3 6 identification of intermediates and comparison proposed degradation pathways in order to better understand the photocatalytic degradation process and mechanism of smx sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac under solar light irradiation the lc ms technology was used to identify the intermediate products of three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics in the reaction process in the photocatalytic degradation of smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac a total of six products were detected by gradient elution method as shown in fig s8 a total of 6 signal peaks were captured in esi mode among which four signal peaks 3 6 appeared in the 0 min sample where the base peak in the mass spectrum corresponding to signal peak 6 was m z 253 8 which was consistent with the molecular weight of smx the signal peak of 3 5 only decreases in the subsequent reaction indicating that it is likely to be the impurity in the sample in esi mode a total of seven signal peaks were captured but the response values of the signal peaks were all very low which made it difficult to accurately judge the base peaks through multiple argumentation only the structure of the signal peak 3 7 is inferred which is mutually verified with the ms spectra in esi mode the structural formulas of the five intermediate products a e were shown in table 3 in the process of photocatalytic degradation of sdz by bi2o3 tio2 pac it can be seen that six signal peaks detected in esi mode seen from figs s9 a and b the mass spectrum of peaks 1 2 and 3 had obvious ion peak while the mass spectrogram were m z 250 8 of the signal peaks for 4 5 and 6 molecular ion peaks of the sdz other ion peak response was very low in esi mode there were 4 distinct peaks among which only signal peak 1 corresponds to signal peak 3 in esi mode indicating that products of all other signal peaks 2 4 were containing sulfonic groups in the sample of 0 min the main signal peak detected by esi mode was signal peak 3 and the corresponding base peak in the ms was m z 250 8 and the substance was sdz in esi mode signal peaks of 1 3 and 4 were appeared where the base peak corresponding to signal peak 1 in ms was m z 248 7 which was the result of sdz h the base peak of the signal peak 3 corresponding to the ms was m z 171 8 considering that the molecule contains sulfonic groups it can be inferred that the product was p amino penzene sulfonic acid by combining with the possible bond breaking mode of sdz with the development of reaction time the response of signal peak 1 in esi mode was significantly enhanced indicating that new products were generated and the base peak in the corresponding ms diagram was m z 186 7 in addition the ion peak in the ms diagram corresponding to signal peak 2 in esi mode was m z 202 9 with a difference of one oxygen atom from m z 186 7 therefore the intermediates were five intermediates of f j as shown in table 3 as can be seen from fig s10 in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac at the first time two obvious signal peaks 5 and 6 appeared in esi mode at 0 min of which signal peak 6 had the highest response the corresponding base peak in ms figure was m z 278 8 which was consistent with the molecular weight of smt the base peak in the ms diagram corresponding to the signal peak 5 is m z 264 8 which differs from the molecular weight of smt by 15 therefore it is judged that the signal peak 5 may be the demethylated product of smt or it may be the impurity of smt sample in which the raw material of smt synthesis considering that the concentration of smt only decreased in the subsequent reaction the signal peak of 5 was identified as the impurity in the sample in addition the base peak in the ms diagram corresponding to signal peaks 1 and 2 were m z 214 9 but the separation degree of the signal peaks of the two were very good which must be two different products under the esi mode the ms response value of signal peak 5 was too low to be analyzed which was similar to sdz the base peak in the ms corresponding to signal peak 4 was m z 276 8 which is smt peak 1 3 in the ms spectrum corresponding the base peak was m z 292 8 290 7 and 292 9 respectively where the molecular weights of the products corresponding to m z 292 8 and m z 292 9 were very close with a difference of 16 from the molecular weights of smt therefore the signal peaks 1 and 3 correspond to two products with one oxygen atom added respectively based on the action principle of ros the structures of the two products were deduced as shown in table 3 the material corresponding to the signal peak 2 was 14 different from smt which just met the increased molecular weight of nh2 oxidation to no according to the identification results of intermediate products of sulfonamide antibiotics produced by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalytic degradation the degradation pathway were shown in fig 10 as can be seen the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for three kinds of sulfonamide antibiotics were similar such as the breaking of sn bond x1 z4 and t4 and the cracking of n containing benzene ring x2 z3 t5 13 17 48 49 in addition there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring z1 t1 and t2 extrusion of so2 z2 and t3 may be the result of superoxide radical action 11 20 21 50 the reason for this phenomenon should be that the main ros of smx degradation by bi2o3 tio2 pac photocatalysis were different from sdz and smt there are some differences in the structure of the three sulfonamides except that all of them contain p aminobenzene sulfonamide the structure of smx contains the oxazole ring with five memons and the n in the oxazole ring is the electron donor group the structure of sdz and smt is the pyrimidine ring of the six membered ring and the n in the pyrimidine ring is the electron absorbing group 51 in the process of photocatalytic degradation of sdz and smt o2 played a decisive role as o2 is an affinity free radical it is easy to react with materials with electron absorbing groups which is more conducive to degradation of these two sulfonamides the results also indicated that bi2o3 tio2 pac was more likely to degrade smx with fewer inter products and a simple degradation pathway however the degradation pathways of sdz and smt were complex and there were more kinds of degradation pathways and intermediates 4 conclusion in this study the photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides using bi2o3 tio2 pac prepared by two stage calcination method as photocatalyst under solar light irradiation has been proved to be an efficient treatment method for sulfonamides and its photocatalytic degradation efficiency and mechanism have been systematically studied it was found that different water quality parameters had obvious different effects on the degradation efficiency of smx sdz and smt by bi2o3 tio2 pac an increase of ph and hco3 concentration decreased the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smx contrarily improved the degradation efficiency of sdz and smt in addition when ha or natural water was employed in experiments the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamides was inhibited by high concentration of natural organic compounds it was proved by epr measurements and trapping experiments that the reactive oxygen species which play the main role in the photocatalytic degradation of sulfanilamide were different photocatalytic degradation of smx mainly involves h and o2 is the main reactive oxygen species for degradation of sdz and smt the photocatalytic degradation pathways of bi2o3 tio2 pac for sulfonamide antibiotics were similar such as the breaking of sn bond and the cracking of n containing benzene ring furthermore there were differences degradation pathways of the sdz smt and smx by bi2o3 tio2 pac mainly reflected in hydroxylation of benzene ring extrusion of so2 moreover the bi2o3 tio2 pac also exhibited excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfonamides in natural

14013,atrazine in aquatic environment poses a potential threat to human health and ecological system and photocatalytic technology exhibits a promising prospect for eliminating trace pollutants in water four photocatalysts zni2s4 zis and other three zis based catalysts g c3n4 zis czis biobr zis bzis and pd zis pzis were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and characterized by bet uv vis drs sem tem xrd and xps respectively it showed that four catalysts had high photocatalytic activities for atrazine degradation under different light sources irradiation and their active sequence was pzis czis zis bzis the stronger light intensity the higher photocatalytic efficiency under direct solar irradiation of 1 h the degradation efficiency for 20 mg l of atrazine solution reached 90 by pzis with a dosage of 0 5 g l pd doping increased the specific surface area and shortened the band gap and particle size of the catalyst that resulting in an effective enhancement of photocatalytic activity in the process of atrazine degradation it confirmed by laser that pd2 ion entered the internal structure of zis to affect the crystal phase slightly but prohibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs effectively a feasible photocatalytic mechanism of atrazine by pzis was proposed in the paper the research work verified high photocatalytic activity of pzis for its further application in the purification of aquatic environment that polluted by various herbicides including atrazine keywords atrazine photocatalysis zis pd doping mechanism 1 introduction atrazine is a widely used herbicide for controlling broadleaf and grassy weeds to promote the growth of maize sorghum fruiter and woods etc 1 it is stable nonvolatile low water solubility 33 mg l at 25 and low biodegradability due to its triazine structure however it has medium toxicity to human being and livestock including endocrine disruption hepatoxicity and renal toxicity 2 to be classified as a possible human carcinogen by the usepa 3 atrazine remaining in the crops and grasses can enter soil surface water and groundwater by leaching and permeation nowadays it keeps a concentration of ng l μg l in aquatic environment worldwide thus posing a potential threat to the ecological environment 4 presently traditional techniques including biochar adsorption 5 microbic metabolism 6 phytoremediation 7 and advanced oxidation processes such as photo fenton 8 uv oxidation 9 and photocatalysis 10 are applied to treat atrazine in aquatic environment and soil among these technologies photocatalytic technology has been much more interested by the researchers in virtue of clean valueless and sustainable utilization of solar energy complete mineralization and detoxification of 20 mg l atrazine in water were attained by iranian scholars using in s tio2 rgo catalyst under visible light irradiation 11 among photocatalytic technique the photocatalyst is vital to the process and the research and development of new and high efficiency catalysts that utilizing visible light are still attracted deeply by scientists ga cl poly aam ni oh 2 feooh nch 12 ceo2 13 and au tio2 14 exhibited excellent activities for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue flumequine and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride respectively compared with metallic oxides the band gaps of metallic sulfides are narrower and more suitable to absorb visible light powerfully ternary metallic sulfides become a hotspot currently due to their strong resistance to photochemical corrosion especially for those containing transition metal 15 as a representative hexagonal zni2s4 zis has an excellent photocatalytic activity to have been already employed in hydrogen evolution 16 dye decolorizing 17 and pharmaceutical degradation 18 in virtue of strong reducing ability of photogenerated electron e and oxidizing ability of photogenerated hole h our previous works 19 20 have verified that zis band gap eg of 1 98 ev and 1 89 ev respectively and zis tio2 can induce hydroxyl radical oh active oxygen free radical o2 superoxide and hydrogen peroxide active species to degrade trace carbamazepine in aqueous solution effectively and the increase of light intensity is of benefit to the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine however to the best of our knowledge there is no literature reported the research of pure zis or zis based photocatalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of atrazine in water under visible light lamp or direct solar irradiation to enhance the photocatalytic activity of zis graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 as a visible light driven photocatalyst was reported to construct a binary heterojunction composite g c3n4 zis czis to enhance the charge separation and migration efficiency which improved effectively the h2 evolution rate 21 and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid decomposition 22 bismuth oxybromide biobr that possessing excellent photocatalytic performance for dye degradation under visible light 23 was introduced to combine with uio 66 structural formula noted as zr24o120c192h96 to exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity on atrazine degradation 24 however there is still no report on the combination of biobr with zis in contaminant photodegradation metallic doping deposition or hybridization especially for noble metals like pt pd and au etc can improve effectively the photocatalytic performance of zis on h2 generation rate 25 alkylation of amines and ketones 26 and oxidation of benzyl alcohol 27 the reason is mostly attributed to trap conduction e to decrease the recombination of e h pairs that leading to the increase of photocatalytic activity herein we synthesized pure zis via a facile hydrothermal method and zis based photocatalysts such as czis composite biobr zis composite bzis and pd zis doping pzis then their photocatalytic activities were investigated in the degradation of atrazine in aqueous solution under different visible light lamps irradiation and direct solar irradiation respectively for experiment high atrazine concentration mg l that existing in the real industrial wastewater 28 was used to verify the catalytic activity of zis based photocatalysts the success of removing high atrazine concentration will certainly apply for the removal of low atrazine concentration in the real aquatic environment which could be deemed as more easily different characterizations reaction kinetics and feasible degrading mechanism were discussed simultaneously the novelty of the study is to clarify the photocatalytic activities of zis and zis based catalysts on atrazine degradation to look for one high performance zis based catalyst under direct solar irradiation moreover to carve out a new way to confirm pd particles entering into the inner structure of zis molecule 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o 99 and tetraamminepalladium ⅱ nitrate pd

that installed in the aisle of the laboratory 2 2 preparation and characterization of zis based catalysts pure zis was prepared by a facile hydrothermal method firstly 104 09 mg zn no3 2 6h2o and 210 58 mg in no3 3 were dissolved into 70 ml di water and sonicated for 0 5 h then 420 75 mg taa was added to metallic nitrates solution and sonicated for 0 5 h again secondly 20 vol hno3 was dropped into the mixture to adjust the ph of solution to 2 5 twice under stirring if not zis cannot be formed thirdly the mixture was sealed to a ptfe lined high pressure reactor and heated at 80 for 6 h finally yellow zis was obtained after centrifuged washed dried overnight and ground and kept at a marked vial before used 20 μl pd nh3 4 no3 2 solution 7 4 mg g c3n4 nanosheets and 7 4 mg biobr powder were added separately into metallic nitrates solution in the first step and then followed the same steps as well as zis preparation to obtain three zis zis based catalysts named as 0 5 wt pzis doped

of 5 0 kv transmission electron microscopy tem and high resolution tem hrtem images were obtained by a jeol jem 1400 transmission electron microscope at 100 kv and a titan 80 300 stem at 200 kv respectively the crystal structure intensity of binding energy and metallic valence state of the samples were determined by a x ray diffractometer xrd panalytical mpd x pert pro with voltage 45 kv and current 40 ma via a ni filtered cu kα radiation and a x ray photoelectron spectrometer xps thermofisher scientific escalab 250 with a microfocused monochromated al kα x ray source 15 kv and a double focusing full 180 spherical sector electron analyzer 2 3 photocatalytic programme the photocatalytic activity of zis based catalysts was checked by indoor and outdoor experiments under different light sources of a 100 w halogen tungsten lamp 380 820 nm a 450 w 1000 w m2 solar simulator 300 2500 nm newport sol2a and direct solar irradiation 300 2500 nm respectively firstly the catalyst with a dosage of 0 5 g l was added to atrazine solution and then the mixture was settled in the center of a tap water recirculated cooling container and a magnetic stirrer was equipped at the bottom of the container to keep constant temperature and thorough mixing in experiment secondly a 100 w halogen tungsten lamp was fixed at the top of the mixture and kept a 125 mm height from the solution surface finally the whole setup was sealed at a big box that covered by aluminium foil on the inside wall to prevent light leakage prior to irradiation the mixture was stirred in darkness for 30 min to achieve an adsorption desorption equilibrium for eliminating the adsorption influence with the light on the experiment was beginning and an aliquot of 1 5 ml of reactant was sampled at a given interval then the sample was centrifuged five times to remove the catalyst completely and kept at a refrigerator before analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc quantitatively according to the saturated solubility of atrazine in water 33 mg l at 25 the detection limit of hplc and a suitable speed of photocatalytic degradation to compare the activity of zis based catalysts atrazine solution with an initial concentration c0 of 2 mg l was applied in the process of halogen tungsten lamp irradiation and c0 of 20 mg l was applied in direct solar irradiation nearly at noon and simulated solar irradiation the solar simulator was kept a 400 mm height from the solution surface separately all experiments were carried out in triplicate to reduce experimental error and ensure the reproducibility 2 4 analytical method atrazine concentration was quantified by the hplc agilent technologies 1260 infinity with a waters μbondapak c18 column id l 3 9 150 mm and an uv detector at an excitation wavelength of 220 nm the mobile phase containing 60 methanol and 40 di water v v was run at a constant flow rate of 1 0 ml min the injection volume of the sample was 10 μl and the target was analyzed by external standard method 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of zis based catalysts to explore the change of photocatalytic activity more evidentially relative characterizations of zis based catalysts were carried out timely fig 2 showed the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms and uv vis drs of pure zis and other three catalysts and related textural parameters of four photocatalysts were seen in table 1 it was seen in fig 2 a that all isotherms belonged to standard type iv isotherms to show a multilayer adsorption onto these catalysts the adsorption hysteresis loops were observed at a relatively high pressure to expose the existence of much more mesopores which was confirmed by the data of pore volume and micropore volume on table 1 and was consistent with our previous research 20 the sbet values of four catalysts indicated that zis and bzis had almost same specific surface area and pd doping enhanced the sbet obviously that should be beneficial to atrazine adsorption and further degradation however g c3n4 composite decreased the sbet partly while comparing with zis which could bring a negative effect on atrazine adsorption although czis exhibited a higher catalytic activity than zis in fig 2 on table 1 the sbet pore volume and external surface area of pzis were 166 m2 g 0 205 cm3 g and 148 m2 g respectively the highest values among four catalysts which improved greatly the adsorption of atrazine onto the catalyst surface and contact time with active radicals entering the inner pore more easily that benefiting atrazine photodegradation effectively fig 2 b showed that four catalysts could absorb both uv and visible light strongly bzis and pzis had stronger visible light absorption and czis had a little enhancement in uv absorption while comparing with zis the band gaps of zis bzis czis and pzis were measured to be 1 93 ev 1 30 ev 1 89 ev and 1 48 ev respectively according to the intersection of two extrapolated straight lines from the plots of αhν 1 2 versus hν inset of fig 2 b which agreed with our previous reports 19 20 it speculated that pd2 ion might enter the molecular structure of zis to shorten the band gap of catalyst that improving the photon transition greatly however the increase of light absorbing capacity is not the sole impacting factor to photocatalytic activity bzis had a worse activity in atrazine degradation seen in fig 6 and a stronger light absorbing ability than zis simultaneously fig 3 showed the surface morphology and element analysis of four catalysts based on sem and energy dispersion spectrum eds determination the spherical particles with different sizes piled up together in fig 3 a for pure zis and the peaks of zn in and s elements were seen clearly in fig 3 e and an inaccurate atom ratio should be related to semiquantitative determination of eds the large size of bzis particles in fig 3 b was probably due to the coating of zis to biobr and all element peaks were observed in fig 3 f g c3n4 nanosheets with irregular sizes adhered to zis spheres strongly and abundant pores and uneven surface of czis were observed all in fig 3 c that should be beneficial to atrazine adsorption and degradation pd doping resulted in smaller particles of pzis in fig 3 d but the small dots appearing in the surface could not be judged to pd particles the smaller particle sizes the higher specific surface area which is consistent with the bet result on table 1 fortunately pd element was found by eds in fig 3 h although the doping amount of pd was quite low in this work to observe vertical structure of zis based photocatalysts and verify the existence and site of pd particle in pzis tem and hrtem characterizations were carried out and related images were given in fig 4 it can be seen in fig 4 a that zis microspheres aggregated together with the sizes of 120 180 nm and comprised of a large amount of zis nanosheets with the sizes of several nanometers which was consistent with the report of wang 26 large bzis microspheres were observed in fig 4 b again while comparing with the sem picture in fig 3 b czis particles in fig 4 c had a similar size like zis and zis microspheres adhered to g c3n4 nanosheets closely which was beneficial to the formation of heterojunction structure smaller particles and more dispersion were observed clearly in fig 4 d while comparing with fig 4 a which indicated that pd doping reduced the aggregation of zis nanosheets effectively the result of fig 4 d was consistent with the increase of specific surface area of pzis on table 1 and the image of fig 3 d hrtem of pzis in fig 4 e showed clearly that the lattice interplanar spacing of 0 336 nm belonged to 102 crystal plane of hexagonal zis and lattice fringes of 0 224 nm matched the 112 crystal plane of zis seen in fig 5 the similar result was also reported by wang 26 in fig 4 e the black spots that entering the crystal structure of zis could be related to pd2 ions but need further confirmation in order to verify the location of pd2 ions 0 5 wt pzis catalyst was added to pure methanol solution as reductant firstly then sonicated for 0 5 h to ensure a complete mixture and then reduced by a nd yag laser λ 532 nm pulse width τ 7 ns repetition rate 30 hz 70 100 mj pulse spectra physics lab 173 30 for 1 min under stirring 29 and the tem image was shown in fig 4 f it showed that pd spheric nanoparticles with different sizes appeared clearly on the surface of zis after laser reduction which was attributed to the strong energy of laser that leading to a rapid reduction and aggregation of pd2 ions laser energy also could destroy the structure of zis molecule which caused the color change of catalyst and exposed pd2 ions from the internal structure of zis therefore pd2 ions were confirmed to enter the molecular structure of zis in this work that according to the preparation method in section 2 2 fig 5 showed xrd and xps characterizations of four photocatalysts it can be seen in fig 5 a that four diffraction peaks represented different crystal planes of 102 400 112 and 202 respectively could be indexed to the hexagonal phase of zis jcpds card no 01 072 0773 30 biobr and g c3n4 composites had little effect on the crystal structure of zis however pd doping reduced the peak of 400 crystal plane apparently and shifted the peak of 112 crystal plane slightly to confirm pd2 ion entering the internal structure of zis again moreover pd2 ion could be connected to negative charged s planes of zis as evidenced from a light brown of pzis while comparing with yellow zis which was reported by chen 31 the xps full scanning spectra fig 5 b showed almost no difference for four zis based catalysts and only zn in and s element peaks were observed clearly high revolution spectra of three elements seen in fig 5 c e verified the existence of zn2 in3 and s2 ions 3 2 photocatalytic activity before experiment 0 5 wt pzis catalyst was selected as a representative to check the adsorption time in darkness and the result was shown on table 2 it showed clearly that the catalyst had a rapid adsorption to atrazine and the adsorption removal was 28 at 10 min then the adsorption was slowly and the adsorption removal rates were 29 and 39 at 30 min and 8760 min respectively therefore the dark adsorption time was confirmed to be 30 min in this work which was in accordance with a report of guo 32 subsequently the photocatalytic experiments under different light sources were conducted and the corresponding results were shown at fig 6 it was seen in fig 6 a that pure zis catalyzed the photodegradation of atrazine effectively and the degradation efficiency was about 62 after 5 h irradiation of halogen tungsten lamp the degradation rates of atrazine were 90 78 and 48 for pzis czis and bzis respectively pd doping and g c3n4 composite improved the catalytic activity of zis apparently although biobr composite decreased the catalytic activity in a degree therefore the sequence of photocatalytic activity of four catalysts to atrazine was 0 5 wt pzis 5 wt czis zis 5 wt bzis it was observed that the hydrophobicity of bzis was stronger than pure zis in experiment which could weaken the adsorption of atrazine onto the catalyst surface to bring negative effect on atrazine photodegradation the heterojunction structure of czis that reported by chen 33 adopting the similar process of catalyst preparation and pd doping that entering the structure of zis to prevent the recombination of e and h pairs could be the reasons for the improvement of their photocatalytic activities as a comparison 0 5 wt pzis catalyst showed no catalytic activity for atrazine photodegradation under irradiation of laboratorial fluorescent lamp 400 750 nm which could be attributed to a very weak light intensity of fluorescent lamp about 100 lx while comparing with 100 w halogen tungsten lamp about 2000 lx due to a full conversion for 2 mg l atrazine solution within 10 min under direct solar irradiation that was an insufficient time for sampling and pre treatment the initial concentration of atrazine solution was adjusted to 20 mg l and the experiments were conducted nearly at noon to acquire the strongest solar irradiation it could be seen in fig 6 b that the same activity sequence of the catalysts was confirmed again and the degradation efficiencies after 1 h irradiation were 90 75 69 and 48 for pzis czis zis and bzis respectively compared with halogen tungsten lamp a faster degrading speed under solar irradiation should be attributed to a stronger light intensity about 100000 lx at noon the decrease of adsorption effect should be due to a given catalyst dosage of 0 5 g l and the increase of initial concentration of atrazine solution fig 6 b also verified that direct photolysis without addition of catalyst could not remove atrazine and the increase of concentration should be explained to water evaporation in experiment considering the change of solar intensity with time passing the catalytic activities of pure zis and pzis were checked using a solar simulator that providing a constant light intensity of 1000 w m2 about 38000 lx it showed at fig 6 c that the degradation efficiencies of atrazine after 1 h irradiation were 43 and 78 for zis and pzis respectively that confirming the improvement of pd doping to zis activity again comparing with solar irradiation 100000 lx the degradation rates of atrazine using solar simulator 38000 lx decreased apparently which indicated light intensity was a key factor in atrazine photocatalytic degradation again 3 3 reaction kinetics to further clarify the order of reaction and the variety of photodegradative rate the kinetics curves of atrazine degradation by different zis based catalysts were fitted according to the first order and second order kinetics equations and shown in fig 7 relative kinetics equations and parameters were calculated and seen on table 3 based on kinetics fitting curves in fig 7 and related correlation coefficients r2 on table 3 atrazine photodegradation under irradiation of halogen tungsten lamp and solar simulator followed pseudo first order kinetics model and related r2 values were above 0 98 except for bzis which was in accordance with our previous research 19 and xue s report 24 however atrazine photodegradation under direct solar irradiation followed pseudo second order kinetics model and relative r2 were above 0 96 although the fitting results of first order kinetics were also satisfied with the increase of reaction order the effects of initial concentration of target compound and multiple adsorptions of catalyst become more obviously under solar irradiation atrazine was transformed to intermediates rapidly that resulting in competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface between atrazine and the intermediates therefore the pseudo second order reaction kinetics of atrazine could be related to high initial concentration of atrazine solution and multilayer adsorption of catalyst to atrazine and course products simultaneously moreover it was reported by khan 34 that the photochemical degradation of atrazine in uv s2o8 2 process followed second order reaction kinetics it showed on table 3 that pd doping improved the rate constant k apparently and reduced the half life t1 2 sharply under three light sources while comparing with pure zis for example the k and t1 2 values of pzis were 4 66 times and 1 15 7 less than those of zis under solar irradiation and 50 removal of 20 mg l atrazine solution was done quickly within 2 29 min it exhibits an available application of pzis in real treatment of atrazine industrial wastewater 28 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism based on the above discussion an available photocatalytic mechanism of atrazine by pzis catalyst was clarified in fig 8 due to premixture of pd2 with zn2 and in3 ions pd2 ion entered the molecular structure of zis during hydrothermal process and might connect with s2 ion weakly which changed the catalyst color decreased the crystal plane peak slightly and shortened the band gap obviously from 1 93 ev to 1 48 ev that improving visible light absorption greatly under visible light irradiation zis can be excited to generate electrons e and holes h a part of photogenerated electrons could react with oxygen and water molecules to generate active species like active oxygen free radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh etc which oxidized atrazine immediately onto the catalyst surface or in the solution some photogenerated electrons transferred from conduction band to the empty orbit of pd2 ion to inhibit the recombination of e h pair effectively the electrons from electron rich pd species 35 also can form o2 and oh to further oxidize atrazine the photogenerated holes on valence band had strong oxidizing capacity and oxidized atrazine to oxidative course products directly 19 4 conclusions in summary four zis based photocatalysts exhibited different catalytic activities in atrazine degradation and pzis showed the highest catalytic capacity under visible light irradiation however atrazine could not be photodegraded under fluorescent lamp irradiation due to a very weak light intensity direct photolysis also could not degrade atrazine in water a little comparing with pure zis the activity decrease of bzis should be related to large particle size and strong hydrophobicity and the improvement of czis activity could be attributed to the heterojunction structure the photocatalytic degradation of atrazine under direct solar irradiation followed pseudo second order kinetics due to high initial concentration of atrazine solution and competitive adsorption and photocatalytic degradation between atrazine and course products under solar irradiation pd doping improved the rate constant 4 66 times and reduced the half life to 1 15 7 greatly while comparing with zis pd2 ion that entering the inner structure of zis was hard to observe and trap by sem tem xrd and xps characterizations however pd0 particles appeared clearly on the surface of catalyst by tem after reduction by laser considering real application optimization of pd doping amounts and catalyst dosage will be carried out in our next work declaration of competing interest the

14013,atrazine in aquatic environment poses a potential threat to human health and ecological system and photocatalytic technology exhibits a promising prospect for eliminating trace pollutants in water four photocatalysts zni2s4 zis and other three zis based catalysts g c3n4 zis czis biobr zis bzis and pd zis pzis were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and characterized by bet uv vis drs sem tem xrd and xps respectively it showed that four catalysts had high photocatalytic activities for atrazine degradation under different light sources irradiation and their active sequence was pzis czis zis bzis the stronger light intensity the higher photocatalytic efficiency under direct solar irradiation of 1 h the degradation efficiency for 20 mg l of atrazine solution reached 90 by pzis with a dosage of 0 5 g l pd doping increased the specific surface area and shortened the band gap and particle size of the catalyst that resulting in an effective enhancement of photocatalytic activity in the process of atrazine degradation it confirmed by laser that pd2 ion entered the internal structure of zis to affect the crystal phase slightly but prohibit the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs effectively a feasible photocatalytic mechanism of atrazine by pzis was proposed in the paper the research work verified high photocatalytic activity of pzis for its further application in the purification of aquatic environment that polluted by various herbicides including atrazine keywords atrazine photocatalysis zis pd doping mechanism 1 introduction atrazine is a widely used herbicide for controlling broadleaf and grassy weeds to promote the growth of maize sorghum fruiter and woods etc 1 it is stable nonvolatile low water solubility 33 mg l at 25 and low biodegradability due to its triazine structure however it has medium toxicity to human being and livestock including endocrine disruption hepatoxicity and renal toxicity 2 to be classified as a possible human carcinogen by the usepa 3 atrazine remaining in the crops and grasses can enter soil surface water and groundwater by leaching and permeation nowadays it keeps a concentration of ng l μg l in aquatic environment worldwide thus posing a potential threat to the ecological environment 4 presently traditional techniques including biochar adsorption 5 microbic metabolism 6 phytoremediation 7 and advanced oxidation processes such as photo fenton 8 uv oxidation 9 and photocatalysis 10 are applied to treat atrazine in aquatic environment and soil among these technologies photocatalytic technology has been much more interested by the researchers in virtue of clean valueless and sustainable utilization of solar energy complete mineralization and detoxification of 20 mg l atrazine in water were attained by iranian scholars using in s tio2 rgo catalyst under visible light irradiation 11 among photocatalytic technique the photocatalyst is vital to the process and the research and development of new and high efficiency catalysts that utilizing visible light are still attracted deeply by scientists ga cl poly aam ni oh 2 feooh nch 12 ceo2 13 and au tio2 14 exhibited excellent activities for photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue flumequine and 1 butyl 3 methylimidazolium chloride respectively compared with metallic oxides the band gaps of metallic sulfides are narrower and more suitable to absorb visible light powerfully ternary metallic sulfides become a hotspot currently due to their strong resistance to photochemical corrosion especially for those containing transition metal 15 as a representative hexagonal zni2s4 zis has an excellent photocatalytic activity to have been already employed in hydrogen evolution 16 dye decolorizing 17 and pharmaceutical degradation 18 in virtue of strong reducing ability of photogenerated electron e and oxidizing ability of photogenerated hole h our previous works 19 20 have verified that zis band gap eg of 1 98 ev and 1 89 ev respectively and zis tio2 can induce hydroxyl radical oh active oxygen free radical o2 superoxide and hydrogen peroxide active species to degrade trace carbamazepine in aqueous solution effectively and the increase of light intensity is of benefit to the photocatalytic degradation of carbamazepine however to the best of our knowledge there is no literature reported the research of pure zis or zis based photocatalysts for the photocatalytic degradation of atrazine in water under visible light lamp or direct solar irradiation to enhance the photocatalytic activity of zis graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 as a visible light driven photocatalyst was reported to construct a binary heterojunction composite g c3n4 zis czis to enhance the charge separation and migration efficiency which improved effectively the h2 evolution rate 21 and 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid decomposition 22 bismuth oxybromide biobr that possessing excellent photocatalytic performance for dye degradation under visible light 23 was introduced to combine with uio 66 structural formula noted as zr24o120c192h96 to exhibit significantly enhanced photocatalytic activity on atrazine degradation 24 however there is still no report on the combination of biobr with zis in contaminant photodegradation metallic doping deposition or hybridization especially for noble metals like pt pd and au etc can improve effectively the photocatalytic performance of zis on h2 generation rate 25 alkylation of amines and ketones 26 and oxidation of benzyl alcohol 27 the reason is mostly attributed to trap conduction e to decrease the recombination of e h pairs that leading to the increase of photocatalytic activity herein we synthesized pure zis via a facile hydrothermal method and zis based photocatalysts such as czis composite biobr zis composite bzis and pd zis doping pzis then their photocatalytic activities were investigated in the degradation of atrazine in aqueous solution under different visible light lamps irradiation and direct solar irradiation respectively for experiment high atrazine concentration mg l that existing in the real industrial wastewater 28 was used to verify the catalytic activity of zis based photocatalysts the success of removing high atrazine concentration will certainly apply for the removal of low atrazine concentration in the real aquatic environment which could be deemed as more easily different characterizations reaction kinetics and feasible degrading mechanism were discussed simultaneously the novelty of the study is to clarify the photocatalytic activities of zis and zis based catalysts on atrazine degradation to look for one high performance zis based catalyst under direct solar irradiation moreover to carve out a new way to confirm pd particles entering into the inner structure of zis molecule 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals zinc nitrate hexahydrate zn no3 2 6h2o 99 and tetraamminepalladium ⅱ nitrate pd

58 mg in no3 3 were dissolved into 70 ml di water and sonicated for 0 5 h then 420 75 mg taa was added to metallic nitrates solution and sonicated for 0 5 h again secondly 20 vol hno3 was dropped into the mixture to adjust the ph of solution to 2 5 twice under stirring if not zis cannot be formed thirdly the mixture was sealed to a ptfe lined high pressure reactor and heated at 80 for 6 h finally yellow zis was obtained after centrifuged washed dried overnight and ground and kept at a marked vial before used 20 μl pd nh3 4 no3 2 solution 7 4 mg g c3n4 nanosheets and 7 4 mg biobr powder were added separately into metallic nitrates solution in the first step and then followed the same steps as well as zis preparation to obtain three zis zis based catalysts named as 0 5 wt pzis doped

could be related to pd2 ions but need further confirmation in order to verify the location of pd2 ions 0 5 wt pzis catalyst was added to pure methanol solution as reductant firstly then sonicated for 0 5 h to ensure a complete mixture and then reduced by a nd yag laser λ 532 nm pulse width τ 7 ns repetition rate 30 hz 70 100 mj pulse spectra physics lab 173 30 for 1 min under stirring 29 and the tem image was shown in fig 4 f it showed that pd spheric nanoparticles with different sizes appeared clearly on the surface of zis after laser reduction which was attributed to the strong energy of laser that leading to a rapid reduction and aggregation of pd2 ions laser energy also could destroy the structure of zis molecule which caused the color change of catalyst and exposed pd2 ions from the internal structure of zis therefore pd2 ions were confirmed to enter the molecular structure of zis in this work that according to the preparation method in section 2 2 fig 5 showed xrd and xps characterizations of four photocatalysts it can be seen in fig 5 a that four diffraction peaks represented different crystal planes of 102 400 112 and 202 respectively could be indexed to the hexagonal phase of zis jcpds card no 01 072 0773 30 biobr and g c3n4 composites had little effect on the crystal structure of zis however pd doping reduced the peak of 400 crystal plane apparently and shifted the peak of 112 crystal plane slightly to confirm pd2 ion entering the internal structure of zis again moreover pd2 ion could be connected to negative charged s planes of zis as evidenced from a light brown of pzis while comparing with yellow zis which was reported by chen 31 the xps full scanning spectra fig 5 b showed almost no difference for four zis based catalysts and only zn in and s element peaks were observed clearly high revolution spectra of three elements seen in fig 5 c e verified the existence of zn2 in3 and s2 ions 3 2 photocatalytic activity before experiment 0 5 wt pzis catalyst was selected as a representative to check the adsorption time in darkness and the result was shown on table 2 it showed clearly that the catalyst had a rapid adsorption to atrazine and the adsorption removal was 28 at 10 min then the adsorption was slowly and the adsorption removal rates were 29 and 39 at 30 min and 8760 min respectively therefore the dark adsorption time was confirmed to be 30 min in this work which was in accordance with a report of guo 32 subsequently the photocatalytic experiments under different light sources were conducted and the corresponding results were shown at fig 6 it was seen in fig 6 a that pure zis catalyzed the photodegradation of atrazine effectively and the degradation efficiency was about 62 after 5 h irradiation of halogen tungsten lamp the degradation rates of atrazine were 90 78 and 48 for pzis czis and bzis respectively pd doping and g c3n4 composite improved the catalytic activity of zis apparently although biobr composite decreased the catalytic activity in a degree therefore the sequence of photocatalytic activity of four catalysts to atrazine was 0 5 wt pzis 5 wt czis zis 5 wt bzis it was observed that the hydrophobicity of bzis was stronger than pure zis in experiment which could weaken the adsorption of atrazine onto the catalyst surface to bring negative effect on atrazine photodegradation the heterojunction structure of czis that reported by chen 33 adopting the similar process of catalyst preparation and pd doping that entering the structure of zis to prevent the recombination of e and h pairs could be the reasons for the improvement of their photocatalytic activities as a comparison 0 5 wt pzis catalyst showed no catalytic activity for atrazine photodegradation under irradiation of laboratorial fluorescent lamp 400 750 nm which could be attributed to a very weak light intensity of fluorescent lamp about 100 lx while comparing with 100 w halogen tungsten lamp about 2000 lx due to a full conversion for 2 mg l atrazine solution within 10 min under direct solar irradiation that was an insufficient time for sampling and pre treatment the initial concentration of atrazine solution was adjusted to 20 mg l and the experiments were conducted nearly at noon to acquire the strongest solar irradiation it could be seen in fig 6 b that the same activity sequence of the catalysts was confirmed again and the degradation efficiencies after 1 h irradiation were 90 75 69 and 48 for pzis czis zis and bzis respectively compared with halogen tungsten lamp a faster degrading speed under solar irradiation should be attributed to a stronger light intensity about 100000 lx at noon the decrease of adsorption effect should be due to a given catalyst dosage of 0 5 g l and the increase of initial concentration of atrazine solution fig 6 b also verified that direct photolysis without addition of catalyst could not remove atrazine and the increase of concentration should be explained to water evaporation in experiment considering the change of solar intensity with time passing the catalytic activities of pure zis and pzis were checked using a solar simulator that providing a constant light intensity of 1000 w m2 about 38000 lx it showed at fig 6 c that the degradation efficiencies of atrazine after 1 h irradiation were 43 and 78 for zis and pzis respectively that confirming the improvement of pd doping to zis activity again comparing with solar irradiation 100000 lx the degradation rates of atrazine using solar simulator 38000 lx decreased apparently which indicated light intensity was a key factor in atrazine photocatalytic degradation again 3 3 reaction kinetics to further clarify the order of reaction and the variety of photodegradative rate the kinetics curves of atrazine degradation by different zis based catalysts were fitted according to the first order and second order kinetics equations and shown in fig 7 relative kinetics equations and parameters were calculated and seen on table 3 based on kinetics fitting curves in fig 7 and related correlation coefficients r2 on table 3 atrazine photodegradation under irradiation of halogen tungsten lamp and solar simulator followed pseudo first order kinetics model and related r2 values were above 0 98 except for bzis which was in accordance with our previous research 19 and xue s report 24 however atrazine photodegradation under direct solar irradiation followed pseudo second order kinetics model and relative r2 were above 0 96 although the fitting results of first order kinetics were also satisfied with the increase of reaction order the effects of initial concentration of target compound and multiple adsorptions of catalyst become more obviously under solar irradiation atrazine was transformed to intermediates rapidly that resulting in competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface between atrazine and the intermediates therefore the pseudo second order reaction kinetics of atrazine could be related to high initial concentration of atrazine solution and multilayer adsorption of catalyst to atrazine and course products simultaneously moreover it was reported by khan 34 that the photochemical degradation of atrazine in uv s2o8 2 process followed second order reaction kinetics it showed on table 3 that pd doping improved the rate constant k apparently and reduced the half life t1 2 sharply under three light sources while comparing with pure zis for example the k and t1 2 values of pzis were 4 66 times and 1 15 7 less than those of zis under solar irradiation and 50 removal of 20 mg l atrazine solution was done quickly within 2 29 min it exhibits an available application of pzis in real treatment of atrazine industrial wastewater 28 3 4 photocatalytic mechanism based on the above discussion an available photocatalytic mechanism of atrazine by pzis catalyst was clarified in fig 8 due to premixture of pd2 with zn2 and in3 ions pd2 ion entered the molecular structure of zis during hydrothermal process and might connect with s2 ion weakly which changed the catalyst color decreased the crystal plane peak slightly and shortened the band gap obviously from 1 93 ev to 1 48 ev that improving visible light absorption greatly under visible light irradiation zis can be excited to generate electrons e and holes h a part of photogenerated electrons could react with oxygen and water molecules to generate active species like active oxygen free radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh etc which oxidized atrazine immediately onto the catalyst surface or in the solution some photogenerated electrons transferred from conduction band to the empty orbit of pd2 ion to inhibit the recombination of e h pair effectively the electrons from electron rich pd species 35 also can form o2 and oh to further oxidize atrazine the photogenerated holes on valence band had strong oxidizing capacity and oxidized atrazine to oxidative course products directly 19 4 conclusions in summary four zis based photocatalysts exhibited different catalytic activities in atrazine degradation and pzis showed the highest catalytic capacity under visible light irradiation however atrazine could not be photodegraded under fluorescent lamp irradiation due to a very weak light intensity direct photolysis also could not degrade atrazine in water a little comparing with pure zis the activity decrease of bzis should be related to large particle size and strong hydrophobicity and the improvement of czis activity could be attributed to the heterojunction structure the photocatalytic degradation of atrazine under direct solar irradiation followed pseudo second order kinetics due to high initial concentration of atrazine solution and competitive adsorption and photocatalytic degradation between atrazine and course products under solar irradiation pd doping improved the rate constant 4 66 times and reduced the half life to 1 15 7 greatly while comparing with zis pd2 ion that entering the inner structure of zis was hard to observe and trap by sem tem xrd and xps characterizations however pd0 particles appeared clearly on the surface of catalyst by tem after reduction by laser considering real application optimization of pd doping amounts and catalyst dosage will be carried out in our next work declaration of competing interest the

intermediates identified by gc ms analysis and reactive oxidant species ros study the operating cost of acrylonitrile treatment from aqueous solution was estimated to be 61 14 m3 wastewater by catalytic peroxidation process keywords acrylonitrile catalytic peroxidation perovskite like catalyst degradation pathways scavengers 1 introduction the rapid industrialization worldwide over the past few decades have led to generation of huge amount of toxic and refractory materials which are polluting the water bodies considering the stringent regulation on water safety and emission these toxic and refractory pollutants have been paid more attention due to their potential effects on human health and environment 1 acrylonitrile ch2 chcn is one of the major toxic and carcinogenic compound that discharge in high concentration from various industry such as abs resin acrylic fiber nitrile rubber and other synthetic resins 2 the wastewater discharge from abs resin manufacturing contain acrylonitrile in the range of 100 450 mg l 3 4 and other compound of acrylonitrile family viz 3 3 imminodipropiononitrile 30 35 mg l 3 3 oxydipropiononitrile 65 75 mg l 5 in a typical synthesis of acrylonitrile low volume of wastewater discharge from quench tower having the high concentration of acrylonitrile in the range of 1000 2000 mg l and the bulk volume of wastewater contain acrylonitrile in the range of 50 500 mg l 6 acrylonitrile is colourless flammable and volatile liquid acrylonitrile is produced by ammoxidation of propylene known as sohio process it is very highly toxic at low dosage 7 acrylonitrile is the 3rd rank most toxic pollutant in the united states environmental protection agency usepa list of 129 priority pollutants 8 the exposure of acrylonitrile occurs primarily in the work place via dermal contact and inhalation during its production or handling 9 the chronic exposure of acrylonitrile leads to detrimental impact on human health viz nausea asphyxia mild jaundice insomnia inflammation in respiratory system headache and weakness 10 11 consequently without treated properly acrylonitrile containing wastewater cannot be discharge into ground water until treated to bring its concentration within permissible limit 0 0026 mg l 12 a various treatment technique of acrylonitrile containing wastewater have been explored viz uv fenton process 13 peroxi coagulation 14 combined anaerobic oxic aerobic biological fluidized tank a o abft process 15 membrane process 16 photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption 17 supercritical water oxidation 18 adsorption 11 wet air oxidation 19 and microbial process 20 and others work have been tabulated in supplementary document table s1 however previous processes have some drawback such as membrane fouling and expensive cleaning or regeneration in membrane process corrosion and salt precipitation leads to high operating cost in supercritical water oxidation and high cost required for sludge disposal in biological process 16 18 therefore present scenario demands to developed a promising economic effective and environment friendly treatment technique for the degradation of acrylonitrile so as to prevent its detrimental impacts on human as well as animals to fulfill the desired objective catalytic peroxidation process cpo has been suggested cpo process is a noble and efficient approach to deal with emerging toxic and hazardous pollutants in wastewater among the all advanced oxidation processes cpo process is a heterogeneous fenton like process which carried out under mild conditions temperature 100 c unit atmospheric pressure with low consumption of energy 21 22 in cpo process hydroxyl radicals are produced from catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent e0 2 86 v low cost and non toxic reactant that promote the oxidation of organic compounds in the presence of catalyst 23 in the recent years various transition metals containing oxide such as mixed oxides hydroxides and zeolites have been used with supporting materials e g zms 5 mcm 41 gac sba 15 and clay in heterogeneous fenton like process 24 26 and various types of nano composite materials have been used in combined adsorption and heterogeneous fenton like catalytic oxidation process for the degradation of hazardous and toxic pollutants from aqueous medium adsorption phenomena are the initial step of heterogeneous fenton like catalytic oxidation process 27 31 however the stability of some catalyst was not satisfactory due to leaching of active metals from the catalyst in aqueous medium perovskite like catalyst is an emerging new class of materials in mixed oxide family because of their attractive physicochemical properties such as electronic structure excellent redox property electron mobility and high hydrothermal stability 32 perovskite have the general formula abo3 where a site cations occupied by lanthanide and alkaline earth cation and b site are transition metal cations lanthanum based perovskite catalyst have retained high catalytic activity with h2o2 for catalytic peroxidation process 21 33 a variety of perovskite like catalyst have been used for the removal of toxic and hazardous pollutants such as phenol paracetamol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid atrazine and acrylic acid 21 34 37 and other perovskite like catalysts with their applications have been tabulated in supplementary document table s2 however no study has been performed for the removal of acrylonitrile from aqueous solution by catalytic peroxidation process with perovskite like catalyst so far therefore present study focuses on optimization of operating parameters catalyst dose h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio ph and temperature through central composite

cuo phase jcpds pdf 041 0254 with crystalline monoclinic structure 39 some additional peaks located at 2θ values 31 10 47 90 and 54 20 corresponds to la2cuo4 phase jcpds pdf 01 086 0454 with orthorhombic crystal structure 35 and a common peak located at 2θ value 27 35 in both catalyst lccu and lcco attributed to la2o3 phase jcpds pdf 05 0602 with crystalline hexagonal structure 40 41 the catalyst lcfe exhibited major characteristic peaks located at 2θ values 22 84 32 52 40 11 and 46 60 attributed to lafeo3 phase jcpds pdf 01 075 0439 with crystalline cubic structure apart from that some common peaks were observed in all three catalysts located at 2θ values 28 68 56 78 and 76 80 corresponds to ceo2 phase jcpds pdf 001 0800 with crystalline cubic structure 42 43 the characteristics peaks in catalyst lcco exhibits main peaks at 2θ values 36 96 44 83 59 17 and 65 18 attributed to co3o4 phase jcpds pdf 001 1152 with crystalline cubic structure 44 the debye scherrer

the diffraction peak accordingly average crystal size of the catalysts was obtained 3 72 nm 5 84 nm and 6 3 nm for lccu lcfe and lcco respectively these average crystal sizes are similar to data reported by hammouda et al for ceo2 lafeo3 and ceo2 lacuo3 catalysts 43 3 1 2 fourier transform infrared ftir the ftir spectra of fresh and used la0 5ce0 5mo3 m cu fe and co perovskite like catalyst were obtained in the range of 400 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 as shown in fig 1b the spectral band around 3432 cm 1 exhibited stretching mode of oh group with hydrogen bonding of interlayer water molecules 45 46 spectral peak at around 2926 cm 1 is ascribed to aliphatic ch stretching vibration in ch ch2 30 31 spectral peak in the range of 1418 1427 cm 1 exhibited to bending vibrational mode of ch3 and cc stretching mode 47 48 as seen in fig 1b relative intensity of used catalyst was slightly decreased due to deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface which leads to inhibit the activity of catalyst 49 the strong peak at 2336 cm 1 can be assign to co2 molecules probably adsorbed on the surface of catalyst 50 and the peak around 1100 cm 1 1106 cm 1 and 1120 cm 1 indicates the co stretching mode in aliphatic ether 51 in addition highly intense characteristic peaks below 600 cm 1 533 570 573 and 568 cm 1 indicates the bonding between metal and oxygen mo mom and moh whereas m la ce fe cu and co 46 47 52 3 1 3 brunauer emmet teller bet surface area the texture properties of fresh and used catalysts were assessed by nitrogen adsorption desorption techniques bet method was used to measure the specific surface area of catalysts pore sizes and pore volume were evaluated by bjh method as given in table 1 bet surface area of the fresh catalysts were decreased after degradation of acrylonitrile from 4 95 m2 g to 3 78 m2 g for lccu 5 85 m2 g to 4 22 m2 g for lcfe and 7 19 m2 g to 5 71 m2 g for lcco respectively while the pore volume of fresh catalysts was significantly decreased after degradation of acrylonitrile from 0 162 to 0 131 cm3 g 0 186 to 0 169 cm3 g and 0 173 to 0 170 cm3 g for catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco respectively the surface area and pore volume of the catalysts was decreased after acrylonitrile degradation might be cause of blockage of catalyst pores by carbon deposit inside the pores or may be collapse of catalyst pores 49 53 54 bet surface area and pore volume of the catalysts are comparable to those reported by various authors 37 38 55 and similar decreasing trend have been reported by mao et al for lacemn catalyst 54 zhang et al for lamno3 perovskite catalyst 28 and maghsoodi et al for lamno3 56 the pore size of fresh catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco were obtained 2 14 2 64 and 3 50 nm and after treatment pore size of the catalysts were reduced to 2 03 2 18 and 2 48 nm respectively 3 1 4 scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the fe sem micrographs of fresh and used la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalysts and their corresponding edax analysis were shown in figs 2 a f the morphology of lccu catalyst exhibits the porous structure with interconnected aggregated nanosized particles as shown in fig 2a this shows that all the metals ions present in lccu catalyst sample are well dispersed similar type of morphology has been reported by hammouda et al for composite perovskite like catalyst ceo2 lacuo3 synthesized with citric acid used as a complexing agent 43 the surface morphology of lccu catalyst after treatment shows almost same structure as of fresh catalyst but the porosity of catalyst was reduced due to collapse of pores or reduce the pore size which is confirmed from bet pore size analysis 49 53 as shown in fig 2d in addition the substitution of fe in m site of la0 5ce0 5mo3 perovskite like catalyst lcfe its morphology has significantly changed along with shape of particles and non uniform irregular sheet like structure were observed as shown in fig 2b the morphology of lcfe catalysts after treatment was not much changed but the catalyst surface became rough due to deposition of impurity such as carbon from intermediate form during the degradation of acrylonitrile 35 despite of this catalyst particles have agglomerated with irregular shape as shown in fig 2e the substitution of co in m site of la0 5ce0 5mo3 perovskite like catalyst lcco a porous structure with interconnected aggregated nanosized particles were observed as shown in fig 2c similar type of morphology has been reported by bai et al for laceco catalyst 57 after treatment surface morphology of lcco catalyst show the cotton wool like surface with porous structure as shown in fig 2f the chemical composition of fresh and used la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalysts were studied with edax analysis the weight percentage of elements la ce m cu fe and co present in the catalyst samples is close to the stoichiometric composition as shown in table inserted in figs 2a f the stoichiometric composition of each element after treatment was significantly changed it may be due to leaching of active metals m fe cu and co from the catalyst surface 3 1 5 transmission electron microscopy tem tem images of lcfe perovskite like catalyst were taken to determine the internal morphology as well as crystallographic information the tem images depicted in figs 3 a c reveals that nano sized particles present in the lcfe perovskite like catalyst were seem to be irregular spherical like agglomerated and well dispersed these nanosized particles are in cubic and hexagonal shapes which are confirmed from xrd results 42 43 it is clearly seen from fig 3b lattice fringe of lafeo3 and ceo2 having periodicity of 2 75 nm and 3 11 nm respectively which correspond to d spacing of crystallographic plane d110 2 75 nm for lafeo3 phase jcpds pdf 01 075 0439 with cubic crystal structure and d spacing of d111 3 11 nm for ceo2 phase jcpds pdf 001 0800 with hexagonal crystal structure which is good agreement with xrd results 58 selected area electron diffraction saed pattern recorded the bright electron diffraction rings aiming to identify the crystal phases in lcfe catalyst shown in inset of fig 3b these diffraction rings suggest the formation of polycrystalline structure of lcfe catalyst the histogram plot of lcfe catalyst shown in fig 3d indicate the size distribution of particles these particles are in the range of 6 nm to 13 nm with average mean diameter of 9 35 nm in size which is obtained from more than fifty particles as shown in fig 3c the mean average particle size in histogram is close to the average crystal size in xrd results and similar to reported by 58 3 1 6 x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps xps technique was employed to investigate the surface property chemical state of elements and oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalyst xps survey spectrum of fresh and used lcfe catalyst represent the existence of la 3d ce 3d fe 2p and o 1 s elements in the sample 59 which is shown in fig 4 a the xps profile of fresh lcfe catalyst corresponding to la 3d level deconvoluted into two characteristic peaks at binding energy of 833 4 ev and 850 ev which can be assigned as la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 peaks respectively as shown in fig 4b the binding energy difference shown in two characteristic peaks of la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 are equal to 16 6 ev however these entire spectral peaks ensured the presence of la 3 state in the form of trivalent oxide la2o3 in catalyst and similar energy level with peak position have been reported by various authors 21 34 60 in addition the spectral peaks of used lcfe catalyst was small shifted toward the higher energy level of 833 9 ev and 851 2 ev corresponding to la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 which attributes to predominant state la iii in the form of hydroxide la oh 3 moreover lanthanum carbonate may be present on the catalyst surface 21 the shifting of xps peak is related to its oxidation state and higher shift in binding energy corresponds to higher oxidation state 28 fig 4c reveal that ce 3d spectrum shows two characteristic peaks at binding energy of 884 ev and 903 ev corresponding to ce 3d5 2 and ce 3d3 2 spin orbital in ce 3 chemical state 42 61 62 in addition ce 3d spectrum of used lcfe catalyst exhibited two similar spectral peaks as of fresh catalyst no significant change was observed in peak position only intensity of spectral peak increased at lower energy level 884 ev in ce 3d5 2 spin orbital and decreased at higher energy level 903 ev in ce 3d3 2 spin orbital which represent the atomic composition of ce 3 chemical state in the catalyst 63 cerium metal has gain great attention due to its attractive features such as high redox property high mobility of oxygen atom throughout the lattice structure and excellent oxygen storage capacity which enhance the catalytic activity of materials for wastewater treatment purpose on enhancing the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface leads to improve the activity of catalyst for acrylonitrile degradation 37 43 fig 4d reveal that fe 2p core level spectra of fresh lcfe catalyst deconvoluted into two characteristic peaks at binding energy 709 7 ev and 722 5 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 which are attributed to fe 3 chemical state 64 in addition xps spectral peak of used lcfe catalyst was small shifted toward the higher energy levels of 710 1 ev and 723 3 ev corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 the entire shifting of these energy levels confirming the chemical valance state fe 3 in used lcfe catalyst which is good agreement with the results reported by authors hammouda et al 43 64 the xps spectra of o1 s deconvoluted into three main peaks as shown in fig 4e these three peaks at binding energy 530 75 ev olat 531 1 ev osur and 531 8 ev obon were attributed to lattice oxygen species weakly bonded surface adsorbed oxygen species and chemisorbed species 36 42 the area of spectral peak quantifies the composition of active species on the surface of catalyst 65 moreover xps spectra of used catalyst for o1 s exhibit similar peaks as of fresh catalyst but peak area of adsorbed oxygen species 531 8 ev obon was increased after using the catalyst which indicate the carbonaceous species adsorbed in the form of carbonate oxygen h2o co3 2 on the catalyst surface the carbonate oxygen species adsorb on the catalyst surface by the intermediate formed during the acrylonitrile degradation 35 these adsorbed carbonaceous species accountable for reduction of acrylonitrile degradation 21 3 2 preliminary experimental study initially some preliminary experiments were performed for the removal of acrylonitrile in the presence and absence of oxidizing agent with catalysts as shown in fig 4f acrylonitrile removal was observed i e 10 49 8 50 and 6 93 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively without using oxidant at reaction conditions i e catalyst dose 1000 mg l ph₀ 6 5 acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and temperature 30 c furthermore 11 94 acrylonitrile removal was observed when only unit molar oxidizing agent stoichiometric molar ratio of acrylonitrile h2o2 1 was used without using any catalysts at the same reaction conditions the acrylonitrile removal was noticed i e 36 88 45 38 and 27 66 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively in the presence of oxidant at reaction conditions i e catalyst dose 1000 mg l ph₀ 6 5 acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio 1 and temperature 30 c moreover acrylonitrile removal was quite higher with simultaneous utilizing the catalyst and oxidising agent compared to utilizing oxidizing agent and catalyst alone therefore it is concluded that oxidizing agent and catalyst dose both are responsible for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile 3 3 effect of parameters on acrylonitrile removal 3 3 1 catalyst dose and acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio catalyst dose and h2o2 dose play a significant role in catalytic peroxidation process the higher catalyst loading increases the treatment cost but also produce the large volume of leachate containing high concentration of metal ions in effluent that cause create the further problems in environment 66 therefore optimization of catalyst dose and h2o2 dose is very necessary during acrylonitrile degradation the effect of catalyst dosage 250 1250 mg l and acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio 0 5 2 5 was studied during the degradation of acrylonitrile with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts the acrylonitrile removal efficiencies increased with increase in catalyst dosage and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio up to optimum operating values catalyst dose 745 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 67 catalyst dose 660 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 and catalyst dose 630 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 72 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively as shown in figs 5 a c and e subsequently acrylonitrile removal efficiencies starts to decrease on further increase in catalyst dosage and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio for all the catalysts 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o the rate of hydroxyl radical formation increases with increase in catalyst dosage up to optimum dose thereafter generated hydroxyl radical consumed by excess catalyst dose which leads to decrease removal efficiency 25 66 the rate of hydroxyl radical s generation mechanism is shown in eqs 2 and 3 it may be also that catalyst particle aggregate in aqueous solution that causes suppress the active sites or block the active sites of catalyst therefore rate of acrylonitrile degradation decreased with rise in catalyst dosage beyond the optimum catalyst dose 67 69 at higher h2o2 dose acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio excess amount of hydroxyl radical oh participate in the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ho2 these hydroperoxyl radical are less reactive compared to hydroxyl radical and do not participate in catalytic peroxidation reaction which leads to decrease in acrylonitrile removal efficiency 70 71 3 3 2 ph and temperature solution ph and reaction temperature are also very effective parameters that play the crucial role in catalytic peroxidation process the influence of ph 2 10 and temperature 30 90 c was studied during the catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts the acrylonitrile removal efficiencies increased with increase in ph and temperature up to optimum values ph 6 96 and temperature 66 c ph 5 44 and temperature 56 70 c and ph 7 52 and temperature 54 60 c catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively as shown in figs 5b d and f subsequently acrylonitrile removal efficiencies starts to decrease on further increase in ph and temperature however acrylonitrile removal efficiency decreases in both case either decrease or increase in ph whether the hydroxyl group on la0 5ce0 5mo3 will get protonated or deprotonated along with ph resulting in decreased acrylonitrile removal efficiency 22 at low ph 6 96 more protons h ions were generated that react with hydroxyl radicals and scavenge the hydroxyl radicals which leads to decreased the removal efficiency 22 72 73 moreover at low ph 6 96 interaction between acrylonitrile molecules and active sites of catalyst was very poor due to electrostatic force of repulsion which leads to decrease in removal efficiency in alkaline medium ph 6 96 hydrogen peroxide self decomposes into water and molecular oxygen rapidly which reduce the removal efficiency it might be also that hydroperoxyl radical is self decompose in neutral medium resulting in higher removal at optimum ph 22 25 74 the similar result has been reported by ren et al maximum acrylonitrile removal was reported at ph 7 with electrocoagulation and peroxy coagulation process 14 during catalytic peroxidation reaction an increase in reaction temperature accelerate the rate of h2o2 decomposition that enhanced the rate of hydroxyl radical generation and produced activation energy which leads to increase the collision frequency between oh radical and acrylonitrile molecules consequently enhance the acrylonitrile degradation efficiency 75 the enhanced degradation rate could be as cribbed to the arrhenius theory of rate constants dependence on temperature 70 4 h 2 o 2 oh h o 2 h 2 o 5 h o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o in addition further increase in reaction temperature exceed the optimum temperature acrylonitrile removal efficiency decreased due to rapid decomposition of h2o2 in to molecular oxygen rather than oh radical and scavenge the hydroxyl radical as shown in eqs 4 and 5 the produced molecular oxygen was not capable to efficiently degrade the organic compound under mild conditions 76 77 3 4 response surface methodology rsm analysis 3 4 1 optimization of operating parameters catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile was studied by optimizing the operating parameters through central composite design ccd in response surface methodology rsm to obtain the maximum acrylonitrile degradation with catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco design expert software stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used to determine the optimum operating conditions on the basis of results obtained from regression and graphical analysis the ranges of operating parameters are given in table 2 actual and ccd predicted removal efficiency of acrylonitrile with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts are given in table 3 and ccd predicted optimum operating conditions and their experimental results are given in table 4 3 5 anova analysis 3 5 1 regression coefficient r2 predicted r2 adjusted r2 and adequacy of precision regression coefficient r2 is very significant tools to examine the adequacy of the model the value of r2 should be greater than 0 8 for better fitting of model 78 79 in the present study values of r2 for the degradation of acrylonitrile catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco are 0 94 0 95 and 0 91 respectively table 5 which indicate the good model adequacy predicted r2 value represents the variance in predicted data by the model higher value of predicted r2 indicates the highly significant model the adjusted r2 value determined the amount of variance in the mean and adjust the number of parameters in the model high value of adjusted r2 indicates the highly significant model 80 82 the adjusted r2 corrected to r2 for number of terms and sample sizes of the model adequacy of precision represents the signal to noise ratio for better fitting of model signal to noise ratio should be more than 4 79 all the values of predicted r2 adjusted r2 and adequacy of precision for catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco are given in the table 5 3 5 2 cv coefficient of variation press predicted residual error sum of squares p value and f value cv value determined the variation in actual values and model predicted values the value of cv should not be greater than 10 for better adequacy of the model 79 press value is very crucial parameter that measures the fitting quality of model on each point it is sum of square difference between estimated values and actual values over all points p value indicates the significance of model terms model terms which have lower p value 0 05 are significant and greater than 0 100 are insignificant 83 f value of model indicates the distribution of actual data near the fitted model lower p values and f values are desirable for good fitting of model terms 83 84 all the values of cv press p value and f value are in satisfactory level in the model as shown in table 5 3 5 3 model equations based on the anova analysis in the present study ccd model suggested the second order polynomial equations for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with various catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco which represent the correlation between independent variables and responses the responses for acrylonitrile degradation with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts are given in generalized eqs 6 8 as following 6 r cu 76 06 5 99 a 5 76 b 4 32 c 5 69 d 0 268 a b 1 01 b c 0 85 b d 0 735 c d 5 17 a 2 3 29 b 2 7 75 c 2 7 r fe 93 5 17 a 7 08 b 10 83 c 5 58 d 0 125 a b 1 75 b c 3 c d 6 69 a 2 7 19 b 2 11

b acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio c ph and d temperature are coded values for the independent variables 3 6 scavenger study the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism is further confirmed by scavenging study of in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros during the reaction in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 were treated with their respective quenchers as tert butyl alcohol tba was used as hydroxyl radical scavenger 35 p benzoquinone p bq was used as superoxide radical scavenger 85 and sodium azide sa was used as a singlet oxygen scavenger 86 in the scavenging study a known amount of catalyst dose and h2o2 were introduced into acrylonitrile aqueous solution and treated with desired amount of quencher dose acrylonitrile removal efficiency was significantly inhibited about 9 40 treated with these quenchers 25 mm at optimum operating conditions e g lcfe catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 4 reaction temperature 56 7 c acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and reaction time 3 h the ros scavengers viz 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butylalcohol tba and sodium azide sa inhibited the dye degradation about 30 40 catalysis with zg5 nanocomposite by photocatalytic process 85 similar ros scavengers inhibited photocatalytic degradation of pyridine assisted by 5 cu zno up to 35 45 86 the kinetic study of inhibition rate of acrylonitrile degradation with various quenchers are shown in fig 6 a the inhibition rate constant values for acrylonitrile degradation were obtained i e 12 8 10 03 12 1 10 03 8 8 10 03 and 4 7 10 03 min 1 for lcfe without scavenger lcfe sa lcfe p bq and lcfe tba respectively as shown in supporting document table s3 the above results demonstrate that in situ generated hydroxyl radical s more influenced on acrylonitrile degradation than other ros scavengers superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen therefore effect of various concentrations of hydroxyl radical quencher tba 25 50 mm was further investigated on acrylonitrile removal at the same optimum operating conditions acrylonitrile removal efficiency was significantly inhibited about 45 59 treated with tba concentrations 25 50 mm the inhibition rate constant values for acrylonitrile degradation were obtained 12 8 10 03 6 2 10 03 5 7 10 03 and 4 7 10 03 min 1 for without scavenger 25 mm 30 mm and 50 mm concentrations respectively as shown in fig 6b the inhibition rate of acrylonitrile degradation decreased with increase in hydroxyl radical scavenger concentration therefore it is concluded that in situ generated hydroxyl radicals played major role in catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile 3 7 kinetic study the acrylonitrile degradation kinetics was studied by employing the excess amount of h2o2 for completely oxidize the acrylonitrile during catalytic peroxidation process therefore dependence of h2o2 in catalytic peroxidation reaction kinetics was avoided 70 the kinetics of acrylonitrile degradation at various temperatures and concentrations can be expressed by a power law rate eq 9 as following 9 r dc dt k c p c w q where p and q are order of reaction for acrylonitrile concentration and catalyst dose c and cw are acrylonitrile concentration at time t and catalyst dose mg l k is rate constant since catalyst is not consumed in the catalytic peroxidation reaction power law model can be suitably represented by following eq 10 10 dc dt k c p various authors have been reported similar type of two step reaction kinetics as a pseudo first order kinetics in catalytic peroxidation reaction 22 70 87 the above eq 10 can be integrated for n 1 to yield eq 11 11 ln c o c t kt where k k c w q is first order rate constant which can be determined by slope of linear plot between ln co ct versus t it can be seen from fig 6c d degradation of acrylonitrile by catalytic peroxidation process displays two linear sections in the plots these bilinear plots indicate that acrylonitrile degradation occurs in two steps fast step and slow step in fast step acrylonitrile oxidized into intermediate compounds and other small compounds accordingly in slow step these intermediate compounds get further oxidized into carbon dioxide and water 67 70 the values of rate constants k1 and k2 for fast step and slow step at various temperatures 303 353 k and various concentrations 100 500 mg l for acrylonitrile degradation are given in table 6 it is clearly seen from fig 6c that values of rate constants k1 and k2 increased with increase in reaction temperature and the values of rate constant in fast step k1 is much higher than slow step k2 consequently the transition time for fast step to slow step reaction tends to decreased with increase in reaction temperature therefore peroxidation reaction shifted from kinetic controlled regime to diffusion controlled regime diffusion rate constant kdiffusion and surface reaction rate constant ksurface reaction both rate constants must account for controlling the reaction the overall reaction rate constant can be expressed as following eq 12 12 k overall k diffusion k surface reaction k diffusion k surface reaction at low temperature catalytic peroxidation reaction controlled by ksurface reaction kinetic constant 25 88 89 thus conversion of h2o2 into oh radicals on the active sites and reaction between acrylonitrile molecules and oh radical both controlled by ksurface reaction moreover catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile reaction accelerates at high temperature which is controlled by both rate constants kdiffusion and ksurface reaction the values of rate constant k1 and k2 were further utilized to determine the activation energy by arrhenius equation as depicted in fig 6e and table 6 the activation energy in fast step and slow step for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile was obtained 34 48 kj mol and 17 93 kj mol respectively similar values of activation energy i e 41 29 29 40 and 19 10 kj mol were reported for pyrrole quinoline and pyridine degradation in aqueous solution 67 87 90 3 8 catalyst reusability study the reusability study of the catalyst was carried out to assess the economic viability of lcfe catalyst over four cycles under optimum operating conditions e g catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 44 reaction temperature 56 7 c acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and time 3 h in the first cycle maximum acrylonitrile degradation was observed about 90 11 the spent catalyst was separated from reaction solution by centrifugation separated catalyst was washed with 0 1 m nh4oh and dried at 100 c for 8 h 70 85 regenerated catalyst was further used in new batch of acrylonitrile aqueous solution at the same optimum operating conditions in the second third and fourth cycles acrylonitrile removal efficiency gradually dropped from 90 11 to 80 38 73 42 and 69 92 respectively the catalytic activity decreased after each cycle might be caused of some possible reasons 1 leaching of active sites fe in catalyst 43 2 intermediate formed during the acrylonitrile degradation adsorbed on the catalyst surface and occupied the active sites on the catalyst surface 91 fe leaching was measured after each cycle of experiment by icp ms as shown in fig 7 a fe leaching was gradually decreased after each cycle and observed 0 96 mg l 0 62 mg l 0 38 mg l and 0 27 mg l after first second third and fourth cycles respectively which is below the range of discharge permissible limits of wastewater in india 92 the chemical stability of lcfe catalyst was further analyzed at optimum operating conditions in term of fe leaching at various phs as shown in fig 7b the leaching of fe gradually decreased i e 2 11 1 16 0 96 and 0 76 mg l with increase in ph i e 2 4 5 4 and 9 and significantly rises in acrylonitrile removal efficiency i e 45 41 64 19 90 11 and 65 86 the fe leaching was obtained 0 63 0 35 0 29 and 0 23 for ph 2 4 5 4 and 9 respectively in strong acidic medium ph 2 highest fe leaching was observed due to that acrylonitrile removal efficiency 45 41 was decreased authors qin et al reported the fe leaching 1 65 1 36 1 18 0 88 and 0 75 for phs 2 1 3 8 5 8 8 1 and 10 2 respectively during the degradation of benzoic acid by catalytic wet peroxide oxidation catalysis with fe can 77 and similar behavior have been also reported by various authors 43 93 therefore it is concluded that to achieving long term stability of the catalyst reaction should be performed at neutral and alkaline ph 77 moreover ph of the solution plays crucial role to prevent loss of active sites from catalyst surface metal leaching is the major disadvantage of heterogeneous catalyst which reduce the active sites of the catalyst but perovskite like catalyst is very stable catalyst that does not lose the catalytic activity after many cycles 32 authors taran and co worker reported that lafeo3 perovskite like catalyst does not lose their catalytic activity after forty cycles for the removal of phenol 21 and sulfamethoxazole was treated by lafeo3 perovskite like catalyst their activity was not much affected after ten cycles 35 therefore it is concluded that lcfe perovskite like catalyst is very stable catalyst for the degradation of acrylonitrile 3 9 acrylonitrile mineralization mechanism catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with synthesized lcfe catalyst can be ascribed to heterogeneous fenton like process the reactive oxygen species oh o2 ho2 are produced through catalytic decomposition of h2o2 which are responsible for the degradation of any organic compounds 22 94 the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism has been suggested to proceed via decomposition of h2o2 chemisorbed on the active sites fe 3 of lcfe catalyst surface and to formed the complex as shown in eq 13 the formed complex was subsequently converted in to fe 2 and produced the ho2 radicals in eq 14 94 95 these hydroperoxyl radical ho2 radicals are very unstable having the oxidation potential significantly lower than that of hydroxyl radical oh converted into superoxide radicals o2 via eq 15 the active site fe 3 further react with o2 ho2 and produced fe 2 with molecular oxygen via eq 16 fe 2 oxidized to fe 3 via transfer of one electron and generate oh radicals in eq 17 which is known as fenton reaction 94 moreover fe 3 fe 2 cycles frequently accelerated and more reactive oxygen species were generated according to haber wiese mechanism 96 13 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 14 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 15 h o 2 o 2 h 16 f e 3 h o 2 o 2 f e 2 o 2 h 17 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 oh o h 18 acrylonitrile oh o2 intermediates co2 h2o hence acrylonitrile mineralized into co2 and h2o via overall reaction 18 the reaction pathway of acrylonitrile degradation was proposed based on the intermediates identified by gc ms analysis as shown in supporting document figure s2 and available literature study 14 various intermediate compounds i e propanamide acrylic acid propionic acid d alanine acetic acid acetamide dimethylamine were identified four possible routes of acrylonitrile degradation were proposed based on intermediates identified and literature study as shown in fig 7c in first path oh radicals attacked on acrylonitrile molecules which converted into propanamide propanamide further convert into acrylic acid and acetic until mineralized to co2 and h2o 97 in the second and third possible routes major intermediates dimethylamine and alanine formed and further degraded into propionic acid via deamination propionic acid is further degraded into acetic acid until mineralized to co2 and h2o in the last possible route acrylonitrile reacts with oh radical which convert into intermediate acetamide acetamide further degraded into acetic acid by deamination and mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 10 cost evaluation of treatment process evaluation of treatment cost is an important aspect for implementation of any innovative technologies the operating cost of acrylonitrile treatment by catalytic peroxidation process was evaluated at optimum operating condition the operating cost of treatment process comprises to chemical reagent cost and energy consumption cost for catalytic peroxidation process as shown in table 7 the operating cost of acrylonitrile treatment by catalytic peroxidation process was estimated to be 61 14 m3 wastewater this operating cost can be decrease in large scale operation the operating cost for treatment of pyridine by catalytic wet peroxidation process was found to be 99 62 m3 using nfeº gac catalyst 87 and 248 m3 catalysis with ceria supported sba 15 98 similarly for treatment of 2 propanol by ozonation and fenton oxidation process operating cost was estimated to be 145 m3 and 94 m3 respectively 99 thus catalytic peroxidation process is relatively cheaper than other processes viz ozonation and fenton oxidation process for removal of pollutant from wastewater 4 conclusions this study shows la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalyst synthesized by sol gel method exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for the degradation of acrylonitrile by catalytic peroxidation process the maximum acrylonitrile removal for various concentrations 100 200 300 and 500 mg l was 90 11 77 56 71 62 and 60 37 respectively at optimum operating conditions i e lcfe catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 4 reaction temperature 56 7 c and reaction time 3 h the kinetic data of acrylonitrile degradation by catalytic peroxidation process at various temperatures and concentrations were well represented by first order and two step degradation kinetic model in situ generated reactive oxidant species ros studies were performed to justify the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism and concluded that in situ generated hydroxyl radical play major role in catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile catalyst reusability studies demonstrate that la0 5ce0 5feo3 perovskite like catalyst loose minor catalytic activity and maintained the satisfactory performance in the fourth cycles the acrylonitrile mineralization mechanism was proposed by four reaction pathways on the basis of intermediates identified by gc ms in all reaction pathways acrylonitrile converted into intermediate

catalytic peroxidation process keywords acrylonitrile catalytic peroxidation perovskite like catalyst degradation pathways scavengers 1 introduction the rapid industrialization worldwide over the past few decades have led to generation of huge amount of toxic and refractory materials which are polluting the water bodies considering the stringent regulation on water safety and emission these toxic and refractory pollutants have been paid more attention due to their potential effects on human health and environment 1 acrylonitrile ch2 chcn is one of the major toxic and carcinogenic compound that discharge in high concentration from various industry such as abs resin acrylic fiber nitrile rubber and other synthetic resins 2 the wastewater discharge from abs resin manufacturing contain acrylonitrile in the range of 100 450 mg l 3 4 and other compound of acrylonitrile family viz 3 3 imminodipropiononitrile 30 35 mg l 3 3 oxydipropiononitrile 65 75 mg l 5 in a typical synthesis of acrylonitrile low volume of wastewater discharge from quench tower having the high concentration of acrylonitrile in the range of 1000 2000 mg l and the bulk volume of wastewater contain acrylonitrile in the range of 50 500 mg l 6 acrylonitrile is colourless flammable and volatile liquid acrylonitrile is produced by ammoxidation of propylene known as sohio process it is very highly toxic at low dosage 7 acrylonitrile is the 3rd rank most toxic pollutant in the united states environmental protection agency usepa list of 129 priority pollutants 8 the exposure of acrylonitrile occurs primarily in the work place via dermal contact and inhalation during its production or handling 9 the chronic exposure of acrylonitrile leads to detrimental impact on human health viz nausea asphyxia mild jaundice insomnia inflammation in respiratory system headache and weakness 10 11 consequently without treated properly acrylonitrile containing wastewater cannot be discharge into ground water until treated to bring its concentration within permissible limit 0 0026 mg l 12 a various treatment technique of acrylonitrile containing wastewater have been explored viz uv fenton process 13 peroxi coagulation 14 combined anaerobic oxic aerobic biological fluidized tank a o abft process 15 membrane process 16 photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption 17 supercritical water oxidation 18 adsorption 11 wet air oxidation 19 and microbial process 20 and others work have been tabulated in supplementary document table s1 however previous processes have some drawback such as membrane fouling and expensive cleaning or regeneration in membrane process corrosion and salt precipitation leads to high operating cost in supercritical water oxidation and high cost required for sludge disposal in biological process 16 18 therefore present scenario demands to developed a promising economic effective and environment friendly treatment technique for the degradation of acrylonitrile so as to prevent its detrimental impacts on human as well as animals to fulfill the desired objective catalytic peroxidation process cpo has been suggested cpo process is a noble and efficient approach to deal with emerging toxic and hazardous pollutants in wastewater among the all advanced oxidation processes cpo process is a heterogeneous fenton like process which carried out under mild conditions temperature 100 c unit atmospheric pressure with low consumption of energy 21 22 in cpo process hydroxyl radicals are produced from catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydrogen peroxide is a powerful oxidizing agent e0 2 86 v low cost and non toxic reactant that promote the oxidation of organic compounds in the presence of catalyst 23 in the recent years various transition metals containing oxide such as mixed oxides hydroxides and zeolites have been used with supporting materials e g zms 5 mcm 41 gac sba 15 and clay in heterogeneous fenton like process 24 26 and various types of nano composite materials have been used in combined adsorption and heterogeneous fenton like catalytic oxidation process for the degradation of hazardous and toxic pollutants from aqueous medium adsorption phenomena are the initial step of heterogeneous fenton like catalytic oxidation process 27 31 however the stability of some catalyst was not satisfactory due to leaching of active metals from the catalyst in aqueous medium perovskite like catalyst is an emerging new class of materials in mixed oxide family because of their attractive physicochemical properties such as electronic structure excellent redox property electron mobility and high hydrothermal stability 32 perovskite have the general formula abo3 where a site cations occupied by lanthanide and alkaline earth cation and b site are transition metal cations lanthanum based perovskite catalyst have retained high catalytic activity with h2o2 for catalytic peroxidation process 21 33 a variety of perovskite like catalyst have been used for the removal of toxic and hazardous pollutants such as phenol paracetamol 2 hydroxybenzoic acid atrazine and acrylic acid 21 34 37 and other perovskite like catalysts with their applications have been tabulated in supplementary document table s2 however no study has been performed for the removal of acrylonitrile from aqueous solution by catalytic peroxidation process with perovskite like catalyst so far therefore present study focuses on optimization of operating parameters catalyst dose h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio ph and temperature through central composite design ccd in response surface methodology rsm for acrylonitrile degradation by catalytic peroxidation process with la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalysts the synthesized catalysts were further characterized by xrd ftir bet fe sem tem and xps furthermore acrylonitrile mineralization pathways were proposed based on intermediates identified by gc ms analysis and justified by ros

46 spectral peak at around 2926 cm 1 is ascribed to aliphatic ch stretching vibration in ch ch2 30 31 spectral peak in the range of 1418 1427 cm 1 exhibited to bending vibrational mode of ch3 and cc stretching mode 47 48 as seen in fig 1b relative intensity of used catalyst was slightly decreased due to deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface which leads to inhibit the activity of catalyst

47 52 3 1 3 brunauer emmet teller bet surface area the texture properties of fresh and used catalysts were assessed by nitrogen adsorption desorption techniques bet method was used to measure the specific surface area of catalysts pore sizes and pore volume were evaluated by bjh method as given in table 1 bet surface area of the fresh catalysts were decreased after degradation of acrylonitrile from 4 95 m2 g to 3 78 m2 g for lccu 5 85 m2 g to 4 22 m2 g for lcfe and 7 19 m2 g to 5 71 m2 g for lcco respectively while the pore volume of fresh catalysts was significantly decreased after degradation of acrylonitrile from 0 162 to 0 131 cm3 g 0 186 to 0 169 cm3 g and 0 173 to 0 170 cm3 g for catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco respectively the surface area and pore volume of the catalysts was decreased after acrylonitrile degradation might be cause of blockage of catalyst pores by carbon deposit inside the pores or may be collapse of catalyst pores 49 53 54 bet surface area and pore volume of the catalysts are comparable to those reported by various authors 37 38 55 and similar decreasing trend have been reported by mao et al for lacemn catalyst 54 zhang et al for lamno3 perovskite catalyst 28 and maghsoodi et al for lamno3 56 the pore size of fresh catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco were obtained 2 14 2 64 and 3 50 nm and after treatment pore size of the catalysts were reduced to 2 03 2 18 and 2 48 nm respectively 3 1 4 scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy the fe sem micrographs of fresh and used la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalysts and their corresponding edax analysis were shown in figs 2 a f the morphology of lccu catalyst exhibits the porous structure with interconnected aggregated nanosized particles as shown in fig 2a this shows that all the metals ions present in lccu catalyst sample are well dispersed similar type of morphology has been reported by hammouda et al for composite perovskite like catalyst ceo2 lacuo3 synthesized with citric acid used as a complexing agent 43 the surface morphology of lccu catalyst after treatment shows almost same structure as of fresh catalyst but the porosity of catalyst was reduced due to collapse of pores or reduce the pore size which is confirmed from bet pore size analysis 49 53 as shown in fig 2d in addition the substitution of fe in m site of la0 5ce0 5mo3 perovskite like catalyst lcfe its morphology has significantly changed along with shape of particles and non uniform irregular sheet like structure were observed as shown in fig 2b the morphology of lcfe catalysts after treatment was not much changed but the catalyst surface became rough due to deposition of impurity such as carbon from intermediate form during the degradation of acrylonitrile 35 despite of this catalyst particles have agglomerated with irregular shape as shown in fig 2e the substitution of co in m site of la0 5ce0 5mo3 perovskite like catalyst lcco a porous structure with interconnected aggregated nanosized particles were observed as shown in fig 2c similar type of morphology has been reported by bai et al for laceco catalyst 57 after treatment surface morphology of lcco catalyst show the cotton wool like surface with porous structure as shown in fig 2f the chemical composition of fresh and used la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalysts were studied with edax analysis the weight percentage of elements la ce m cu fe and co present in the catalyst samples is close to the stoichiometric composition as shown in table inserted in figs 2a f the stoichiometric composition of each element after treatment was significantly changed it may be due to leaching of active metals m fe cu and co from the catalyst surface 3 1 5 transmission electron microscopy tem tem images of lcfe perovskite like catalyst were taken to determine the internal morphology as well as crystallographic information the tem images depicted in figs 3 a c reveals that nano sized particles present in the lcfe perovskite like catalyst were seem to be irregular spherical like agglomerated and well dispersed these nanosized particles are in cubic and hexagonal shapes which are confirmed from xrd results 42 43 it is clearly seen from fig 3b lattice fringe of lafeo3 and ceo2 having periodicity of 2 75 nm and 3 11 nm respectively which correspond to d spacing of crystallographic plane d110 2 75 nm for lafeo3 phase jcpds pdf 01 075 0439 with cubic crystal structure and d spacing of d111 3 11 nm for ceo2 phase jcpds pdf 001 0800 with hexagonal crystal structure which is good agreement with xrd results 58 selected area electron diffraction saed pattern recorded the bright electron diffraction rings aiming to identify the crystal phases in lcfe catalyst shown in inset of fig 3b these diffraction rings suggest the formation of polycrystalline structure of lcfe catalyst the histogram plot of lcfe catalyst shown in fig 3d indicate the size distribution of

size in histogram is close to the average crystal size in xrd results and similar to reported by 58 3 1 6 x ray photo electron spectroscopy xps xps technique was employed to investigate the surface property chemical state of elements and oxygen vacancies on the surface of catalyst xps survey spectrum of fresh and used lcfe catalyst represent the existence of la 3d ce 3d fe 2p and o 1 s elements in the sample 59 which is shown in fig 4 a the xps profile of fresh lcfe catalyst corresponding to la 3d level deconvoluted into two characteristic peaks at binding energy of 833 4 ev and 850 ev which can be assigned as la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 peaks respectively as shown in fig 4b the binding energy difference shown in two characteristic peaks of la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 are equal to 16 6 ev however these entire spectral peaks ensured the presence of la 3 state in the form of trivalent oxide la2o3 in catalyst and similar energy level with peak position have been reported by various authors 21 34 60 in addition the spectral peaks of used lcfe catalyst was small shifted toward the higher energy level of 833 9 ev and 851 2 ev corresponding to la 3d5 2 and la 3d3 2 which attributes to predominant state la iii in the form of hydroxide la oh 3 moreover lanthanum carbonate may be present on the catalyst surface 21 the shifting of xps peak is related to its oxidation state and higher shift in binding energy corresponds to higher oxidation state 28 fig 4c reveal that ce 3d spectrum shows two characteristic peaks at binding energy of 884 ev and 903 ev corresponding to ce 3d5 2 and ce 3d3 2 spin orbital in ce 3 chemical state 42 61 62 in addition ce 3d spectrum of used lcfe catalyst exhibited two similar spectral peaks as of fresh catalyst no significant change was observed in peak position only intensity of spectral peak increased at lower energy level 884 ev in ce 3d5 2 spin orbital and decreased at higher energy level 903 ev in ce 3d3 2 spin orbital which represent the atomic composition of ce 3 chemical state in the catalyst 63 cerium metal has gain great attention due to its attractive features such as high redox property high mobility of oxygen atom throughout the lattice structure and excellent oxygen storage capacity which enhance the catalytic activity of materials for wastewater treatment purpose on enhancing the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface leads to improve the activity of catalyst for acrylonitrile degradation 37 43 fig 4d reveal that fe 2p core level spectra of fresh lcfe catalyst deconvoluted into two characteristic peaks at binding energy 709 7 ev and 722 5 ev corresponding to 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 which are attributed to fe 3 chemical state 64 in addition xps spectral peak of used lcfe catalyst was small shifted toward the higher energy levels of 710 1 ev and 723 3 ev corresponding to fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 the entire shifting of these energy levels confirming the chemical valance state fe 3 in used lcfe catalyst which is good agreement with the results reported by authors hammouda et al 43 64 the xps spectra of o1 s deconvoluted into three main peaks as shown in fig 4e these three peaks at binding energy 530 75 ev olat 531 1 ev osur and 531 8 ev obon were attributed to lattice oxygen species weakly bonded surface adsorbed oxygen species and chemisorbed species 36 42 the area of spectral peak quantifies the composition of active species on the surface of catalyst 65 moreover xps spectra of used catalyst for o1 s exhibit similar peaks as of fresh catalyst but peak area of adsorbed oxygen species 531 8 ev obon was increased after using the catalyst which indicate the carbonaceous species adsorbed in the form of carbonate oxygen h2o co3 2 on the catalyst surface the carbonate oxygen species adsorb on the catalyst surface by the intermediate formed during the acrylonitrile degradation 35 these adsorbed carbonaceous species accountable for reduction of acrylonitrile degradation 21 3 2 preliminary experimental study initially some preliminary experiments were performed for the removal of acrylonitrile in the presence and absence of oxidizing agent with catalysts as shown in fig 4f acrylonitrile removal was observed i e 10 49 8 50 and 6 93 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively without using oxidant at reaction conditions i e catalyst dose 1000 mg l ph₀ 6 5 acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and temperature 30 c furthermore 11 94 acrylonitrile removal was observed when only unit molar oxidizing agent stoichiometric molar ratio of acrylonitrile h2o2 1 was used without using any catalysts at the same reaction conditions the acrylonitrile removal was noticed i e 36 88 45 38 and 27 66 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively in the presence of oxidant at reaction conditions i e catalyst dose 1000 mg l ph₀ 6 5 acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio 1 and temperature 30 c moreover acrylonitrile removal was quite higher with simultaneous utilizing the catalyst and oxidising agent compared to utilizing oxidizing agent and catalyst alone therefore it is concluded that oxidizing agent and catalyst dose both are responsible for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile 3 3 effect of parameters on acrylonitrile removal 3 3 1 catalyst dose and acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio catalyst dose and h2o2 dose play a significant role in catalytic peroxidation process the higher catalyst loading increases the treatment cost but also produce the large volume of leachate containing high concentration of metal ions in effluent that cause create the further problems in environment 66 therefore optimization of catalyst dose and h2o2 dose is very necessary during acrylonitrile degradation the effect of catalyst dosage 250 1250 mg l and acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio 0 5 2 5 was studied during the degradation of acrylonitrile with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts the acrylonitrile removal efficiencies increased with increase in catalyst dosage and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio up to optimum operating values catalyst dose 745 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 67 catalyst dose 660 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 and catalyst dose 630 mg l and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 72 catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively as shown in figs 5 a c and e subsequently acrylonitrile removal efficiencies starts to decrease on further increase in catalyst dosage and h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio for all the catalysts 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 3 h 2 o 2 h o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o the rate of hydroxyl radical formation increases with increase in catalyst dosage up to optimum dose thereafter generated hydroxyl radical consumed by excess catalyst dose which leads to decrease removal efficiency 25 66 the rate of hydroxyl radical s generation mechanism is shown in eqs 2 and 3 it may be also that catalyst particle aggregate in aqueous solution that causes suppress the active sites or block the active sites of catalyst therefore rate of acrylonitrile degradation decreased with rise in catalyst dosage beyond the optimum catalyst dose 67 69 at higher h2o2 dose acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio excess amount of hydroxyl radical oh participate in the formation of hydroperoxyl radical ho2 these hydroperoxyl radical are less reactive compared to hydroxyl radical and do not participate in catalytic peroxidation reaction which leads to decrease in acrylonitrile removal efficiency 70 71 3 3 2 ph and temperature solution ph and reaction temperature are also very effective parameters that play the crucial role in catalytic peroxidation process the influence of ph 2 10 and temperature 30 90 c was studied during the catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts the acrylonitrile removal efficiencies increased with increase in ph and temperature up to optimum values ph 6 96 and temperature 66 c ph 5 44 and temperature 56 70 c and ph 7 52 and temperature 54 60 c catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco respectively as shown in figs 5b d and f subsequently acrylonitrile removal efficiencies starts to decrease on further increase in ph and temperature however acrylonitrile removal efficiency decreases in both case either decrease or increase in ph whether the hydroxyl group on la0 5ce0 5mo3 will get protonated or deprotonated along with ph resulting in decreased acrylonitrile removal efficiency 22 at low ph 6 96 more protons h ions were generated that react with hydroxyl radicals and scavenge the hydroxyl radicals which leads to decreased the removal efficiency 22 72 73 moreover at low ph 6 96 interaction between acrylonitrile molecules and active sites of catalyst was very poor due to electrostatic force of repulsion which leads to decrease in removal efficiency in alkaline medium ph 6 96 hydrogen peroxide self decomposes into water and molecular oxygen rapidly which reduce the removal efficiency it might be also that hydroperoxyl radical is self decompose in neutral medium resulting in higher removal at optimum ph 22 25 74 the similar result has been reported by ren et al maximum acrylonitrile removal was reported at ph 7 with electrocoagulation and peroxy coagulation process 14 during catalytic peroxidation reaction an increase in reaction temperature accelerate the rate of h2o2 decomposition that enhanced the rate of hydroxyl radical generation and produced activation energy which leads to increase the collision frequency between oh radical and acrylonitrile molecules consequently enhance the acrylonitrile degradation efficiency 75 the enhanced degradation rate could be as cribbed to the arrhenius theory of rate constants dependence on temperature 70 4 h 2 o 2 oh h o 2 h 2 o 5 h o 2 oh o 2 h 2 o in addition further increase in reaction temperature exceed the optimum temperature acrylonitrile removal efficiency decreased due to rapid decomposition of h2o2 in to molecular oxygen rather than oh radical and scavenge the hydroxyl radical as shown in eqs 4 and 5 the produced molecular oxygen was not capable to efficiently degrade the organic compound under mild conditions 76 77 3 4 response surface methodology rsm analysis 3 4 1 optimization of operating parameters catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile was studied by optimizing the operating parameters through central composite design ccd in response surface methodology rsm to obtain the maximum acrylonitrile degradation with catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco design expert software stat ease inc minneapolis usa was used to determine the

regression coefficient r2 predicted r2 adjusted r2 and adequacy of precision regression coefficient r2 is very significant tools to examine the adequacy of the model the value of r2 should be greater than 0 8 for better fitting of model 78 79 in the present study values of r2 for the degradation of acrylonitrile catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco are 0 94 0 95 and 0 91 respectively table 5 which indicate the good model adequacy predicted r2 value represents the variance in predicted data by the model higher value of predicted r2 indicates the highly significant model the adjusted r2 value determined the amount of variance in the mean and adjust the number of parameters in the model high value of adjusted r2 indicates the highly significant model 80 82 the adjusted r2 corrected to r2 for number of terms and sample sizes of the model adequacy of precision represents the signal to noise ratio for better fitting of model signal to noise ratio should be more than 4 79 all the values of predicted r2 adjusted r2 and adequacy of precision for catalysis with lccu lcfe and lcco are given in the table 5 3 5 2 cv coefficient of variation press predicted residual error sum of squares p

crucial parameter that measures the fitting quality of model on each point it is sum of square difference between estimated values and actual values over all points p value indicates the significance of model terms model terms which have lower p value 0 05 are significant and greater than 0 100 are insignificant 83 f value of model indicates the distribution of actual data near the fitted model lower p values and f values are desirable for good fitting of model terms 83 84 all the values of cv press p value and f value are in satisfactory level in the model as shown in table 5 3 5 3 model equations based on the anova analysis in the present study ccd model suggested the second order polynomial equations for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with various catalysts lccu lcfe and lcco which represent the correlation between independent variables and responses the responses for acrylonitrile degradation with lccu lcfe and lcco catalysts are given in generalized eqs 6 8 as following 6 r cu 76 06 5 99 a 5 76 b 4 32 c 5 69 d 0 268 a b 1 01 b c 0 85 b d 0 735 c d 5 17 a 2 3 29 b 2 7 75 c 2 7 r fe 93 5 17 a 7 08 b 10 83 c 5 58 d 0 125 a b 1 75 b c 3 c d 6 69 a 2 7 19 b 2 11

b acrylonitrile h2o2 molar ratio c ph and d temperature are coded values for the independent variables 3 6 scavenger study the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism is further confirmed by scavenging study of in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros during the reaction in situ generated reactive oxygen species ros e g hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and singlet oxygen 1o2 were treated with their respective quenchers as tert butyl alcohol tba was used as hydroxyl radical scavenger 35 p benzoquinone p bq was used as superoxide radical scavenger 85 and sodium azide sa was used as a singlet oxygen scavenger 86 in the scavenging study a known amount of catalyst dose and h2o2 were introduced into acrylonitrile aqueous solution and treated with desired amount of quencher dose acrylonitrile removal efficiency was significantly inhibited about 9 40 treated with these quenchers 25 mm at optimum operating conditions e g lcfe catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 4 reaction temperature 56 7 c acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and reaction time 3 h the ros scavengers viz 1 4 benzoquinone bq tert butylalcohol tba and sodium azide sa inhibited the dye degradation about 30 40 catalysis with zg5 nanocomposite by photocatalytic process 85 similar ros scavengers inhibited photocatalytic degradation of pyridine assisted by 5 cu zno up to 35 45 86 the kinetic study of inhibition rate of acrylonitrile degradation with various quenchers are shown in fig 6 a the inhibition rate constant values for acrylonitrile degradation were obtained i e 12 8 10 03 12 1 10 03 8 8 10 03 and 4 7 10 03 min 1 for lcfe without scavenger lcfe sa lcfe p bq and lcfe tba respectively as shown in supporting document table s3 the above results demonstrate that in situ generated hydroxyl radical s more influenced on acrylonitrile degradation than other ros scavengers superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen therefore effect of various concentrations of hydroxyl radical quencher tba 25 50 mm was further investigated on acrylonitrile removal at the same optimum operating conditions acrylonitrile removal efficiency was significantly inhibited about 45 59 treated with tba concentrations 25 50 mm the inhibition rate constant values for acrylonitrile degradation were obtained 12 8 10 03 6 2 10 03 5 7 10 03 and 4 7 10 03 min 1 for without scavenger 25 mm 30 mm and 50 mm concentrations respectively as shown in fig 6b the inhibition rate of acrylonitrile degradation decreased with increase in hydroxyl radical scavenger concentration therefore it is concluded that in situ generated hydroxyl radicals played major role in catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile 3 7 kinetic study the acrylonitrile degradation kinetics was studied by employing the excess amount of h2o2 for completely oxidize the acrylonitrile during catalytic peroxidation process therefore dependence of h2o2 in catalytic peroxidation reaction kinetics was avoided 70 the kinetics of acrylonitrile degradation at various temperatures and concentrations can be expressed by a power law rate eq 9 as following 9 r dc dt k c p c w q where p and q are order of reaction for acrylonitrile concentration and catalyst dose c and cw are acrylonitrile concentration at time t and catalyst dose mg l k is rate constant since catalyst is not consumed in the catalytic peroxidation reaction power law model can be suitably represented by following eq 10 10 dc dt k c p various authors have been reported similar type of two step reaction kinetics as a pseudo first order kinetics in catalytic peroxidation reaction 22 70 87 the above eq 10 can be integrated for n 1 to yield eq 11 11 ln c o c t kt where k k c w q is first order rate constant which can be determined by slope of linear plot between ln co ct versus t it can be seen from fig 6c d degradation of acrylonitrile by catalytic peroxidation process displays two linear sections in the plots these bilinear plots indicate that acrylonitrile degradation occurs in two steps fast step and slow step in fast step acrylonitrile oxidized into intermediate compounds and other small compounds accordingly in slow step these intermediate compounds get further oxidized into carbon dioxide and water 67 70 the values of rate constants k1 and k2 for fast step and slow step at various temperatures 303 353 k and various concentrations 100 500 mg l for acrylonitrile degradation are given in table 6 it is clearly seen from fig 6c that values of rate constants k1 and k2 increased with increase in reaction temperature and the values of rate constant in fast step k1 is much higher than slow step k2 consequently the transition time for fast step to slow step reaction tends to decreased with increase in reaction temperature therefore peroxidation reaction shifted from kinetic controlled regime to diffusion controlled regime diffusion rate constant kdiffusion and surface reaction rate constant ksurface reaction both rate constants must account for controlling the reaction the overall reaction rate constant can be expressed as following eq 12 12 k overall k diffusion k surface reaction k diffusion k surface reaction at low temperature catalytic peroxidation reaction controlled by ksurface reaction kinetic constant 25 88 89 thus conversion of h2o2 into oh radicals on the active sites and reaction between acrylonitrile molecules and oh radical both controlled by ksurface reaction moreover catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile reaction accelerates at high temperature which is controlled by both rate constants kdiffusion and ksurface reaction the values of rate constant k1 and k2 were further utilized to determine the activation energy by arrhenius equation as depicted in fig 6e and table 6 the activation energy in fast step and slow step for catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile was obtained 34 48 kj mol and 17 93 kj mol respectively similar values of activation energy i e 41 29 29 40 and 19 10 kj mol were reported for pyrrole quinoline and pyridine degradation in aqueous solution 67 87 90 3 8 catalyst reusability study the reusability study of the catalyst was carried out to assess the economic viability of lcfe catalyst over four cycles under optimum operating conditions e g catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 44 reaction temperature 56 7 c acrylonitrile concentration 100 mg l and time 3 h in the first cycle maximum acrylonitrile degradation was observed about 90 11 the spent catalyst was separated from reaction solution by centrifugation separated catalyst was washed with 0 1 m nh4oh and dried at 100 c for 8 h 70 85 regenerated catalyst was further used in new batch of acrylonitrile aqueous solution at the same optimum operating conditions in the second third and fourth cycles acrylonitrile removal efficiency gradually dropped from 90 11 to 80 38 73 42 and 69 92 respectively the catalytic activity decreased after each cycle might be caused of some possible reasons 1 leaching of active sites fe in catalyst 43 2 intermediate formed during the acrylonitrile degradation adsorbed on the catalyst surface and occupied the active sites on the catalyst surface 91 fe leaching was measured after each cycle of experiment by icp ms as shown in fig 7 a fe leaching was gradually decreased after each cycle and observed 0 96 mg l 0 62 mg l 0 38 mg l and 0 27 mg l after first second third and fourth cycles respectively which is below the range of discharge permissible limits of wastewater in india 92 the chemical stability of lcfe catalyst was further analyzed at optimum operating conditions in term of fe leaching at various phs as shown in fig 7b the leaching of fe gradually decreased i e 2 11 1 16 0 96 and 0 76 mg l with increase in ph i e 2 4 5 4 and 9 and significantly rises in acrylonitrile removal efficiency i e 45 41 64 19 90 11 and 65 86 the fe leaching was obtained 0 63 0 35 0 29 and 0 23 for ph 2 4 5 4 and 9 respectively in strong acidic medium ph 2 highest fe leaching was observed due to that acrylonitrile removal efficiency 45 41 was decreased authors qin et al reported the fe leaching 1 65 1 36 1 18 0 88 and 0 75 for phs 2 1 3 8 5 8 8 1 and 10 2 respectively during the degradation of benzoic acid by catalytic wet peroxide oxidation catalysis with fe can 77 and similar behavior have been also reported by various authors 43 93 therefore it is concluded that to achieving long term stability of the catalyst reaction should be performed at neutral and alkaline ph 77 moreover ph of the solution plays crucial role to prevent loss of active sites from catalyst surface metal leaching is the major disadvantage of heterogeneous catalyst which reduce the active sites of the catalyst but perovskite like catalyst is very stable catalyst that does not lose the catalytic activity after many cycles 32 authors taran and co worker reported that lafeo3 perovskite like catalyst does not lose their catalytic activity after forty cycles for the removal of phenol 21 and sulfamethoxazole was treated by lafeo3 perovskite like catalyst their activity was not much affected after ten cycles 35 therefore it is concluded that lcfe perovskite like catalyst is very stable catalyst for the degradation of acrylonitrile 3 9 acrylonitrile mineralization mechanism catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile with synthesized lcfe catalyst can be ascribed to heterogeneous fenton like process the reactive oxygen species oh o2 ho2 are produced through catalytic decomposition of h2o2 which are responsible for the degradation of any organic compounds 22 94 the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism has been suggested to proceed via decomposition of h2o2 chemisorbed on the active sites fe 3 of lcfe catalyst surface and to formed the complex as shown in eq 13 the formed complex was subsequently converted in to fe 2 and produced the ho2 radicals in eq 14 94 95 these hydroperoxyl radical ho2 radicals are very unstable having the oxidation potential significantly lower than that of hydroxyl radical oh converted into superoxide radicals o2 via eq 15 the active site fe 3 further react with o2 ho2 and produced fe 2 with molecular oxygen via eq 16 fe 2 oxidized to fe 3 via transfer of one electron and generate oh radicals in eq 17 which is known as fenton reaction 94 moreover fe 3 fe 2 cycles frequently accelerated and more reactive oxygen species were generated according to haber wiese mechanism 96 13 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h 2 o 2 14 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h o 2 h 15 h o 2 o 2

pathway of acrylonitrile degradation was proposed based on the intermediates identified by gc ms analysis as shown in supporting document figure s2 and available literature study 14 various intermediate compounds i e propanamide acrylic acid propionic acid d alanine acetic acid acetamide dimethylamine were identified four possible routes of acrylonitrile degradation were proposed based on intermediates identified and literature study as shown in fig 7c in first path oh radicals attacked on acrylonitrile molecules which converted into propanamide propanamide further convert into acrylic acid and acetic until mineralized to co2 and h2o 97 in the second and third possible routes major intermediates dimethylamine and alanine formed and further degraded into propionic acid via deamination propionic acid is further degraded into acetic acid until mineralized to co2 and h2o in the last possible route acrylonitrile reacts with oh radical which convert into intermediate acetamide acetamide further degraded into acetic acid by deamination and mineralized into co2 and h2o 3 10 cost evaluation of treatment process evaluation of treatment cost is an important aspect for implementation of any innovative technologies the operating cost of acrylonitrile treatment by catalytic peroxidation process was evaluated at optimum operating condition the operating cost of treatment process comprises to chemical reagent cost and energy consumption cost for catalytic peroxidation process as shown in table 7 the operating cost of acrylonitrile treatment by catalytic peroxidation process was estimated to be 61 14 m3 wastewater this operating cost can be decrease in large scale operation the operating cost for treatment of pyridine by catalytic wet peroxidation process was found to be 99 62 m3 using nfeº gac catalyst 87 and 248 m3 catalysis with ceria supported sba 15 98 similarly for treatment of 2 propanol by ozonation and fenton oxidation process operating cost was estimated to be 145 m3 and 94 m3 respectively 99 thus catalytic peroxidation process is relatively cheaper than other processes viz ozonation and fenton oxidation process for removal of pollutant from wastewater 4 conclusions this study shows la0 5ce0 5mo3 m fe cu and co perovskite like catalyst synthesized by sol gel method exhibited high catalytic activity and stability for the degradation of acrylonitrile by catalytic peroxidation process the maximum acrylonitrile removal for various concentrations 100 200 300 and 500 mg l was 90 11 77 56 71 62 and 60 37 respectively at optimum operating conditions i e lcfe catalyst dose 660 mg l h2o2 acrylonitrile molar ratio 1 54 ph 5 4 reaction temperature 56 7 c and reaction time 3 h the kinetic data of acrylonitrile degradation by catalytic peroxidation process at various temperatures and concentrations were well represented by first order and two step degradation kinetic model in situ generated reactive oxidant species ros studies were performed to justify the acrylonitrile degradation mechanism and concluded that in situ generated hydroxyl radical play major role in catalytic peroxidation of acrylonitrile catalyst reusability studies demonstrate that la0 5ce0 5feo3 perovskite like catalyst loose minor catalytic activity and maintained the satisfactory performance in the fourth cycles
