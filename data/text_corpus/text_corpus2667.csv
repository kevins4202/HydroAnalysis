13335,many emerging organic pollutants exist as cationic residues at environmentally relevant ph this indicates a need to develop economically viable and robust methods to remove such residues from environmental waters in this paper we report using polymer inclusion membranes pims containing anacardic acid aa sourced from cashew nut shells as an acidic carrier for the extraction and transport of 4 amino 2 chloropyridine acp paraquat and diquat as representative target solutes of organic pesticide residues in aqueous solutions amounts of cellulose triacetate cta as polymer 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe as plasticiser aa as carrier and 1 dodecanol as modifier were used to prepare membranes an optimal composition of 30 wt cta 40 wt npoe 10 wt aa and 20 wt dodecanol produced an initial flux of 364 16 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 for transport of acp the extraction performance of aa was comparable to bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid a widely used acidic carrier in pims of similar composition pims utilizing aa were also successfully applied to a sample of environmental water for the competitive recovery of acp paraquat and diquat each at 500 μg l using chemicals from plants as active reagents was shown to be an effective strategy to enhance the green chemistry credentials associated with methods for water remediation keywords anacardic acid cashew nut shell liquid organic pesticides facilitated transport polymer inclusion membrane green chemistry 1 introduction cationic organic contaminants from anthropogenic sources and agricultural and industrial activities are being released into the environment at increased amounts consequently there is a growing concern regarding increased chemical contamination of surface and ground waters by these and similar compounds and a heightened interest in developing efficient remediation strategies chemical degradation and biodegradation have been widely used to remove organic pesticides however other chemicals with undesirable environmental effects such as higher toxicity than parent compounds are often produced 1 for example a highly persistent compound 4 amino 2 chloropyridine acp results from decomposition of forchlorfenuron 1 2 chloro 4 pyridyl 3 phenylurea a commonly used plant growth regulator 2 3 thus the development of cost effective methods to remove organic contaminants from environmental waters is essential the adsorption of particular compounds such as cationic dyes on various materials is recognised as an effective method to remove contaminants at low concentrations 4 5 a variety of organic compounds can be targeted using pims that offer undeniable advantages such as reduced operating costs versatility and ease of fabrication compared to other liquid membranes 6 the use of pims to target cationic dyes 7 and chlorinated pesticides 8 is known this indicates the potential of using pims to target cationic pesticide residues typically pims contain a liquid phase of carrier and plasticiser and in some cases a modifier the liquid components are normally entrapped by chemical interactions and entanglement within a polymer matrix a configuration that also imposes a diffusive resistance to solutes a plasticiser improves the diffusion of solutes by the formation of liquid micro channels in the membrane however these micro channels can also be a route for leakage of carrier an effect that decreases membrane performance 9 11 consequently the suitability of pims for environmental remediation applications could be limited because of concerns about the toxic nature of some carriers thus it would be beneficial to source alternative carriers that are less harmful to the environment using renewable feedstocks and safer chemicals are important principles for the development of green extraction chemistry 12 thus using plant based compounds as active components in separation processes is a worthwhile strategy cashew nut shell liquid cnsl can be used as a source of raw materials to produce a range of chemicals an approach that does not create a burden on the supply of edible oils because cnsl is a renewable by product from the processing of cashews using compounds from cnsl is an appealing prospect because of the associated low manufacturing cost abundant availability and diverse chemical nature of the components 13 14 in this paper the development of pims containing anacardic acid aa from cnsl as an eco friendly and cost effective acidic carrier is described specifically the application of pims for the transport of representative test solutes of organic cationic residues of pesticides in aqueous solutions and environmental waters is reported 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents cellulose triacetate cta 2 nitrophenyl octyl ether npoe 99 0 1

australia analytical grade reagents and solvents were used as received unless indicated otherwise deionised water 18 2 mω cm was used to prepare solutions 2 2 synthesis of anacardic acid aa anacardic acid was extracted and isolated as a mixture of saturated and unsaturated compounds shown in fig 1 from cnsl using established procedures 15 the resulting mixture was hydrogenated and an off white powder was isolated from workup of the subsequent solution the powder was identified as 2 hydroxy 6 pentadecyl benzoic acid anacardic acid 1a by analysis using 1h nmr fig s2 16 2 3 pim preparation a casting method similar to that previously reported 8 was used to prepare pims from cta polymer npoe plasticiser aa carrier and dodecanol modifier briefly the membrane components totalling 300 mg were added to dichloromethane 20 ml and the mixture vigorously stirred to give a clear solution the solution was concentrated to approximately 10 ml added to a glass petri dish 90 mm and the dichloromethane allowed to slowly evaporate over 24 h at room temperature after which the membrane was removed and dried to constant mass the central portion was used to yield a membrane of 53 mm diameter uniform thickness 28 2 μm and mass 50 3 mg a fresh membrane was used for all experiments other than stability experiments weight percentages wt are used to express membrane compositions 2 4 transport studies a permeation cell containing two compartments of equal volume 100 ml was used for transport experiments 8 a membrane 34 mm was used to separate a feed solution containing acp or mixture of acp paraquat and diquat and a receiving solution of 100 mm phosphate buffer solution ph 2 the solutions were maintained at 25 1 c and stirred at 300 rpm solute concentration profiles in each cell compartment were developed by sampling 250 μl of each solution at regular times a constant volume was maintained during the experiments by replacing sample volumes with initial feed and receiving solutions a plot of the integrated rate equation eq 1 was used to confirm the transport of solute followed first order kinetics 1 ln c x c 0 k t where k c0 and cx are the rate constant s 1 and solute concentration in the feed solution at initial t 0 and given time t x respectively membrane permeability p m s 1 and initial flux j i mol m 2 s 1 were determined using eq 2 eq 3 respectively

the final cf and initial c0 concentrations of analyte in the receiving and feed solutions respectively using eq 4 4 te c f c 0 100 2 5 sample analysis a cary 300 uv vis bio spectrophotometer was used to quantify acp at 245 nm in non competitive experiments samples 250 μl from each solution were diluted with ph 7 phosphate buffer solution to 5 ml amounts of acp diquat and paraquat fig 2 in competitive experiments were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a known method 17 briefly a shimadzu lc 20at equipped with an apollo c18 column 5 μm 150 4 6 mm and a dual wavelength uv detector 265 310 nm was used isocratic elution with a mobile phase of 50 50 vol methanol phosphate buffer solution ph 2 at 0 6 ml min was used to analyse 20 μl of sample 2 6 pre concentration of acp paraquat and diquat from natural water pre concentration of analytes from a natural water sample was performed using a method previously described 8 briefly an environmental water sample spiked with a mixture of acp paraquat and diquat each at 500 μg l as a feed solution 250 ml was separated by a pim from a receiving solution 10 ml of 100 mm ph 2 phosphate buffer the hplc method previously described in section 2 5 was used to measure the concentration of acp paraquat and diquat 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport mechanism in this work we used acp as a representative model test solute for residues of some cationic organic agricultural chemicals transport of acp using aa as carrier occurs by a facilitated counter coupled mechanism involving coulombic attraction of the positively charged amine of acp with the negatively charged carrier this occurs at the feed membrane interface to form an aa acp ion pair complex as shown in fig 3 subsequently the complex partitions to the membrane and diffuses to the membrane receiving interface where it dissociates to release acp via a cation exchange process facilitated transport of acp rather than passive diffusion from a solution of high to low concentration is achieved by a proton gradient across the membrane using a feed solution at ph 7 and receiving solution at ph 2 and the preference for aa to exist as a neutral species in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane 3 2 preliminary investigations 3 2 1 influence of ph on acp speciation the distribution of acp pka 9 species present at ph 2 5 and 7 in aqueous solution was examined by uv vis spectrometry and the absorbance profiles associated with the different chemical species are shown in fig s1 the absorption maxima observed at 245 and 264 nm are associated with the monocation and dication respectively of acp 18 at ph 7 an aqueous solution contains predominantly monocation species due to protonation of the endocyclic nitrogen however as the ph is lowered the amount of monocations decrease and more dications are present as indicated by the increase in absorbance at 264 nm at ph 2 the dication is the principle acp species in solution the dication involves concurrent protonation of the exocyclic nitrogen that occurs in strongly acidic solution due to resonance stabilisation 18 20 the findings from the current experiments indicate acp exists as positively charged species over ph 2 7 thus this ph range was examined in subsequent experiments 3 2 2 pim composition optimisation the findings from preliminary investigations table a1 indicate membranes prepared from cta npoe and containing 5 wt aa were transparent and homogeneous however an insoluble white residue was obvious for membranes containing more than 5 wt aa indicating aa is only sparingly soluble in npoe tests indicated good solubility of aa in dodecanol and consequently small amounts were added as a modifier to the pim formulation membranes prepared with 5 wt dodecanol proved useful for low amounts 5 10 wt of aa however 10 or 20 wt dodecanol was needed to dissolve larger amounts up to 20 wt aa to prepare useable membranes although dodecanol has some plasticising ability it is not as effective as npoe notably the complete replacement of npoe by dodecanol produced mechanically unstable membranes that were easily ruptured this is attributed to increased separation and less effective interaction of polymer chains due to the large combined amounts of carrier and modifier a minimum 30 wt of cta was needed for stable membranes to enable a wide range of carrier amounts to be tested membranes prepared with 30 wt cta and 20 wt dodecanol were used in subsequent experiments 3 2 3 carrier concentration the amount of carrier influences the loading of target solute through chemical interactions at the membrane feed interface the target solute acp has a positive charge and is attracted to the negatively charged carrier aa in the membrane to form a neutral acp aa ion pair complex which is readily solubilized in the membrane phase fig s3 the effect of amounts of carrier on the transport of acp was investigated with the findings fig 4 showing an optimum initial flux at 10 wt carrier the initial improvement in flux as the carrier is increased from 5 wt is attributed to enhanced formation of aa acp ion pair complex at the membrane interface relatedly the observed decrease in flux at higher amounts of carrier is a likely outcome of increased viscosity of the membrane phase the results indicate 10 wt aa as the optimal amount of carrier in these transport experiments thus an optimal membrane formulation of 30 wt cta 40 wt npoe 10 wt aa and 20 wt dodecanol was identified for subsequent experiments 3 3 influence of ph of feed and receiving solutions the distribution of charged species of acp and aa is a ph dependent process as previously described thus the initial ph of the feed and receiving solutions as likely important variables on the transport of acp was investigated the results in table 1 and fig s4 show no facilitated transport occurred for a feed solution at ph 2 in which aa pka 5 8 predominantly exists in a neutral form thus at ph 2 aa cannot function as an acidic carrier even if the target solute is present in the protonated form significant transport with a similar transport efficiency of 98 after 24 h was observed at ph 5 7 of the feed solution however the flux was significantly better three times greater at ph 7 which is at least one unit greater than the pka of aa the better flux is associated with increased amounts of deprotonated carrier resulting in more ready formation of aa acp complex at the feed membrane interface the loading capacity of the membrane increases at ph 7 this significantly improves the initial flux but not the total amount of solute eventually transported because a similar te at equilibrium conditions is observed for feed solutions at ph 5 7 the results table 1 and fig s5 show the best transport efficiency 98 occurred at a low ph 2 of the receiving solution transport efficiency of bipyridinium herbicides is also known to improve at low ph using bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid dehpa as acidic carrier in a bulk liquid membrane 17 a better transport efficiency due to low ph of the receiving solution indicates improved back extraction of acp this is associated with decreased stability of the aa acp ion pair and enhanced formation of charged amine and neutral carrier at the membrane interface the optimal condition of ph 2 is synergistic for both chemical species involved in the back extraction process being more than 2 units below the pka of aa as carrier and acp as target solute the transport efficiency of 79 at ph 5 indicates the ph difference across the membrane is still a significant process to drive transport and this is complemented by the preference for aa to exist as a neutral species in the membrane the absence of a proton gradient across receiving and feed solutions at ph 7 explains the moderate 50 transport efficiency whereby an equilibrium concentration of acp is established in both solutions similarly the trend of improved initial flux at lower receiving solution ph provides further evidence a ph gradient is essential for the transport process as has been demonstrated for other positively charged amines 21 the current investigation indicates a receiving solution of ph 2 and a feed solution of ph 7 as optimal conditions for transport efficiency and flux thus these conditions were used for subsequent investigations involving the transport of acp and related compounds 3 4 transport kinetics membranes containing aa as carrier were evaluated and compared to similar membranes prepared with dehpa a commonly used acidic carrier for the transport kinetics of acp dehpa pka 3 24 22 also exists as an anion in a similar manner to aa at the feed membrane interface the transient concentration profiles of acp in fig 5 show aa and dehpa produce similar transport performance this supports the inference both carriers are engaged in facilitated transport involving a similar cation exchange process similarly the comparable permeability reported in table 2 is another strong indicator both carriers are involved in the same type of transport mechanism the difference in observed permeability is partly due to the amount of deprotonated carrier available for the transport process the carriers have different pka and at ph 7 aa pka 5 8 does not completely exist as an anion whereas dehpa pka 3 24 exists primarily as a deprotonated species and is capable of functioning more effectively as an acidic carrier additionally the transport performance is also influenced by other factors such as viscosity of the liquid membrane phase and size of the ion pair complex which also affects the permeability of the ion pair the results demonstrate aa offers similar extraction and transport performance to dehpa a commonly used commercial acidic carrier 3 5 membrane reusability studies stability and reusability are important performance criteria if pims are to be used for routine applications the ability of a membrane to maintain performance during repeated use was investigated through five consecutive transport cycles of 24 h using fresh feed and receiving solutions for each cycle a constant initial flux was observed during the first 2 cycles as indicated in fig 6 thereafter the flux decreased by 7 2 during cycle 3 and then remained similar for the last 2 cycles the decrease in flux during the third transport cycle is associated with partitioning of dodecanol to the adjacent aqueous solutions 23 24 other membrane liquid components npoe and aa are less likely to leach into the feed and receiving solutions because they are more hydrophobic than dodecanol the observed small change in flux indicates the membranes are reasonably stable and suitable for practical applications involving some repeated use 3 6 competitive transport and pre concentration of acp paraquat and diquat 3 6 1 competitive transport the potential application of pims containing aa to remove and recover a mixture of herbicide residues and associated decomposition products from contaminated environmental waters was also explored the competitive transport of acp paraquat and diquat as target solutes from a mixture of equal concentrations was investigated using the optimum experimental conditions previously determined the pka of the solutes indicates each exists as a cation at ph 7 the results in table 3 and fig 7 demonstrate aa is an effective carrier that readily forms ion pair complexes with all the target compounds achieving similar permeability and transport efficiencies after 24 h the permeability increased in the order acp paraquat diquat which is consistent with the lipophilicity of each solute as indicated by log kow values additionally although the lipophilicity of a target solute is an important determinant for extraction from an aqueous solution the current findings also demonstrate other factors are equally as important for instance although paraquat and diquat have similar lipophilicity they display somewhat different permeability due to a difference in stability of the ion pair complexes resulting from steric hindrance the two pyridine rings in diquat are fixed by an ethylene bridge that imposes a rigid yet slightly twisted chemical structure whereas the rings in paraquat are joined by a single bond and more able to freely rotate yielding a more flexible chemical structure consequently paraquat can more readily adopt a structural configuration enabling the cationic pyridine nitrogen to closely approach the active anionic site of the carrier therefore we assert that despite some minor variations in performance indicators aa is a suitable acidic carrier for the competitive transport of these and likely other similar positively charged organic compounds 3 6 2 pre concentration experiments using optimal membranes for the pre concentration of target solutes at a low initial concentration 500 μg l from a sample of environmental water was investigated the results in table 4 and fig s6 demonstrate good recovery of paraquat and diquat after 24 h and high transport efficiencies of all solutes after 48 h the permanent cationic nature of paraquat and diquat benefits the effective formation of ion pairs with aa which contributes to the high transport efficiencies the lower transport efficiency for acp pka 9 is attributed to fewer available target cations in the natural water sample at ph 7 8 humic acidic substances can comprise a significant component of natural waters and possibly affect the performance of the membranes however no significant fouling effect on membrane performance was apparent during these experiments we attribute the lack of fouling from humus to the electrostatic repulsion between the carrier and humic substances because both are negatively charged at the ph of the experiments the results demonstrate aa performs as an effective acidic carrier to pre concentrate these cationic organic compounds from a complex sample of natural water 4 conclusion pims containing aa as an acidic carrier were prepared and successfully used for the transport of acp paraquat and diquat as representative cationic organic compounds from aqueous solutions membranes composed of 30 wt cta 40 wt npoe 10 wt aa and 20 wt dodecanol proved optimal producing an initial flux of 364 16 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 for the transport of acp the pim performance was comparable to similar membranes prepared with dehpa a widely used commercial acidic carrier optimal membranes successfully achieved competitive transport of acp paraquat and diquat from synthetic and natural water samples the potential of using aa as a green carrier derived from plants to replace commercial synthetic carriers such as dehpa was shown the green chemistry of pims is enhanced by using cta which is naturally sourced and modified rather than a synthetic polymer such as pvc as the base polymer however there is still a need for subsequent efforts to identify other plant based chemicals to replace commonly used plasticisers and modifiers to further enhance the green chemistry credentials of pims the subsequent widespread or large scale use of green carriers to replace current commercial carriers in separation processes could be beneficial from both an economic point of view by lowering chemical costs and a reduced risk of harm from toxic chemicals to the environment thus these preliminary results for the use of aa as an extractant are encouraging they highlight the need for more green chemistry studies to identify other plant derived chemicals to replace the use of synthetic commercial compounds for a variety of application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

casting method similar to that previously reported 8 was used to prepare pims from cta polymer npoe plasticiser aa carrier and dodecanol modifier briefly the membrane components totalling 300 mg were

competitive experiments were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc using a known method 17 briefly a shimadzu lc 20at equipped with an apollo c18 column 5 μm 150 4 6 mm and a dual wavelength uv detector 265 310 nm was used isocratic elution with a mobile phase of 50 50 vol methanol phosphate buffer solution ph 2 at 0 6 ml min was used to analyse 20 μl of sample 2 6 pre concentration of acp paraquat and diquat from natural water pre concentration of analytes from a natural water sample was performed using a method previously described 8 briefly an environmental water sample spiked with a mixture of acp paraquat and diquat each at 500 μg l as a feed solution 250 ml was separated by a pim from a receiving solution 10 ml of 100 mm ph 2 phosphate buffer the hplc method previously described in section 2 5 was used to measure the concentration of acp paraquat and diquat 3 results and discussion 3 1 transport mechanism in this work we used acp as a representative model test solute for residues of some cationic organic agricultural chemicals transport of acp using aa as carrier occurs by a facilitated counter coupled mechanism involving coulombic attraction of the positively charged amine of acp with the negatively charged carrier this occurs at the feed membrane interface to form an aa acp ion pair complex as shown in fig 3 subsequently the complex partitions to the membrane and diffuses to the membrane receiving interface where it dissociates to release acp via a cation exchange process facilitated transport of acp rather than passive diffusion from a solution of high to low concentration is achieved by a proton gradient across the membrane using a feed solution at ph 7 and receiving solution at ph 2 and the preference for aa to exist as a neutral species in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane 3 2 preliminary investigations 3 2 1 influence of ph on acp speciation the distribution of acp pka 9 species present at ph 2 5 and 7 in aqueous solution was examined by uv vis spectrometry and the absorbance profiles associated with the different chemical species are shown in fig s1 the absorption maxima observed at 245 and 264 nm are associated with the monocation and dication respectively of acp 18 at ph 7 an aqueous solution contains predominantly monocation species due to protonation of the endocyclic nitrogen however as the ph is lowered the amount of monocations decrease and more dications are present as indicated by the increase in absorbance at 264 nm at ph 2 the dication is the principle acp species in solution the dication involves concurrent protonation of the exocyclic nitrogen that occurs in strongly acidic solution due to resonance stabilisation 18 20 the findings from the current experiments indicate acp exists as positively charged species over ph 2 7 thus this ph range was examined in subsequent experiments 3 2 2 pim composition optimisation the findings from preliminary investigations table a1 indicate membranes prepared from cta npoe and containing 5 wt aa were transparent and homogeneous however an insoluble white residue was obvious for membranes containing more than 5 wt aa indicating aa is only sparingly soluble in npoe tests indicated good solubility of aa in dodecanol and consequently small amounts were added as a modifier to the pim formulation membranes prepared with 5 wt dodecanol proved useful for low amounts 5 10 wt of aa however 10 or 20 wt dodecanol was needed to dissolve larger amounts up to 20 wt aa to prepare useable membranes although dodecanol has some plasticising ability it is not as effective as npoe notably the complete replacement of npoe by dodecanol produced mechanically unstable membranes that were easily ruptured this is attributed to increased separation and less effective interaction of polymer chains due to the large combined amounts of carrier and modifier a minimum 30 wt of cta was needed for stable membranes to enable a wide range of carrier amounts to be tested membranes prepared with 30 wt cta and 20 wt dodecanol were used in subsequent experiments 3 2 3 carrier concentration the amount of carrier influences the loading of target solute through chemical interactions at the membrane feed interface the target solute acp has a positive charge and is attracted to the negatively charged carrier aa in the membrane to form a neutral acp aa ion pair complex which is readily solubilized in the membrane phase fig s3 the effect of amounts of carrier on the transport of acp was investigated with the findings fig 4 showing an optimum initial flux at 10 wt carrier the initial improvement in flux as the carrier is increased from 5 wt is attributed to enhanced formation of aa acp ion pair complex at the membrane interface relatedly the observed decrease in flux at higher amounts of carrier is a likely outcome of increased viscosity of the membrane phase the results indicate 10 wt aa as the optimal amount of carrier in these transport experiments thus an optimal membrane formulation of 30 wt cta 40 wt npoe 10 wt aa and 20 wt dodecanol was identified for subsequent experiments 3 3 influence of ph of feed and receiving solutions the distribution of charged species of acp and aa is a ph dependent process as previously described thus the initial ph of the feed and receiving solutions as likely important variables on the transport of acp was investigated the results in table 1 and fig s4 show no facilitated transport occurred for a feed solution at ph 2 in which aa pka 5 8 predominantly exists in a neutral form thus at ph 2 aa cannot function as an acidic carrier even if the target solute is present in the protonated form significant transport with a similar transport efficiency of 98 after 24 h was observed at ph 5 7 of the feed solution however the flux was significantly better three times greater at ph 7 which is at least one unit greater than the pka of aa the better flux is associated with increased amounts of deprotonated carrier resulting in more ready formation of aa acp complex at the feed membrane interface the loading capacity of the membrane increases at ph 7 this significantly improves the initial flux but not the total amount of solute eventually transported because a similar te at equilibrium conditions is observed for feed solutions at ph 5 7 the results table 1 and fig s5 show the best transport efficiency 98 occurred at a low ph 2 of the receiving solution transport efficiency of bipyridinium herbicides is also known to improve at low ph using bis 2 ethylhexyl phosphoric acid dehpa as acidic carrier in a bulk liquid membrane 17 a better transport efficiency due to low ph of the receiving solution indicates improved back extraction of acp this is associated with decreased stability of the aa acp ion pair and enhanced formation of charged amine and neutral carrier at the membrane interface the optimal condition of ph 2 is synergistic for both chemical species involved in the back extraction process being more than 2 units below the pka of aa as carrier and acp as target solute the transport efficiency of 79 at ph 5 indicates the ph difference across the membrane is still a significant process to drive transport and this is complemented by the preference for aa to exist as a neutral species in the membrane the absence of a proton gradient across receiving and feed solutions at ph 7 explains the moderate 50 transport efficiency whereby an equilibrium concentration of acp is established in both solutions similarly the trend of improved initial flux at lower receiving solution ph provides further evidence a ph gradient is essential for the transport process as has been demonstrated for other positively charged amines 21 the current investigation indicates a receiving solution of ph 2 and a feed solution of ph 7 as optimal conditions for transport efficiency and flux thus these conditions were used for subsequent investigations involving the transport of acp and related compounds 3 4 transport kinetics membranes containing aa as carrier were evaluated and compared to similar membranes prepared with dehpa a commonly used acidic carrier for the transport kinetics of acp dehpa pka 3 24 22 also exists as an anion in a similar manner to aa at the feed membrane interface the transient concentration profiles of acp in fig 5 show aa and dehpa produce similar transport performance this supports the inference both carriers are engaged in facilitated transport involving a similar cation exchange process similarly the comparable permeability reported in table 2 is another strong indicator both carriers are involved in the same type of transport mechanism the difference in observed permeability is partly due to the amount of deprotonated carrier available for the transport process the carriers have different pka and at ph 7 aa pka 5 8 does not completely exist as an anion whereas dehpa pka 3 24 exists primarily as a deprotonated species and is capable of functioning more effectively as an acidic carrier additionally the transport performance is also influenced by other factors such as viscosity of the liquid membrane phase and size of the ion pair complex which also affects the permeability of the ion pair the results demonstrate aa offers similar extraction and transport performance to dehpa a commonly used commercial acidic carrier 3 5 membrane reusability studies stability and reusability are important performance criteria if pims are to be used for routine applications the ability of a membrane to maintain performance during repeated use was investigated through five consecutive transport cycles of 24 h using fresh feed and receiving solutions for each cycle a constant initial flux was observed during the first 2 cycles as indicated in fig 6 thereafter the flux decreased by 7 2 during cycle 3 and then remained similar for the last 2 cycles the decrease in flux during the third transport cycle is associated with partitioning of dodecanol to the adjacent aqueous solutions 23 24 other membrane liquid components npoe and aa are less likely to leach into the feed and receiving solutions because they are more hydrophobic than dodecanol the observed small change in flux indicates the membranes are reasonably stable and suitable for practical applications involving some repeated use 3 6 competitive transport and pre concentration of acp paraquat and diquat 3 6 1 competitive transport the potential application of pims containing aa to remove and recover a mixture of herbicide residues and associated decomposition products from contaminated environmental waters was also explored the competitive transport of acp paraquat and diquat as target solutes from a mixture of equal concentrations was investigated using the optimum experimental conditions previously determined the pka of the solutes indicates each exists as a cation at ph 7 the results in table 3 and fig 7 demonstrate aa is an effective carrier that readily forms ion pair complexes with all the target compounds achieving similar permeability and transport efficiencies after 24 h the permeability increased in the order acp paraquat diquat which is consistent with the lipophilicity of each solute as indicated by log kow values additionally although the lipophilicity of a target solute is an important determinant for extraction from an aqueous solution the current findings also demonstrate other factors are equally as important for instance although paraquat and diquat have similar lipophilicity they display somewhat different permeability due to a difference in stability of the ion pair complexes resulting from steric hindrance the two pyridine rings in diquat are fixed by an ethylene bridge that imposes a rigid yet slightly twisted chemical structure whereas the rings in paraquat are joined by a single bond and more able to freely rotate yielding a more flexible chemical structure consequently paraquat can more readily adopt a structural configuration enabling the cationic pyridine nitrogen to closely approach the active anionic site of the carrier therefore we assert that despite some minor variations in performance indicators aa is a suitable acidic carrier for the competitive transport of these and likely other similar positively charged organic compounds 3 6 2 pre concentration experiments using optimal membranes for the pre concentration of target solutes at a low initial concentration 500 μg l from a sample of environmental water was investigated the results in table 4 and fig s6 demonstrate good recovery of paraquat and diquat after 24 h and high transport efficiencies of all solutes after 48 h the permanent cationic nature of paraquat and diquat benefits the effective formation of ion pairs with aa which contributes to the high transport efficiencies the lower transport efficiency for acp pka 9 is attributed to fewer available target cations in the natural water sample at ph 7 8 humic acidic substances can comprise a significant component of natural waters and possibly affect the performance of the membranes however no significant fouling effect on membrane performance was apparent during these experiments we attribute the lack of fouling from humus to the electrostatic repulsion between the carrier and humic substances because both are negatively charged at the ph of the experiments the results demonstrate aa performs as an effective acidic carrier to pre concentrate these cationic organic compounds from a complex sample of natural water 4 conclusion pims containing aa as an acidic carrier were prepared and successfully used for the transport of acp paraquat and diquat as representative cationic organic compounds from aqueous solutions membranes composed of 30 wt cta 40 wt npoe 10 wt aa and 20 wt dodecanol proved optimal producing an initial flux of 364 16 10 8 mol m 2 s 1 for the transport of acp the pim performance was comparable to similar membranes prepared with dehpa a widely used commercial acidic carrier optimal membranes successfully achieved competitive transport of acp paraquat and diquat from synthetic and natural water samples the potential of using aa as a green carrier derived from plants to replace commercial synthetic carriers such as dehpa was shown the green chemistry of pims is enhanced by using cta which is naturally sourced and modified rather than a synthetic polymer such as pvc as the base polymer however there is still a need for subsequent efforts to identify other plant based chemicals to replace commonly used plasticisers and modifiers to further enhance the green chemistry credentials of pims the subsequent widespread or large scale use of green carriers to replace current commercial carriers in separation processes could be beneficial from both an economic point of view by lowering chemical costs and a reduced risk of harm from toxic chemicals to the environment thus these preliminary results for the use of aa as an extractant are encouraging they highlight the need for more green chemistry studies to identify other plant derived chemicals to replace the use of synthetic commercial compounds for a variety of application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

13336,membrane filtration processes like microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are proven to be effective in industrial wastewater treatment including oil water separation as they generate suitable quality permeate for water reuse applications various research efforts have been conducted in areas of developing and or modifying commercial mf uf membrane materials through synthesizing new advanced polymers that promise improvement in oil water separation performance although multiple mf uf testing procedures were developed there is still a gap in literature on having a comprehensive protocol that assesses the performance of the membranes in terms of flux rejection fouling and cleanability this paper delivers a robust bench scale testing procedure incorporating experiences and lessons learned from literature the evaluation procedure includes three main testing steps initial characterization operating performance and cleaning and recovery the protocol was designed to mimic industrial conditions by using a representative synthetic produced water solution and operating multiple consecutives cycles of oil water filtration followed by membrane chemical cleaning the procedure was initially validated on multiple commercial mf uf membranes having different pore sizes mwcos and chemistries obtained from various manufacturers and then applied to evaluate emerging membrane materials the protocol was found to be reliable in evaluating the performance trends of various commercial membranes and effective in comparing the performance of emerging membranes the developed procedure is proposed to be applied by researchers to assess the performance of new membrane materials as compared to relevant commercial products graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration microfiltration oil water separation membrane filtration experimental protocol 1 introduction large volumes of oily wastewater are produced in various industrial processes such as oil and gas refinery petrochemical facilities textiles leather manufacturing and food processing 1 5 for oil and gas industry treatment of such oily wastewaters typically involves applying conventional oil removal technologies such as gravity separation flotation coagulation and centrifugation which are used to remove free and dispersed oil 6 8 however there have been recent drivers towards applying advanced treatment as the industry encounters new operational challenges related to strict environmental oil in water discharge limits and restrictions on deep well injection as these water reuse facilitating drivers are being recognized by the industry many oil and gas companies have started to investigate opportunities for applying fit for purpose treatment on by product waters that are now considered a valuable resource instead of a possible liability membrane processes such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are known to be one of the best available advanced treatment technologies that can generate suitable quality effluent for water reuse applications these polymeric membranes offer lower energy consumption high organics removal and compact systems with full automation the main shortcoming is fouling due to adsorption of oil droplets onto the surface and internal pores which limits their performance and reduces their respective lifespan 8 9 polymeric flat hollow fiber mf uf membranes used for the treatment of oily wastewater acquire different chemistries such as polyvinyl acetate polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf polysulfone polyether sulfone pes cellulose acetate etc 10 various commercial polymeric mf and uf membranes tested on oily wastewater have shown high performances in terms of oil removal fouling propensity and cleanability for instance a tubular mf pan membrane showed an oil removal efficiency of 99 7 and the membrane flux was restored by cleaning with citric acid and caustic anionic detergent 11 another hydrophilic uf pan membrane at 20 kda was investigated in bench scale for the treatment of a refinery oily wastewater the membrane showed removals of 99 for oil and grease o g total suspended solids tss and turbidity 12 commercial uf membranes are typically prepared by phase inversion method in which the liquid polymer solution is converted to a solid state the process involves mixing polymers solvents non solvents and even additives to form a solution that is casted on a surface for evaporation the casted film is then immersed in a coagulation bath which leads to the separation of the solid membrane film 13 the composition of the casting solution the incorporation of additives and the alteration in the casting temperature thickness and evaporation time are examples of parameters that can be optimized to enhance the membrane s characteristic properties and performance 14 the pore characteristics and skin layer morphology are improved in the casting step to obtain required molecular weight cut off mwco the mwco term was derived from the rejection of macromolecules described by their molecular weights arbitrarily the mwco can be defined as the rejection of 90 of a known molecular weight organic solute 15 16 hence uf membranes do not possess an absolute pore size and the fabrication of such membranes has been an elusive target for many years to date there is not a standard method followed by membrane manufacturers for characterizing the mwco yet membrane manufacturers often use dextran polyethylene glycol peg and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as solutes for determining the membrane mwco 16 17 on the other hand numerous research efforts have been conducted towards modifying commercial products or developing novel alternatives that potentially show a step change in performance improvement of commercial products involves surface modification via addition of nanoparticles namely alumina bentonite silica titanium oxide and zinc oxide to increase the hydrophilicity and antifouling behavior of the membrane 18 23 most recently fabrication of flat sheet uf membranes consisting of self assembled block copolymer bcp films has gained wide popularity since they possess enhanced water fluxes 17 18 24 30 with all emerging mf uf membranes specifically flat sheet type being developed there is a pressing need for having a representative bench scale testing protocol for evaluating and comparing the performance of newly developed membranes against commercial products after extensively reviewing various bench scale testing procedures applied in literature 17 20 25 26 29 31 37 it was observed that these published testing protocols were developed targeting the evaluation of a specific performance parameter this has created a gap in terms of having one comprehensive testing procedure addressing all basic membrane performance parameters like permeability rejection fouling tendency and recyclability another key aspect of the testing protocol is the feed solution since access to actual industrial oily wastewaters e g produced water pw is restricted due to the associated health safety and environmental hse challenges the use of synthetic recipes in performance screening tests has become more applicable 38 44 2 objective based on the above research experience and lessons learned from literature were considered to develop a robust bench scale testing procedure that assesses the performance of flat sheet mf uf membranes for industrial applications in terms of water permeability organics rejection fouling tendency and cleanability the developed procedure was initially validated on several commercial membranes via examining the effect of variating pore size mwco manufacturer and chemistry on the oil water separation performance the protocol was then applied on selected emerging membranes for performance comparison to commercial products 3 materials methods 3 1 chemicals deionized water di resistivity of 18 mω cm

reagent sodium hydroxide pellets naoh acquired from thermo fischer scientific 3 2 synthetic pw solution preparation oil water separation tests were carried out using a representative synthetic pw solution prepared following the protocol published by 45 the recipe involves using a low salinity brine total dissolved solids tds 3800 mg l mimicking the salinity of a gas field pw 46 a medium grade neat crude oil and an emulsifier sds to disperse the oil into the brine in a ratio of 5 1 oil to surfactant since mf uf membrane treatment is typically applied for tertiary industrial wastewater treatment a solution having a total organic carbon toc concentration in the range of 25 30 mg l was prepared initially 500 ml of low salinity brine was prepared using di water and salt concentrations specified in table 1 then 5 mg of sds were added to the brine with 0 03 ml of crude oil the solution was then magnetically stirred at 1000 rpm for 0 5 h and sonicated for another 0 5 h finally the solution was transferred to a glass separatory funnel to settle for 1 2 h after separating the free oil layer the final solution was stored in a glass bottle and used immediately in the oil water separation tests a summary of the analytical results for the synthetic pw solution are presented in table 2 fig 1 presents the particle size distribution of the final solution showing a mean droplet size of 4 6 μm which is within the typical size range of oil water emulsions at 20 μm 47 3 3 analytical characterization methods 3 3 1 analytical equipment table 3 3 3 2 thickness porosity and mean pore radius the porosity ε of the membrane was measured following a protocol published by 48 the gravimetric method determines the porosity of a membrane based on the difference between the wet and dry weights w1 and w2 of a known membrane area a and thickness l as indicated in eq 1 1 ε w 2 w 1 a l d w where dw is the water density of 0 998 g cm3 to measure porosity initially a piece of known membrane area was soaked for 24 h in di water then the sample was weighed immediately after cautiously cleaning excess water on the membrane surface after that the membrane sample was dried in the oven for 2 h at a temperature of 60 c and then weighed again the thickness of the membrane was measured directly using a pocket thickness gauge 0 0 001 micrometer the mean pore radius rm was then calculated using eq 2 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 ηl j w a ε δ p where η is the viscosity of water at 8 9 10 4 pa s jw is the membrane water flux in m3 s and δp is the applied operating pressure in pa analyses were carried out on triplicate membrane samples to ensure results repeatability 3 4 mf uf bench scale setup the bench scale unit was built after reviewing published mf uf testing setups 14 24 25 27 as shown in figs 2 and 3 the setup is based on an amicon uf stirred cell amicon millipore usa having a capacity of 50 ml membrane diameter of 44 5 mm and an actual filtration area of 13 5 cm2 the cell is used for testing flat sheet membranes at different pressures ranging from 1 to 5 bar those pressures were provided using a nitrogen cylinder connected to a 1 gallon feed reservoir 316ss pressure vessel sterlitech usa with appropriate safety features pressure regulator and relief valve a pressure transducer px309 omega engineering usa was mounted at the inlet of the amicon uf stirred cell i e feed reservoir outlet to accurately measure and record the applied pressure the amicon uf stirred cell was positioned on top of a magnetic stirring plate sterlitech usa to maintain the homogeneity of the feed wastewater filtered water i e permeate was collected in a 1 l glass beaker that was placed on a digital balance mettler toledo switzerland to measure the weight of the collected water both pressure and permeate weight were acquired every 250 ms by a labview acquisition system crio 9035 national instruments usa the system was setup to constantly collect and store the data as well as to monitor the membrane water flux that is plotted by the software and displayed on a screen 3 5 commercial mf uf membranes several commercially available mf uf membranes from various manufactures with different chemistries and mwcos were screened and some were selected for testing using the developed experimental protocol as shown in table 4 3 6 mf uf experimental protocol after thoroughly reviewing published mf uf bench testing experiences and not coming across a comprehensive procedure a testing protocol was developed addressing membrane permeability rejection fouling and cleanability which consists of three key steps 3 6 1 initial characterization the membrane sheet was initially soaked in di water for at least 24 h to ensure that any shipping or storage preservatives have been washed out properly after that the membrane was cut and placed into the amicon uf stirred cell used for testing diameter 44 5 cm the membrane was then tested using di water at a pressure of 3 bar and stirring speed of 560 rpm until reaching a stable water flux measurement similar operating conditions were also applied for all following baseline tests flux obtained from this test is referred to as the clean membrane flux which was utilized as the benchmark for flux comparison against the fouled membrane 3 6 2 operating performance fouling tests were performed using a low salinity synthetic pw solution as noted in section 3 2 targeting 50 feed volume reduction 100 ml and 50 ml of the synthetic pw were transferred to the 1 gal feed reservoir and the amicon uf stirred cell respectively the membrane was then tested at a pressure of 3 bar and stirring speed of 560 rpm the flux generated from this test is described as the synthetic pw flux samples of feed and permeate were collected and analyzed for toc and o g to assess the organics rejection performance by the membrane 3 6 3 cleaning and recovery initially the fouled membrane flux was measured via performing a di water baseline on the fouled membrane after that two membrane chemical cleaning steps were implemented to recover the membrane s lost flux due to fouling for the first step 50 ml of a 1 mm naoh solution with ph of 11 5 at a temperature of 25 c was prepared and transferred to the amicon uf stirred cell for surface cleaning under magnetic stirring for 15 min at 560 rpm to measure the efficiency of naoh cleaning a di water baseline test was performed as noted in section 3 6 1 the second chemical cleaning step involves using 50 ml sds solution at a concentration of 10 mm a ph of 9 4 and a temperature of 35 c at similar testing conditions followed for naoh cleaning a final baseline test was conducted for measuring the final membrane flux chemical cleaning flux and determining the total flux loss due to fouling as indicated in eq 3 3 flux loss j o j f j o 100 where jo is the clean membrane flux and jf is the final membrane flux after chemical cleaning to mimic typical membrane filtration operating conditions after characterizing the clean membrane water flux step 3 6 1 three consecutive cycles of membrane fouling and cleaning were conducted as a robust approach for determining the membrane s oil water separation efficiency 4 results discussion 4 1 protocol validation on commercial mf uf membranes validation tests using the developed bench scale testing procedure were carried out on selected commercial mf and uf membranes as specified in table 4 the applicability of the testing protocol was evaluated for different membrane parameters including variation of membrane pore size mwco manufacturer and chemistry 4 1 1 variation of pore size mwco 4 1 1 1 mf membranes the impact of pore size was first studied on commercial mf membranes 0 2 and 8 0 μm pes membranes were obtained from m1 and tested using the developed protocol since higher water fluxes are expected from mf membranes in comparison to uf the operating pressure was adjusted and set at 0 5 bar such adjustment will prolong the testing period which ultimately will help in better characterizing the performance of the membrane fig 4 compares the oil water separation test results for both membranes specific water fluxes of 10 689 and 28 616 lmh bar were observed for the 0 2 and 8 0 μm pes membranes respectively in terms of organics rejection an average toc rejection of 87 was obtained for the 0 2 μm membrane against 67 for the 8 0 μm membrane as noted in table 5 the lower toc rejection obtained at a pore size of 8 0 μm is attributed to the synthetic pw solution that consists of oil water emulsions possessing a mean droplet size of 4 6 μm therefore the 8 0 μm membrane is not rejecting smaller oil particles which results in lower toc rejection similar interpretation applies also for the minimum flux loss obtained at this pore size against the 26 loss for the 0 2 μm pes membrane that is rejecting the smaller oil contaminants 4 1 1 2 uf membranes a oil water separation tests as uf membrane manufacturers use different methods for mwco characterization three commercial uf membranes with pes chemistry having different mwcos of 50 100 and 300 kda were acquired from manufacturer m2 and tested using the developed protocol as shown in fig 5 specific water fluxes of 21 41 and 59 lmh bar were obtained for the tested mwcos 50 100 300 kda respectively the variation in flux against mwco obtained using the protocol was validated with porosity measurements as presented in fig 6 both sets of data were found to show a strong linear correlation validating the applicability of the procedure in characterizing the pure water permeability of membranes having different mwcos in table 6 o g analyses performed on feed and permeate samples showed comparable rejection performances for all mwcos with 99 removal in terms of toc as expected lower removal performances were realized in comparison to o g at 88 for 100 k and 300 k against 92 for 50 k this is due to the physical breaking of the oil sds emulsions by the membrane that is mainly rejecting the oil and allowing the sds molecules to permeate inside the membrane pores thus contributing to the toc in the permeate as shown in table 6 pes 50 kda was selected as an example to graphically represent the oil emulsions breaking mechanism through the tested membranes as illustrated in fig 7 49 b modeling of fouling mechanisms the protocol was also utilized to compare the membranes fouling propensity in terms of total irreversible flux loss four classic fouling correlations 50 51 were curve fitted to the experimental data to identify the fouling mechanism occurring on the membrane as indicated in table 7 in the cake filtration mechanism the layers of contaminants deposit on the membrane surface whereas in complete blocking foulants will entirely block the pores of the membrane similarly in intermediate blocking the contaminants will block some of the pores on the membrane with some attaching to formerly deposited particles the last fouling mechanism is the standard blocking of the pores at which the size of the contaminant particles is smaller than the membrane pores causing them attach to the inner walls of the pores results presented in table 6 showed an increase in total flux loss to about 18 at a mwco of 100 kda against 8 obtained at 50 kda nevertheless at a higher mwco of 300 kda irreversible fouling behavior was detected to be minimum i e 0 flux loss the fouling behavior for those membranes was studied further through applying the classic fouling correlations table 8 compares the correlation coefficients r2 for the four fouling mechanisms at a mwco of 50 kda surface deposition cake filtration was found to have the highest r2 of 0 99 which showed the best agreement with experimental data as shown in fig 8 confirming that surface deposition was the main fouling mechanism for this membrane similar approach was applied for mwcos of 100 and 300 kda results showed that at a mwco of 100 kda intermediate blocking has generated the best fit at an r2 coefficient of 0 97 this justifies the experimentally obtained increase in total flux loss at this mwco in comparison with the 50 kda membrane since at intermediate fouling some of the foulants will deposit while others will block the surface pores of the membrane at a higher mwco 300 kda cake filtration was found to be the main fouling mechanism at an r2 of 0 97 and with the larger pore size on this membrane the applied surface cleaning will potentially be more efficient as it can reach through the larger pores and remove deposited or blocking contaminants from the membrane 4 1 2 variation of vendor as properties and performance of a membrane are both dependent on the synthesis method and thus its manufacturer hence the developed protocol was also applied for evaluating the effect of variating membrane vendor using three pan membranes obtained from m2 m3 and m4 with mwcos of 100 50 and 20 kda respectively table 9 summarizes the testing results in terms of flux fouling and rejection fluxes of 16 203 and 390 lmh bar were obtained for the tested pan membranes despite that pan sourced from m2 was characterized to have a mwco of 100 kda it showed lower flux in comparison to pan membranes sourced from m3 and m4 having mwcos of 50 and 20 kda sem images of the tested membranes are shown in fig 9 the figure compares the surface structure of the tested pan membranes confirming that pan m4 has larger pores in comparison to pan m2 pan m3 was also showing relatively larger pores against pan m2 but they were less in terms of quantity against pan m4 in addition the three membranes have shown different fouling performances for instance pan m2 and pan m4 revealed minimum fouling behaviors at total flux losses 10 whereas pan m3 showed a higher flux loss at 51 similarly both pan membranes from m2 and m4 showed similar rejection performances at a toc removal of 80 while pan from m3 showed a slightly higher toc rejection at 86 the above results prove the applicability of the testing protocol in assessing and comparing the performance of products sourced from different manufacturers 4 1 3 variation of chemistry three different membrane chemistries pes pan and pvdf having a mwco of 100 kda were sourced from the same manufacturer m2 to ensure having a common comparison basis for performance evaluation and were tested using the developed experimental procedure a water contact angle water contact angle analysis assessing the hydrophilicity of the three membrane chemistries was carried out as shown in table 10 membranes having pan and pes chemistries showed higher affinities towards water at contact angles between 50 and 56 on the other hand pvdf was found to be less hydrophilic at a measured water contact angle of 69 making it more susceptible to organic fouling obtained results were validated against published data and were all found to be equivalent 16 b oil water separation tests initially the reproducibility of the developed testing protocol in terms of showing repeatable performance results upon testing duplicate membrane coupons was validated duplicate membrane coupons for pan and pes were tested and the average specific water flux results are presented respectively in fig 10a and fig 10b test results were found to be reliably reproducible in terms of characterizing the membrane s pure water flux as well as the fouling behavior and organics rejection for both membrane chemistries as presented in table 11 fig 10 compares the performance of three different membrane polymers pan pes and pvdf specific water fluxes of 16 43 and 171 lmh bar were obtained for the tested membranes respectively although pes and pan were proven to be more hydrophilic both were showing lower membrane specific water fluxes against pvdf such performance was investigated through measurements of porosity and mean pore radius results were found to confirm such variation in flux between tested polymers with pvdf showing the highest porosity and mean pore size at 57 and 92 nm as presented in table 12 the three membrane polymers were capable of removing almost all the o g from the synthetic pw at percentages 99 however in terms of toc attributed to both oil and sds both pes and pvdf chemistries have shown better toc rejections against pan this was supported by permeate toc and o g data confirming the physical breakage of emulsions and the passage of sds through the membranes as presented in table 13 and illustrated in fig 7 c ftir analysis to compare the fouling behavior of the three tested chemistries ftir analysis was carried out to identify key functional groups present in the crude oil used to prepare the synthetic pw and both the clean and the fouled membrane samples fig 11 presents the ftir absorbance spectra for the crude oil against the fouled membranes after subtracting the absorbance of the clean membranes as shown in the figure peaks found at wavelengths of 2292 and 2852 cm 1 in the crude oil relate to single ch stretching vibrations 54 similar peaks were also found on the three fouled membrane chemistries ftir results were found to agree with the experimentally obtained fouling trends in terms of verifying that pan has the least fouling tendency against pes and pvdf 4 2 protocol application on emerging membranes based on the above validation study performed on commercial mf uf products we are in the process of applying and optimizing the protocol to a wide range of emerging membrane materials under development in order the effectively evaluate their performance for oil water separation below are two examples for the application of the testing procedure on innovative membrane materials currently being developed 4 2 1 initial characterization the first step of membrane testing as denoted in section 3 6 1 is the membrane initial characterization that is performed using di water this critical test is performed on a clean membrane sheet to determine its stable pure water permeability prior to fouling tests fig 12 compares the water flux results for two commercial membranes pan 100 k pes 100 k manufactured by m2 against an emerging membrane under development as expected both commercial membranes were consistently showing stable water flux measurements after only the first half hour of testing on the other hand one of our emerging uf membranes under development showed significant drop in flux up to 91 during the first 3 h before starting to stabilize during the last hour of testing such challenge related to the initial membrane characterization was identified as an area that needs further optimization by the emerging membrane developers 4 2 2 oil water separation test an experimental nanostructure enhanced mf membrane developed by our team was also tested using the deveploed protocol the membrane consists of a styrene isoprene styrene sis block copolymer mesoporous silica ms nanocomposite layered on a commercial 8 0 μm pes mf membrane sourced from m1 the specific water flux measured for the modified membrane was found to be lower at 18 600 lmh bar in comparison to the commercial mf membrane being initially at 28 600 lmh bar after testing it with the synthetic pw solution a following baseline test confirmed the fouling of the emerging membrane at a specific water flux of 7500 lmh bar as shown in fig 13 upon applying chemical cleaning it was found that only a small fraction of the flux was recovered i e 10 in cycle 1 similarly cycles 2 and 3 confirmed the membrane s fouling tendency with a consistent drop in the fouled membrane flux as well as the insignificant flux recovery after chemical cleaning translating to a total flux loss of 81 in terms of organics rejection the nanocomposite coating was able to enhance the rejection of the 8 0 μm pes commercial membrane from 67 up to an average of 81 as demonstrated in table 14 thus through applying the developed protocol it was verified that this membrane showed improved rejection performances but still requires improvement in terms of fouling propensity and cleanability optical images to qualitatively illustrate and compare the fouling behavior of the emerging membrane against the commercial mf product are presented in fig 14 the procedure will help optimize various innovative membrane materials currently under development by our team to identify the formulations that would demonstrate step change in performance in comparison to commercial products 5 conclusion the study presented a bench testing procedure developed for evaluating the performance of commercial and novel flat sheet mf uf membranes for oil water separation the protocol mimics industrial conditions by using a representative synthetic pw solution and applying multiple consecutive oil water separation with cleaning cycles several commercial mf uf membranes having different pore size mwco and chemistry were acquired from multiple manufacturers and evaluated using the protocol in terms of water permeability organics rejection fouling and cleanability selected observations from membrane performance evaluation which validated the protocol applicability include for mf membranes with larger pore sizes higher specific water flux and lower fouling tendency and organics rejection performance were achieved for mf membranes with smaller pore sizes lower specific water flux and higher fouling propensity were measured but with higher organics rejection for uf membranes with larger mwcos higher specific water fluxes were observed which were linearly correlated to increased membrane porosity the fouling rate of uf membranes with different mwcos was dependent on the fouling mechanism e g cake filtration vs intermediate blocking on the membrane surface for membranes manufactured with the same polymer variation in performance was found to be dependent on the difference of vendor membrane characterization which was further supported by sem analysis for different membrane polymers acquired from the same vendor pan showed the lowest fouling tendency while pvdf showed the highest fouling propensity which was also validated by ftir for different membrane polymers with the same mwco from the same vendor pan had the lowest organics rejection while pvdf had the highest

13336,membrane filtration processes like microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are proven to be effective in industrial wastewater treatment including oil water separation as they generate suitable quality permeate for water reuse applications various research efforts have been conducted in areas of developing and or modifying commercial mf uf membrane materials through synthesizing new advanced polymers that promise improvement in oil water separation performance although multiple mf uf testing procedures were developed there is still a gap in literature on having a comprehensive protocol that assesses the performance of the membranes in terms of flux rejection fouling and cleanability this paper delivers a robust bench scale testing procedure incorporating experiences and lessons learned from literature the evaluation procedure includes three main testing steps initial characterization operating performance and cleaning and recovery the protocol was designed to mimic industrial conditions by using a representative synthetic produced water solution and operating multiple consecutives cycles of oil water filtration followed by membrane chemical cleaning the procedure was initially validated on multiple commercial mf uf membranes having different pore sizes mwcos and chemistries obtained from various manufacturers and then applied to evaluate emerging membrane materials the protocol was found to be reliable in evaluating the performance trends of various commercial membranes and effective in comparing the performance of emerging membranes the developed procedure is proposed to be applied by researchers to assess the performance of new membrane materials as compared to relevant commercial products graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords ultrafiltration microfiltration oil water separation membrane filtration experimental protocol 1 introduction large volumes of oily wastewater are produced in various industrial processes such as oil and gas refinery petrochemical facilities textiles leather manufacturing and food processing 1 5 for oil and gas industry treatment of such oily wastewaters typically involves applying conventional oil removal technologies such as gravity separation flotation coagulation and centrifugation which are used to remove free and dispersed oil 6 8 however there have been recent drivers towards applying advanced treatment as the industry encounters new operational challenges related to strict environmental oil in water discharge limits and restrictions on deep well injection as these water reuse facilitating drivers are being recognized by the industry many oil and gas companies have started to investigate opportunities for applying fit for purpose treatment on by product waters that are now considered a valuable resource instead of a possible liability membrane processes such as microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are known to be one of the best available advanced treatment technologies that can generate suitable quality effluent for water reuse applications these polymeric membranes offer lower energy consumption high organics removal and compact systems with full automation the main shortcoming is fouling due to adsorption of oil droplets onto the surface and internal pores which limits their performance and reduces their respective lifespan 8 9 polymeric flat hollow fiber mf uf membranes used for the treatment of oily wastewater acquire different chemistries such as polyvinyl acetate polyacrylonitrile pan polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf polysulfone polyether sulfone pes cellulose acetate etc 10 various commercial polymeric mf and uf membranes tested on oily wastewater have shown high performances in terms of oil removal fouling propensity and cleanability for instance a tubular mf pan membrane showed an oil removal efficiency of 99 7 and the membrane flux was restored by cleaning with citric acid and caustic anionic detergent 11 another hydrophilic uf pan membrane at 20 kda was investigated in bench scale for the treatment of a refinery oily wastewater the membrane showed removals of 99 for oil and grease o g total suspended solids tss and turbidity 12 commercial uf membranes are typically prepared by phase inversion method in which the liquid polymer solution is converted to a solid state the process involves mixing polymers solvents non solvents and even additives to form a solution that is casted on a surface for evaporation the casted film is then immersed in a coagulation bath which leads to the separation of the solid membrane film 13 the composition of the casting solution the incorporation of additives and the alteration in the casting temperature thickness and evaporation time are examples of parameters that can be optimized to enhance the membrane s characteristic properties and performance 14 the pore characteristics and skin layer morphology are improved in the casting step to obtain required molecular weight cut off mwco the mwco term was derived from the rejection of macromolecules described by their molecular weights arbitrarily the mwco can be defined as the rejection of 90 of a known molecular weight organic solute 15 16 hence uf membranes do not possess an absolute pore size and the fabrication of such membranes has been an elusive target for many years to date there is not a standard method followed by membrane manufacturers for characterizing the mwco yet membrane manufacturers often use dextran polyethylene glycol peg and polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp as solutes for determining the membrane mwco 16 17 on the other hand numerous research efforts have been conducted towards modifying commercial products or developing novel alternatives that potentially show a step change in performance improvement of commercial products involves surface modification via addition of nanoparticles namely alumina bentonite silica titanium oxide and zinc oxide to increase the hydrophilicity and antifouling behavior of the membrane 18 23 most recently fabrication of flat sheet uf membranes consisting of self assembled block copolymer bcp films has gained wide popularity since they possess enhanced water fluxes 17 18 24 30 with all emerging mf uf membranes specifically flat sheet type being developed there is a pressing need for having a representative bench scale testing protocol for evaluating and comparing the performance of newly developed membranes against commercial products after extensively reviewing various bench scale testing procedures applied in literature 17 20 25 26 29 31 37 it was observed that these published testing protocols were developed targeting the evaluation of a specific performance parameter this has created a gap in terms of having one comprehensive testing procedure addressing all basic membrane performance parameters like permeability rejection fouling tendency and recyclability another key aspect of the testing protocol is the feed solution since access to actual industrial oily wastewaters e g produced water pw is restricted due to the associated health safety and environmental hse challenges the use of synthetic recipes in performance screening tests has become more applicable 38 44 2 objective based on the above research experience and lessons learned from literature were considered to develop a robust bench scale testing procedure that assesses the performance of flat sheet mf uf membranes for industrial applications in terms of water permeability organics rejection fouling tendency and cleanability the developed procedure was initially validated on several commercial membranes via examining the effect of variating pore size mwco manufacturer and chemistry on the oil water separation performance the protocol was then applied on selected emerging membranes for performance comparison to commercial products 3 materials methods 3 1 chemicals deionized water di resistivity of 18 mω cm

reagent sodium hydroxide pellets naoh acquired from thermo fischer scientific 3 2 synthetic pw solution preparation oil water separation tests were carried out using a representative synthetic pw solution prepared following the protocol published by 45 the recipe involves using a low salinity brine total dissolved solids tds 3800 mg l mimicking the salinity of a gas field pw 46 a medium grade neat crude oil and an emulsifier sds to disperse the oil into the brine in a ratio of 5 1 oil to surfactant since mf uf membrane treatment is typically applied for tertiary industrial wastewater treatment a solution having a total organic carbon toc concentration in the range of 25 30 mg l was prepared initially 500 ml of low salinity brine was prepared using di water and salt concentrations specified in table 1 then 5 mg of sds were added to the brine with 0 03 ml of crude oil the solution was then magnetically stirred at 1000 rpm for 0 5 h and sonicated for another 0 5 h finally the solution was transferred to a glass separatory funnel to settle for 1 2 h after separating the free oil layer the final solution was stored in a glass bottle and used immediately in the oil water separation tests a summary of the analytical results for the synthetic pw solution are presented in table 2 fig 1 presents the particle size distribution of the final solution showing a mean droplet size of 4 6 μm which is within the typical size range of oil water emulsions at 20 μm 47 3 3 analytical characterization methods 3 3 1 analytical equipment table 3 3 3 2 thickness porosity and mean pore radius the porosity ε of the membrane was measured following a protocol published by 48 the gravimetric method determines the porosity of a membrane based on the difference between the wet and dry weights w1 and w2 of a known membrane area a and thickness l as indicated in eq 1 1 ε w 2 w 1 a l d w where dw is the water density of 0 998 g cm3 to measure porosity initially a piece of known membrane area was soaked for 24 h in di water then the sample was weighed immediately after cautiously cleaning excess water on the membrane surface after that the membrane sample was dried in the oven for 2 h at a temperature of 60 c and then weighed again the thickness of the membrane was measured directly using a pocket thickness gauge 0 0 001 micrometer the mean pore radius rm was then calculated using eq 2 2 r m 2 9 1 75 ε 8 ηl j w a ε δ p where η is the viscosity of water at 8 9 10 4 pa s jw is the membrane water flux in m3 s and δp is the applied operating pressure in pa analyses were carried out on triplicate membrane samples to ensure results repeatability 3 4 mf uf bench scale setup the bench scale unit was built after reviewing published mf uf testing setups 14 24 25 27 as shown in figs 2 and 3 the setup is based on an amicon uf stirred cell amicon millipore usa having a capacity of 50 ml membrane diameter of 44 5 mm and an actual filtration area of 13 5 cm2 the cell is used for testing flat sheet membranes at different pressures ranging from 1 to 5 bar those pressures were provided using a nitrogen cylinder connected to a 1 gallon feed reservoir 316ss pressure vessel sterlitech usa with appropriate safety features pressure regulator and relief valve a pressure transducer px309 omega engineering usa was mounted at the inlet of the amicon uf stirred cell i e feed reservoir outlet to accurately measure and record the applied pressure the amicon uf stirred cell was positioned on top of a magnetic stirring plate sterlitech usa to maintain the homogeneity of the feed wastewater filtered water i e permeate was collected in a 1 l glass beaker that was placed on a digital balance mettler toledo switzerland to measure the weight of the collected water both pressure and permeate weight were acquired every 250 ms by a labview acquisition system crio 9035 national instruments usa the system was setup to constantly collect and store the data as well as to monitor the membrane water flux that is plotted by the software and displayed on a screen 3 5 commercial mf uf membranes several commercially available mf uf membranes from various manufactures with different chemistries and mwcos were screened and some were selected for testing using the developed experimental protocol as shown in table 4 3 6 mf uf experimental protocol after thoroughly reviewing published mf uf bench testing experiences and not coming across a comprehensive procedure a testing protocol was developed addressing membrane permeability rejection fouling and cleanability which consists of three key steps 3 6 1 initial characterization the membrane sheet was initially soaked in di water for at least 24 h to ensure that any shipping or storage preservatives have been washed out properly after that the membrane was cut and placed into the amicon uf stirred cell used for testing diameter 44 5 cm the membrane was then tested using di water at a pressure of 3 bar and stirring speed of 560 rpm until reaching a stable water flux measurement similar operating conditions were also applied for all following baseline tests flux obtained from this test is referred to as the clean membrane flux which was utilized as the benchmark for flux comparison against the fouled membrane 3 6 2 operating performance fouling tests were performed using a low salinity synthetic pw solution as noted in section 3 2 targeting 50 feed volume reduction 100 ml and 50 ml of the synthetic pw were transferred to the 1 gal feed reservoir and the amicon uf stirred cell respectively the membrane was then tested at a pressure of 3 bar and stirring speed of 560 rpm the flux generated from this test is described as the synthetic pw flux samples of feed and permeate were collected and analyzed for toc and o g to assess the organics rejection performance by the membrane 3 6 3 cleaning and recovery initially the fouled membrane flux was measured via performing a di water baseline on the fouled membrane after that two membrane chemical cleaning steps were implemented to recover the membrane s lost flux due to fouling for the first step 50 ml of a 1 mm naoh solution with ph of 11 5 at a temperature of 25 c was prepared and transferred to the amicon uf stirred cell for surface cleaning under magnetic stirring for 15 min at 560 rpm to measure the efficiency of naoh cleaning a di water baseline test was performed as noted in section 3 6 1 the second chemical cleaning step involves using 50 ml sds solution at a concentration of 10 mm a ph of 9 4 and a temperature of 35 c at similar testing conditions followed for naoh cleaning a final baseline test was conducted for measuring the final membrane flux chemical cleaning flux and determining the total flux loss due to fouling as indicated in eq 3 3 flux loss j o j f j o 100 where jo is the clean membrane flux and jf is the final membrane flux after chemical cleaning to mimic typical membrane filtration operating conditions after characterizing the clean membrane water flux step 3 6 1 three consecutive cycles of membrane fouling and cleaning were conducted as a robust approach for determining the membrane s oil water separation efficiency 4 results discussion 4 1 protocol validation on commercial mf uf membranes validation tests using the developed bench scale testing procedure were carried out on selected commercial mf and uf membranes as specified in table 4 the applicability of the testing protocol was evaluated for different membrane parameters including variation of membrane pore size mwco manufacturer and chemistry 4 1 1 variation of pore size mwco 4 1 1 1 mf membranes the impact of pore size was first studied on commercial mf membranes 0 2 and 8 0 μm pes membranes were obtained from m1 and tested using the developed protocol since higher water fluxes are expected from mf membranes in comparison to uf the operating pressure was adjusted and set at 0 5 bar such adjustment will prolong the testing period which ultimately will help in better characterizing the performance of the membrane fig 4 compares the oil water separation test results for both membranes specific water fluxes of 10 689 and 28 616 lmh bar were observed for the 0 2 and 8 0 μm pes membranes respectively in terms of organics rejection an average toc rejection of 87 was obtained for the 0 2 μm membrane against 67 for the 8 0 μm membrane as noted in table 5 the lower toc rejection obtained at a pore size of 8 0 μm is attributed to the synthetic pw solution that consists of oil water emulsions possessing a mean droplet size of 4 6 μm therefore the 8 0 μm membrane is not rejecting smaller oil particles which results in lower toc rejection similar interpretation applies also for the minimum flux loss obtained at this pore size against the 26 loss for the 0 2 μm pes membrane that is rejecting the smaller oil contaminants 4 1 1 2 uf membranes a oil water separation tests as uf membrane manufacturers use different methods for mwco characterization three commercial uf membranes with pes chemistry having different mwcos of 50 100 and 300 kda were acquired from manufacturer m2 and tested using the developed protocol as shown in fig 5 specific water fluxes of 21 41 and 59 lmh bar were obtained for the tested mwcos 50 100 300 kda respectively the variation in flux against mwco obtained using the protocol was validated with porosity measurements as presented in fig 6 both sets of data were found to show a strong linear correlation validating the applicability of the procedure in characterizing the pure water permeability of membranes having different mwcos in table 6 o g analyses performed on feed and permeate samples showed comparable rejection performances for all mwcos with 99 removal in terms of toc as expected lower removal performances were realized in comparison to o g at 88 for 100 k and 300 k against 92 for 50 k this is due to the physical breaking of the oil sds emulsions by the membrane that is mainly rejecting the oil and allowing the sds molecules to permeate inside the membrane pores thus contributing to the toc in the permeate as shown in table 6 pes 50 kda was selected as an example to graphically represent the oil emulsions breaking mechanism through the tested membranes as illustrated in fig 7 49 b modeling of fouling mechanisms the protocol was also utilized to compare the membranes fouling propensity in terms of total irreversible flux loss four classic fouling correlations 50 51 were curve fitted to the experimental data to identify the fouling mechanism occurring on the membrane as indicated in table 7 in the cake filtration mechanism the layers of contaminants deposit on the membrane surface whereas in complete blocking foulants will entirely block the pores of the membrane similarly in intermediate blocking the contaminants will block some of the pores on the membrane with some attaching to formerly deposited particles the last fouling mechanism is the standard blocking of the pores at which the size of the contaminant particles is smaller than the membrane pores causing them attach to the inner walls of the pores results presented in table 6 showed an increase in total flux loss to about 18 at a mwco of 100 kda against 8 obtained at 50 kda nevertheless at a higher mwco of 300 kda irreversible fouling behavior was detected to be minimum i e 0 flux loss the fouling behavior for those membranes was studied further through applying the classic fouling correlations table 8 compares the correlation coefficients r2 for the four fouling mechanisms at a mwco of 50 kda surface deposition cake filtration was found to have the highest r2 of 0 99 which showed the best agreement with experimental data as shown in fig 8 confirming that surface deposition was the main fouling mechanism for this membrane similar approach was applied for mwcos of 100 and 300 kda results showed that at a mwco of 100 kda intermediate blocking has generated the best fit at an r2 coefficient of 0 97 this justifies the experimentally obtained increase in total flux loss at this mwco in comparison with the 50 kda membrane since at intermediate fouling some of the foulants will deposit while others will block the surface pores of the membrane at a higher mwco 300 kda cake filtration was found to be the main fouling mechanism at an r2 of 0 97 and with the larger pore size on this membrane the applied surface cleaning will potentially be more efficient as it can reach through the larger pores and remove deposited or blocking contaminants from the membrane 4 1 2 variation of vendor as properties and performance of a membrane are both dependent on the synthesis method and thus its manufacturer hence the developed protocol was also applied for evaluating the effect of variating membrane vendor using three pan membranes obtained from m2 m3 and m4 with mwcos of 100 50 and 20 kda respectively table 9 summarizes the testing results in terms of flux fouling and rejection fluxes of 16 203 and 390 lmh bar were obtained for the tested pan membranes despite that pan sourced from m2 was characterized to have a mwco of 100 kda it showed lower flux in comparison to pan membranes sourced from m3 and m4 having mwcos of 50 and 20 kda sem images of the tested membranes are shown in fig 9 the figure compares the surface structure of the tested pan membranes confirming that pan m4 has larger pores in comparison to pan m2 pan m3 was also showing relatively larger pores against pan m2 but they were less in terms of quantity against pan m4 in addition the three membranes have shown different fouling performances for instance pan m2 and pan m4 revealed minimum fouling behaviors at total flux losses 10 whereas pan m3 showed a higher flux loss at 51 similarly both pan membranes from m2 and m4 showed similar rejection performances at a toc removal of 80 while pan from m3 showed a slightly higher toc rejection at 86 the above results prove the applicability of the testing protocol in assessing and comparing the performance of products sourced from different manufacturers 4 1 3 variation of chemistry three different membrane chemistries pes pan and pvdf having a mwco of 100 kda were sourced from the same manufacturer m2 to ensure having a common comparison basis for performance evaluation and were tested using the developed experimental procedure a water contact angle water contact angle analysis assessing the hydrophilicity of the three membrane chemistries was carried out as shown in table 10 membranes having pan and pes chemistries showed higher affinities towards water at contact angles between 50 and 56 on the other hand pvdf was found to be less hydrophilic at a measured water contact angle of 69 making it more susceptible to organic fouling obtained results were validated against published data and were all found to be equivalent 16 b oil water separation tests initially the reproducibility of the developed testing protocol in terms of showing repeatable performance results upon testing duplicate membrane coupons was validated duplicate membrane coupons for pan and pes were tested and the average specific water flux results are presented respectively in fig 10a and fig 10b test results were found to be reliably reproducible in terms of characterizing the membrane s pure water flux as well as the fouling behavior and organics rejection for both membrane chemistries as presented in table 11 fig 10 compares the performance of three different membrane polymers pan pes and pvdf specific water fluxes of 16 43 and 171 lmh bar were obtained for the tested membranes respectively although pes and pan were proven to be more hydrophilic both were showing lower membrane specific water fluxes against pvdf such performance was investigated through measurements of porosity and mean pore radius results were found to confirm such variation in flux between tested polymers with pvdf showing the highest porosity and mean pore size at 57 and 92 nm as presented in table 12 the three membrane polymers were capable of removing almost all the o g from the synthetic pw at percentages 99 however in terms of toc attributed to both oil and sds both pes and pvdf chemistries have shown better toc rejections against pan this was supported by permeate toc and o g data confirming the physical breakage of emulsions and the passage of sds through the membranes as presented in table 13 and illustrated in fig 7 c ftir analysis to compare the fouling behavior of the three tested chemistries ftir analysis was carried out to identify key functional groups present in the crude oil used to prepare the synthetic pw and both the clean and the fouled membrane samples fig 11 presents the ftir absorbance spectra for the crude oil against the fouled membranes after subtracting the absorbance of the clean membranes as shown in the figure peaks found at wavelengths of 2292 and 2852 cm 1 in the crude oil relate to single ch stretching vibrations 54 similar peaks were also found on the three fouled membrane chemistries ftir results were found to agree with the experimentally obtained fouling trends in terms of verifying that pan has the least fouling tendency against pes and pvdf 4 2 protocol application on emerging membranes based on the above validation study performed on commercial mf uf products we are in the process of applying and optimizing the protocol to a wide range of emerging membrane materials under development in order the effectively evaluate their performance for oil water separation below are two examples for the application of the testing procedure on innovative membrane materials currently being developed 4 2 1 initial characterization the first step of membrane testing as denoted in section 3 6 1 is the membrane initial characterization that is performed using di water this critical test is performed on a clean membrane sheet to determine its stable pure water permeability prior to fouling tests fig 12 compares the water flux results for two commercial membranes pan 100 k pes 100 k manufactured by m2 against an emerging membrane under development as expected both commercial membranes were consistently showing stable water flux measurements after only the first half hour of testing on the other hand one of our emerging uf membranes under development showed significant drop in flux up to 91 during the first 3 h before starting to stabilize during the last hour of testing such challenge related to the initial membrane characterization was identified as an area that needs further optimization by the emerging membrane developers 4 2 2 oil water separation test an experimental nanostructure enhanced mf membrane developed by our team was also tested using the deveploed protocol the membrane consists of a styrene isoprene styrene sis block copolymer mesoporous silica ms nanocomposite layered on a commercial 8 0 μm pes mf membrane sourced from m1 the specific water flux measured for the modified membrane was found to be lower at 18 600 lmh bar in comparison to the commercial mf membrane being initially at 28 600 lmh bar after testing it with the synthetic pw solution a following baseline test confirmed the fouling of the emerging membrane at a specific water flux of 7500 lmh bar as shown in fig 13 upon applying chemical cleaning it was found that only a small fraction of the flux was recovered i e 10 in cycle 1 similarly cycles 2 and 3 confirmed the membrane s fouling tendency with a consistent drop in the fouled membrane flux as well as the insignificant flux recovery after chemical cleaning translating to a total flux loss of 81 in terms of organics rejection the nanocomposite coating was able to enhance the rejection of the 8 0 μm pes commercial membrane from 67 up to an average of 81 as demonstrated in table 14 thus through applying the developed protocol it was verified that this membrane showed improved rejection performances but still requires improvement in terms of fouling propensity and cleanability optical images to qualitatively illustrate and compare the fouling behavior of the emerging membrane against the commercial mf product are presented in fig 14 the procedure will help optimize various innovative membrane materials currently under development by our team to identify the formulations that would demonstrate step change in performance in comparison to commercial products 5 conclusion the study presented a bench testing procedure developed for evaluating the performance of commercial and novel flat sheet mf uf membranes for oil water separation the protocol mimics industrial conditions by using a representative synthetic pw solution and applying multiple consecutive oil water separation with cleaning cycles several commercial mf uf membranes having different pore size mwco and chemistry were acquired from multiple manufacturers and evaluated using the protocol in terms of water permeability organics rejection fouling and cleanability selected observations from membrane performance evaluation which validated the protocol applicability include for mf membranes with larger pore sizes higher specific water flux and lower fouling tendency and organics rejection performance were achieved for mf membranes with smaller pore sizes lower specific water flux and higher fouling propensity were measured but with higher organics rejection for uf membranes with larger mwcos higher specific water fluxes were observed which were linearly correlated to increased membrane porosity the fouling rate of uf membranes with different mwcos was dependent on the fouling mechanism e g cake filtration vs intermediate blocking on the membrane surface for membranes manufactured with the same polymer variation in performance was found to be dependent on the difference of vendor membrane characterization which was further supported by sem analysis for different membrane polymers acquired from the same vendor pan showed the lowest fouling tendency while pvdf showed the highest fouling propensity which was also validated by ftir for different membrane polymers with the same mwco from the same vendor pan had the lowest organics rejection while pvdf had the highest rejection finally the protocol steps were effectively applied on novel membrane materials under development to compare their performance against relevant commercial products hence the robust bench testing procedure is proposed to be utilized by researchers who are developing innovative membrane materials to allow for comparison of their new membranes against relevant commercial products for

13337,extracting alberta s bitumen by sagd requires a growing supply of steam which is mainly generated from recycled produced water pw traditionally a warm lime softener wls followed by walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cation exchange wac units have been employed to minimize the concentrations of silica toc and hardness from pw in this study we enhanced toc and silica removal in a wsf unit by modifying the surface of the walnut shell media the walnut shells were modified by anchoring low mass percentages e g 5 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles under moderate hydrolysis conditions the nanoparticle anchored walnut shell particles ws nps were fully characterized and their ability to remove toc and silica was tested using batch and column experiments in the batch tests up to 85 of silica and toc was removed in the column tests which mimicked industrial operations ws nps significantly improved the breakthrough behavior without reaching pressure drop limitations the column breakthrough behaviors were successfully described by a dimensionless advection axial dispersion model the model accurately captured the commercial breakthrough behavior indicating the possibility of scaling up the filter using a combined unit that removes silica and toc simultaneously without using wls and wac keywords surface modification hydrolysis conditions total organic carbon removal silica removal fixed bed column advection dispersion model 1 introduction there are two major methods that are currently employed for bitumen recovery from oil sands open pit mining processes and in situ thermal recovery about 80 percent of the bitumen reserves in alberta are buried too deep to mine and can only be recovered by in situ thermal recovery 1 3 in situ thermal recovery resembles the recovery of conventional oil whereby bitumen extraction is accomplished by drilling two wells and consequently injecting steam or generating heat which allows the bitumen to flow to the surface steam assisted gravity drainage sagd is one the most commonly used processes for bitumen recovery from oil sands 1 4 in principle sagd requires the drilling of two horizontal wells 2 the upper well is used for injecting the steam inside the oil well deposit the steam is used as the heat carrier latent heat to reduce the viscosity of bitumen decreasing the flow resistance of heavy oil through porous media and ultimately increasing the yield and production rate 5 therefore the mobilized bitumen along with the condensate steam are drained downward by gravity to the second horizontal well where it is pumped to the surface at the surface the recovered bitumen is separated via subsequent cooling units generating huge amounts of wastewater as produced water pw 2 5 bitumen is transferred to surface upgrading facilities converting low quality oil to synthetic crude oil pw on the other hand is transferred to subsequent de oiling and water treatment units the water treatment units through sequential water treatment steps improve the water quality to be re used for boiler feed water bfw in a once through steam generator otsg that produces steam from high quality water pw is generally characterized as having high concentrations from 1000 to 10 000 mg l of brine silica alkalines and total dissolved solids tds 6 8 table s1 displays the typical sagd produced water concentrations mg l as well as the desirable feed for otsg in the form of tds toc silica and hardness as caco3 9 11 exceeding the tabulated threshold requirement concentrations is undesirable for the reuse of pw as boiler feed water in an oilfield steam generator unless it can be effectively treated through selective water treatment technology trains 12 the generated sagd produced water must meet the strict requirements in the employed boiler for steam generation 5 9 10 13 14 otherwise boiler drum and tubes can be damaged or corroded oil sands companies in canada are therefore under endless pressure to find novel technologies to improve the technologies for recycling the pw fig 1 shows a schematic representation for the conventional treatment train that is used to improve the quality of pw as described the treatment train is composed of a warm lime softening unit wls followed by walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cationic exchange wac units in the wls the hardness calcium and magnesium ions and alkalinity are removed by adding chemicals like lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and caustic soda naoh 9 15 as a result the concentrations of silica and hardness are diminished to values of less than 50 mg l and 50 mg l caco3 respectively while the concentration of toc drops to a range of 150 300 mg l interestingly most of the silica is removed by wls through adsorption of the silica on the surface of precipitated magnesium ions 9 after the free oil content is further reduced 50 mg l by using a walnut shell filter wsf with a high concentration of divalent ions ca2 and mg2 that are gained during the wls treatment 9 15 these divalent ions are then treated by applying the weak acid cation exchanging process wac as a last step during the wac treatment wac resins e g carboxylic acid derivatives are added for the de alkalization of water 15 thus the total alkalinity carbonates and non carbonates is removed unfortunately the sequential steps in conventional sagd wastewater treatment are not completely successful in removing silica and toc especially in the wls unit tds and toc concentration levels also increase with the introduction of resins prior to wac the high level of both contaminants severely interferes with subsequent recycling of the pw because more low quality water is blown down to the otsg in fact accumulation of silica and toc results in damage and corrosion of otsg drums and tubes causing the need for large size or great number of evaporators many potential technologies e g chemical physical biological and membrane filtration have been introduced as emerging technologies to various types of oil sand process affected water ospw despite many modifications they cannot be effectively used for oil field applications to treat silica and or degrade many types of complex organic compounds 8 16 23 nowadays membrane filtration has progressively been used as an alternative option and has attracted the attention of many researchers over the last 10 years due to its high removal efficiency 8 16 23 the key parameters for the membrane filtration are selectivity and flux which tend to be influenced at high hydraulic loading rapid membrane clogging and fouling with high concentrations resulting in lower efficiency 8 16 23 in the field it has also been noted that investment maintenance and operational costs of membranes are often too high 8 16 23 in wsf a deep bed filter media commonly termed walnut shell filters are conventionally used due to their oil and solid filtration performance combined with ease of backwashing walnut shell filter media compared with other minerals and polymers has several unique characteristics e g hard lightweight chemically inert non toxic and biodegradable 21 24 these characteristics in addition to its high affinity to uptake many mineral oils have motivated its utilization as an effective filtration media when separating crude oil from water e g reducing of the toc concentration of sagd wastewater it has also been reported that the walnut shell filter effectiveness for removing heavy metals pharmaceuticals and toxic organics can be enhanced with various methods of surface modification table 1 however none of these studies have been continuously implemented via column tests or improved the depth filtration of the wsf unit toward removing of silica and toc 25 31 in our current study we are proposing an effective method to improve the deep bed filtration efficiency by enhancing the sorption capacity of the walnut shell filter particles via anchoring low mass fraction of iron hydroxide nanoparticles at the walnut shell surface to enhance the simultaneous removal efficiency of the toc and silica having low mass percentages of iron hydroxide nanoparticles will enhance the sorption affinity of the walnut shell particles without impacting the wastewater flux through the filtration process as a result sequential water treatment units for the pw can be combined in one single unit so that both silica and toc can be removed in wsf without involving wls and wac the breakthrough behavior under various loading conditions was described by using our dimensionless advection dispersion model that is able to capture the governed mass transfer phenomena under non ideal plug flow behavior the recyclability of the spent particles was investigated through direct backwashing and blade stirring methods indeed this is the first time that such a treatment approach for sagd produced water has been used thus the findings of this study could establish the stepping stone for the future nanotechnological applications in the field of produced water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials walnut shell filter aid particles and steam assisted gravity drainage wastewater samples were kindly supplied by an industrial partner in calgary alberta canada the supplied walnut shell particles have media size of 12 20 mesh 0 8 1 7 mm which is the typical walnut shell media applied in oil and gas industry for oil removal from produced water for the surface modification nitric acid hno3 70 and iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 97 were used both chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa and used as received without further treatment or purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 walnut shell filter surface modification surface modification for the walnut shell filter particles was hydrothermally carried out at mild conditions by two successive steps the first step consisted of the reaction of walnut shell particles ws vr with diluted nitric acid hno3 10 followed by anchoring iron hydro oxide nanoparticles into the walnut shell filter particles via thermal hydrolysis reaction the walnut shell particles were acid treated by adding 50 g of the walnut shell filter particles to 70 ml of aqueous solution of nitric acid inside a 200 ml glass container that was partially sealed and placed inside the fume hood for 3 h after the acid treated walnut shell particles ws at were washed with deionized water and dried overnight under vacuum in the second step 10 g from the ws at were added to 500 ml of iron chloride hexahydrate solution fecl3 6h2o 97 under magnetic stirring for 5 h inside a sealed plastic container thermal hydrolysis was carried out at ph range from 1 5 to 3 0 by placing the container inside a pre heated furnace which allowed for the hydrothermal reaction to occur for the particles of ws at the hydrolysis reaction allowed the formation of anchored walnut shell particles with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles ws nps during the synthesis formation of iron hydroxide on the walnut shell surface was controlled by three main factors namely initial concentration of starting material iron precursor hydrolysis time and the temperature concentration of iron precursors had two levels 1 and 2 m and hydrolysis time had three levels 4 8 and 12 h temperature had two levels 80 and 100 c thus twelve individual experiments were performed for synthesis of ws nps after the hydrolysis the produced ws nps were recovered washed and dried to be characterized and tested for the removal of toc and silica 2 2 2 characterization study to visualize the surface change for the walnut shell filter particles before and after the acid treatment and anchorage of the iron hydro oxide nanoparticles a field emission quanta 250 scanning electron microscopy analysis sem was performed for the samples ws vr ws at and ws nps the sem analysis was used to confirm the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles following our anchoring procedure for the analysis a small amount of each sample was deposited over a carbon tape sample holder the holder was then tapped to release the extra amount of each sample then with a focused beam of electrons the sample generated signals forming the sem images x ray diffraction xrd was also performed for ws vr before and after surface modifications using a rigaku ultima iii x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation as the x ray source the x ray scans were performed in the range of 2 90 degrees of 2θ using a 0 05 degree step and a counting time of 1 0 degree per min operating at 40 kv and 44 ma to obtain the full diffractogram for the analyzed material the results are obtained in the form of x ray patterns the obtained peaks were analyzed by jade software to estimate the full width at half maximum fwhm jade software provides fitting of the experimental profile to a pseudo voigt profile function allowing the computation of the crystalline domain sizes by scherer equation the surface area and pore size distribution of the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications were characterized by performing bruneur emmett teller bet analysis the analysis was carried out by a surface area and porosity analyzer tristar ii 3020 micromeritics instrument corporation norcross ga before the analysis the dried samples were pre treated inside sample holder cells under flow of nitrogen gas and simultaneously heated to 423 k overnight then the pre treated samples were submitted to the adsorption desorption by nitrogen at 77 k and to produce the physisorption isotherms to further investigate the micro porosity the bet tests were also performed by submitting the same samples to physisorption of carbon dioxide at 273 k carbon dioxide has more advantageous kinetics than nitrogen because of its lower molecular size that allows faster diffusion through the pore network and consequently easier access to the micropores furthermore fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was conducted for the three samples using an iraffinity 1s instrument shimadzu corporation to confirm that walnut shell surface was successfully anchored with iron hydroxide nanoparticles the ftir was operated in the diffuse reflectance mode in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a 4 cm 1 resolution and for an average of 50 scans for the analysis potassium bromide kbr was used for dispersing the powder sample 2 mg per 200 mg 1 wt wt then the iron content of each sample was quantified by a microwave assisted acid digestion mars analysis that was followed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes thermo scientific icap series for mars analysis a commercial procedure was used as implemented by the unit model mars 6 from cem cooperation mathews nc usa for the analysis each solid sample i e ws vr ws at and ws nps was weighted and mixed with 10 ml hno3 70 inside 100 m l vessel then the content of each vessel was digested inside the mars unit that operates at a frequency of 2 45 ghz at 100 of full power maximum of 1600 w after the acid digestion the concentrations of iron and silica for each sample were measured by the icp oes the method used to build calibration curves for the iron and silica was dashboard icap 7200 with asx560 using iron and silica standard solutions that were purchased from sigma aldrich at purities of 99 5 and 98 respectively 2 2 3 toc and silica removal by batch process the toc and silica removal from a real sagd wastewater sample was tested for the materials of the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications by using a batch mode of adsorption each experiment was performed by adding 100 mg of each material to a series of 25 ml glass vials filled with 10 ml of sagd wastewater solution with initial concentrations of silica and toc of 155 and 450 mg l respectively then the vials were sealed and placed in a wrist action shaker burrel model 75 bb for 4 h which was enough time to attain the equilibrium after the vials were left overnight on the lab bench at room temperature to allow the tested materials to settle down after settling the sorbent particles all vials were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm in an eppendorf centrifuge 5804 to separate the residuals after the batch adsorption experiments the residual concentration of toc was measured using a shimadzu toc toc l cph cpn analyzer while the residual concentrations of silica and iron were measured by icp oes thermo scieintific icap 7000 series icp oes ontario canada and x ray fluorescence xrf marlven panalytical spectris canada inc 4921 place olivia st laurent canada measuring the residual concentration of iron allowed us to determine the quantity of iron hydroxide nanoparticles leached out at the end of each batch test while the percentage removal removal of silica and toc for each sample was calculated as follows 1 r e m o v a l c i n c f c i n 100 where cin and cf are the initial and final concentrations mg l respectively additionally the adsorbed amount qe in mg g was determined by applying the mass balance as follows 2 q e v m c i n c e where v m and ce are the volume of solution ml the mass of adsorbent g and the equilibrium concentration mg l respectively the maximum adsorption capacity in addition to the kinetic parameters for the removal of silica and toc were determined by performing batch adsorption experiments at various dosages of ws nps the obtained equilibria data were plotted to estimate the batch adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm data were described by the sips model 34 commonly known as freundlich langmuir combined model represented by the following equation 3 q e k q m c e n 1 k c e n where k qm and n are sips equilibrium constant l mg n maximum adsorption capacity mg g and heterogeneity coefficient dimensionless that express the sensitivity of the model towards langmuir or freundlich tendency respectively 34 the sips equation has been derived to rigorously calculate the distribution of the adsorption energies of the sites of a catalyst surface when the adsorption isotherms are known if the adsorption is localized and there are no interactions 34 thus sips model can be utilized to a freundlich isotherm and also to a new theoretical isotherm which reduces to the freundlich type for low concentration but exhibits saturation for high concentration 34 it is worth noting here that the value of heterogeneity coefficient for all the physical cases must lie between zero and unity 34 accordingly the duality of sips equation is apparent as it approaches the langmuir model as n approaches 1 implying homogeneity or freundlich as n approaches zero implying heterogenicity 34 2 2 4 fixed bed column toc and silica removal after performing the batch adsorption tests the walnut shell particles were also tested for silica and toc removal before and after modifying the surface with low mass fraction of nanoparticles in a continuous flow mode using a fixed bed column a schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the column setup was primarily composed of a packed bed column pressure transducers peristaltic pump and influent and effluent tanks the column and tubes were made of 316 stainless steel the column had a diameter of 1 cm and various lengths i e 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm two pressure transducers located at the inlet and outlet of the column were connected to a computer where the pressure drop in the column was recorded throughout the experiments the direction of flow through the column was controlled via a series of valves at the effluent a needle valve was installed for sampling the watson marlow qdos 60 peristaltic pump used was a manual pump with 7 atm 100 psi santoprene renu pumphead before each experiment the column was supported and closely packed from the bottom and top with a 120 mesh 125 μm filter the column was filled with each material ws vr and w nps individually until it obtained the desired length after filling the column was initially flushed with deionized water and each experiment was started by providing a uniform flow rate to the column from the top the effluent was collected periodically from the bottom of the column during each experiment and the toc and silica concentrations of each sample were measured by the toc and icp oes at different time intervals the obtained concentration values were presented in the form of breakthrough curves for each material and compared in terms of breakthrough time and removal efficiency the breakthrough time was obtained when the effluent concentration ct was approximately equal 0 05 of the influent concentration cin each experiment was stopped based on the differential pressure achieved or the effluent wastewater quality the flux was selected based on a typical flux of the industrial scale walnut shell filter that has a typical diameter of 4 26 m 14 ft and operates under minimum flux of 0 067m3 s 1077 02 gpm 26 to mimic the flow through the commercial filter dimensionless number analysis was applied for the column to determine the column running flow regime assuming that the physical properties for the wastewater were similar to that for water at 25 c and porosity of the walnut shell particles was 0 7 the obtained reynold number re was determined to be 13 with this re the column as a pilot scale for the commercial filter should operate at a minimum flow rate of 22 5 ml min accordingly the column tests were performed at volumetric flow rates q of 10 20 and 30 ml min with constant initial concentrations of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l and a bed depth of 8 cm for industrial purposes the quality of the sagd produced water was also considered as an important hydrodynamic parameter thus the change in the inlet concentrations of silica and toc was focused in the column study such that the inlet toc concentration was 450 225 and 150 mg l while the inlet concentration of silica was 155 77 5 51 6 mg l furthermore our column study included the bed height z effect on the breakthrough behavior with bed heights of 4 6 10 in i e 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm after the toc and silica concentration measurements the experimental data were presented in the form of breakthrough curves btcs the btcs are typically used to describe the variation in effluent influent concentrations of the silica or toc against time in each btc the time at which the effluent concentration approaches 5 of the influent concentration is arbitrarily identified as breakthrough time tb which is considered as one of the most characteristic parameters in the column tests 35 the obtained btc can be also used to estimate other characteristic parameters which are listed in table s2 the listed parameters in table s2 are valuable in determining the performance of the walnut shell before and after loading it with nanoparticles to remove the silica and toc however investigating the parameters cannot accurately estimate the degree of curvature and symmetry of the breakthrough curves when it is subjected to different hydrodynamic and operational conditions such as the initial flow rate inlet concentration and bed height at the pilot scale 35 in fact the shape and behavior of the breakthrough curve suffers from various factors such as mass transfer resistance flow rate equilibrium time and adsorption mechanisms 35 fundamentally prediction of long term filtration performance through a full scale depth filtration system is not effective due to several assumptions 35 first the models are derived based on ideal interactions between spherical pollutant particles with spherical filter grain second hydrodynamic variability and the operating conditions in the filtration theory add more complexity third the filtration coefficient cannot be predicted as a single value for the whole depth of the filter which changes with either time or depth fourth the fundamental depth filtration theory does not include the sorption or accumulation of the pollutant particles on the grain filter media the most common approach in deep bed filtration modeling is the classical colloid filtration theory that was developed by yao et al 1971 who presented a basic model for wastewater treatment application based on the accumulation of the pollutant particles on single filter grain collector 25 however the generation or loss of particles as well as the diffusion into and out of the control volume is ignored compared to the convection term also growing the filter media particles through the filtration due to sorption or depositing behavior of the contaminated particle is not considered 35 thus the basic mechanism for transporting and attaching the particles to the media is not accurately presented especially if there are binding sites available on the grain surface when the filter operates this subsequently leads to unclear transport phenomena of the pollutant particles inside the filter as a result of sedimentation interception and diffusion 35 tufkenji et al 2005 have discovered a significant deviation from the classical colloid filtration theory due to presence of deposition behavior 36 they proposed a well controlled experimental system to examine the deposition behavior of uniform particles within a column packed with a glass bead collector over a wide range of physiochemical conditions 36 to account for the deviations from the classical filtration theory the sorption and diffusion of the pollutant particles to the collectors should be included into the differential elements over the control volume of the column thus including the sorption inside the bed under continuous operation can be possible with many mathematical models that take into account i film diffusion through the laminar layer of liquid on the external surface of an adsorbent particle ii pore or surface diffusion within the porous structure of the adsorbent iii internal surface reaction 37 the internal surface reaction is generally fast hence the first or second steps are the rate limiting steps it is experimentally difficult to determine whether the first or second is the dominant step since the dominant mass transfer step can be influenced by the operational parameters along the column in many previous studies various mass transfer models have been widely used to describe the phenomena controlling the rate limiting steps 37 40 however these models either assume the presence of an ideal plug flow behavior or ignore the axial dispersion effect 34 by considering the axial dispersion the dominant mass transfer phenomena along the column can be determined especially with variation of the hydrodynamic conditions and rate of adsorption 34 an advection axial dispersion model has shown some satisfactory results in the prediction of the breakthrough behavior of different nanoparticle based adsorbents under various operational conditions after converting to the dimensionless form the model also successfully described the dominant mass transfer mechanism along the column with smaller number of geometrical and phenomenological variables 41 as reported in our previous work 41 the dimensionless advection axial dispersion takes the following form 4 2 c η 2 p e m c η 1 r 2 c t ρ b n k q m c i n c n 1 r 1 k c i n c n 2 c t 0 0 η 1 0 t where ρ b is the bulk density of the walnut shell kg m3 and k qm cin and n are the kinetic parameters obtained from the batch experiments the other dimensionless parameters presented in eq 4 are listed in table s3 also the initial and boundary conditions that are used to describe the process in eq 4 are 5 c 0 0 η l l t 0 6 1 c 1 p e m c η 0 η 0 0 t 7 c η 0 η l l 0 t eq 4 was solved numerically by using wolfram mathematica package v 10 2 the numerical solution of the pde found using the ndsolve command and by applying the method of lines was fit to the experimental data in every breakthrough data set the best numerical solution was obtained by minimizing the sum square of the difference between the experimental data and numerical solution 42 the peclet number over the characteristic length p e m is the fitting parameter obtained from fitting the experimental breakthrough data with the numerical solution then by calculating peclet number over the real length of the column p e l the dominant mechanism responsible for mass transfer phenomena inside the column could be determined 41 2 2 5 recyclability and regeneration backwashing of the filtration media is a necessary and critical step in the real field the regeneration of the walnut shell filter is part of the filtration cycle and can be triggered by one of the following 1 the quality of the water outlet 2 the pressure drop profile and 3 the pre set time for the filtration stage in many deep filtration sites the backwash is either performed inside the same vessel or in a separate vessel 43 however direct backwashing of the saturated walnut shell filtration column is not easy and requires a huge amount of energy and fresh water since the oil does not directly get adsorbed in the media and tends to be agglomerated forming mud balling thus injecting fresh water in a direction opposite to that of the filtration stage even at high volumetric flow rate is not sufficient in fact every cycle requires agitation of the complete bed of the media in a violent turbulent fashion recently three backwashing modes have been reported to regenerate the dirty walnut shell media from the oilfield wastewater filter fluidization hydraulic swirling and blade stirring 43 the results showed that blade stirring compared with the other backwashing methods is the most effective backwashing method with the least water consumption we have thus performed the regeneration by two methods direct backwashing and blade stirring the direct backwashing was done by reverse injecting a very diluted sodium hydroxide solution 1 mm to the spent filter at high flow rate this experiment was done on the spent column that was obtained at q 10 ml min z 4 in co toc 155 and co silica 450 mg l after a certain time attaining clean samples from the outlet the backwashing stopped and the flow reversed for the second cycle with the original sagd produced water sample at the same conditions after saturation the column stopped and the same backwashing procedure was repeated for three regeneration cycles furthermore the blade stirring method was also applied in our regeneration study for spent filter that was obtained at q 10 ml min z 6 in co toc 155 and co silica 450 mg l the blade stirring regeneration method was conducted by recovering the spent material after shutting down the column prior to the recovery the spent ws nps was soaked with 40 ml sodium hydroxide 0 1 mm at ph 6 and stirred by the mixer at 500 rpm for 5 min inside a 50 ml plastic bottle the recovered material was then filtered under a vacuum and washed 3 times with fresh water to be reused for the next cycle during the next cycle the column was run at the same operational parameters as the first cycle and the clean water was periodically collected till the column was saturated the same regeneration procedure was repeated for the second and third regeneration cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization study sem images for the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications are shown in fig s1a d as seen the surface went through some changes after modifying it with acid fig s1b and anchorage with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles fig s1c d before surface modifications amorphous and compact structure is mainly observed as a result of high contents of cellulose and hemicellulose inert layers fig s1a presented on the walnut shell particle surface 44 in fact the pores on the untreated walnut shell particles were fused and not developed however with acid treatment of the particles insignificant reduction in the ash content 0 01 0 3 is achieved as a result of removing the outer inert surface layers which thereby allowed to form well developed surfaces with open macropores and macro porous cavities fig s1b 44 the presence of these macropores created the possibility of providing anchoring and diffusion sites to accommodate the iron hydroxide nanoparticles which are clearly presented in nanoscales in fig s1c these iron hydroxide nanoparticles appear as agglomerates of small spherical particles with diameters ranging from 1 to 60 nm dispersed on the surface of the treated walnut shell particles xrd patterns of walnut shell particles before ws vr and after surface modifications ws at and ws nps are presented in fig s2 the obtained diffraction peaks for ws vr do not reflect anything beyond the low crystallinity walnut shell xrd pattern in fact broadening and intensities of the obtained diffraction signals were not significantly affected by the hydrothermal treatment of the ws vr also no diffraction peaks corresponding to the iron hydroxide nanoparticles were observed probably due to its high dispersion and low mass fraction with respect to the walnut shell particles consistent with our previous sem results thus anchorage of iron hydroxide nanoparticles at low mass fraction of the ws vr did not alter the morphological structure of the synthesized ws nps however anchorage of iron hydroxide slightly altered the surface area and porosity of the walnut shell filter particles before surface modification low temperature measurements of surface area and porosity were performed for ws vr by n2 unfortunately the measurements did not exhibit any adsorption desorption isotherms in fact the neat walnut shell particles similar to coals and many activated carbons are microporous the entry and accessibility of the n2 molecules at 77 k in these narrow micropores is kinetically restricted due to the low rate of diffusion of the sorbed molecules alternatively we used co2 as suggested by some authors to characterize the micropores presented in the ws vr 45 fig s3 shows the co2 adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution insets estimated by dubinin astakhov for the ws vr fig s2a ws at fig s2b and ws nps fig s2c 45 as shown successful co2 adsorption was achieved at 298 k for the ws vr with bet surface area around 66 m2 g the figure clearly shows that the major distribution of the pore size was around 14 å 2 nm confirming the micro porosity of these particles after acid treatment the adsorption of co2 molecules by the microporous surface tend to be slightly enhanced with bet surface area of 79 m2 g and major distribution of the pore size around 16 å as shown in fig s2b thus treating the structure of the walnut shell particles allowed to create more pores with widened pore sizes toward meso and macro ranges anchoring of 1 7 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles to the surface of ws at on the other hand contributed in slightly reducing the microporous surface area up to 59 m2 g with major distribution of pore size around 17 å fig s2 c this confirms that the narrow pores were partially blocked by the iron hydroxide particles during the synthesis ftir measurements were performed for the same samples i e ws vr ws at and ws nps to confirm the anchoring of iron hydroxide nanoparticles on the walnut shell particle surface at framework of 400 4000 cm 1 see fig s3 a wide band with maximum intensity at wavenumber of 3405 cm 1 was obtained for the three signals assigned to the stretching of oh group of macromolecular association also significant bands were obtained at around 2925 and 2854 cm 1 at different intensities these bands represent the stretching of methylene group bonds presented in the walnut shell structure however the broadness of this band was reduced for the walnut shell particles after acid treatment and the anchoring of nanoparticles before anchoring of nanoparticles a sharp band can be observed at 1708 cm 1 and another at 1622 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid involved in an intermolecular hydrogen bond in addition another sharp peak for ws vr that appears at 1510 and 1458 cm 1 is assigned to the cc ring stretch of aromatic rings several bands ranging from 1319 to 1051 cm 1 refer to co bonding of phenols this splitting pattern is characteristic of several different co bonding of different phenols confirming the presence of tannins polyphenolic biomolecules from these results it can be confirmed that the metallic ions bind to walnut shell particle through interaction with the active oh of phenolic groups as well as carboxylic acids through the addition of acid the nitric acid removes an outer layer of the walnut shell particles to expose the pores which provides more surface area with oh and cooh functional groups to react with the iron complexes during hydrolysis thus it is believed that the acid treatment effectively removes a relatively inert surface layer of the walnut shell to expose a porous surface which increases the surface area of the outer layer thereby exposing greater quantities of carboxylic acids and phenolic groups that can react with the nanoparticles for that purpose the walnut shell surface was treated with acid before surface functionalization with nanoparticles and with surface treatment the band observed at 2925 2854 1708 and 1622 cm 1 tends to diminish due to a reduction in carboxylic acid groups for ws nps a vibration band was obtained at 586 cm 1 that represents fe o providing evidence for the successful anchoring of walnut shell particles with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles to gain better insights into the anchoring mechanism of the iron cations and the oxygenated walnut shell surface the hydrolysis conditions at which the iron hydro oxide is formed is described in fig 3 generally when the ferric salt is dissociated to ferric ions a number of parallel and sequential reactions are carried out 35 46 the iron iii cations tend to form hexa aqueous complexes f e o h 2 6 3 as per reaction 1 47 r1 f e c l 3 6 h 2 o s f e o h 2 6 3 a q 3 c l a q such that water molecules form a coordinate bond with metal cation the formed hexa aqueous complexes pass through a series of hydrolytic reactions as illustrated on fig 3 which give rise to the formation of variety of soluble mono clear and precipitate species 35 46 these species are generated due to reduction of the oh bonds in the coordinated water molecules which tend to act as bronsted acids in the aqueous solution proton donors 35 46 thus the h2o ligands presented in the aquo complex tend to be ultimately deprotonated in a step wise process to form other mono clear soluble i e f e o h o h 2 5 2 and f e o h 2 o h 2 4 and precipitate i e fe oh 3 species as presented in fig 4 hence it is uncertain to determine which species are involved in anchoring the hydroxylated particles i e ws at according to some previous studies two possible scenarios can be suggested to represent the interaction between the formed species and the hydroxylated particles i e ws at 35 46 in the first scenario interaction of hydroxylated particles can be achieved with any mono clear species by forming oxygenated bridges through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism as suggested by nieto delgado and rangel mendez 2012 47 on the other hand zhu et al 2020 48 have proposed that the precipitate species of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 can be bounded to the hydroxylated surface by bidentate adsorption as schematically presented in fig 4 the authors have proven via experimental and theoretical dft calculations that the interaction between fe oh 3 s and a hydroxylated surface of bastnaesite occurs through the bidentate adsorption 48 this bidentate adsorption will lead to the reduction of active sites two rare earth cation sites may be reduced to one ferric ion site according to such mechanism the fe oh 3 nanoparticles chemically adsorb onto the hydroxylated surfaces and form a more stable and reactive structure 48 50 which allows the surface to remove silica and toc simultaneously as will be discussed in the next sections 3 2 removal of toc and silica by batch adsorption the weight percentages of iron anchored on the walnut shell particles after controlling the factors of initial concentration of iron precursor hydrolysis temperature and time are listed in table s4 the mass fraction of iron on the modified walnut shell particles ws pns against the hydrolysis temperature at times of 4 8 and 12 h when the ws nps was prepared at different concentrations of iron precursor are shown in fig s5 a b as seen the mass fraction of anchored iron hydroxide nanoparticles increased with hydrolysis time as the hydrolysis reaction provides a higher conversion of iron hydro oxide at high residence times in the presence of these nanoparticles an increment in the removal of toc and silica is expected presence of more binding sites the batch adsorption study showed a considerable enhancement in the removal of silica and toc in the presence of more mass fractions of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles anchored to the walnut shell particles however loading greater amounts of the nanoparticles 1 wt did not allow for greater removal of silica and toc in some cases the cause may be the formation of large iron hydroxide nanoparticle agglomerates over the entire surface of the walnut shell particles rather than single nanoparticles which resulted in poor dispersion of the nanoparticles on the surface and subsequent reduction in removing of both toc and silica molecules as displayed in table s4 on the other hand the presence of a great amount of hydroxide nanoparticles on the walnut shell surface as large agglomerates can either block the porous media under continuous operation or contribute to greater leaching as confirmed in table s4 hence it is not recommended to enhance the loading efficacy especially at an industrial scale accordingly the optimized ws nps was selected to be prepared at lower concentration of iron precursor 1 m lower hydrolysis temperature 80 c and less time 4 h at these conditions the optimized modified walnut shell particles contained 1 7 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles table s4 shows that testing the same ws nps in the batch adsorption led to less leaching of iron 0 42 mg g in comparison with the other samples 0 5 mg g which is an additional advantage of selecting such sample to perform the other batch and column tests fig 5 represents the toc and silica removal by walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications by acid treatment and anchorage of 1 7 wt iron hydro oxide nanoparticles in the batch sorption experiments the figure also includes a photograph of sample vials that shows the color change before and after the surface modification as seen the walnut shell particles have a high affinity towards removal of silica and toc removal 85 in the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles as the dark black color for the sagd became colorless compared with the samples obtained through employment of the non modified and acid treated walnut shell particles this clearly proved that using our modified walnut shell particles can potentially generate high quality water with low levels of both silica 30 mg l and toc 50 mg thus meeting the strict requirements in the employed boiler for steam generation accordingly replacing the non modified walnut shell particles ws vr with our modified once ws nps in the wsf should provide a replacement for the conventional treatment train in which the conventional wls wsf and wac can be substituted with one single unit after comparing the performance towards removal of silica and toc the optimized ws nps were used to construct adsorption isotherms for the silica and toc at temperature of 25 c and ph 8 90 fig 5b shows the experimental adsorption isotherms obtained for the toc and silica colored points along with their fitting with the sips model dashed lines as shown the sips model described the experimental data very well the goodness of the fit of the experimental data was also determined statistically using the non linear chi square analysis χ2 by minimizing the sum of squares of the differences between the experimental values and the predicted ones using origin pro 8 sr4 software version 8 095 the estimated χ2 values were 0 001 this low value of χ2 confirms that the sips model adequately describes the experimental data from the non linear fitting it was found that the maximum monolayer uptake for toc and silica were around 72 and 37 mg g respectively the fitting parameters obtained through fitting the experimental adsorption isotherms with the sips model are presented in table s4 as seen the obtained values for maximum monolayer adsorption uptakes qm with ws nps for the toc and silica were around 81 and 48 mg g respectively indicating that our modified walnut shell particles have great potential toward removing silica and toc simultaneously from the same table it can be also noticed that the obtained values of n with adsorbing silica and toc are close to unity which indicates a nearly langmuirian adsorption isotherm 51 53 to confirm the presence of interactions between the silica toc and the ws nps the functionality changes of the ws nps after the batch sorption tests were determined by ftir analysis and the obtained spectra for each sample was compared to a dried sagd wastewater sample sagd influent as shown in fig s6 the figure clearly shows different experimental spectra of sagd influent compared to that obtained for sagd influent removed on ws nps for the virgin sagd influent sample the infrared bands at 1595 and 1392 cm 1 were attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching bonds of the carboxylate groups coo the bands obtained at 2920 and 2820 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric ch2 stretching of the hydrocarbon present in sagd wastewater at 1302 cm 1 the obtained bands were assigned to the cn stretching also other bands obtained for sagd influent were obtained at 3250 2951 1630 1550 1400 and 1010 cm 1 representing absorption bands of hydroxyl amine methylene carbonyl and carboxylate functional groups all the aforementioned bands for the virgin sagd influent sample were attributed to the dissolved organic matter presented in the sagd wastewater represented by the total organic carbon toc term the bands at 475 and 694 cm 1 were assigned to asymmetric and symmetric bending of si o in addition other small bands obtained around 778 and 797 cm 1 were assigned to stretching symmetric si o the bending and stretching bands for si o provided evidence for the presence of silica in sagd wastewater the infrared band assigned for fe o at 586 cm 1 in ws nps appeared to be reduced and was less visible after the sorption test in ws spent confirming the functionality change after the batch sorption test experiment this functionality change was also indicated by the appearance of bands at regions of 670 and 2870 and 3250 cm 1 confirming interactions of various functional groups of toc and silica fundamentally the term toc in sagd produced water refers to soluble organics which can be classified as dissociable or non dissociable organics 54 dissociable organics are organic molecules that might be dissociated into ionic forms like phenols mono and dicarboxylic acids 55 while the non dissociable organics are the non ionic soluble oil fraction and glycols both types of soluble organics tend to form neutralized colloids at low ph or via positively charged metal ions iron hydro oxide nanoparticles dissolved silica on the other hand has many stable and unstable species that can exist under aqueous conditions soluble silica contains various silica species monomers q dimers q1 trimers q2 and polymeric silicic acid q3 as shown in fig s6 56 57 based on the medium ph and the presence of other ions the silica species are in transition among each other 56 57 with polymerization of silicic acid by condensation a three dimensional gel network of insoluble or colloidal silica amorphous silica is formed behavior in the presence of the various forms of silica is said to be anomalous meaning its stability in terms of ph does not follow a certain trend 56 57 it has been previously reported that silica species in equilibrium with the amorphous form depend on the medium ph and silica concentration which consists of two domain states of silica 56 57 the first domain is the colloidal domain which is insoluble and amorphous polymerization 56 57 while the second domain is the mono clear sodium silicate containing the forms of si oh 4 si o oh 3 and si o2 oh 2 2 up to a ph of 9 the dominant mono clear form is si oh 4 then ionization of dissolved silica species increases as ph 9 at a ph range between 9 and 11 5 the concentration of mono clear domain silica and other species is the dominant in an aqueous condition 56 57 thus in the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles the anionic species of silica tends to interact with the surface of the walnut shell particles these findings agree with some previous studies obtained by previous studies 58 60 all found that silica can form fe si fe linkages in the presence of iron and aluminum compounds 58 60 to further investigate the adsorption of silica and toc onto the surface of ws nps atomistic simulations were performed using density functional theory dft calculations details of the calculations are provided in the supporting information by presenting si oh 4 heptanoic acid c7h14o2 and cellulose as model molecules that are dominant for silica toc and ws respectively our dft calculations were performed to determine the adsorption energies of si oh 4 and heptanoic acid on the surface of our cellulose anchored with fe oh 3 cel nps compared with the bare cellulose cel vr as summarized in table 2 48 50 61 71 according to the dft calculations the adsorption energy of the c7h14o2 to the cel nps surface is 1455 kj mol compared with 73 3 kj mol for its adsorption on the cel vr similarly the adsorption energy of the si oh 4 molecule to the cel nps was determined to be 1592 kj mol while it is 427 4 kj mol for its adsorption on the bare cellulose surface these results obtained using the atomistic simulations are consistent with the experimental findings and confirming that silica and toc molecules adsorb more strongly to the surface of nanoparticle functionalized walnut shell compared with the bare walnut shell 48 50 61 71 3 3 toc and silica removal by fixed bed column breakthrough profiles for the removal of toc and silica that were obtained from the fixed bed column experiments by packing the column with ws vr and ws nps at constant initial concentrations of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l bed depth of 4 in flow rate of 10 ml min and ph 8 90 are shown in fig 6 the figure also includes the pressure drop bar against time min which were obtained through each column experiment as seen the experimental data followed the typical behavior of the breakthrough curves however the virgin walnut shell particles without iron hydroxide nanoparticles had low sorption affinity for toc and silica from sagd wastewater with estimated tb value 1 min however more effective removal of toc and silica occurred in the presence of nanoparticles with an estimated tb value of 6 min thus the toc and silica were initially removed resulting in colorless effluent samples for almost 10 min as the column operates the effluent concentration started to breakthrough ct 0 05 cin and increased until exhausted where the effluent samples tended to become darker furthermore the pressure drop measurements inside the column that confirmed the presence of nanoparticles did not significantly contribute to the pressure drop its value was less than 0 1 bar thus the presence of nanoparticles on the walnut shell surface did not cause mud balling or channeling effect before the saturation of the column during the operation these results provide robust evidence that the modified walnut shell filter media has a strong ability to improve the performance of the commercial walnut shell filter after optimizing the operational parameters these interesting results motivated us to study the effects of the other hydrodynamic loading conditions of silica and toc q co and z in the breakthrough behavior of ws nps and the mechanism controlling the mass transfer inside the column figs 7 9 show the experimental breakthrough curves btcs together with the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model dashed lines obtained for the removal of toc and silica from the column tests by varying the hydrodynamic loading parameters of q co and z all the btcs include pressure drop profiles that were obtained during the column operations the inset graphs as shown for all cases the dimensional and dimensionless btcs follow the typical shape of the btcs the dimensionless btcs fit very well with the numerical solution of the dimensionless model confirming the agreement between the experimental btcs and the suggested model tables 3 and 4 list the hydrodynamic conditions controlled during the column experiments in addition to the obtained fitting parameter pel that resulted from fitting the experimental btcs with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model eq 4 together with standard error analysis of the fitting in the form of χ 2 for the toc and silica removal inside the fixed bed column respectively as displayed in the table the obtained values of χ2 are very low confirming high levels of fitting of the experimental data with the model it can be also noted that the obtained values for fitting parameter pel are higher than unity indicating that the advection is the dominant mass transfer step during the column tests the sensitivity towards changing the obtained values of pel by varying the hydrodynamic loading conditions will be explained in the following sections 3 3 1 flow rate effect the performance of any treatment process in continuous mode is significantly affected by the flow rate in the pilot or industrial scale 58 fig 7a represents the obtained btcs for the removal of toc by changing the feed flow rate 10 20 and 30 ml min at constant bed height 10 2 cm and inlet concentration of toc 450 mg l and silica 155 mg l fig 7b shows the obtained btcs for the removal of silica under the same operational conditions the dimensionless btcs of silica and toc along with their fit with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model are also illustrated in fig 7c and d respectively all the btcs showed that the adsorption was initially very rapid and identical for any flow rate which is associated with the presence of binding sites capable of capturing all of the toc and silica molecules 38 40 the binding sites in the next step are gradually occupied and their uptake became less effective based on the provided flow rate 34 when the flow rate was increased the btc became steeper and the breakthrough time and adsorbed amount of toc and silica are reduced as shown in tables 3 and 4 inside the column the residence time for attaining the adsorption equilibrium at the high flow rate of toc and silica molecules is shorter consequently the front of the mass transfer zone reaches the bottom of the column quickly causing early saturation of the column and leaving more un adsorbed toc and silica molecules the contact time between the adsorbed molecules and ws nps is therefore shorter at high flow rates causing a significant reduction in the removal efficiency in addition enhancing the feed flow rate contributed to increasing the values of pel because of the reduction in the axial dispersion at high flow rate hence reducing the axial dispersion when the fluid velocity increases should proportionally increase the value of pel to the best of our knowledge enhancing the flow rate with similar conditions to the industrial operation 20 ml min did not significantly impact the pressure drop profiles this strongly proves that our modified walnut shell particles can be transformative to the currently applied technology 3 3 2 feed initial concentration effects the feed quality of sagd produced water significantly influences the performance of the bed inside the column thus the effect of feed initial concentrations of toc and silica on the breakthrough behavior was investigated in fig 8 such that fig 8a and b show the obtained btcs at different concentrations of toc 150 450 mg l and silica 51 6 155 mg l respectively other experimental conditions were kept constant the dimensionless btcs of silica and toc along with their fit with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model are also illustrated in fig 8c and d respectively these results demonstrate that the change in the feed concentration affects the saturation rate and breakthrough times in brief the presence of high concentrations of silica and toc accelerates the saturation of column which contains limited binding sites thus decreased inlet silica and toc concentrations provided higher treated volume since the lower concentration gradient caused slower transport due to a lower driving force this suggests that initial concentration of adsorbate affects the diffusion of adsorbate in the ws nps as a rule of thumb enhancing the driving force for the mass transfer contributes to a high rate of adsorption and axial dispersion 36 37 accordingly injecting low feed concentration of silica and toc provided higher values of pel tables 3 and 4 it is worth noting here that increasing the feed concentration had slight effect on the pressure drop profiles 3 3 3 effect of bed height to study the effect of the length of the bed on the removal performance and breakthrough behavior fixed bed experiments were conducted at different lengths 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm with unchanged feed concentration of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l and flow rate 10 ml min the experimental btcs at these conditions are shown in fig 9 fig 9a illustrates the experimental btcs of the toc while the experimental btcs of silica are shown in fig 9b as shown when the column length increases the number of binding sites tends to be higher 36 72 in such case the toc and silica molecules have more time to diffuse through the pores of the ws nps fig 9c d depict the dimensionless btcs that were obtained at different lengths 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm constant feed concentration and flow rate the same figure includes fitting of the dimensionless btcs with the numerical solution of eq 5 as shown the dimensionless breakthrough time increases as the bed capacity increases however the steepness in all cases is identical these results indicate that they have a similar axial dispersion coefficient as a result the obtained value of pel tend to increase linearly with increases in column length tables 3 and 4 by increasing the bed height the increment in the pressure drop profile was limited and insignificant 3 3 4 regeneration and recyclability fig 10 represents the recyclability of the spent ws nps q 10 ml min co toc 450 co silica 155 and z 10 6 cm that was obtained from the direct backwashing process the figure includes sorption btcs of toc fig 10a and silica fig 10b along with the pressure drop profiles that resulted from direct backwashing of the spent column with diluted naoh 0 1 mm at 30 ml min the figure also presents the desorption profiles of toc fig 10c and silica fig 10d that were achieved through backwashing the spent column fig 10a b clearly shows that the sorption breakthrough time and removal efficiency of the spent material are significantly reduced while the pressure drop increased during every backwashing cycle also longer backwashing time was obtained indicating the consumption of huge amounts of backwashing solution thus incomplete desorption of toc and silica were obtained by applying a direct backwashing method due to formation of an agglomerated oil layer that needs a high shear mixing or fluidization to be effectively removed for that reason the blade stirring method was alternatively applied to regenerate the spent ws nps worth noting here that using this regeneration method did not cause leaching of nps nor damage the structure of ws nps fig 11 shows the recyclability of the spent columns of ws np that was obtained at hydrodynamic conditions of q 10 ml min co toc 450 c o silica 155 and z 10 6 cm the figure includes the experimental btcs and pressure drop profile of silica fig 11a and toc fig 11b obtained through the regeneration of the spent ws nps as illustrated from fig s 9a and b a successful regeneration occurred through three regeneration cycles such that there was a very limited reduction in the breakthrough time and removal efficiency of recycled ws nps table 5 shows the values of tb and regeneration efficiency regeneration that is calculated as follows 8 r e g e n e r a t i o n q c y c l e q o r i g i n a l 100 as confirmed from the table the regeneration efficiency was successfully implemented for the ws nps and the regeneration efficiency was slightly influenced in fact each cycle was repeated by nearly complete removal of silica and toc for three more subsequent cycles with capture efficiencies of 100 91 5 and 81 for the subsequent cycles this supports the attaining minor or insignificant leaching with respect to the material performance as sorbent for both toc and silica the figure also confirms that the pressure drop profile was insignificantly impacted in every cycle interestingly enough these obtained results can be considered strong evidence for the replacement of the employed material with our modified one without impacting the process operating efficiency but significantly improving its removal capacity 4 conclusion with the decline in global price of crude oil and increased attention to environmental issues there has been a growing need to improve water treatment efficiencies and realize potential cost saving it is a good time to reflect on the technology used in the sagd water treatment process as existing plants are seeking to improve operating costs and uptime in some sagd sites a precipitation softening process is involved through a warm lime softening wls for silica removal followed by filtration using a walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cation exchange wac to remove the carbonated and non carbonated hardness these technologies primarily focus on water recycling at high capital and operating costs and very few of them showed effective remediation of silica and toc with a lower environmental footprint this study modified the surface of nutshell filter particles by anchoring iron hydroxide nanoparticles to the surface at various hydrolysis conditions time temperature and concentration of iron precursor and then fully characterized and tested them to measure the removal of the total organic carbon and silica in batch and fixed bed column operations compared to the virgin particles the walnut shell particles in the presence of the nanoparticles at low mass percentage showed an outstanding ability to remove toc and silica in the batch experiments the modified material performed well in removing up to 85 of silica and toc compared with the non modified nutshell filter particles that showed 5 removal efficiency while in the fixed bed column experiments and similar to the industrial operation the filter particle in presence of active nanoparticles improved the breakthrough behavior without having channeling or pressure drop limitations regeneration and recyclability of the spent column were successfully implemented through three successful cycles following direct backwashing and blade stirring methods to the best of our knowledge the efficiency of cleaning up of silica and toc obtained from our modified filter compared with the currently employed processes has not been achieved in fact we have proven that this outstanding efficiency can be reached with a simpler process a single hybrid unit can outperform three existing units wls wac and wsf in the recycling of produced water generated from sagd process this unit can be simply implemented with minor modifications to the existing units which would reduce the capital and operational costs in summary our innovative technique provides an outstanding hybrid wsf unit that would

13337,extracting alberta s bitumen by sagd requires a growing supply of steam which is mainly generated from recycled produced water pw traditionally a warm lime softener wls followed by walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cation exchange wac units have been employed to minimize the concentrations of silica toc and hardness from pw in this study we enhanced toc and silica removal in a wsf unit by modifying the surface of the walnut shell media the walnut shells were modified by anchoring low mass percentages e g 5 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles under moderate hydrolysis conditions the nanoparticle anchored walnut shell particles ws nps were fully characterized and their ability to remove toc and silica was tested using batch and column experiments in the batch tests up to 85 of silica and toc was removed in the column tests which mimicked industrial operations ws nps significantly improved the breakthrough behavior without reaching pressure drop limitations the column breakthrough behaviors were successfully described by a dimensionless advection axial dispersion model the model accurately captured the commercial breakthrough behavior indicating the possibility of scaling up the filter using a combined unit that removes silica and toc simultaneously without using wls and wac keywords surface modification hydrolysis conditions total organic carbon removal silica removal fixed bed column advection dispersion model 1 introduction there are two major methods that are currently employed for bitumen recovery from oil sands open pit mining processes and in situ thermal recovery about 80 percent of the bitumen reserves in alberta are buried too deep to mine and can only be recovered by in situ thermal recovery 1 3 in situ thermal recovery resembles the recovery of conventional oil whereby bitumen extraction is accomplished by drilling two wells and consequently injecting steam or generating heat which allows the bitumen to flow to the surface steam assisted gravity drainage sagd is one the most commonly used processes for bitumen recovery from oil sands 1 4 in principle sagd requires the drilling of two horizontal wells 2 the upper well is used for injecting the steam inside the oil well deposit the steam is used as the heat carrier latent heat to reduce the viscosity of bitumen decreasing the flow resistance of heavy oil through porous media and ultimately increasing the yield and production rate 5 therefore the mobilized bitumen along with the condensate steam are drained downward by gravity to the second horizontal well where it is pumped to the surface at the surface the recovered bitumen is separated via subsequent cooling units generating huge amounts of wastewater as produced water pw 2 5 bitumen is transferred to surface upgrading facilities converting low quality oil to synthetic crude oil pw on the other hand is transferred to subsequent de oiling and water treatment units the water treatment units through sequential water treatment steps improve the water quality to be re used for boiler feed water bfw in a once through steam generator otsg that produces steam from high quality water pw is generally characterized as having high concentrations from 1000 to 10 000 mg l of brine silica alkalines and total dissolved solids tds 6 8 table s1 displays the typical sagd produced water concentrations mg l as well as the desirable feed for otsg in the form of tds toc silica and hardness as caco3 9 11 exceeding the tabulated threshold requirement concentrations is undesirable for the reuse of pw as boiler feed water in an oilfield steam generator unless it can be effectively treated through selective water treatment technology trains 12 the generated sagd produced water must meet the strict requirements in the employed boiler for steam generation 5 9 10 13 14 otherwise boiler drum and tubes can be damaged or corroded oil sands companies in canada are therefore under endless pressure to find novel technologies to improve the technologies for recycling the pw fig 1 shows a schematic representation for the conventional treatment train that is used to improve the quality of pw as described the treatment train is composed of a warm lime softening unit wls followed by walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cationic exchange wac units in the wls the hardness calcium and magnesium ions and alkalinity are removed by adding chemicals like lime ca oh 2 soda ash na2co3 and caustic soda naoh 9 15 as a result the concentrations of silica and hardness are diminished to values of less than 50 mg l and 50 mg l caco3 respectively while the concentration of toc drops to a range of 150 300 mg l interestingly most of the silica is removed by wls through adsorption of the silica on the surface of precipitated magnesium ions 9 after the free oil content is further reduced 50 mg l by using a walnut shell filter wsf with a high concentration of divalent ions ca2 and mg2 that are gained during the wls treatment 9 15 these divalent ions are then treated by applying the weak acid cation exchanging process wac as a last step during the wac treatment wac resins e g carboxylic acid derivatives are added for the de alkalization of water 15 thus the total alkalinity carbonates and non carbonates is removed unfortunately the sequential steps in conventional sagd wastewater treatment are not completely successful in removing silica and toc especially in the wls unit tds and toc concentration levels also increase with the introduction of resins prior to wac the high level of both contaminants severely interferes with subsequent recycling of the pw because more low quality water is blown down to the otsg in fact accumulation of silica and toc results in damage and corrosion of otsg drums and tubes causing the need for large size or great number of evaporators many potential technologies e g chemical physical biological and membrane filtration have been introduced as emerging technologies to various types of oil sand process affected water ospw despite many modifications they cannot be effectively used for oil field applications to treat silica and or degrade many types of complex organic compounds 8 16 23 nowadays membrane filtration has progressively been used as an alternative option and has attracted the attention of many researchers over the last 10 years due to its high removal efficiency 8 16 23 the key parameters for the membrane filtration are selectivity and flux which tend to be influenced at high hydraulic loading rapid membrane clogging and fouling with high concentrations resulting in lower efficiency 8 16 23 in the field it has also been noted that investment maintenance and operational costs of membranes are often too high 8 16 23 in wsf a deep bed filter media commonly termed walnut shell filters are conventionally used due to their oil and solid filtration performance combined with ease of backwashing walnut shell filter media compared with other minerals and polymers has several unique characteristics e g hard lightweight chemically inert non toxic and biodegradable 21 24 these characteristics in addition to its high affinity to uptake many mineral oils have motivated its utilization as an effective filtration media when separating crude oil from water e g reducing of the toc concentration of sagd wastewater it has also been reported that the walnut shell filter effectiveness for removing heavy metals pharmaceuticals and toxic organics can be enhanced with various methods of surface modification table 1 however none of these studies have been continuously implemented via column tests or improved the depth filtration of the wsf unit toward removing of silica and toc 25 31 in our current study we are proposing an effective method to improve the deep bed filtration efficiency by enhancing the sorption capacity of the walnut shell filter particles via anchoring low mass fraction of iron hydroxide nanoparticles at the walnut shell surface to enhance the simultaneous removal efficiency of the toc and silica having low mass percentages of iron hydroxide nanoparticles will enhance the sorption affinity of the walnut shell particles without impacting the wastewater flux through the filtration process as a result sequential water treatment units for the pw can be combined in one single unit so that both silica and toc can be removed in wsf without involving wls and wac the breakthrough behavior under various loading conditions was described by using our dimensionless advection dispersion model that is able to capture the governed mass transfer phenomena under non ideal plug flow behavior the recyclability of the spent particles was investigated through direct backwashing and blade stirring methods indeed this is the first time that such a treatment approach for sagd produced water has been used thus the findings of this study could establish the stepping stone for the future nanotechnological applications in the field of produced water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials walnut shell filter aid particles and steam assisted gravity drainage wastewater samples were kindly supplied by an industrial partner in calgary alberta canada the supplied walnut shell particles have media size of 12 20 mesh 0 8 1 7 mm which is the typical walnut shell media applied in oil and gas industry for oil removal from produced water for the surface modification nitric acid hno3 70 and iron chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 97 were used both chemicals were purchased from sigma aldrich missouri usa and used as received without further treatment or purification 2 2 methods 2 2 1 walnut shell filter surface modification surface modification for the walnut shell filter particles was hydrothermally carried out at mild conditions by two successive steps the first step consisted of the reaction of walnut shell particles ws vr with diluted nitric acid hno3 10 followed by anchoring iron hydro oxide nanoparticles into the walnut shell filter particles via thermal hydrolysis reaction the walnut shell particles were acid treated by adding 50 g of the walnut shell filter particles to 70 ml of aqueous solution of nitric acid inside a 200 ml glass container that was partially sealed and placed inside the fume hood for 3 h after the acid treated walnut shell particles ws at were washed with deionized water and dried overnight under vacuum in the second step 10 g from the ws at were added to 500 ml of iron chloride hexahydrate solution fecl3 6h2o 97 under magnetic stirring for 5 h inside a sealed plastic container thermal hydrolysis was carried out at ph range from 1 5 to 3 0 by placing the container inside a pre heated furnace which allowed for the hydrothermal reaction to occur for the particles of ws at the hydrolysis reaction allowed the formation of anchored walnut shell particles with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles ws nps during the synthesis formation of iron hydroxide on the walnut shell surface was controlled by three main factors namely initial concentration of starting material iron precursor hydrolysis time and the temperature concentration of iron precursors had two levels 1 and 2 m and hydrolysis time had three levels 4 8 and 12 h temperature had two levels 80 and 100 c thus twelve individual experiments were performed for synthesis of ws nps after the hydrolysis the produced ws nps were recovered washed and dried to be characterized and tested for the removal of toc and silica 2 2 2 characterization study to visualize the surface change for the walnut shell filter particles before and after the acid treatment and anchorage of the iron hydro oxide nanoparticles a field emission quanta 250 scanning electron microscopy analysis sem was performed for the samples ws vr ws at and ws nps the sem analysis was used to confirm the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles following our anchoring procedure for the analysis a small amount of each sample was deposited over a carbon tape sample holder the holder was then tapped to release the extra amount of each sample then with a focused beam of electrons the sample generated signals forming the sem images x ray diffraction xrd was also performed for ws vr before and after surface modifications using a rigaku ultima iii x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation as the x ray source the x ray scans were performed in the range of 2 90 degrees of 2θ using a 0 05 degree step and a counting time of 1 0 degree per min operating at 40 kv and 44 ma to obtain the full diffractogram for the analyzed material the results are obtained in the form of x ray patterns the obtained peaks were analyzed by jade software to estimate the full width at half maximum fwhm jade software provides fitting of the experimental profile to a pseudo voigt profile function allowing the computation of the crystalline domain sizes by scherer equation the surface area and pore size distribution of the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications were characterized by performing bruneur emmett teller bet analysis the analysis was carried out by a surface area and porosity analyzer tristar ii 3020 micromeritics instrument corporation norcross ga before the analysis the dried samples were pre treated inside sample holder cells under flow of nitrogen gas and simultaneously heated to 423 k overnight then the pre treated samples were submitted to the adsorption desorption by nitrogen at 77 k and to produce the physisorption isotherms to further investigate the micro porosity the bet tests were also performed by submitting the same samples to physisorption of carbon dioxide at 273 k carbon dioxide has more advantageous kinetics than nitrogen because of its lower molecular size that allows faster diffusion through the pore network and consequently easier access to the micropores furthermore fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analysis was conducted for the three samples using an iraffinity 1s instrument shimadzu corporation to confirm that walnut shell surface was successfully anchored with iron hydroxide nanoparticles the ftir was operated in the diffuse reflectance mode in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 with a 4 cm 1 resolution and for an average of 50 scans for the analysis potassium bromide kbr was used for dispersing the powder sample 2 mg per 200 mg 1 wt wt then the iron content of each sample was quantified by a microwave assisted acid digestion mars analysis that was followed by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes thermo scientific icap series for mars analysis a commercial procedure was used as implemented by the unit model mars 6 from cem cooperation mathews nc usa for the analysis each solid sample i e ws vr ws at and ws nps was weighted and mixed with 10 ml hno3 70 inside 100 m l vessel then the content of each vessel was digested inside the mars unit that operates at a frequency of 2 45 ghz at 100 of full power maximum of 1600 w after the acid digestion the concentrations of iron and silica for each sample were measured by the icp oes the method used to build calibration curves for the iron and silica was dashboard icap 7200 with asx560 using iron and silica standard solutions that were purchased from sigma aldrich at purities of 99 5 and 98 respectively 2 2 3 toc and silica removal by batch process the toc and silica removal from a real sagd wastewater sample was tested for the materials of the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications by using a batch mode of adsorption each experiment was performed by adding 100 mg of each material to a series of 25 ml glass vials filled with 10 ml of sagd wastewater solution with initial concentrations of silica and toc of 155 and 450 mg l respectively then the vials were sealed and placed in a wrist action shaker burrel model 75 bb for 4 h which was enough time to attain the equilibrium after the vials were left overnight on the lab bench at room temperature to allow the tested materials to settle down after settling the sorbent particles all vials were centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm in an eppendorf centrifuge 5804 to separate the residuals after the batch adsorption experiments the residual concentration of toc was measured using a shimadzu toc toc l cph cpn analyzer while the residual concentrations of silica and iron were measured by icp oes thermo scieintific icap 7000 series icp oes ontario canada and x ray fluorescence xrf marlven panalytical spectris canada inc 4921 place olivia st laurent canada measuring the residual concentration of iron allowed us to determine the quantity of iron hydroxide nanoparticles leached out at the end of each batch test while the percentage removal removal of silica and toc for each sample was calculated as follows 1 r e m o v a l c i n c f c i n 100 where cin and cf are the initial and final concentrations mg l respectively additionally the adsorbed amount qe in mg g was determined by applying the mass balance as follows 2 q e v m c i n c e where v m and ce are the volume of solution ml the mass of adsorbent g and the equilibrium concentration mg l respectively the maximum adsorption capacity in addition to the kinetic parameters for the removal of silica and toc were determined by performing batch adsorption experiments at various dosages of ws nps the obtained equilibria data were plotted to estimate the batch adsorption isotherm the adsorption isotherm data were described by the sips model 34 commonly known as freundlich langmuir combined model represented by the following equation 3 q e k q m c e n 1 k c e n where k qm and n are sips equilibrium constant l mg n maximum adsorption capacity mg g and heterogeneity coefficient dimensionless that express the sensitivity of the model towards langmuir or freundlich tendency respectively 34 the sips equation has been derived to rigorously calculate the distribution of the adsorption energies of the sites of a catalyst surface when the adsorption isotherms are known if the adsorption is localized and there are no interactions 34 thus sips model can be utilized to a freundlich isotherm and also to a new theoretical isotherm which reduces to the freundlich type for low concentration but exhibits saturation for high concentration 34 it is worth noting here that the value of heterogeneity coefficient for all the physical cases must lie between zero and unity 34 accordingly the duality of sips equation is apparent as it approaches the langmuir model as n approaches 1 implying homogeneity or freundlich as n approaches zero implying heterogenicity 34 2 2 4 fixed bed column toc and silica removal after performing the batch adsorption tests the walnut shell particles were also tested for silica and toc removal before and after modifying the surface with low mass fraction of nanoparticles in a continuous flow mode using a fixed bed column a schematic representation of the experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the column setup was primarily composed of a packed bed column pressure transducers peristaltic pump and influent and effluent tanks the column and tubes were made of 316 stainless steel the column had a diameter of 1 cm and various lengths i e 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm two pressure transducers located at the inlet and outlet of the column were connected to a computer where the pressure drop in the column was recorded throughout the experiments the direction of flow through the column was controlled via a series of valves at the effluent a needle valve was installed for sampling the watson marlow qdos 60 peristaltic pump used was a manual pump with 7 atm 100 psi santoprene renu pumphead before each experiment the column was supported and closely packed from the bottom and top with a 120 mesh 125 μm filter the column was filled with each material ws vr and w nps individually until it obtained the desired length after filling the column was initially flushed with deionized water and each experiment was started by providing a uniform flow rate to the column from the top the effluent was collected periodically from the bottom of the column during each experiment and the toc and silica concentrations of each sample were measured by the toc and icp oes at different time intervals the obtained concentration values were presented in the form of breakthrough curves for each material and compared in terms of breakthrough time and removal efficiency the breakthrough time was obtained when the effluent concentration ct was approximately equal 0 05 of the influent concentration cin each experiment was stopped based on the differential pressure achieved or the effluent wastewater quality the flux was selected based on a typical flux of the industrial scale walnut shell filter that has a typical diameter of 4 26 m 14 ft and operates under minimum flux of 0 067m3 s 1077 02 gpm 26 to mimic the flow through the commercial filter dimensionless number analysis was applied for the column to determine the column running flow regime assuming that the physical properties for the wastewater were similar to that for water at 25 c and porosity of the walnut shell particles was 0 7 the obtained reynold number re was determined to be 13 with this re the column as a pilot scale for the commercial filter should operate at a minimum flow rate of 22 5 ml min accordingly the column tests were performed at volumetric flow rates q of 10 20 and 30 ml min with constant initial concentrations of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l and a bed depth of 8 cm for industrial purposes the quality of the sagd produced water was also considered as an important hydrodynamic parameter thus the change in the inlet concentrations of silica and toc was focused in the column study such that the inlet toc concentration was 450 225 and 150 mg l while the inlet concentration of silica was 155 77 5 51 6 mg l furthermore our column study included the bed height z effect on the breakthrough behavior with bed heights of 4 6 10 in i e 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm after the toc and silica concentration measurements the experimental data were presented in the form of breakthrough curves btcs the btcs are typically used to describe the variation in effluent influent concentrations of the silica or toc against time in each btc the time at which the effluent concentration approaches 5 of the influent concentration is arbitrarily identified as breakthrough time tb which is considered as one of the most characteristic parameters in the column tests 35 the obtained btc can be also used to estimate other characteristic parameters which are listed in table s2 the listed parameters in table s2 are valuable in determining the performance of the walnut shell before and after loading it with nanoparticles to remove the silica and toc however investigating the parameters cannot accurately estimate the degree of curvature and symmetry of the breakthrough curves when it is subjected to different hydrodynamic and operational conditions such as the initial flow rate inlet concentration and bed height at the pilot scale 35 in fact the shape and behavior of the breakthrough curve suffers from various factors such as mass transfer resistance flow rate equilibrium time and adsorption mechanisms 35 fundamentally prediction of long term filtration performance through a full scale depth filtration system is not effective due to several assumptions 35 first the models are derived based on ideal interactions between spherical pollutant particles with spherical filter grain second hydrodynamic variability and the operating conditions in the filtration theory add more complexity third the filtration coefficient cannot be predicted as a single value for the whole depth of the filter which changes with either time or depth fourth the fundamental depth filtration theory does not include the sorption or accumulation of the pollutant particles on the grain filter media the most common approach in deep bed filtration modeling is the classical colloid filtration theory that was developed by yao et al 1971 who presented a basic model for wastewater treatment application based on the accumulation of the pollutant particles on single filter grain collector 25 however the generation or loss of particles as well as the diffusion into and out of the control volume is ignored compared to the convection term also growing the filter media particles through the filtration due to sorption or depositing behavior of the contaminated particle is not considered 35 thus the basic mechanism for transporting and attaching the particles to the media is not accurately presented especially if there are binding sites available on the grain surface when the filter operates this subsequently leads to unclear transport phenomena of the pollutant particles inside the filter as a result of sedimentation interception and diffusion 35 tufkenji et al 2005 have discovered a significant deviation from the classical colloid filtration theory due to presence of deposition behavior 36 they proposed a well controlled experimental system to examine the deposition behavior of uniform particles within a column packed with a glass bead collector over a wide range of physiochemical conditions 36 to account for the deviations from the classical filtration theory the sorption and diffusion of the pollutant particles to the collectors should be included into the differential elements over the control volume of the column thus including the sorption inside the bed under continuous operation can be possible with many mathematical models that take into account i film diffusion through the laminar layer of liquid on the external surface of an adsorbent particle ii pore or surface diffusion within the porous structure of the adsorbent iii internal surface reaction 37 the internal surface reaction is generally fast hence the first or second steps are the rate limiting steps it is experimentally difficult to determine whether the first or second is the dominant step since the dominant mass transfer step can be influenced by the operational parameters along the column in many previous studies various mass transfer models have been widely used to describe the phenomena controlling the rate limiting steps 37 40 however these models either assume the presence of an ideal plug flow behavior or ignore the axial dispersion effect 34 by considering the axial dispersion the dominant mass transfer phenomena along the column can be determined especially with variation of the hydrodynamic conditions and rate of adsorption 34 an advection axial dispersion model has shown some satisfactory results in the prediction of the breakthrough behavior of different nanoparticle based adsorbents under various operational conditions after converting to the dimensionless form the model also successfully described the dominant mass transfer mechanism along the column with smaller number of geometrical and phenomenological variables 41 as reported in our previous work 41 the dimensionless advection axial dispersion takes the following form 4 2 c η 2 p e m c η 1 r 2 c t ρ b n k q m c i n c n 1 r 1 k c i n c n 2 c t 0 0 η 1 0 t where ρ b is the bulk density of the walnut shell kg m3 and k qm cin and n are the kinetic parameters obtained from the batch experiments the other dimensionless parameters presented in eq 4 are listed in table s3 also the initial and boundary conditions that are used to describe the process in eq 4 are 5 c 0 0 η l l t 0 6 1 c 1 p e m c η 0 η 0 0 t 7 c η 0 η l l 0 t eq 4 was solved numerically by using wolfram mathematica package v 10 2 the numerical solution of the pde found using the ndsolve command and by applying the method of lines was fit to the experimental data in every breakthrough data set the best numerical solution was obtained by minimizing the sum square of the difference between the experimental data and numerical solution 42 the peclet number over the characteristic length p e m is the fitting parameter obtained from fitting the experimental breakthrough data with the numerical solution then by calculating peclet number over the real length of the column p e l the dominant mechanism responsible for mass transfer phenomena inside the column could be determined 41 2 2 5 recyclability and regeneration backwashing of the filtration media is a necessary and critical step in the real field the regeneration of the walnut shell filter is part of the filtration cycle and can be triggered by one of the following 1 the quality of the water outlet 2 the pressure drop profile and 3 the pre set time for the filtration stage in many deep filtration sites the backwash is either performed inside the same vessel or in a separate vessel 43 however direct backwashing of the saturated walnut shell filtration column is not easy and requires a huge amount of energy and fresh water since the oil does not directly get adsorbed in the media and tends to be agglomerated forming mud balling thus injecting fresh water in a direction opposite to that of the filtration stage even at high volumetric flow rate is not sufficient in fact every cycle requires agitation of the complete bed of the media in a violent turbulent fashion recently three backwashing modes have been reported to regenerate the dirty walnut shell media from the oilfield wastewater filter fluidization hydraulic swirling and blade stirring 43 the results showed that blade stirring compared with the other backwashing methods is the most effective backwashing method with the least water consumption we have thus performed the regeneration by two methods direct backwashing and blade stirring the direct backwashing was done by reverse injecting a very diluted sodium hydroxide solution 1 mm to the spent filter at high flow rate this experiment was done on the spent column that was obtained at q 10 ml min z 4 in co toc 155 and co silica 450 mg l after a certain time attaining clean samples from the outlet the backwashing stopped and the flow reversed for the second cycle with the original sagd produced water sample at the same conditions after saturation the column stopped and the same backwashing procedure was repeated for three regeneration cycles furthermore the blade stirring method was also applied in our regeneration study for spent filter that was obtained at q 10 ml min z 6 in co toc 155 and co silica 450 mg l the blade stirring regeneration method was conducted by recovering the spent material after shutting down the column prior to the recovery the spent ws nps was soaked with 40 ml sodium hydroxide 0 1 mm at ph 6 and stirred by the mixer at 500 rpm for 5 min inside a 50 ml plastic bottle the recovered material was then filtered under a vacuum and washed 3 times with fresh water to be reused for the next cycle during the next cycle the column was run at the same operational parameters as the first cycle and the clean water was periodically collected till the column was saturated the same regeneration procedure was repeated for the second and third regeneration cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization study sem images for the walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications are shown in fig s1a d as seen the surface went through some changes after modifying it with acid fig s1b and anchorage with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles fig s1c d before surface modifications amorphous and compact structure is mainly observed as a result of high contents of cellulose and hemicellulose inert layers fig s1a presented on the walnut shell particle surface 44 in fact the pores on the untreated walnut shell particles were fused and not developed however with acid treatment of the particles insignificant reduction in the ash content 0 01 0 3 is achieved as a result of removing the outer inert surface layers which thereby allowed to form well developed surfaces with open macropores and macro porous cavities fig s1b 44 the presence of these macropores created the possibility of providing anchoring and diffusion sites to accommodate the iron hydroxide nanoparticles which are clearly presented in nanoscales in fig s1c these iron hydroxide nanoparticles appear as agglomerates of small spherical particles with diameters ranging from 1 to 60 nm dispersed on the surface of the treated walnut shell particles xrd patterns of walnut shell particles before ws vr and after surface modifications ws at and ws nps are presented in fig s2 the obtained diffraction peaks for ws vr do not reflect anything beyond the low crystallinity walnut shell xrd pattern in fact broadening and intensities of the obtained diffraction signals were not significantly affected by the hydrothermal treatment of the ws vr also no diffraction peaks corresponding to the iron hydroxide nanoparticles were observed probably due to its high dispersion and low mass fraction with respect to the walnut shell particles consistent with our previous sem results thus anchorage of iron hydroxide nanoparticles at low mass fraction of the ws vr did not alter the morphological structure of the synthesized ws nps however anchorage of iron hydroxide slightly altered the surface area and porosity of the walnut shell filter particles before surface modification low temperature measurements of surface area and porosity were performed for ws vr by n2 unfortunately the measurements did not exhibit any adsorption desorption isotherms in fact the neat walnut shell particles similar to coals and many activated carbons are microporous the entry and accessibility of the n2 molecules at 77 k in these narrow micropores is kinetically restricted due to the low rate of diffusion of the sorbed molecules alternatively we used co2 as suggested by some authors to characterize the micropores presented in the ws vr 45 fig s3 shows the co2 adsorption isotherm and pore size distribution insets estimated by dubinin astakhov for the ws vr fig s2a ws at fig s2b and ws nps fig s2c 45 as shown successful co2 adsorption was achieved at 298 k for the ws vr with bet surface area around 66 m2 g the figure clearly shows that the major distribution of the pore size was around 14 å 2 nm confirming the micro porosity of these particles after acid treatment the adsorption of co2 molecules by the microporous surface tend to be slightly enhanced with bet surface area of 79 m2 g and major distribution of the pore size around 16 å as shown in fig s2b thus treating the structure of the walnut shell particles allowed to create more pores with widened pore sizes toward meso and macro ranges anchoring of 1 7 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles to the surface of ws at on the other hand contributed in slightly reducing the microporous surface area up to 59 m2 g with major distribution of pore size around 17 å fig s2 c this confirms that the narrow pores were partially blocked by the iron hydroxide particles during the synthesis ftir measurements were performed for the same samples i e ws vr ws at and ws nps to confirm the anchoring of iron hydroxide nanoparticles on the walnut shell particle surface at framework of 400 4000 cm 1 see fig s3 a wide band with maximum intensity at wavenumber of 3405 cm 1 was obtained for the three signals assigned to the stretching of oh group of macromolecular association also significant bands were obtained at around 2925 and 2854 cm 1 at different intensities these bands represent the stretching of methylene group bonds presented in the walnut shell structure however the broadness of this band was reduced for the walnut shell particles after acid treatment and the anchoring of nanoparticles before anchoring of nanoparticles a sharp band can be observed at 1708 cm 1 and another at 1622 cm 1 indicating the stretching vibration of a carboxylic acid involved in an intermolecular hydrogen bond in addition another sharp peak for ws vr that appears at 1510 and 1458 cm 1 is assigned to the cc ring stretch of aromatic rings several bands ranging from 1319 to 1051 cm 1 refer to co bonding of phenols this splitting pattern is characteristic of several different co bonding of different phenols confirming the presence of tannins polyphenolic biomolecules from these results it can be confirmed that the metallic ions bind to walnut shell particle through interaction with the active oh of phenolic groups as well as carboxylic acids through the addition of acid the nitric acid removes an outer layer of the walnut shell particles to expose the pores which provides more surface area with oh and cooh functional groups to react with the iron complexes during hydrolysis thus it is believed that the acid treatment effectively removes a relatively inert surface layer of the walnut shell to expose a porous surface which increases the surface area of the outer layer thereby exposing greater quantities of carboxylic acids and phenolic groups that can react with the nanoparticles for that purpose the walnut shell surface was treated with acid before surface functionalization with nanoparticles and with surface treatment the band observed at 2925 2854 1708 and 1622 cm 1 tends to diminish due to a reduction in carboxylic acid groups for ws nps a vibration band was obtained at 586 cm 1 that represents fe o providing evidence for the successful anchoring of walnut shell particles with iron hydro oxide nanoparticles to gain better insights into the anchoring mechanism of the iron cations and the oxygenated walnut shell surface the hydrolysis conditions at which the iron hydro oxide is formed is described in fig 3 generally when the ferric salt is dissociated to ferric ions a number of parallel and sequential reactions are carried out 35 46 the iron iii cations tend to form hexa aqueous complexes f e o h 2 6 3 as per reaction 1 47 r1 f e c l 3 6 h 2 o s f e o h 2 6 3 a q 3 c l a q such that water molecules form a coordinate bond with metal cation the formed hexa aqueous complexes pass through a series of hydrolytic reactions as illustrated on fig 3 which give rise to the formation of variety of soluble mono clear and precipitate species 35 46 these species are generated due to reduction of the oh bonds in the coordinated water molecules which tend to act as bronsted acids in the aqueous solution proton donors 35 46 thus the h2o ligands presented in the aquo complex tend to be ultimately deprotonated in a step wise process to form other mono clear soluble i e f e o h o h 2 5 2 and f e o h 2 o h 2 4 and precipitate i e fe oh 3 species as presented in fig 4 hence it is uncertain to determine which species are involved in anchoring the hydroxylated particles i e ws at according to some previous studies two possible scenarios can be suggested to represent the interaction between the formed species and the hydroxylated particles i e ws at 35 46 in the first scenario interaction of hydroxylated particles can be achieved with any mono clear species by forming oxygenated bridges through a nucleophilic substitution mechanism as suggested by nieto delgado and rangel mendez 2012 47 on the other hand zhu et al 2020 48 have proposed that the precipitate species of iron hydroxide fe oh 3 can be bounded to the hydroxylated surface by bidentate adsorption as schematically presented in fig 4 the authors have proven via experimental and theoretical dft calculations that the interaction between fe oh 3 s and a hydroxylated surface of bastnaesite occurs through the bidentate adsorption 48 this bidentate adsorption will lead to the reduction of active sites two rare earth cation sites may be reduced to one ferric ion site according to such mechanism the fe oh 3 nanoparticles chemically adsorb onto the hydroxylated surfaces and form a more stable and reactive structure 48 50 which allows the surface to remove silica and toc simultaneously as will be discussed in the next sections 3 2 removal of toc and silica by batch adsorption the weight percentages of iron anchored on the walnut shell particles after controlling the factors of initial concentration of iron precursor hydrolysis temperature and time are listed in table s4 the mass fraction of iron on the modified walnut shell particles ws pns against the hydrolysis temperature at times of 4 8 and 12 h when the ws nps was prepared at different concentrations of iron precursor are shown in fig s5 a b as seen the mass fraction of anchored iron hydroxide nanoparticles increased with hydrolysis time as the hydrolysis reaction provides a higher conversion of iron hydro oxide at high residence times in the presence of these nanoparticles an increment in the removal of toc and silica is expected presence of more binding sites the batch adsorption study showed a considerable enhancement in the removal of silica and toc in the presence of more mass fractions of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles anchored to the walnut shell particles however loading greater amounts of the nanoparticles 1 wt did not allow for greater removal of silica and toc in some cases the cause may be the formation of large iron hydroxide nanoparticle agglomerates over the entire surface of the walnut shell particles rather than single nanoparticles which resulted in poor dispersion of the nanoparticles on the surface and subsequent reduction in removing of both toc and silica molecules as displayed in table s4 on the other hand the presence of a great amount of hydroxide nanoparticles on the walnut shell surface as large agglomerates can either block the porous media under continuous operation or contribute to greater leaching as confirmed in table s4 hence it is not recommended to enhance the loading efficacy especially at an industrial scale accordingly the optimized ws nps was selected to be prepared at lower concentration of iron precursor 1 m lower hydrolysis temperature 80 c and less time 4 h at these conditions the optimized modified walnut shell particles contained 1 7 wt of iron hydroxide nanoparticles table s4 shows that testing the same ws nps in the batch adsorption led to less leaching of iron 0 42 mg g in comparison with the other samples 0 5 mg g which is an additional advantage of selecting such sample to perform the other batch and column tests fig 5 represents the toc and silica removal by walnut shell particles before and after surface modifications by acid treatment and anchorage of 1 7 wt iron hydro oxide nanoparticles in the batch sorption experiments the figure also includes a photograph of sample vials that shows the color change before and after the surface modification as seen the walnut shell particles have a high affinity towards removal of silica and toc removal 85 in the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles as the dark black color for the sagd became colorless compared with the samples obtained through employment of the non modified and acid treated walnut shell particles this clearly proved that using our modified walnut shell particles can potentially generate high quality water with low levels of both silica 30 mg l and toc 50 mg thus meeting the strict requirements in the employed boiler for steam generation accordingly replacing the non modified walnut shell particles ws vr with our modified once ws nps in the wsf should provide a replacement for the conventional treatment train in which the conventional wls wsf and wac can be substituted with one single unit after comparing the performance towards removal of silica and toc the optimized ws nps were used to construct adsorption isotherms for the silica and toc at temperature of 25 c and ph 8 90 fig 5b shows the experimental adsorption isotherms obtained for the toc and silica colored points along with their fitting with the sips model dashed lines as shown the sips model described the experimental data very well the goodness of the fit of the experimental data was also determined statistically using the non linear chi square analysis χ2 by minimizing the sum of squares of the differences between the experimental values and the predicted ones using origin pro 8 sr4 software version 8 095 the estimated χ2 values were 0 001 this low value of χ2 confirms that the sips model adequately describes the experimental data from the non linear fitting it was found that the maximum monolayer uptake for toc and silica were around 72 and 37 mg g respectively the fitting parameters obtained through fitting the experimental adsorption isotherms with the sips model are presented in table s4 as seen the obtained values for maximum monolayer adsorption uptakes qm with ws nps for the toc and silica were around 81 and 48 mg g respectively indicating that our modified walnut shell particles have great potential toward removing silica and toc simultaneously from the same table it can be also noticed that the obtained values of n with adsorbing silica and toc are close to unity which indicates a nearly langmuirian adsorption isotherm 51 53 to confirm the presence of interactions between the silica toc and the ws nps the functionality changes of the ws nps after the batch sorption tests were determined by ftir analysis and the obtained spectra for each sample was compared to a dried sagd wastewater sample sagd influent as shown in fig s6 the figure clearly shows different experimental spectra of sagd influent compared to that obtained for sagd influent removed on ws nps for the virgin sagd influent sample the infrared bands at 1595 and 1392 cm 1 were attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching bonds of the carboxylate groups coo the bands obtained at 2920 and 2820 cm 1 were attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric ch2 stretching of the hydrocarbon present in sagd wastewater at 1302 cm 1 the obtained bands were assigned to the cn stretching also other bands obtained for sagd influent were obtained at 3250 2951 1630 1550 1400 and 1010 cm 1 representing absorption bands of hydroxyl amine methylene carbonyl and carboxylate functional groups all the aforementioned bands for the virgin sagd influent sample were attributed to the dissolved organic matter presented in the sagd wastewater represented by the total organic carbon toc term the bands at 475 and 694 cm 1 were assigned to asymmetric and symmetric bending of si o in addition other small bands obtained around 778 and 797 cm 1 were assigned to stretching symmetric si o the bending and stretching bands for si o provided evidence for the presence of silica in sagd wastewater the infrared band assigned for fe o at 586 cm 1 in ws nps appeared to be reduced and was less visible after the sorption test in ws spent confirming the functionality change after the batch sorption test experiment this functionality change was also indicated by the appearance of bands at regions of 670 and 2870 and 3250 cm 1 confirming interactions of various functional groups of toc and silica fundamentally the term toc in sagd produced water refers to soluble organics which can be classified as dissociable or non dissociable organics 54 dissociable organics are organic molecules that might be dissociated into ionic forms like phenols mono and dicarboxylic acids 55 while the non dissociable organics are the non ionic soluble oil fraction and glycols both types of soluble organics tend to form neutralized colloids at low ph or via positively charged metal ions iron hydro oxide nanoparticles dissolved silica on the other hand has many stable and unstable species that can exist under aqueous conditions soluble silica contains various silica species monomers q dimers q1 trimers q2 and polymeric silicic acid q3 as shown in fig s6 56 57 based on the medium ph and the presence of other ions the silica species are in transition among each other 56 57 with polymerization of silicic acid by condensation a three dimensional gel network of insoluble or colloidal silica amorphous silica is formed behavior in the presence of the various forms of silica is said to be anomalous meaning its stability in terms of ph does not follow a certain trend 56 57 it has been previously reported that silica species in equilibrium with the amorphous form depend on the medium ph and silica concentration which consists of two domain states of silica 56 57 the first domain is the colloidal domain which is insoluble and amorphous polymerization 56 57 while the second domain is the mono clear sodium silicate containing the forms of si oh 4 si o oh 3 and si o2 oh 2 2 up to a ph of 9 the dominant mono clear form is si oh 4 then ionization of dissolved silica species increases as ph 9 at a ph range between 9 and 11 5 the concentration of mono clear domain silica and other species is the dominant in an aqueous condition 56 57 thus in the presence of iron hydro oxide nanoparticles the anionic species of silica tends to interact with the surface of the walnut shell particles these findings agree with some previous studies obtained by previous studies 58 60 all found that silica can form fe si fe linkages in the presence of iron and aluminum compounds 58 60 to further investigate the adsorption of silica and toc onto the surface of ws nps atomistic simulations were performed using density functional theory dft calculations details of the calculations are provided in the supporting information by presenting si oh 4 heptanoic acid c7h14o2 and cellulose as model molecules that are dominant for silica toc and ws respectively our dft calculations were performed to determine the adsorption energies of si oh 4 and heptanoic acid on the surface of our cellulose anchored with fe oh 3 cel nps compared with the bare cellulose cel vr as summarized in table 2 48 50 61 71 according to the dft calculations the adsorption energy of the c7h14o2 to the cel nps surface is 1455 kj mol compared with 73 3 kj mol for its adsorption on the cel vr similarly the adsorption energy of the si oh 4 molecule to the cel nps was determined to be 1592 kj mol while it is 427 4 kj mol for its adsorption on the bare cellulose surface these results obtained using the atomistic simulations are consistent with the experimental findings and confirming that silica and toc molecules adsorb more strongly to the surface of nanoparticle functionalized walnut shell compared with the bare walnut shell 48 50 61 71 3 3 toc and silica removal by fixed bed column breakthrough profiles for the removal of toc and silica that were obtained from the fixed bed column experiments by packing the column with ws vr and ws nps at constant initial concentrations of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l bed depth of 4 in flow rate of 10 ml min and ph 8 90 are shown in fig 6 the figure also includes the pressure drop bar against time min which were obtained through each column experiment as seen the experimental data followed the typical behavior of the breakthrough curves however the virgin walnut shell particles without iron hydroxide nanoparticles had low sorption affinity for toc and silica from sagd wastewater with estimated tb value 1 min however more effective removal of toc and silica occurred in the presence of nanoparticles with an estimated tb value of 6 min thus the toc and silica were initially removed resulting in colorless effluent samples for almost 10 min as the column operates the effluent concentration started to breakthrough ct 0 05 cin and increased until exhausted where the effluent samples tended to become darker furthermore the pressure drop measurements inside the column that confirmed the presence of nanoparticles did not significantly contribute to the pressure drop its value was less than 0 1 bar thus the presence of nanoparticles on the walnut shell surface did not cause mud balling or channeling effect before the saturation of the column during the operation these results provide robust evidence that the modified walnut shell filter media has a strong ability to improve the performance of the commercial walnut shell filter after optimizing the operational parameters these interesting results motivated us to study the effects of the other hydrodynamic loading conditions of silica and toc q co and z in the breakthrough behavior of ws nps and the mechanism controlling the mass transfer inside the column figs 7 9 show the experimental breakthrough curves btcs together with the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model dashed lines obtained for the removal of toc and silica from the column tests by varying the hydrodynamic loading parameters of q co and z all the btcs include pressure drop profiles that were obtained during the column operations the inset graphs as shown for all cases the dimensional and dimensionless btcs follow the typical shape of the btcs the dimensionless btcs fit very well with the numerical solution of the dimensionless model confirming the agreement between the experimental btcs and the suggested model tables 3 and 4 list the hydrodynamic conditions controlled during the column experiments in addition to the obtained fitting parameter pel that resulted from fitting the experimental btcs with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model eq 4 together with standard error analysis of the fitting in the form of χ 2 for the toc and silica removal inside the fixed bed column respectively as displayed in the table the obtained values of χ2 are very low confirming high levels of fitting of the experimental data with the model it can be also noted that the obtained values for fitting parameter pel are higher than unity indicating that the advection is the dominant mass transfer step during the column tests the sensitivity towards changing the obtained values of pel by varying the hydrodynamic loading conditions will be explained in the following sections 3 3 1 flow rate effect the performance of any treatment process in continuous mode is significantly affected by the flow rate in the pilot or industrial scale 58 fig 7a represents the obtained btcs for the removal of toc by changing the feed flow rate 10 20 and 30 ml min at constant bed height 10 2 cm and inlet concentration of toc 450 mg l and silica 155 mg l fig 7b shows the obtained btcs for the removal of silica under the same operational conditions the dimensionless btcs of silica and toc along with their fit with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model are also illustrated in fig 7c and d respectively all the btcs showed that the adsorption was initially very rapid and identical for any flow rate which is associated with the presence of binding sites capable of capturing all of the toc and silica molecules 38 40 the binding sites in the next step are gradually occupied and their uptake became less effective based on the provided flow rate 34 when the flow rate was increased the btc became steeper and the breakthrough time and adsorbed amount of toc and silica are reduced as shown in tables 3 and 4 inside the column the residence time for attaining the adsorption equilibrium at the high flow rate of toc and silica molecules is shorter consequently the front of the mass transfer zone reaches the bottom of the column quickly causing early saturation of the column and leaving more un adsorbed toc and silica molecules the contact time between the adsorbed molecules and ws nps is therefore shorter at high flow rates causing a significant reduction in the removal efficiency in addition enhancing the feed flow rate contributed to increasing the values of pel because of the reduction in the axial dispersion at high flow rate hence reducing the axial dispersion when the fluid velocity increases should proportionally increase the value of pel to the best of our knowledge enhancing the flow rate with similar conditions to the industrial operation 20 ml min did not significantly impact the pressure drop profiles this strongly proves that our modified walnut shell particles can be transformative to the currently applied technology 3 3 2 feed initial concentration effects the feed quality of sagd produced water significantly influences the performance of the bed inside the column thus the effect of feed initial concentrations of toc and silica on the breakthrough behavior was investigated in fig 8 such that fig 8a and b show the obtained btcs at different concentrations of toc 150 450 mg l and silica 51 6 155 mg l respectively other experimental conditions were kept constant the dimensionless btcs of silica and toc along with their fit with the numerical solution of the dimensionless advection axial dispersion model are also illustrated in fig 8c and d respectively these results demonstrate that the change in the feed concentration affects the saturation rate and breakthrough times in brief the presence of high concentrations of silica and toc accelerates the saturation of column which contains limited binding sites thus decreased inlet silica and toc concentrations provided higher treated volume since the lower concentration gradient caused slower transport due to a lower driving force this suggests that initial concentration of adsorbate affects the diffusion of adsorbate in the ws nps as a rule of thumb enhancing the driving force for the mass transfer contributes to a high rate of adsorption and axial dispersion 36 37 accordingly injecting low feed concentration of silica and toc provided higher values of pel tables 3 and 4 it is worth noting here that increasing the feed concentration had slight effect on the pressure drop profiles 3 3 3 effect of bed height to study the effect of the length of the bed on the removal performance and breakthrough behavior fixed bed experiments were conducted at different lengths 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm with unchanged feed concentration of silica 155 mg l and toc 450 mg l and flow rate 10 ml min the experimental btcs at these conditions are shown in fig 9 fig 9a illustrates the experimental btcs of the toc while the experimental btcs of silica are shown in fig 9b as shown when the column length increases the number of binding sites tends to be higher 36 72 in such case the toc and silica molecules have more time to diffuse through the pores of the ws nps fig 9c d depict the dimensionless btcs that were obtained at different lengths 10 2 15 2 and 25 4 cm constant feed concentration and flow rate the same figure includes fitting of the dimensionless btcs with the numerical solution of eq 5 as shown the dimensionless breakthrough time increases as the bed capacity increases however the steepness in all cases is identical these results indicate that they have a similar axial dispersion coefficient as a result the obtained value of pel tend to increase linearly with increases in column length tables 3 and 4 by increasing the bed height the increment in the pressure drop profile was limited and insignificant 3 3 4 regeneration and recyclability fig 10 represents the recyclability of the spent ws nps q 10 ml min co toc 450 co silica 155 and z 10 6 cm that was obtained from the direct backwashing process the figure includes sorption btcs of toc fig 10a and silica fig 10b along with the pressure drop profiles that resulted from direct backwashing of the spent column with diluted naoh 0 1 mm at 30 ml min the figure also presents the desorption profiles of toc fig 10c and silica fig 10d that were achieved through backwashing the spent column fig 10a b clearly shows that the sorption breakthrough time and removal efficiency of the spent material are significantly reduced while the pressure drop increased during every backwashing cycle also longer backwashing time was obtained indicating the consumption of huge amounts of backwashing solution thus incomplete desorption of toc and silica were obtained by applying a direct backwashing method due to formation of an agglomerated oil layer that needs a high shear mixing or fluidization to be effectively removed for that reason the blade stirring method was alternatively applied to regenerate the spent ws nps worth noting here that using this regeneration method did not cause leaching of

the figure includes the experimental btcs and pressure drop profile of silica fig 11a and toc fig 11b obtained through the regeneration of the spent ws nps as illustrated from fig s 9a and b a successful regeneration occurred through three regeneration cycles such that there was a very limited reduction in the breakthrough time and removal efficiency of recycled ws nps table 5 shows the values of tb and regeneration efficiency regeneration that is calculated as follows 8 r e g e n e r a t i o n q c y c l e q o r i g i n a l 100 as confirmed from the table the regeneration efficiency was successfully implemented for the ws nps and the regeneration efficiency was slightly influenced in fact each cycle was repeated by nearly complete removal of silica and toc for three more subsequent cycles with capture efficiencies of 100 91 5 and 81 for the subsequent cycles this supports the attaining minor or insignificant leaching with respect to the material performance as sorbent for both toc and silica the figure also confirms that the pressure drop profile was insignificantly impacted in every cycle interestingly enough these obtained results can be considered strong evidence for the replacement of the employed material with our modified one without impacting the process operating efficiency but significantly improving its removal capacity 4 conclusion with the decline in global price of crude oil and increased attention to environmental issues there has been a growing need to improve water treatment efficiencies and realize potential cost saving it is a good time to reflect on the technology used in the sagd water treatment process as existing plants are seeking to improve operating costs and uptime in some sagd sites a precipitation softening process is involved through a warm lime softening wls for silica removal followed by filtration using a walnut shell filter wsf and weak acid cation exchange wac to remove the carbonated and non carbonated hardness these technologies primarily focus on water recycling at high capital and operating costs and very few of them showed effective remediation of silica and toc with a lower environmental footprint this study modified the surface of nutshell filter particles by anchoring iron hydroxide nanoparticles to the surface at various hydrolysis conditions time temperature and concentration of iron precursor and then fully characterized and tested them to measure the removal of the total organic carbon and silica in batch and fixed bed column operations compared to the virgin particles the walnut shell particles in the presence of the nanoparticles at low mass percentage showed an outstanding ability to remove toc and silica in the batch experiments the modified material performed well in removing up to 85 of silica and toc compared with the non modified nutshell filter particles that showed 5 removal efficiency while in the fixed bed column experiments and similar to the industrial operation the filter particle in presence of active nanoparticles improved the breakthrough behavior without having channeling or pressure drop limitations regeneration and recyclability of the spent column were successfully implemented through three successful cycles following direct backwashing and blade stirring methods to the best of our knowledge the efficiency of cleaning up of silica and toc obtained from our modified filter compared with the currently employed processes has not been achieved in fact we have proven that this outstanding efficiency can be reached with a simpler process a single hybrid unit can outperform three existing units wls wac and wsf in the recycling of produced water generated from sagd process this unit can be simply implemented with minor modifications to the existing units which would reduce the capital and operational costs in summary our innovative technique provides an outstanding hybrid wsf unit that would

13338,long is the way and hard that out of covid 19 leads up to light the virus is highly contagious and spread rapidly and the number of infections increases exponentially the colossal number of infections and presence of the novel coronavirus rna in human wastes e g excreta urine even after the patients recovered and the rt pcr tests were negative results in massive load of the viral in water environments numerous studies reported the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the risk of contaminating water bodies in the regions which suffer from the lack of proper sanitation system and wastewater treatment plants mostly in developing countries is higher since solar water disinfection sodis is usually used by people in developing countries there is a concern about using this method during the pandemic because the sars cov 2 can be eliminated by high temperature 56 c and uvc wavelength 100 280 nm while sodis systems mainly work at lower temperature 45 c and use the available uva 315 400 nm thus during a situation like the ongoing pandemic using sodis method for wastewater treatment or providing drinking water is not a reliable method it should be reminded that the main aim of the present study is not just to give insights about the possibilities and risks of using sodis during the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect for any future outbreak pandemic that results in biological contamination of water bodies nevertheless some experimental studies seem to be necessary by all researchers under conditions similar to developing countries graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords solar disinfection sodis water treatment uv disinfection developing countries novel coronavirus contaminated water 1 introduction covid 19 is more than a health crisis millions have lost their jobs the global economy is headed for the sharpest contraction since the great depression the political economic and social effect of the pandemic will be felt for years to come we should be all in this together dr tedros adhanom director general of the world health organization the world was surprised at the end of 2019 with shocking news about the advent of a new virus from the family of coronaviridae 1 although the beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars cov 2 firstly was reported by chinese officials at the end days of 2019 and in more than 2000 papers researchers mentioned the city of wuhan in their abstract as the starting point of the pandemic 2 but there are some pieces of concrete evidence about the presence of the sars cov 2 in different locations long time before the chinese announcement such striking instances has created many doubts about the main origination of the virus since the viral rna was detected in wastewater samples of spain 3 and brazil 4 eleven and four months before the first case was confirmed by the officials of those countries respectively this means that the exact origination of the pandemic is quite vague the contradiction of these reports steps the crucial importance of water and wastewater bodies in detecting some kind of epidemic into the spotlight before it becomes to a catastrophic pandemic like the covid 19 since the beginning of the pandemic the experts of wastewater based epidemiology wbe have conducted numerous researches throughout the world to examine the presence of the sars cov 2 in various wastewater samples 5 the presence of the sars cov 2 in various water bodies increases because of human excreta and urine that release into the aquatic environment through wastewater mostly in developing countries and wastewater treatment plants wwtps however there are various routes for transmitting the virus into the aquatic environment while the dominant transmission route of the sars cov 2 is mainly established via the respiratory system but there are anxieties over the effects opening new windows for transmitting the virus when the infected gastrointestinal glandular implied the potential transmission via fecal oral 6 newly probability transmission of the sars cov 2 through water media has raised many questions 7 furthermore it was stated due to the heavy load of the viral concentration in water bodies during the ongoing pandemic using solar water desalination system to provide drinking water by desalinating impure water has too many risks 8 therefore any water related system and facility can be encounter with contamination of the virus and it can become a possible route to spread the sars cov 2 1 1 the objective of the present study the main objective of the present study is to examine the effectiveness of sodis method during the ongoing pandemic by focusing on the two important parameters that the novel coronavirus and the sodis system have in common the review organized in several steps and it is recommended to be meticulously followed by readers to realize the main concept in the first step the general concept of the sodis systems is briefly introduced in the second step some parameters that have an effect on the performance of sodis such as the type of uv content free radicals etc are presented in the third step the photo reactivation process is discussed to show the uv damage on the pathogen s genome and the repair mechanism while application of sodis for virus eliminating virus structure and mechanism and resistance of viral inactivation through uv and temperature in the fourth section is discussed the paper is followed in the fifth section by focusing on the contamination of water bodies to justify the fact that the feed water for sodis systems can be heavily polluted by human waste through wastewater and wastewater treatment plants which result in biological contamination the sixth section brought the importance of the fifth section into the spotlight by validating the presence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater groundwater surface water and rivers that discussed in numerous studies the seventh section is the most important part of this study because it discusses two important factors that the sars cov 2 and sodis systems are severely affected by which are uv and temperature in the first section i e 7 1 vulnerability of the virus to temperature is presented while the second sub section i e 7 2 discusses on the effect of various types of uv on the viability of the virus in the eighth section the risks of using sodis systems during the ongoing pandemic by considering the earlier discussions in the seventh section and focusing on the effect of uv and temperature are presented eventually in the ninth section summaries concluding remarks and future studies are recommended it should be noted that the reason for brought a comprehensive content about the effective parameters on the sodis performance damage and repair mechanism of pathogen s structure discussing the pollution of water environments by pathogens etc is to show that the present study is not limited to the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect about any possibility for the future outbreak pandemic that results to contaminate aquatic environment throughout the world 2 solar water disinfection more than half of the world population 4 billion is living in conditions that face with severe water scarcity at least one month of each year 9 while consuming contaminated water from available water resources by people lead to a high risk of waterborne diseases especially in poor and rural communities the importance of the providing safe drinking water can be elucidated when we consider that the un in two of the most important action plans called mdgs and sdgs between 2000 and 2030 assigned a specific goal to water 10 the importance of providing safe drinking water is more critical in low income and developing countries because of poor sanitation networks and insufficient improper lack of wastewater treatment plants wwtp a well known instance is brazil which has one of the largest water resources in the world but due to the poor sanitation system and lack of proper wwtps many areas of the country have limited access to adequate drinkable water resources 11 and people confronted many problems through contaminated water solar based systems such as solar stills and solar water disinfection sodis are proper options for extremely remote regions as well as low income and poor communities 12 15 the sodis is a point of use water treatment method that has been used all over the world especially in asia latin america and africa 16 nearly 5 000 000 people in almost 50 countries through the world are using this method for their daily consumption most of them are located in developing countries with limited access to a source of a safe drinking water 16 in these countries waterborne pathogens such as escherichia coli salmonella vibrio cholera giardia cryptosporidium 17 etc cause serious and even life threatening diseases the sodis is known as a low cost household water treatment and storage hwts method by which pathogenic microorganisms are eliminated through solar radiation and mild temperature it is drastically cheaper than filtration chlorination even than solar stills 12 17 in this method a transparent container is filled with contaminated water and exposed to direct sunlight for at least 6 8 h 17 usually containers are chose from domestic plastic or glass bottles plastic bottles are used more frequently because they are cheaper and more resistant but they should be replaced every six months because prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause to the leaching of plastic materials into water 17 it is recommended to consume solar disinfected water within 24 h because of the possibility of post exposure regrowth of pathogenic microorganisms 17 the exact mechanism of the sodis is still unclear but it is obvious that damage to the dna protein increasing cell wall permeability have significant roles in the process the sensitivity of pathogen available uv content reactive oxygen species ross water ambient temperatures and exposure time are the main factors in the germicidal effect of the sodis method that some of them are discussed in the following 2 1 hydroxyl and dioxygen radicals generated by photons photosensitizers are endogenous or exogenous molecules that can produce ross by reducing oxygen when they are excited by light ross have a role in physiological reactions as secondary messengers 18 under normal conditions the balance between production and elimination of ros is controlled by a scavenging system to maintain cellular homeostasis 19 but under oxidative stress conditions excessive production of ros can cause many problems for the cell enzymes such as catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod provide cellular defense against ros and protect cells from radical attacks 18 these enzymes can be inactivated by photons 18 which has an important role in solar disinfection ross can cause oxidative damage to dna and other cell components 16 18 19 it produces pyrimidine dimers and single strand breaks ssbs which are lethal to the cell 18 20 it can also affect cell membrane penetration by inducing oxidation reactions to hydroxyl groups of cell wall and cell membrane 21 22 typically during the soids process two kinds of radicals are generated hydroxyl radicals oh and dioxygen radicals 1o2 the first one usually considers a powerful oxidant while the second one is a moderate oxidant generally the predominant cause of pathogen annihilation in the case of protozoa and bacteria by hydroxyl radicals is damaging cell membrane through oxidizing lipid 23 24 since hydroxyl radicals are exceedingly reactive they have a short lifetime and they are generated on site by regular advanced oxidation process aop by ultraviolet activation of hydrogen peroxide or ozone 25 however generating this kind of hydroxyl for small and poor communities has difficulties because of excessive demand for electrical energy and chemicals while other methods such as tio2 based photocatalysis given the same results in the absence of aforementioned challenges 25 nevertheless one of the well known obstacles for hydroxyl radicals in water treatment is removing the generated oh by natural organic matters which is not an implausible phenomenon in wastewater especially in complex water matrices which results in to drastically decline the effectiveness of the disinfection process 26 although by combining stored hydrogen peroxide with harvested solar energy for photocatalytic synthesize to produce oh one of the obstacles that is the constant presence of solar radiation to produce oh in solar based water treatment systems is addressed but this method also has the disadvantage of reducing singlet oxygen to hydrogen peroxide instead of h2o or simply catalytic selectivity furthermore another method to produce oh such as utilizing fenton catalyst is still on laboratory scale and it applications under real conditions is not realized yet conversely moderate oxidants such as singlet oxygen 1o2 is stable higher which means that they have less reactivity compared to powerful oxidants oh in comparison to oh radicals they have a longer lifetime which means this kind of radicals can go farther distant from the site of origination this is a huge advantage for the 1o2 radicals to remain effective in complex water matrices with a high natural organic matter in contrast to oh radicals that loss their effectiveness in complex water matrices due to a higher rate of reactivity 26 28 while our focus in the present study is viruses specifically the sars cov 2 we have not discussed the inactivation mechanism of bacteria via singlet oxygen however the inactivation mechanism of bacteria by 1o2 is extensively discussed before 29 singlet oxygen considers as a powerful disinfectant against enveloped viruses when 1o2 is reacting with lipid the fluidity of the membrane is decreases which results in an increase in the energy requisite for host binding subsequently impede the membrane bind to the host cell 30 conversely the non enveloped virus inactivation mechanism is leaned by damaging the genomic and capsid which is not our concern in the present study to reinforce the effectiveness of this method of disinfection i e producing 1o2 using fullerene that leads to a high yield of 1o2 is also considered but such photosensitizers should be separated before the water is consumed by individuals it should be noted that by separating photosensitizers performance of the system is severely affected and diminished 31 33 2 2 effect of uv on the performance of sodis the uv considered as one of the powerful tools for inactivating biologically contaminated water due to some advantages such as the absence of generating by products during the disinfection process in contrast with other methods like chlorination briefly uv types were categorized based on their wavelength as the a type 315 400 nm the b type 280 315 nm and the c type 100 280 nm which abbreviated as the uva uvb and uvc wavelengths respectively 16 optical inactivation of pathogens is practical when the solar intensity and available uv is strong enough to damage to the pathogen s structure however in the case of sodis we should not count only on the most available uv on the earth which is uva 315 400 nm there is a huge difference between uv germicide microbicide irradiance and the uva wavelength the effective uv irradiance is directly damaged to the genome of pathogens while the effectual wavelength for this phenomenon is below 280 nm somewhere in 260 265 nm which is the highest uv absorption of nucleic acid 34 because photons of the uva wavelength are considered as low energy photon while high energy photons in uvc wavelength are strong enough to damage the genome of pathogens in this regard we cannot rely on the effectiveness of the uva even by using solar reflectors to increase the uv irradiance by collecting not only the direct uv but also the diffuse on cloudy days the energy of photons would not change and the only difference is increasing the available uva 35 however in recent years using lanthanide elements 36 to convert photons of visible light with lower energy into photons with higher energy in the uvc region is proposed as a solution but application of these materials due to the high rate of reactivity and low quantum yield is remained on the laboratory scale 2 3 temperature contribution to effectiveness of the sodis thermal contribution to the solar disinfection process is considerable but its importance varies in different seasons the effect of thermal stress is significant above the optimum temperature for the growth of microorganisms as the structure and activity of enzymes will be affected 22 for instance most of the fecal bacteria are mesophilic withstanding between the temperature of 20 45 c 17 this means that inactivation through the effect of temperature is more possible above this point i e 45 c which means that below 45 c the effect of temperature on bacterial inactivation is negligible 37 38 thus the removal of microorganisms through solar disinfection is severely limited in winter the thermal effect depends on the volume and turbidity of water and also environmental conditions thermal stress facilitates the process of dna damage and inhibits dna repair mechanisms 16 39 it increases the cell wall permeability 39 limits the enzymatic activities 17 22 and also leads to protein denaturation which all of them are lethal to cells in temperatures beyond 45 c a synergy between thermal and optical inactivation is reported by many researchers 16 18 37 39 which improves the solar disinfection performance but it is effective in specific cases under specific conditions sichel et al 40 examined the effect of environmental conditions for removing e coli by the sodis method their results showed that the temperature of water in the warmest months of the year july did not exceed 40 c mcguigan et al 38 simulated the process of sodis by considering the effect of temperature turbidity and optical irradiation findings revealed that for complete inactivation of pathogens the water temperature should reach 55 c while it was reported that in field investigations under real conditions for several experiments the temperature of water did not even reach 45 c 41 rincon et al showed that the temperature of water in sodis with and without tio2 photocatalyst from 32 6 c and 36 6 c reaches 39 c and 38 6 c respectively 35 moreover under real conditions in winter and summer the water temperature cannot further than 30 c and it is in the range of 15 21 c and 25 30 c respectively 42 it can be concluded that the temperature of water regarding the results of numerous experiments in cold seasons is always quite low whereas in warm seasons just in rare cases the temperature is higher than 45 c 2 4 time of exposure time of exposure is another important factor in solar disinfection which is affected by environmental conditions such as wind speed solar intensity and ambient temperature 43 and it depends on the type of pathogen and its features for instance full sunshine can eliminate the somatic phage 44 and bovine rotaviruses in less than 3 h 45 but on the contrary the t2 phage is not inactivated even after 8 h 16 in another study enterococcus faecalis salmonella spp and staphylococcus aureus exposed to sunlight and 4 log10 cfu 100 ml in 6 h were obtained but as the exposure time increased to 8 h the concentration reduced to below the detectable level 22 in suitable conditions most waterborne pathogenic bacteria such as e coli are removable within 6 h which makes many diseases preventable 16 table 1 gives the sodis application for various types of pathogens considering the rate of reduction time of exposure and solar intensity 3 damage and repair mechanism in pathogens numerous parameters can be contributed to the inactivation of pathogens however the most important parameters that can be affected the performance of the sodis system and damaging dna rna structure which is mentioned before as the ultraviolet irradiance the temperature of water thermal inactivation various ross i e hydroxyl and dioxygen radicals and time of exposure ultraviolet radiation ross and thermal inactivation can directly and indirectly threaten cells by inducing dna and protein damage for instance the irritation of dna caused by direct uv can cause a connection between two adjacent pyrimidine bases by covalent bonds and make pyrimidine dimers 16 these dimers include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd and 6 4 photoproducts which are two of the most mutagenic dna lesions 21 53 cpds are the most cytotoxic lesions which make up around 75 of uv induced dna damage products while 4 6 photoproducts are less abundant but they are more lethal 21 since it inhibited the progress of dna polymerase 21 it can cause problems in dna multiplication also the rna polymerases are stalling at these regions 21 thus transcription and translation may be eliminated hence unrepaired dna lesions can lead to mutation and inactivation of microorganisms 21 organisms have dna repair mechanisms to remove dna lesions and prevent their lethal effects the photo reactivation process fig 1 is a common and simple mechanism for removing uv induced dna lesions which is done by photolyase enzyme 21 54 in the photo reactivation process pyrimidine dimers in dna are recognized by photolyase under near uv light 310 480 nm 53 flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and methyltetrahydrofolate mthf are the two co factors that are significant for this enzymatic function 54 the mthf absorbs energy and gets excited then transduces an electron to fad subsequently it reduces to fadh2 the fadh2 transfers the high energy electron to the dimer and makes radicals these pyrimidine dimers become highly unstable so they separate into two pyrimidines and the dna becomes fixed 55 so these repairs reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection 53 4 effectiveness of sodis for virus removal among waterborne pathogens viruses are usually more resistant to environmental inactivation 56 while their low infectious dose makes them more dangerous to the public health 57 in the section 2 we discussed about the important parameters on the sodis performance however in the present study uv effect and thermal heating are the main factors in the sodis process since these parameters are critical in inactivation the novel coronavirus among three types of uv just the uva wavelength and a small part of uvb reach on the surface of earth 21 58 and the uvc wavelength is completely absorbed by the ozone layer however it should be reminded that the effective germicidal type of uv is the uvc wavelength and the uva wavelength which is the most abundant type of uv on the earth has not a direct effect on genome s structure and its impact generally defined through the formation of ross 16 21 as it discussed before viruses like other pathogens can be damaged by the direct effect of uv on the genome and indirect endogenous or exogenous effect 59 endogenous when the sensitizer molecules are a part of the virus itself and exogenous when they are in water 51 generally caused by ross 60 61 by considering the simple structure of viruses we can overlook the endogenous damage 59 62 it was reported that f dna coliphages were only sensitive to direct inactivation while f rna coliphages were also susceptible to indirect exogenous inactivation 52 human adenovirus hadv human rotavirus hrov prd1 and ms2 are more susceptible to exogenous indirect inactivation unlike poliovirus porcine rotavirus f dna coliphages which are not much sensitive to exogenous sensitizers 52 it should be mentioned that the most resistant viruses in the light mediated inactivation are double stranded dna dsdna double stranded rna dsrna and single stranded rna ssrna genome 63 the reason for considering dsdna viruses as the most resistant against radiation 52 is that they have more redundant genetic information as well as ability to be repaired in the host cell 64 while in the case of rna viruses the resistance is because of the fact that they have uracil instead of thymine and uracil dimer reactions have less quantum function than the corresponding thymine dimer reactions in dna 65 67 ms2 and adenovirus indicated similar inactivation rate although adenovirus has a longer genome and absorbs more light the reason is that adenovirus is a dsdna virus which can repair uv induced damage on dna 62 direct and indirect viral inactivation against ms2 phix174 and adenovirus has been studied by mattle et al 62 findings revealed that phix174 is the most susceptible one in direct inactivation but the most resistant one in indirect inactivation through reactive species it states that inactivation is mostly through direct process but o2 was also able to disinfect ms2 and adenovirus the main photo inactivation of viruses on the surface of earth is in the range of uvb 280 320 nm 59 as we mentioned most of the uvb wavelength cannot reach on the surface of earth which may be the reason of ineffectiveness of solar disinfection on viruses and it can even become worse when uv intensity decreases for instance coxsackievirus could be completely inactivated under simulated sodis condition at optical irradiance 550 w m2 within 2 h at 45 c 50 while it was just partially inactivated by exposing it to the irradiance of 75 w m2 for 6 h at maximum temperature of 34 c 68 polo et al experimentally examined the effectiveness of sodis for eliminating the hepatitis a virus hav and murine norovirus mnv experiments conducted between 2 and 8 h exposure findings showed that around 0 81log10 and 1 1log10 reduction for hepatitis a virus hav and murine norovirus mnv achieved respectively if time of exposure is 8 h 51 among studied viruses hadv and ms2 seem to be the most resistant viruses against environmental inactivation 52 these results suggested that the uv content temperature and time are important parameters for an effective sodis process however sunlight intensity i e available uv content is the most important factor in viral disinfection in comparison with temperature or time of exposure 51 because high temperature just can effectively harm capsid proteins but it s not much operative on the genome s structure 69 71 in viruses at temperatures above 40 c there is a thermal optic synergy which means that as temperature increases more viruses can be inactivated in exchange for each photon 59 however researchers concluded that complete viral disinfection through the sodis process is not possible under natural conditions 57 therefore it needs more treatment time and even some interventions for total inactivation fig 2 shows some of the most important parameters that have effect on viral inactivation 5 contamination of rivers lakes surface water and groundwater nearly one third of the world civilization is living next to the big rivers and their floodplains but in recent years anthropogenic barriers are a force to transboundary rivers and these regions results in many problems for occupants 72 there are two important sources for pollution of water bodies in the globe which one of them is the human wastes 72 thus contamination of water bodies via open drainage and wastewater is a common phenomenon throughout the world especially in low income and developing countries for example in vietnam 73 the lack of wwtp leads to contamination of sai dong nai rivers and groundwater which provide 1 2 million m3 day water of ho chi minh city in kenya 74 open dumping of wastes in the absence of tight regulations results in heavy contamination of surface groundwater while it was reported that in nigeria around 90 of hospital wastes without any treatment discharge into the surrounding environment 75 in some of the african low income countries such as benin ghana and mali farmers utilized sludge and wastes as fertilizer by bribing to drivers of septic tanks 76 77 which is highly dangerous because some epidemic in the past returned to communities because of direct use of sludge 78 79 in some of countries in south america between 60 to 70 wastewater left out to the water environments without treatment while almost forty percent of people in these regions are not linked to sewage systems 80 for example a big city like quito with 3 million occupants in ecuador treated only 3 of its wastewater 81 moreover it was reported that around 75 of wastewater 45 000 l s in mexico city drained to the environment without any formal treatment 82 some of the famous rivers in india such as the ganges the gomti and the varanasi which are heavily polluted by direct discharge of human wastes and untreated wastewater lead to many waterborne diseases 83 84 although wwtps in industrialized and high income countries are effective to prevent the contamination of water bodies by wastewater but contamination by combined sewer flows csos is still inevitable in these countries 85 it should be pointed out that complete elimination of pathogens in wwtps is not plausible because of inefficient wwtps high resistance of some pathogens and high concentration of biological contamination in wastewater while presence of pathogens in treated wastewater in high income countries that have high standards for wwtp facilities is proved the situation in low income and developing countries most of which have not wwtp or effective water treatment facilities is certainly worse than it can be imagined it is worthy to be mentioned that some well known transboundary rivers and basins polluted by pathogens of wastewaters such as amazon congo parana nile yenisey lena zambezi niger amur indus mekong and salween to name a few 86 in this regard contamination of natural water bodies 87 88 rivers 89 groundwater 90 and freshwater environment 91 via the sars cov 2 become to the one of main concerns of all researchers 6 presence of the sars cov 2 in wastewater presence of the sars cov 2 in water bodies may occur via different routes some of these routes can be the main source of contamination such as wastewater drainage and direct discharging without treatment while some other routes like disposing personal protection equipment ppe in the environment aquatic environment open defecation etc are not consider as a major source of contamination fig 3 wastewater sewer network and open discharging are the main reasons that lead to entering pathogens bacteria virus and protozoan into the water bodies in huge cities a large amount of wastewater results in a high load of coronaviruses because of the population 92 an efficient sewer system can dilute viral load subsequently decreases the presence of the sars cov 2 in an aquatic environment but the large number of infected inhabitants by the virus in mega cities increases the rate of viral load enters to the water bodies 92 presence of the sars cov 2 in wastewater at the beginning of the pandemic was reported in different regions of the world 93 human urine and excreta consider as one of the main reasons which enter the sars cov 2 in water bodies via sewer network researchers in numerous studies were detected presence of the sars cov 2 in the stool of patients even though their respiratory tests are negative 6 further it was reported that the virus in human feces based on the environmental conditions can be prolonged between 11 and 35 days 94 this is highlighted the fact that if a patient is healed and recovered after infection by the virus the feces that contain the viral rna still can increase the load of the virus into the sewer network and subsequently increase the concentration of virion in wastewaters however it should be reminded that the exact infectivity of the sars cov 2 in wastewater is not scrutinized yet 7 besides the lack of wwtps and direct discharging of wastewater like the city of quito the fast rate of infectious that results in a higher rate of infected persons waste entrance to the sewer network increases the risk of a heavy concentration of the virus in water bodies among ten samples of secondary treated wastewater the sars cov 2 rna is detected in 20 of the samples in japan while the existence of the virus in 3 rivers is not confirmed which indicated that the low prevalence of the covid 19 in the region results in the absence of virus rna at those water bodies 95 also it was disclosed about 83 and 11 of untreated and secondary treated wastewater are contaminated by the covid 19 virus it was declared that around 65 of collected sewage samples during october 2019 to february 2020 are polluted by the sars cov 2 suggesting the circulation of the virus in italy months before starting the ongoing pandemic 96 experiments on 8 and 23 samples of treated and untreated wastewater from different sources in paris confirmed the existence of the sars cov 2 respectively 97 furthermore presence of the novel coronavirus in treated wastewater of nine wwtps stepped into the spotlight the fact that conventional wwtps such as active sludge are ineffective for removing the virus in polluted water suggesting advanced methods such as ozonation and membrane treatment 98 it is important to notice that the sars cov 2 is still detected in secondary treated wastewater of wwtps which is commonly utilized by industrialized and high income countries even though a high load of the sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater 107 gc l and treated wastewater removing 1 2 log10 is confirmed before but significance or insignificance risks of the virus concentration on water bodies as well as transmission to the human is unclear yet presently the minimum infectious dose mid of the sars cov 2 which is the number of virion particles that result in infection for humans is unknown 5 nevertheless the expeditious dissemination of the disease suggests that the mid of the novel coronavirus is low similar to other enveloped viruses 99 in this regard whether the concentration of the sars cov 2 in water bodies is high risk or not any possibility about transmission of the virus via water bodies should be considered to impede unexpected consequences 100 7 parameters influencing for inactivation of the sars cov 2 during the covid 19 pandemic numerous studies with different approaches and conditions for inactivating the novel coronavirus are performed castano et al in a preprint categorized the inactivation methods of the sars cov 2 to utilizing plasma ozone coating surfaces with prominent antimicrobial materials such as copper cu and silver ag heat treatment uv irradiance utilizing different chemical compounds 101 furthermore other unconventional methods such as using gamma ray 102 bio based inactivation methods like bio active lipid 103 and nanomaterial 104 are examined and proposed by many scientists however several studies focused on the environmental parameters that have impacted on viability of the sras cov 2 such as the fixation retention ph temperature and solar radiation for example it was reported that ph in a wide range ph 3 10 has an insignificant effect on the sras cov 2 105 while at extreme ph range 2 3 11 12 the virus lost its infectious just in one day 106 among all of the aforementioned parameters we stepped the effect of temperature thermal inactivation heating and uv into the spotlight because these two parameters 7 1 susceptibility of covs to temperature as discussed before in the sodis process the two parameters of temperature and uv are crucial for an effective performance since the family of the coronavirus is vulnerable to temperature it was reported that various types of coronavirus such as hcov 229e sars cov 1 mers cov hcov oc43 tgev mcov and sars cov 2 on different surfaces steel glass paper cloth latex ceramic wood and cardboard in the temperature range of 4 25 c can survive between several hours to 28 days 107 furthermore the impact of temperature on the survival of the coronavirus family in different liquids such as dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem minimum essential medium mem hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes phosphate buffered saline pbs including water is realized it was reported that for the aforementioned families of the coronavirus in a temperature between 4 and 80 c the virus can remain viable around 1 min up to 49 days respectively the lowest temperature leads to higher survival time and vice versa 107 these results elucidate the important fact that the family of the coronavirus is tremendously susceptible to temperature in this regard some researchers focused on the effect of temperature on the viability of the sars cov 2 for instance it was proved that by immersing face masks in the water at 56 c for half an hour the virus is eliminated and the masks can be reused 108 chin et al reported that the variation of temperature highly affected viability of the sars cov 2 where at 4 c just 0 7log10 reduction was observed and the virus remained active for 14 days but at 70 c the virus is inactivated in 5 min 105 another study declared that the sars cov 2 virus suspended in solution in temperatures 4 20 25 and 33 37 c remains viable up to 14 7 and 1 2 days respectively 106 recently survival of the novel coronavirus in different solutions such as tap water autoclave wastewater and untreated wastewater for a varied range of temperature is realized the results revealed that the t90 of the sars cov 2 for the temperatures of 4 c 15 c 25 c and 37 c for untreated wastewater autoclaved wastewater and tap water are varied between 8 27 5 43 and 9 58 days respectively 109 7 2 effect of uv on the sars covs various types of uv and their wavelengths are presented in the previous sections effect of various types of uv on the family of coronavirus is also examined after the sars cov 1 outbreak several studies were conducted on the effect of various types of uv on viability of the sars cov 1 it was examined that uva cannot be effective enough to eliminate the sars cov 1 110 while removing the virus by uvc was completely achieved 110 however in another study complete inactivation of the sars cov 1by utilizing uvc was not achieved 111 which means that the results of different studies are not conclusive currently numerous studies on the effect of the uv irradiance on elimination of the sars cov 2 were conducted which most of them are focused on utilizing uvc it was declared that the uvc wavelength is strong enough for eliminating the sars cov 2 in different surfaces 112 114 kitagawa et al 115 reported 88 5 99 7 diminishment in the sars cov 2 concentration on different surfaces using uvc 222 nm while heilingloh et al 116 reported the minimum dose of uvc for complete inactivating of the sars cov 2 is 1048 mj cm2 moreover rapid inactivation of the dried sar cov 2 on steel in 6 8 min can be attained by uvb irradiance with simulated natural light in the indoor experiment 117 still the effect of various types of uv on contaminated solutions by sars cov 2 remains unknown since the uvc is completely absorbed in the atmosphere and just 5 of uvb is reaching on the earth the most abundant type of uv is uva but based on experiments the uva has an insignificant effect for deactivating the sars cov 2 virus 116 however based on a model the uva may have a contribution to inactivate the virus 118 but it should reminded that during a devastating incident such as the covid 19 scientists and governments should avoid any announcement speculation and assumption in the absence of concrete scientific evidence 119 in fact the peak of absorbing the ultraviolet radiation in the nucleic acid of the viral is between 260 and 265 nm the uvc range which is placed in the optimum and effective range of germicidal wavelength 34 since the uv wavelength below 320 nm consider as actinic and absorption of the uva by the viral nucleic acid is inadequate at wavelength 320 nm the uva generally has not germicidal effect 34 the wavelength has a reverse relationship with its germicidal characteristics which means by decreasing the wavelength germicidal effect is increases and vice versa 120 while the main effect of the uv irradiance in sodis translates by the formation of ross rather than the direct effect yet there is no research on the effect of excessive ross on the sars cov 2 rna however we should emphasize that viruses are always introduced as one of the most resistant pathogens in the sodis 8 what is the risk of using sodis during the pandemic as mentioned above the ongoing pandemic contaminated water bodies in different regions of the world whether in industrialized and high income countries or in the developing world while presence of the sars cov 2 in a high income country like japan 95 with high standard of wwtps in secondary treated wastewater is detected the situation in the developing countries which most of them have no access to wwtps and proper sanitation system is certainly worse solar disinfection is a technology that is used in developing countries rather than high income countries and the number of people that used this method to consume drinkable water is significant the effectiveness of the sodis system is depended on various parameters which the most important of them are uv water temperature ross and type of pathogens generally the sodis method is more preferable and practical for contaminated water with bacteria rather than viruses because among the waterborne diseases viruses are the most resistant type compare to the others 56 two important parameters that are directly related to effectiveness of the sodis performance as well as resistance and survivability of the sars cov 2 are temperature and uv in the literature we discuss the effect of each of these parameters on both of them in numerous studies researchers declared that the uvc wavelength is strong enough to eliminate the virus on different surfaces 112 114 however effect of the uvc on the sars cov 2 virus in solutions various water matrices such as contaminated water is not realized yet and it is not clear that how the uvc wavelength is effective for inactivating the virus in different solutions on the other hand the sodis method mainly relies on the direct and indirect effect of uv irradiance while the most abundant available uv uva is not adequately powerful to affect the genome directly and its effect is generally through the formation of ros 16 21 as we mentioned before viruses like other pathogens can be damaged by a direct effect on the genome and indirect endogenous or exogenous effect while due to simple structure of viruses the endogenous damage can be overlooked 59 the main photo inactivation of viruses on the surface of the earth is in the range of 280 315 nm of wavelengths uvb 59 while only 5 of the uvb is available on the earth and just a small amount of available uvb can be absorbed by genome 21 although the direct effect of uva on the sars cov 2 is not realized yet but regarding numerous studies for inactivation of the novel coronavirus by uv it can be concluded that the available uv on earth i e type a 315 400 nm is not strong enough to damage the viral rna it should be mentioned that the effective wavelength for direct damage of the genome of pathogens and highest absorption of the uv by nucleic acid is between 250 and 270 nm which is the uvc wavelength regions 33 34 119 furthermore using up conversion materials lanthanide elements to turn the uva into uvc wavelength is still stuck in laboratory stages and has many obstacles such as low quantum yield and high reactivity in this regard it is worthy to be mentioned that materials with high efficiency should be utilized to reach a significant level of inactivating pathogens in water to avoid the mechanism of repair the indirect effect of uv by producing free radicals is also questionable powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals are short lived and tremendously reactive and subsequently it is not effective in complex water matrices which contains natural organic matters such as wastewaters 25 26 furthermore effect of the singlet oxygen radicals which is more effective in complex water matrices as well as on enveloped viruses remains in question because the photosensitizers should separate from the water before it consumes by individuals which leads to decrease the effectiveness of sodis system 33 as mentioned before the sars cov 2 virus is highly vulnerable to an increase in temperature and it can be eliminated because of the destruction of its lipid and protein thus thermal inactivation is proposed as a powerful method to eliminate the virus it should be mentioned that viability of the virus has an inverse relation with temperature as it discussed before the t90 of the sars cov 2 for various temperatures 4 c 15 c 25 c and 37 c in different wastewater samples is varied between 5 and 58 days 109 fig 4 whereas in the sodis method under real conditions based on experiments temperature of water is below 40 c and even in ideal conditions i e summer conditions when solar intensity and ambient temperature stands at the highest point the water temperature may not reach 40 c 35 40 42 the low temperature of water in the sodis has two issues first the synergistic effect of temperature with uv can be obtained only and if only the water temperature is higher than 45 c 38 while for temperature 45 c ideal conditions are required i e hot summers secondly at lower temperatures the sars cov 2 virus is more resistant and it can remain viable where at 37 c the t90 for different types of wastewater samples and tap water contaminated by the novel coronavirus is around 5 8 days 109 moreover in other seasons except summer the environmental condition is not suitable for the sodis due to the lower solar intensity and ambient temperature of water is low subsequently the viral would be remaining longer days viable in water up to 58 days to overcome the problem of uv and low temperature in sodis up conversion materials and nanoparticles for turning the uva to uvc and increasing the water temperature by trapping light and taking the advantage of heat localization 36 121 are proposed but neither of these solutions approaches to practical application that can be widely used by poor communities because of obstacles specific characteristics of materials cost of materials advanced methods for preparing the apparatus in mass production thus these methods remain in laboratory scales 9 summaries concluding remarks and knowledge gaps in the present study reliability of solar water disinfection during the covid 19 pandemic is discussed the following summaries and remarks can be concluded a huge amount of water bodies via different routes are contaminated due to the ongoing pandemic presence of the sars cov 2 in different water matrices including untreated wastewater treated wastewater rivers freshwater environment and groundwater is detected all around the globe presence of the virus at higher concentration at water bodies in developing countries due to absence or ineffective sanitation system and wwtps is higher than industrialized and high income countries the novel coronavirus can be viable within several days 5 58 days in different temperatures and different solutions solar radiation temperature physicochemical characteristics of water features of virus type and length of the genome composition of adjacent pyrimidine dimers or guanine content are the factors that affect sunlight mediated disinfection of viruses uv irradiance and temperature are the two important effective parameters that sodis and novel coronavirus have in common typically the sodis method is more practical for contaminated water by bacteria than viruses most of studies in sodis system focused on eliminating various type of the bacteria rather than other pathogens the most abundant available type of uv on the surface of earth uva is not strong enough to eliminate viruses the effectiveness of uva in the sodis system is through formation of ross the effective uv wavelength for viral eliminating is in the range of 100 280 nm which consider as the uvc to achieve the synergistic effect of thermal optic in viral deactivation the temperature of water should be higher than 40 c performance of sodis in cold seasons is tremendously decreases because of the lower ambient temperature and solar i e available uv intensity the sars cov 2 virus in temperature of 37 c remains viable in autoclave wastewater untreated wastewater and tap water around 5 8 and 9 days respectively in sodis system reaching to higher temperature 40 c of water can be realize only in summer and hot climate conditions rate of reduction for the novel coronavirus in different medium surfaces solutions etc has an inverse relation with temperature the critical temperature for killing the sars cov 2 is 56 c its eliminated in less than 30 min while most of sodis systems worked at temperature lower than 45 c furthermore the following are recommended as the post pandemic studies realizing the effectiveness of sodis system with contaminated water by the novel coronavirus in different seasons especially cold seasons determining the important parameters on the performance of sodis system fed by sars cov 2 contaminated water such as variable uv intensity water temperature turbidity time of exposure how the available uva can affected the sras cov 2 viability in contaminated water how concentration of the virus during the sodis process is changed when one parameter is variable and the other parameters are constant determining the effect of originated free radicals during the sodis process i e hydroxyl and dioxygen on viability of the sars cov 2 in water how different physical modifications for sodis containers such as increasing the rate of absorption in containers can affected viability of the virus how utilizing advance materials such as lanthanide elements during the sodis process would be practical in eliminating the sars cov 2 in contaminated water determining the proper dosage of uvb for deactivation of the sars cov 2 under laboratory and natural environmental conditions 10 conclusion the ongoing pandemic forced too many stresses on all communities from different aspects these pressures on people in developing countries and poor communities are more than in high income countries because of the lower standard of living also increasing the number of infections imposes many environmental barriers to water bodies and aquatic environments by contaminating them with the virus using sodis system regarding the potential ineffectiveness for eliminating pathogens in this case the sars cov 2 during a situation like the covid 19 pandemic or any similar situation that water bodies are contaminated could have many risks to open a new route for infection and transmission however the infectious by water matrices remains in question due to lack of valid data and many uncertainties that involve but researchers have speculations about the infection of individuals due to contaminated water 7 92 once again it should be reminded that when the rate of fatalities are more than it was anticipated before 122 any possibility about the sars cov 2 transmission must be consider by experts in related fields that means new ideas and theories which are based on concrete pieces of evidences should be embraced by scientific community 119 credit authorship contribution statement seyed masoud parsa conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing

13338,long is the way and hard that out of covid 19 leads up to light the virus is highly contagious and spread rapidly and the number of infections increases exponentially the colossal number of infections and presence of the novel coronavirus rna in human wastes e g excreta urine even after the patients recovered and the rt pcr tests were negative results in massive load of the viral in water environments numerous studies reported the presence of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples the risk of contaminating water bodies in the regions which suffer from the lack of proper sanitation system and wastewater treatment plants mostly in developing countries is higher since solar water disinfection sodis is usually used by people in developing countries there is a concern about using this method during the pandemic because the sars cov 2 can be eliminated by high temperature 56 c and uvc wavelength 100 280 nm while sodis systems mainly work at lower temperature 45 c and use the available uva 315 400 nm thus during a situation like the ongoing pandemic using sodis method for wastewater treatment or providing drinking water is not a reliable method it should be reminded that the main aim of the present study is not just to give insights about the possibilities and risks of using sodis during the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect for any future outbreak pandemic that results in biological contamination of water bodies nevertheless some experimental studies seem to be necessary by all researchers under conditions similar to developing countries graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords solar disinfection sodis water treatment uv disinfection developing countries novel coronavirus contaminated water 1 introduction covid 19 is more than a health crisis millions have lost their jobs the global economy is headed for the sharpest contraction since the great depression the political economic and social effect of the pandemic will be felt for years to come we should be all in this together dr tedros adhanom director general of the world health organization the world was surprised at the end of 2019 with shocking news about the advent of a new virus from the family of coronaviridae 1 although the beginning of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 sars cov 2 firstly was reported by chinese officials at the end days of 2019 and in more than 2000 papers researchers mentioned the city of wuhan in their abstract as the starting point of the pandemic 2 but there are some pieces of concrete evidence about the presence of the sars cov 2 in different locations long time before the chinese announcement such striking instances has created many doubts about the main origination of the virus since the viral rna was detected in wastewater samples of spain 3 and brazil 4 eleven and four months before the first case was confirmed by the officials of those countries respectively this means that the exact origination of the pandemic is quite vague the contradiction of these reports steps the crucial importance of water and wastewater bodies in detecting some kind of epidemic into the spotlight before it becomes to a catastrophic pandemic like the covid 19 since the beginning of the pandemic the experts of wastewater based epidemiology wbe have conducted numerous researches throughout the world to examine the presence of the sars cov 2 in various wastewater samples 5 the presence of the sars cov 2 in various water bodies increases because of human excreta and urine that release into the aquatic environment through wastewater mostly in developing countries and wastewater treatment plants wwtps however there are various routes for transmitting the virus into the aquatic environment while the dominant transmission route of the sars cov 2 is mainly established via the respiratory system but there are anxieties over the effects opening new windows for transmitting the virus when the infected gastrointestinal glandular implied the potential transmission via fecal oral 6 newly probability transmission of the sars cov 2 through water media has raised many questions 7 furthermore it was stated due to the heavy load of the viral concentration in water bodies during the ongoing pandemic using solar water desalination system to provide drinking water by desalinating impure water has too many risks 8 therefore any water related system and facility can be encounter with contamination of the virus and it can become a possible route to spread the sars cov 2 1 1 the objective of the present study the main objective of the present study is to examine the effectiveness of sodis method during the ongoing pandemic by focusing on the two important parameters that the novel coronavirus and the sodis system have in common the review organized in several steps and it is recommended to be meticulously followed by readers to realize the main concept in the first step the general concept of the sodis systems is briefly introduced in the second step some parameters that have an effect on the performance of sodis such as the type of uv content free radicals etc are presented in the third step the photo reactivation process is discussed to show the uv damage on the pathogen s genome and the repair mechanism while application of sodis for virus eliminating virus structure and mechanism and resistance of viral inactivation through uv and temperature in the fourth section is discussed the paper is followed in the fifth section by focusing on the contamination of water bodies to justify the fact that the feed water for sodis systems can be heavily polluted by human waste through wastewater and wastewater treatment plants which result in biological contamination the sixth section brought the importance of the fifth section into the spotlight by validating the presence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater groundwater surface water and rivers that discussed in numerous studies the seventh section is the most important part of this study because it discusses two important factors that the sars cov 2 and sodis systems are severely affected by which are uv and temperature in the first section i e 7 1 vulnerability of the virus to temperature is presented while the second sub section i e 7 2 discusses on the effect of various types of uv on the viability of the virus in the eighth section the risks of using sodis systems during the ongoing pandemic by considering the earlier discussions in the seventh section and focusing on the effect of uv and temperature are presented eventually in the ninth section summaries concluding remarks and future studies are recommended it should be noted that the reason for brought a comprehensive content about the effective parameters on the sodis performance damage and repair mechanism of pathogen s structure discussing the pollution of water environments by pathogens etc is to show that the present study is not limited to the ongoing pandemic but it has broader prospect about any possibility for the future outbreak pandemic that results to contaminate aquatic environment throughout the world 2 solar water disinfection more than half of the world population 4 billion is living in conditions that face with severe water scarcity at least one month of each year 9 while consuming contaminated water from available water resources by people lead to a high risk of waterborne diseases especially in poor and rural communities the importance of the providing safe drinking water can be elucidated when we consider that the un in two of the most important action plans called mdgs and sdgs between 2000 and 2030 assigned a specific goal to water 10 the importance of providing safe drinking water is more critical in low income and developing countries because of poor sanitation networks and insufficient improper lack of wastewater treatment plants wwtp a well known instance is brazil which has one of the largest water resources in the world but due to the poor sanitation system and lack of proper wwtps many areas of the country have limited access to adequate drinkable water resources 11 and people confronted many problems through contaminated water solar based systems such as solar stills and solar water disinfection sodis are proper options for extremely remote regions as well as low income and poor communities 12 15 the sodis is a point of use water treatment method that has been used all over the world especially in asia latin america and africa 16 nearly 5 000 000 people in almost 50 countries through the world are using this method for their daily consumption most of them are located in developing countries with limited access to a source of a safe drinking water 16 in these countries waterborne pathogens such as escherichia coli salmonella vibrio cholera giardia cryptosporidium 17 etc cause serious and even life threatening diseases the sodis is known as a low cost household water treatment and storage hwts method by which pathogenic microorganisms are eliminated through solar radiation and mild temperature it is drastically cheaper than filtration chlorination even than solar stills 12 17 in this method a transparent container is filled with contaminated water and exposed to direct sunlight for at least 6 8 h 17 usually containers are chose from domestic plastic or glass bottles plastic bottles are used more frequently because they are cheaper and more resistant but they should be replaced every six months because prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause to the leaching of plastic materials into water 17 it is recommended to consume solar disinfected water within 24 h because of the possibility of post exposure regrowth of pathogenic microorganisms 17 the exact mechanism of the sodis is still unclear but it is obvious that damage to the dna protein increasing cell wall permeability have significant roles in the process the sensitivity of pathogen available uv content reactive oxygen species ross water ambient temperatures and exposure time are the main factors in the germicidal effect of the sodis method that some of them are discussed in the following 2 1 hydroxyl and dioxygen radicals generated by photons photosensitizers are endogenous or exogenous molecules that can produce ross by reducing oxygen when they are excited by light ross have a role in physiological reactions as secondary messengers 18 under normal conditions the balance between production and elimination of ros is controlled by a scavenging system to maintain cellular homeostasis 19 but under oxidative stress conditions excessive production of ros can cause many problems for the cell enzymes such as catalase cat and superoxide dismutase sod provide cellular defense against ros and protect cells from radical attacks 18 these enzymes can be inactivated by photons 18 which has an important role in solar disinfection ross can cause oxidative damage to dna and other cell components 16 18 19 it produces pyrimidine dimers and single strand breaks ssbs which are lethal to the cell 18 20 it can also affect cell membrane penetration by inducing oxidation reactions to hydroxyl groups of cell wall and cell membrane 21 22 typically during the soids process two kinds of radicals are generated hydroxyl radicals oh and dioxygen radicals 1o2 the first one usually considers a powerful oxidant while the second one is a moderate oxidant generally the predominant cause of pathogen annihilation in the case of protozoa and bacteria by hydroxyl radicals is damaging cell membrane through oxidizing lipid 23 24 since hydroxyl radicals are exceedingly reactive they have a short lifetime and they are generated on site by regular advanced oxidation process aop by ultraviolet activation of hydrogen peroxide or ozone 25 however generating this kind of hydroxyl for small and poor communities has difficulties because of excessive demand for electrical energy and chemicals while other methods such as tio2 based photocatalysis given the same results in the absence of aforementioned challenges 25 nevertheless one of the well known obstacles for hydroxyl radicals in water treatment is removing the generated oh by natural organic matters which is not an implausible phenomenon in wastewater especially in complex water matrices which results in to drastically decline the effectiveness of the disinfection process 26 although by combining stored hydrogen peroxide with harvested solar energy for photocatalytic synthesize to produce oh one of the obstacles that is the constant presence of solar radiation to produce oh in solar based water treatment systems is addressed but this method also has the disadvantage of reducing singlet oxygen to hydrogen peroxide instead of h2o or simply catalytic selectivity furthermore another method to produce oh such as utilizing fenton catalyst is still on laboratory scale and it applications under real conditions is not realized yet conversely moderate oxidants such as singlet oxygen 1o2 is stable higher which means that they have less reactivity compared to powerful oxidants oh in comparison to oh radicals they have a longer lifetime which means this kind of radicals can go farther distant from the site of origination this is a huge advantage for the 1o2 radicals to remain effective in complex water matrices with a high natural organic matter in contrast to oh radicals that loss their effectiveness in complex water matrices due to a higher rate of reactivity 26 28 while our focus in the present study is viruses specifically the sars cov 2 we have not discussed the inactivation mechanism of bacteria via singlet oxygen however the inactivation mechanism of bacteria by 1o2 is extensively discussed before 29 singlet oxygen considers as a powerful disinfectant against enveloped viruses when 1o2 is reacting with lipid the fluidity of the membrane is decreases which results in an increase in the energy requisite for host binding subsequently impede the membrane bind to the host cell 30 conversely the non enveloped virus inactivation mechanism is leaned by damaging the genomic and capsid which is not our concern in the present study to reinforce the effectiveness of this method of disinfection i e producing 1o2 using fullerene that leads to a high yield of 1o2 is also considered but such photosensitizers should be separated before the water is consumed by individuals it should be noted that by separating photosensitizers performance of the system is severely affected and diminished 31 33 2 2 effect of uv on the performance of sodis the uv considered as one of the powerful tools for inactivating biologically contaminated water due to some advantages such as the absence of generating by products during the disinfection process in contrast with other methods like chlorination briefly uv types were categorized based on their wavelength as the a type 315 400 nm the b type 280 315 nm and the c type 100 280 nm which abbreviated as the uva uvb and uvc wavelengths respectively 16 optical inactivation of pathogens is practical when the solar intensity and available uv is strong enough to damage to the pathogen s structure however in the case of sodis we should not count only on the most available uv on the earth which is uva 315 400 nm there is a huge difference between uv germicide microbicide irradiance and the uva wavelength the effective uv irradiance is directly damaged to the genome of pathogens while the effectual wavelength for this phenomenon is below 280 nm somewhere in 260 265 nm which is the highest uv absorption of nucleic acid 34 because photons of the uva wavelength are considered as low energy photon while high energy photons in uvc wavelength are strong enough to damage the genome of pathogens in this regard we cannot rely on the effectiveness of the uva even by using solar reflectors to increase the uv irradiance by collecting not only the direct uv but also the diffuse on cloudy days the energy of photons would not change and the only difference is increasing the available uva 35 however in recent years using lanthanide elements 36 to convert photons of visible light with lower energy into photons with higher energy in the uvc region is proposed as a solution but application of these materials due to the high rate of reactivity and low quantum yield is remained on the laboratory scale 2 3 temperature contribution to effectiveness of the sodis thermal contribution to the solar disinfection process is considerable but its importance varies in different seasons the effect of thermal stress is significant above the optimum temperature for the growth of microorganisms as the structure and activity of enzymes will be affected 22 for instance most of the fecal bacteria are mesophilic withstanding between the temperature of 20 45 c 17 this means that inactivation through the effect of temperature is more possible above this point i e 45 c which means that below 45 c the effect of temperature on bacterial inactivation is negligible 37 38 thus the removal of microorganisms through solar disinfection is severely limited in winter the thermal effect depends on the volume and turbidity of water and also environmental conditions thermal stress facilitates the process of dna damage and inhibits dna repair mechanisms 16 39 it increases the cell wall permeability 39 limits the enzymatic activities 17 22 and also leads to protein denaturation which all of them are lethal to cells in temperatures beyond 45 c a synergy between thermal and optical inactivation is reported by many researchers 16 18 37 39 which improves the solar disinfection performance but it is effective in specific cases under specific conditions sichel et al 40 examined the effect of environmental conditions for removing e coli by the sodis method their results showed that the temperature of water in the warmest months of the year july did not exceed 40 c mcguigan et al 38 simulated the process of sodis by considering the effect of temperature turbidity and optical irradiation findings revealed that for complete inactivation of pathogens the water temperature should reach 55 c while it was reported that in field investigations under real conditions for several experiments the temperature of water did not even reach 45 c 41 rincon et al showed that the temperature of water in sodis with and without tio2 photocatalyst from 32 6 c and 36 6 c reaches 39 c and 38 6 c respectively 35 moreover under real conditions in winter and summer the water temperature cannot further than 30 c and it is in the range of 15 21 c and 25 30 c respectively 42 it can be concluded that the temperature of water regarding the results of numerous experiments in cold seasons is always quite low whereas in warm seasons just in rare cases the temperature is higher than 45 c 2 4 time of exposure time of exposure is another important factor in solar disinfection which is affected by environmental conditions such as wind speed solar intensity and ambient temperature 43 and it depends on the type of pathogen and its features for instance full sunshine can eliminate the somatic phage 44 and bovine rotaviruses in less than 3 h 45 but on the contrary the t2 phage is not inactivated even after 8 h 16 in another study enterococcus faecalis salmonella spp and staphylococcus aureus exposed to sunlight and 4 log10 cfu 100 ml in 6 h were obtained but as the exposure time increased to 8 h the concentration reduced to below the detectable level 22 in suitable conditions most waterborne pathogenic bacteria such as e coli are removable within 6 h which makes many diseases preventable 16 table 1 gives the sodis application for various types of pathogens considering the rate of reduction time of exposure and solar intensity 3 damage and repair mechanism in pathogens numerous parameters can be contributed to the inactivation of pathogens however the most important parameters that can be affected the performance of the sodis system and damaging dna rna structure which is mentioned before as the ultraviolet irradiance the temperature of water thermal inactivation various ross i e hydroxyl and dioxygen radicals and time of exposure ultraviolet radiation ross and thermal inactivation can directly and indirectly threaten cells by inducing dna and protein damage for instance the irritation of dna caused by direct uv can cause a connection between two adjacent pyrimidine bases by covalent bonds and make pyrimidine dimers 16 these dimers include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpd and 6 4 photoproducts which are two of the most mutagenic dna lesions 21 53 cpds are the most cytotoxic lesions which make up around 75 of uv induced dna damage products while 4 6 photoproducts are less abundant but they are more lethal 21 since it inhibited the progress of dna polymerase 21 it can cause problems in dna multiplication also the rna polymerases are stalling at these regions 21 thus transcription and translation may be eliminated hence unrepaired dna lesions can lead to mutation and inactivation of microorganisms 21 organisms have dna repair mechanisms to remove dna lesions and prevent their lethal effects the photo reactivation process fig 1 is a common and simple mechanism for removing uv induced dna lesions which is done by photolyase enzyme 21 54 in the photo reactivation process pyrimidine dimers in dna are recognized by photolyase under near uv light 310 480 nm 53 flavin adenine dinucleotide fad and methyltetrahydrofolate mthf are the two co factors that are significant for this enzymatic function 54 the mthf absorbs energy and gets excited then transduces an electron to fad subsequently it reduces to fadh2 the fadh2 transfers the high energy electron to the dimer and makes radicals these pyrimidine dimers become highly unstable so they separate into two pyrimidines and the dna becomes fixed 55 so these repairs reduce the efficacy of uv disinfection 53 4 effectiveness of sodis for virus removal among waterborne pathogens viruses are usually more resistant to environmental inactivation 56 while their low infectious dose makes them more dangerous to the public health 57 in the section 2 we discussed about the important parameters on the sodis performance however in the present study uv effect and thermal heating are the main factors in the sodis process since these parameters are critical in inactivation the novel coronavirus among three types of uv just the uva wavelength and a small part of uvb reach on the surface of earth 21 58 and the uvc wavelength is completely absorbed by the ozone layer however it should be reminded that the effective germicidal type of uv is the uvc wavelength and the uva wavelength which is the most abundant type of uv on the earth has not a direct effect on genome s structure and its impact generally defined through the formation of ross 16 21 as it discussed before viruses like other pathogens can be damaged by the direct effect of uv on the genome and indirect endogenous or exogenous effect 59 endogenous when the sensitizer molecules are a part of the virus itself and exogenous when they are in water 51 generally caused by ross 60 61 by considering the simple structure of viruses we can overlook the endogenous damage 59 62 it was reported that f dna coliphages were only sensitive to direct inactivation while f rna coliphages were also susceptible to indirect exogenous inactivation 52 human adenovirus hadv human rotavirus hrov prd1 and ms2 are more susceptible to exogenous indirect inactivation unlike poliovirus porcine rotavirus f dna coliphages which are not much sensitive to exogenous sensitizers 52 it should be mentioned that the most resistant viruses in the light mediated inactivation are double stranded dna dsdna double stranded rna dsrna and single stranded rna ssrna genome 63 the reason for considering dsdna viruses as the most resistant against radiation 52 is that they have more redundant genetic information as well as ability to be repaired in the host cell 64 while in the case of rna viruses the resistance is because of the fact that they have uracil instead of thymine and uracil dimer reactions have less quantum function than the corresponding thymine dimer reactions in dna 65 67 ms2 and adenovirus indicated similar inactivation rate although adenovirus has a longer genome and absorbs more light the reason is that adenovirus is a dsdna virus which can repair uv induced damage on dna 62 direct and indirect viral inactivation against ms2 phix174 and adenovirus has been studied by mattle et al 62 findings revealed that phix174 is the most susceptible one in direct inactivation but the most resistant one in indirect inactivation through reactive species it states that inactivation is mostly through direct process but o2 was also able to disinfect ms2 and adenovirus the main photo inactivation of viruses on the surface of earth is in the range of uvb 280 320 nm 59 as we mentioned most of the uvb wavelength cannot reach on the surface of earth which may be the reason of ineffectiveness of solar disinfection on viruses and it can even become worse when uv intensity decreases for instance coxsackievirus could be completely inactivated under simulated sodis condition at optical irradiance 550 w m2 within 2 h at 45 c 50 while it was just partially inactivated by exposing it to the irradiance of 75 w m2 for 6 h at maximum temperature of 34 c 68 polo et al experimentally examined the effectiveness of sodis for eliminating the hepatitis a virus hav and murine norovirus mnv experiments conducted between 2 and 8 h exposure findings showed that around 0 81log10 and 1 1log10 reduction for hepatitis a virus hav and murine norovirus mnv achieved respectively if time of exposure is 8 h 51 among studied viruses hadv and ms2 seem to be the most resistant viruses against environmental inactivation 52 these results suggested that the uv content temperature and time are important parameters for an effective sodis process however sunlight intensity i e available uv content is the most important factor in viral disinfection in comparison with temperature or time of exposure 51 because high temperature just can effectively harm capsid proteins but it s not much operative on the genome s structure 69 71 in viruses at temperatures above 40 c there is a thermal optic synergy which means that as temperature increases more viruses can be inactivated in exchange for each photon 59 however researchers concluded that complete viral disinfection through the sodis process is not possible under natural conditions 57 therefore it needs more treatment time and even some interventions for total inactivation fig 2 shows some of the most important parameters that have effect on viral inactivation 5 contamination of rivers lakes surface water and groundwater nearly one third of the world civilization is living next to the big rivers and their floodplains but in recent years anthropogenic barriers are a force to transboundary rivers and these regions results in many problems for occupants 72 there are two important sources for pollution of water bodies in the globe which one of them is the human wastes 72 thus contamination of water bodies via open drainage and wastewater is a common phenomenon throughout the world especially in low income and developing countries for example in vietnam 73 the lack of wwtp leads to contamination of sai dong nai rivers and groundwater which provide 1 2 million m3 day water of ho chi minh city in kenya 74 open dumping of wastes in the absence of tight regulations results in heavy contamination of surface groundwater while it was reported that in nigeria around 90 of hospital wastes without any treatment discharge into the surrounding environment 75 in some of the african low income countries such as benin ghana and mali farmers utilized sludge and wastes as fertilizer by bribing to drivers of septic tanks 76 77 which is highly dangerous because some epidemic in the past returned to communities because of direct use of sludge 78 79 in some of countries in south america between 60 to 70 wastewater left out to the water environments without treatment while almost forty percent of people in these regions are not linked to sewage systems 80 for example a big city like quito with 3 million occupants in ecuador treated only 3 of its wastewater 81 moreover it was reported that around 75 of wastewater 45 000 l s in mexico city drained to the environment without any formal treatment 82 some of the famous rivers in india such as the ganges the gomti and the varanasi which are heavily polluted by direct discharge of human wastes and untreated wastewater lead to many waterborne diseases 83 84 although wwtps in industrialized and high income countries are effective to prevent the contamination of water bodies by wastewater but contamination by combined sewer flows csos is still inevitable in these countries 85 it should be pointed out that complete elimination of pathogens in wwtps is not plausible because of inefficient wwtps high resistance of some pathogens and high concentration of biological contamination in wastewater while presence of pathogens in treated wastewater in high income countries that have high standards for wwtp facilities is proved the situation in low income and developing countries most of which have not wwtp or effective water treatment facilities is certainly worse than it can be imagined it is worthy to be mentioned that some well known transboundary rivers and basins polluted by pathogens of wastewaters such as amazon congo parana nile yenisey lena zambezi niger amur indus mekong and salween to name a few 86 in this regard contamination of natural water bodies 87 88 rivers 89 groundwater 90 and freshwater environment 91 via the sars cov 2 become to the one of main concerns of all researchers 6 presence of the sars cov 2 in wastewater presence of the sars cov 2 in water bodies may occur via different routes some of these routes can be the main source of contamination such as wastewater drainage and direct discharging without treatment while some other routes like disposing personal protection equipment ppe in the environment aquatic environment open defecation etc are not consider as a major source of contamination fig 3 wastewater sewer network and open discharging are the main reasons that lead to entering pathogens bacteria virus and protozoan into the water bodies in huge cities a large amount of wastewater results in a high load of coronaviruses because of the population 92 an efficient sewer system can dilute viral load subsequently decreases the presence of the sars cov 2 in an aquatic environment but the large number of infected inhabitants by the virus in mega cities increases the rate of viral load enters to the water bodies 92 presence of the sars cov 2 in wastewater at the beginning of the pandemic was reported in different regions of the world 93 human urine and excreta consider as one of the main reasons which enter the sars cov 2 in water bodies via sewer network researchers in numerous studies were detected presence of the sars cov 2 in the stool of patients even though their respiratory tests are negative 6 further it was reported that the virus in human feces based on the environmental conditions can be prolonged between 11 and 35 days 94 this is highlighted the fact that if a patient is healed and recovered after infection by the virus the feces that contain the viral rna still can increase the load of the virus into the sewer network and subsequently increase the concentration of virion in wastewaters however it should be reminded that the exact infectivity of the sars cov 2 in wastewater is not scrutinized yet 7 besides the lack of wwtps and direct discharging of wastewater like the city of quito the fast rate of infectious that results in a higher rate of infected persons waste entrance to the sewer network increases the risk of a heavy concentration of the virus in water bodies among ten samples of secondary treated wastewater the sars cov 2 rna is detected in 20 of the samples in japan while the existence of the virus in 3 rivers is not confirmed which indicated that the low prevalence of the covid 19 in the region results in the absence of virus rna at those water bodies 95 also it was disclosed about 83 and 11 of untreated and secondary treated wastewater are contaminated by the covid 19 virus it was declared that around 65 of collected sewage samples during october 2019 to february 2020 are polluted by the sars cov 2 suggesting the circulation of the virus in italy months before starting the ongoing pandemic 96 experiments on 8 and 23 samples of treated and untreated wastewater from different sources in paris confirmed the existence of the sars cov 2 respectively 97 furthermore presence of the novel coronavirus in treated wastewater of nine wwtps stepped into the spotlight the fact that conventional wwtps such as active sludge are ineffective for removing the virus in polluted water suggesting advanced methods such as ozonation and membrane treatment 98 it is important to notice that the sars cov 2 is still detected in secondary treated wastewater of wwtps which is commonly utilized by industrialized and high income countries even though a high load of the sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater 107 gc l and treated wastewater removing 1 2 log10 is confirmed before but significance or insignificance risks of the virus concentration on water bodies as well as transmission to the human is unclear yet presently the minimum infectious dose mid of the sars cov 2 which is the number of virion particles that result in infection for humans is unknown 5 nevertheless the expeditious dissemination of the disease suggests that the mid of the novel coronavirus is low similar to other enveloped viruses 99 in this regard whether the concentration of the sars cov 2 in water bodies is high risk or not any possibility about transmission of the virus via water bodies should be considered to impede unexpected consequences 100 7 parameters influencing for inactivation of the sars cov 2 during the covid 19 pandemic numerous studies with different approaches and conditions for inactivating the novel coronavirus are performed castano et al in a preprint categorized the inactivation methods of the sars cov 2 to utilizing plasma ozone coating surfaces with prominent antimicrobial materials such as copper cu and silver ag heat treatment uv irradiance utilizing different chemical compounds 101 furthermore other unconventional methods such as using gamma ray 102 bio based inactivation methods like bio active lipid 103 and nanomaterial 104 are examined and proposed by many scientists however several studies focused on the environmental parameters that have impacted on viability of the sras cov 2 such as the fixation retention ph temperature and solar radiation for example it was reported that ph in a wide range ph 3 10 has an insignificant effect on the sras cov 2 105 while at extreme ph range 2 3 11 12 the virus lost its infectious just in one day 106 among all of the aforementioned parameters we stepped the effect of temperature thermal inactivation heating and uv into the spotlight because these two parameters 7 1 susceptibility of covs to temperature as discussed before in the sodis process the two parameters of temperature and uv are crucial for an effective performance since the family of the coronavirus is vulnerable to temperature it was reported that various types of coronavirus such as hcov 229e sars cov 1 mers cov hcov oc43 tgev mcov and sars cov 2 on different surfaces steel glass paper cloth latex ceramic wood and cardboard in the temperature range of 4 25 c can survive between several hours to 28 days 107 furthermore the impact of temperature on the survival of the coronavirus family in different liquids such as dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem minimum essential medium mem hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid hepes phosphate buffered saline pbs including water is realized it was reported that for the aforementioned families of the coronavirus in a temperature between 4 and 80 c the virus can remain viable around 1 min up to 49 days respectively the lowest temperature leads to higher survival time and vice versa 107 these results elucidate the important fact that the family of the coronavirus is tremendously susceptible to temperature in this regard some researchers focused on the effect of temperature on the viability of the sars cov 2 for instance it was proved that by immersing face masks in the water at 56 c for half an hour the virus is eliminated and the masks can be reused 108 chin et al reported that the variation of temperature highly affected viability of the sars cov 2 where at 4 c just 0 7log10 reduction was observed and the virus remained active for 14 days but at 70 c the virus is inactivated in 5 min 105 another study declared that the sars cov 2 virus suspended in solution in temperatures 4 20 25 and 33 37 c remains viable up to 14 7 and 1 2 days respectively 106 recently survival of the novel coronavirus in different solutions such as tap water autoclave wastewater and untreated wastewater for a varied range of temperature is realized the results revealed that the t90 of the sars cov 2 for the temperatures of 4 c 15 c 25 c and 37 c for untreated wastewater autoclaved wastewater and tap water are varied between 8 27 5 43 and 9 58 days respectively 109 7 2 effect of uv on the sars covs various types of uv and their wavelengths are presented in the previous sections effect of various types of uv on the family of coronavirus is also examined after the sars cov 1 outbreak several studies were conducted on the effect of various types of uv on viability of the sars cov 1 it was examined that uva cannot be effective enough to eliminate the sars cov 1 110 while removing the virus by uvc was completely achieved 110 however in another study complete inactivation of the sars cov 1by utilizing uvc was not achieved 111 which means that the results of different studies are not conclusive currently numerous studies on the effect of the uv irradiance on elimination of the sars cov 2 were conducted which most of them are focused on utilizing uvc it was declared that the uvc wavelength is strong enough for eliminating the sars cov 2 in different surfaces 112 114 kitagawa et al 115 reported 88 5 99 7 diminishment in the sars cov 2 concentration on different surfaces using uvc 222 nm while heilingloh et al 116 reported the minimum dose of uvc for complete inactivating of the sars cov 2 is 1048 mj cm2 moreover rapid inactivation of the dried sar cov 2 on steel in 6 8 min can be attained by uvb irradiance with simulated natural light in the indoor experiment 117 still the effect of various types of uv on contaminated solutions by sars cov 2 remains unknown since the uvc is completely absorbed in the atmosphere and just 5 of uvb is reaching on the earth the most abundant type of uv is uva but based on experiments the uva has an insignificant effect for deactivating the sars cov 2 virus 116 however based on a model the uva may have a contribution to inactivate the virus 118 but it should reminded that during a devastating incident such as the covid 19 scientists and governments should avoid any announcement speculation and assumption in the absence of concrete scientific evidence 119 in fact the peak of absorbing the ultraviolet radiation in the nucleic acid of the viral is between 260 and 265 nm the uvc range which is placed in the optimum and effective range of germicidal wavelength 34 since the uv wavelength below 320 nm consider as actinic and absorption of the uva by the viral nucleic acid is inadequate at wavelength 320 nm the uva generally has not germicidal effect 34 the wavelength has a reverse relationship with its germicidal characteristics which means by decreasing the wavelength germicidal effect is increases and vice versa 120 while the main effect of the uv irradiance in sodis translates by the formation of ross rather than the direct effect yet there is no research on the effect of excessive ross on the sars cov 2 rna however we should emphasize that viruses are always introduced as one of the most resistant pathogens in the sodis 8 what is the risk of using sodis during the pandemic as mentioned above the ongoing pandemic contaminated water bodies in different regions of the world whether in industrialized and high income countries or in the developing world while presence of the sars cov 2 in a high income country like japan 95 with high standard of wwtps in secondary treated wastewater is detected the situation in the developing countries which most of them have no access to wwtps and proper sanitation system is certainly worse solar disinfection is a technology that is used in developing countries rather than high income countries and the number of people that used this method to consume drinkable water is significant the effectiveness of the sodis system is depended on various parameters which the most important of them are uv water temperature ross and type of pathogens generally the sodis method is more preferable and practical for contaminated water with bacteria rather than viruses because among the waterborne diseases viruses are the most resistant type compare to the others 56 two important parameters that are directly related to effectiveness of the sodis performance as well as resistance and survivability of the sars cov 2 are temperature and uv in the literature we discuss the effect of each of these parameters on both of them in numerous studies researchers declared that the uvc wavelength is strong enough to eliminate the virus on different surfaces 112 114 however effect of the uvc on the sars cov 2 virus in solutions various water matrices such as contaminated water is not realized yet and it is not clear that how the uvc wavelength is effective for inactivating the virus in different solutions on the other hand the sodis method mainly relies on the direct and indirect effect of uv irradiance while the most abundant available uv uva is not adequately powerful to affect the genome directly and its effect is generally through the formation of ros 16 21 as we mentioned before viruses like other pathogens can be damaged by a direct effect on the genome and indirect endogenous or exogenous effect while due to simple structure of viruses the endogenous damage can be overlooked 59 the main photo inactivation of viruses on the surface of the earth is in the range of 280 315 nm of wavelengths uvb 59 while only 5 of the uvb is available on the earth and just a small amount of available uvb can be absorbed by genome 21 although the direct effect of uva on the sars cov 2 is not realized yet but regarding numerous studies for inactivation of the novel coronavirus by uv it can be concluded that the available uv on earth i e type a 315 400 nm is not strong enough to damage the viral rna it should be mentioned that the effective wavelength for direct damage of the genome of pathogens and highest absorption of the uv by nucleic acid is between 250 and 270 nm which is the uvc wavelength regions 33 34 119 furthermore using up conversion materials lanthanide elements to turn the uva into uvc wavelength is still stuck in laboratory stages and has many obstacles such as low quantum yield and high reactivity in this regard it is worthy to be mentioned that materials with high efficiency should be utilized to reach a significant level of inactivating pathogens in water to avoid the mechanism of repair the indirect effect of uv by producing free radicals is also questionable powerful oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals are short lived and tremendously reactive and subsequently it is not effective in complex water matrices which contains natural organic matters such as wastewaters 25 26 furthermore effect of the singlet oxygen radicals which is more effective in complex water matrices as well as on enveloped viruses remains in question because the photosensitizers should separate from the water before it consumes by individuals which leads to decrease the effectiveness of sodis system 33 as mentioned before the sars cov 2 virus is highly vulnerable to an increase in temperature and it can be eliminated because of the destruction of its lipid and protein thus thermal inactivation is proposed as a powerful method to eliminate the virus it should be mentioned that viability of the virus has an inverse relation with temperature as it discussed before the t90 of the sars cov 2 for various temperatures 4 c 15 c 25 c and 37 c in different wastewater samples is varied between 5 and 58 days 109 fig 4 whereas in the sodis method under real conditions based on experiments temperature of water is below 40 c and even in ideal conditions i e summer conditions when solar intensity and ambient temperature stands at the highest point the water temperature may not reach 40 c 35 40 42 the low temperature of water in the sodis has two issues first the synergistic effect of temperature with uv can be obtained only and if only the water temperature is higher than 45 c 38 while for temperature 45 c ideal conditions are required i e hot summers secondly at lower temperatures the sars cov 2 virus is more resistant and it can remain viable where at 37 c the t90 for different types of wastewater samples and tap water contaminated by the novel coronavirus is around 5 8 days 109 moreover in other seasons except summer the environmental condition is not suitable for the sodis due to the lower solar intensity and ambient temperature of water is low subsequently the viral would be remaining longer days viable in water up to 58 days to overcome the problem of uv and low temperature in sodis up conversion materials and nanoparticles for turning the uva to uvc and increasing the water temperature by trapping light and taking the advantage of heat localization 36 121 are proposed but neither of these solutions approaches to practical application that can be widely used by poor communities because of obstacles specific characteristics of materials cost of materials advanced methods for preparing the apparatus in mass production thus these methods remain in laboratory scales 9 summaries concluding remarks and knowledge gaps in the present study reliability of solar water disinfection during the covid 19 pandemic is discussed the following summaries and remarks can be concluded a huge amount of water bodies via different routes are contaminated due to the ongoing pandemic presence of the sars cov 2 in different water matrices including untreated wastewater treated wastewater rivers freshwater environment and groundwater is detected all around the globe presence of the virus at higher concentration at water bodies in developing countries due to absence or ineffective sanitation system and wwtps is higher than industrialized and high income countries the novel coronavirus can be viable within several days 5 58 days in different temperatures and different solutions solar radiation temperature physicochemical characteristics of water features of virus type and length of the genome composition of adjacent pyrimidine dimers or guanine content are the factors that affect sunlight mediated disinfection of viruses uv irradiance and temperature are the two important effective parameters that sodis and novel coronavirus have in common typically the sodis method is more practical for contaminated water by bacteria than viruses most of studies in sodis system focused on eliminating various type of the bacteria rather than other pathogens the most abundant available type of uv on the surface of earth uva is not strong enough to eliminate viruses the effectiveness of uva in the sodis system is through formation of ross the effective uv wavelength for viral eliminating is in the range of 100 280 nm which consider as the uvc to achieve the synergistic effect of thermal optic in viral deactivation the temperature of water should be higher than 40 c performance of sodis in cold seasons is tremendously decreases because of the lower ambient temperature and solar i e available uv intensity the sars cov 2 virus in temperature of 37 c remains viable in autoclave wastewater untreated wastewater and tap water around 5 8 and 9 days respectively in sodis system reaching to higher temperature 40 c of water can be realize only in summer and hot climate conditions rate of reduction for the novel coronavirus in different medium surfaces solutions etc has an inverse relation with temperature the critical temperature for killing the sars cov 2 is 56 c its eliminated in less than 30 min while most of sodis systems worked at temperature lower than 45 c furthermore the following are recommended as the post pandemic studies realizing the effectiveness of sodis system with contaminated water by the novel coronavirus in different seasons especially cold seasons determining the important parameters on the performance of sodis system fed by sars cov 2 contaminated water such as variable uv intensity water temperature turbidity time of exposure how the available uva can affected the sras cov 2 viability in contaminated water how concentration of the virus during the sodis process is changed when one parameter is variable and the other parameters are constant determining the effect of originated free radicals during the sodis process i e hydroxyl and dioxygen on viability of the sars cov 2 in water how different physical modifications for sodis containers such as increasing the rate of absorption in containers can affected viability of the virus how utilizing advance materials such as lanthanide elements during the sodis process would be practical in eliminating the sars cov 2 in contaminated water determining the proper dosage of uvb for deactivation of the sars cov 2 under laboratory and natural environmental conditions 10 conclusion the ongoing pandemic forced too many stresses on all communities from different aspects these pressures on people in developing countries and poor communities are more than in high income countries because of the lower standard of living also increasing the number of infections imposes many environmental barriers to water bodies and aquatic environments by contaminating them with the virus using sodis system regarding the potential ineffectiveness for eliminating pathogens in this case the sars cov 2 during a situation like the covid 19 pandemic or any similar situation that water bodies are contaminated could have many risks to open a new route for infection and transmission however the infectious by water matrices remains in question due to lack of valid data and many uncertainties that involve but researchers have speculations about the infection of individuals due to contaminated water 7 92 once again it should be reminded that when the rate of fatalities are more than it was anticipated before 122 any possibility about the sars cov 2 transmission must be consider by experts in related fields that means new ideas and theories which are based on concrete pieces of evidences should be embraced by scientific community 119 credit authorship contribution statement seyed masoud parsa conceptualization methodology investigation visualization writing

13339,solar light driven photocatalysis is an emerging renewable and sustainable approach in environmental remediation to mitigate organic pollutants from waste water zinc sulfide quantum dots zns qds have been utilized because of their larger surface area low cost abundant active sites non toxic nature aqueous insolubility and good thermal stability ascribing to the quantum confinement effect the accumulation of the electrons inside the qds leads to an increase in the light absorption range herein the effect of various parameters like ph and temperature variation are summarized that determines the size and varied morphologies of zns qds including their synthesis via solvothermal hydrothermal coprecipitation microwave assisted method and other emerging greener approaches in view of inherent deficiencies in zns qds namely bandgap alignment and high recombination rate some modification strategies like doping and heterojunction formation have been explored doping is preferred for tuning the band gaps for light absorption upto near infrared region nir that results in enhanced photocatalytic proficiency the formation of heterojunction strategies has been put forth owing to the effective charge separation and migration ability finally an outlook regarding unresolved challenges about zns qds photocatalyst is projected for future perspectives in this arena graphical abstract unlabelled

keywords zinc sulfide quantum dots heterojunction doping organic pollutant degradation 1 introduction rapid worldwide urbanization has led to the exploitation of water resources to an extreme levels thus impacting day to day life of human beings this demands sustainable greener technologies to address the challenge of wastewater contamination 1 3 to end this various conventional wastewater remediation techniques have been practiced including sedimentation distillation chlorination coagulation ion exchange method membrane filtration and reverse osmosis among others 4 6 however they are accompanied by limitations of excessive sludge formation high energy consumption generation of secondary pollutants low removal efficiency and higher capital investments 7 9 from the perspective of inexhaustible solar energy utilization semiconductor based photocatalysis has emerged as an economic and renewable technology for water restoration 10 11 so far researchers have identified many semiconductors as suitable photocatalysts under uv or visible light mainly depending on their band structures the photocatalytic reactions follow three sequential processes photon absorption upon solar light illumination electron hole pair formation and separation and photocatalytic surface reactions determined by the potentials of holes and electrons present in the valence and conduction band of the photocatalyst thus improved photocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by enhancing the three aforementioned processes 12 16 nevertheless the major drawback of existing photocatalysts is the rapid reassembly of electron hole pairs and limited solar spectrum absorption thus reducing the photoactivity in this context widespread research has focussed on the development of an ideal photocatalyst possessing apt bandgap with suitable band edge potentials higher surface area and slow recombination rate of charge carriers 5 17 21 one of the most promising metal chalcogenides is zinc sulfide zns due to its inherent properties that comprise higher electronic mobility water insolubility thermal stability inexpensive and non toxic nature 22 23 zns is an n type semiconductor photocatalyst with a wide bandgap of 3 68 ev with an appropriate negative redox potential of the conduction band 1 36 ev and valence band 2 35 ev exhibiting remarkable chemical stability against oxidation and hydrolysis zns exists in variant morphologies i e cubic sphalerite and hexagonal wurtzite in a tetrahedral framework 24 25 the photocatalytic efficacy of zns is low because of the high charge recombination rate utilization of solar spectrum only up to λ 420 nm and photo corrosion under the prolonged light radiations 26 30 thus the challenge to harvest solar light efficiently can be attained by decoration of zns photocatalyst with quantum dots qds making it desirable for the visible light photoactivity 31 32 the qds have attracted considerable attention for the improvement in zns photo efficiency due to their ultra small particle size 2 10 nm upconversion photoluminescence feature large surface to volume ratio tunable optical and electrical properties 33 36 usually qds are excited by uv light sources because of their wide intrinsic bandgap and allude to quantum confinement of electron hole pairs at smaller dimensions than the bohr radius qds exhibit properties that lie between that of the bulk semiconductor and discrete molecules and possess higher photocatalytic ability than its bulk counterparts 37 39 considering the drawbacks of zns qds can be utilized for bandgap engineering and surface modification to enhance the photoactivity of the pristine zns photocatalyst altogether the applicability of zns qds for wastewater remediation photocatalytic applications is a remarkable option the key foundation of this article is to present an all inclusive overview on the photocatalytic pollutant treatment using zns qds based photocatalysts earlier articles have focused on zns synthesis strategies 40 structural aspects of zns 41 and diverse photocatalytic applications from viewpoint of solar cells 42 h2 generation 43 and biosensors development 44 45 the review aims to assemble together the inspiring research articles as illustrated in fig 1 exploring the potential of modified zns qds photocatalyst for the degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants initially the photocatalytic potential of zns qds and the variant synthetic routes are introduced with the main highlight being the heterojunction formation and incorporation of doping strategies for improving the photocatalytic potential of pristine zns qds finnaly the emerging complications and probable resolutions are projected to contribute to the developments of zns qds as potential candidate among water purification techniques 2 potential of zns qds as photocatalyst zns qds have been investigated as an efficient photocatalyst because of the numerous afore mentioned advantages including excellent photoabsorption properties in the extended solar spectrum quantum confinement effects and size tunable optical features 46 47 goharshadi et al reported that due to the quantum confinement effect zns nanoparticles exhibit two types of band gaps i e 5 77 ev direct bandgap much larger than 3 07 ev indirect bandgap of bulk zns it is inferred that when the size of nanoparticles is smaller than those of the excitons the charge carriers become confined due to which the energy of excitons increases 48 the valence band 2 3 ev and conduction band 0 77 ev potentials of zns qds are suitable for the release of o2 and oh for the degradation of pollutants 49 a comparative study of photodegradation efficiency for brilliant green dye resulted in 88 83 and 81 over zns qds pristine zns and cds respectively attributed to the suppressed charge carrier recombination 50 the major drawback of zns qds is its irreversible agglomeration during the photocatalytic reactions and poor recyclability which lowers the photocatalytic degradation efficiency to overcome the limitations of lower separation limited visible light absorption strategies such as heterojunction formation and dopant incorporation have been opted to modify pristine zns qds for enhanced photocatalytic efficiency 3 synthesis of zns qds the ground breaking research has simplified the preparation of zns qds through a bottom up approach mainly via wet chemical methods i e hydrothermal and solvothermal routes 51 52 microwave assisted route 53 co precipitation 54 and greener fabrication means 55 however the chemicals involved in the synthesis procedure are complicated due to their high expense sluggish reactions and low quantum yield 56 this has necessitated the emergence of green biological fabrication as an alternative to eliminate the use of harmful solvents throughout the chemical processing the underlying principle for zns qds formation mechanism is based on generating an array of self assembled qd atoms over zns held together by ionic van der waals forces hydrogen bonding ᴨ ᴨ hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions 57 notably the size morphology and nature of synthesized zns qds are determined by the type of method precursors employed and synthesis parameters i e temperature ph and concentration of precursors as summarized in schematic representation depicted in fig 2 3 1 solvothermal and hydrothermal method a solvothermal method is a simple approach for the synthesis of zns qds without using a strong acid and surface passivating reagent to obtain desirable morphology in an energy efficient manner 58 60 poornaprakash et al reported the formation of spherical shaped ga doped zns qds using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and gallium nitrate as precursors and polyethylene glycol peg as a stabilizer the crystallite size of the pristine zns qds was found in the range of 4 3 3 1 nm whereas on the incorporation of ga 4 at the size of qds varied from 5 5 3 8 nm 61 tb3 doped zns qds with tb contents 0 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 mol and zinc blend crystal structure were efficaciously fabricated via the solvothermal approach using precursors zinc acetate hexahydrate and sodium sulfide the x ray diffraction xrd characterization technique provided direct evidence of tb3 incorporation into the zns host the intensity of dopant emission is significantly enhanced by the energy transfer from the zns host transfer efficacy increased from 29 7 to 81 2 from host to dopant with increased concentration of tb 3 from 0 5 to 2 62 the hydrothermal technique is widely deployed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions to attain distinctive morphologies of zns qds mansur and co workers studied the fabrication of crystalline spherical shaped zns qds of average size 4 4 0 4 nm using precursors zncl2 and na2s dissolved in a mixture of chitosan acetic acid solution and distilled water 63 similarly prepared zns qds responded to change in ph of chitosan solution from 4 0 to 6 0 resulting in an increase in the average size from 3 8 to 4 7 nm 64 a simple and efficient synthesis of cu doped zns qds tio2 nanocomposites with an average diameter of 2 9 0 5 nm was studied by labiadh and co workers using precursors znso4 cucl2 and 3 mercaptopropionic acid mpa as a stabilizer the improved catalytic efficacy of tio2 cu zns nanocomposite was probably because of the synergetic effects of i charge carrier separation by p n junction and ii cu zns dots can generate oh radicals thereby increased its oxidizing ability 49 this method has the benefits of low cost and toxicity which can produce qds up to size of 10 nm 3 2 co precipitation method the co precipitation technique is often deployed to generate a large number of magnetic nanoparticles and is mostly carried out in an alkaline medium using nh4oh and naoh 65 the temperature ph and concentration of precursor are the principal physicochemical factors to obtain desired precipitates also nature of anion and the ionic force are important factors that strongly impact the morphology and monodispersity of the particles ensued 66 rodriguez et al fabricated zns qds using precursors zinc nitrate and sodium sulfide and entrapped zns qds in silica zns sio2 using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and tetraethyl orthosilicate teos two different morphologies at crystallographic phases of interplanar distance 3 08 å corresponding to 101 plane of hexagonal wurtzite type zns and 3 15 å corresponding to 101 plane of cubic zinc blende were obtained 67 spherical shaped zns qds of average size 2 6 nm were synthesized by kaur et al via using precursors zinc acetate dihydrate and sodium sulfide in distilled water precursors under continuous stirring at neutral ph due to high density growth there was an agglomeration of quantum dots that led to the formation of smaller nanoparticle morphologies 50 3 3 microwave mw assisted method the mw assisted technique is a simple procedure that offers rapid and efficient materials production with higher reproducibility 68 this technique has attracted attention because of fast kinetics quick crystallization uniform nucleation simple control of morphology rapid warming and increase in particle size 69 cubic zinc blend structure of mn2 ion doped zns qds was fabricated using precursors zinc acetate hexahydrate thiourea and manganese acetate via mw assisted route as the concentration of dopant was increased to 4 28 the photodegradation efficacy of methyl orange reached 95 4 in 120 min under uv irradiation whereas it was only 41 2 for undoped zns it is because mn2 ions extended the lifetime of excitons of zns which resulted in the enhanced degradation of methyl orange mo 70 ayodhya et al reported the cubic shaped zns qds doped with zr2 rh3 pd2 by mw assisted synthesis using precursors zinc acetate and sodium sulfide the uv vis spectra zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds exhibited absorption edge at 320 340 nm and undoped zns qds at 370 nm the bandgap values of doped and undoped zns qds were calculated 3 88 4 2 ev which is greater than the bulk zns 3 3 ev a blue shift in absorbance was mainly due to the decreased size of zns qds irrespective of the type of dopant ions 71 3 4 green fabrication route the greener synthesis technique is simple cost effective relatively reproducible and often results in more stable nanoparticles 72 there is no requirement for high pressure energy temperature or toxic chemicals the biosynthesis technique has been proposed as an eco friendly strategy when compared to traditional chemiophysical methods with low maintenance 73 74 spherical particles of average diameter 11 08 nm zns qds were reported by jacob et al with a zinc blend crystal structure at room temperature green methodology fabricated zinc sulfide zns nanoparticles using biomass of penicillium species that was inoculated to potato dextrose broth pdb medium the obtained biomass was washed with distilled water and transferred to znso4 h2o solution the ensued zns nanoparticles were heated in a muffle furnace for removing thye protein layer covering zns nanoparticles 75 the aforementioned techniques have been extensively used but are complex inefficient and have least practical applications the chemical bath deposition method is accompanied by certain drawbacks including high temperature 900 c conditions corrosive and toxic gas production solution wastage after every deposit and proper cleaning of substrate is important in obtaining good adherent films the mw assisted route represents an efficient approach for nanomaterial synthesis with advantages of rapid heating higher reaction rates morphology control by tuning various parameters of the reaction mw assited synthesis also reduces the thermal gradients that provide ideal growth conditions for the uniform size distribution of formed nanomaterials various chemical and physical methods are used to synthesize nanoparticles nps as they require higher radiations and extremely concentrated reductants and stabilizers that are toxic to the environment and living beings thus organic methods are approaching to fill the void even though different synthetic strategies are accessible hydrothermal and solvothermal routes are widely used as they are solution based strategies these methods possess advantages namely high crystallinity closed system conditions easily scalable and low temperature conditions in contrast desirable morphology of zns qds was attainable via hydrothermal and solvothermal methods which does not require sophisticated equipment widely deployed is solvothermal process as there is minimal loss of catalyst with extreme recovery rate 4 doping of zns qds doping is a process of adding entities called dopants to a pure semiconductor to extend the light absorption the purpose of doping is to tune the bandgap improve charge kinetics reduce rapid electron hole pair recombination rate expand surface and interface characteristics 76 77 generally additional energy levels are introduced by the doped ions into the band structure which can be exploited to trap electrons and holes to separate carriers from the bands thereby allowing effective diffusion of carriers at the surface 60 78 79 unexpectedly the photocatalytic activities rely emphatically on crystalline faces to overcome these limitations the structure of semiconductor based zns qds can be tuned via elemental doping to regulate the band positions various doping strategies such as non metal transition metal rare earth metal dopants are utilized to satisfy the various prerequisites for enhancing the performance in a semiconductor photocatalyst framework 4 1 non metal doped zns qds the characteristic properties of nonmetals like higher ionization energies and large electronegativity empower them to increase electrons that leads to stronger lattice structure formation 21 80 moreover non metal dopants exhibit low thermal variation in chemical nature with increased light absorption upto visible region owing to narrow band gap 81 82 this was evidenced in first time reported research on ga doped zns qds exhibiting trivial blue shift absorption as displayed in fig 3 a uv diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs spectra it was observed that undoped zns qds and 2 4 ga doped zns qds showed absorption peaks at 332 nm 325 nm and 318 nm respectively consequently higher bandgap edge potentials at 3 92 ev 3 84 ev and 3 75 ev were obtained for 4 2 ga doped zns qds and pristine zns qds this was attributed to the decreased qds size on increasing the concentration of ga dopant upto 4 leading to generation of sulfur vacancies thereby increasing fluorescence efficiency the photocatalytic degradation results were in accordance as maximum of 98 phenol red dye was removed over 4 ga doped zns qds within 140 min of irradiations whereas only 77 and 96 phenol red dye was eliminated by pristine zns qds and 2 ga doped zns qds 61 4 2 transition metal doped zns qds apart from non metal doping transition metal doping is an important alternative to alleviate water contamination issues transition metals such as fe ag pd 2 and mn 2 have been used to functionalize zns qds with better charge mobility and improved absorption in the visible region 83 fig 3b present the effect of doped mn2 ions on the electronic band structure of zns under uv light mechanistic studies have revealed that the incorporated mn ions in the lattice of zns enhanced the charge carriers separation by forming acceptor levels below the conduction band the photodegradation mechanism being initiated with the generation of e h pair on the surface of zns photocatalyst under uv light irradiation the incorporated mn2 ion and generated sulfur vacancy vs 2 serve as reservoir that efficiently trap the photogenerated e leading to the improved photoactivity of as fabricated mn zns the overall photocatalytic efficacy was determined by the generated reactive oxidative species oh o2 that efficiently decomposed 95 4 mo dye into non toxic co2 and h2o in 120 min 70 rajabi et al fabricated fe3 ion doped zns qds via chemical precipitation method at room temperature for decolorization of malachite green the photocatalyst showed excellent visible light activity for malachite green mg degradation 90 in 90 min under uv radiations 619 nm along with higher stability where the average size of 1 7 0 2 nm was obtained for the the pristine zns qds and fe3 doped zns qds the lifetime of charge carriers electrons holes rely on the nature volume of dopant and morphology of the semiconductor the photodecolorization of malachite green with changed mole fraction x 0 00 0 01 0 03 0 05 and 0 07 is shown in fig 3c also a positive effect of 1 0 to 5 0 was experienced on the decolorization efficacy of zns the decreased decolorization efficiency was observed at x 0 07 highest mole fraction of fe impurity 84 similarly zinc blended crystal structure fe 3 doped zns quantum dots of average diameter of 3 nm were synthesized via chemical precipitation method using 2 mercaptoethanol the ensued qds exhibited excellent degradation efficiency 95 of victoria blue r vbr due to higher surface area and rapid transference of excitons to the nanoparticles surface the decrease in particle size and a corresponding increase in energy band from 3 68 to 4 58 4 75 ev determined the increased lifetime of excitons that further enhanced the photocatalytic proficiency consequently increase in zns bandgap is due to the decrease in particle size to 10 nm on doping with fe 3 ions the efficacy of photocatalyst strongly rely on the effect of solution ph during the reaction fig 3d illustrates the ph range from 2 to 13 for degradation efficiency for victoria blue r dye maximum degradation efficiency was attained at an alkaline ph range of 10 after 90 min of light irradiation and declined with increase in the ph range thus ph 10 was considered as the optimum range for the maximum degradation efficiency 85 cubic zinc blended structure of average size 2 38 to 2 46 nm of mn zns qds were synthesized via mw assisted techniquewhich showed 95 6 degradation of methyl orange under uv light irradiation broad and asymmetric emission peaks were observed in photoluminescence spectra pl of undoped zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds depicted in fig 4 a the pl spectra of undoped zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds exhibited emission at 420 450 nm whereas pure zns qds exhibited emissions at 421 and 483 nm the pl spectra of the zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds comprised of dissimilar peaks at around 431 438 and 435 nm whereas undoped zns qds also displayed a sharp peak at 440 nm 71 a conventional chemical method has been deployed for the fabrication of zns and ag doped zns qds ag doped quantum dots showed excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of strychnine in comparison to un doped catalysts under uv irradiation the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis of ag doped zns qds exhibits larger surface area 89 54 m2 g than zns i e 78 25 m2 g as ag loading on zns qds which provides more reaction sites for photocatalytic activity fig 4b depicts the time resolved pl spectra that showed the longer decay value 0 22 3 21 12 52 for ag doped zns qds in comparison to zns qds that exhibits decay time value at 0 16 1 21 7 25 this was due to the active charge transference across the silver interface and zns qds the ag doped zns qds showed larger decay time that suggests better charge separation with ag doping a resistance in the excitation of photogenerated electrons from conduction band to valence band was higher in ag doped zns qds than pristine zns qds at different time intervals as depicted in fig 4c this can be attributed to the impedence caused by zns qds due to higher charge transfer with ag dopant 86 4 3 rare earth metal doped zns qds rare earth metals with 4f and 5d states are considered as the ideal dopants when compared to transition metals for the modification of the structural electronic and optical properties 87 furthermore they tend to form complexes with various organic compounds through interaction with functional groups of f orbital thereby improving the photoactivity 88 rare earth metal have been incorporated in zns qds via hydrothermal route using zinc nitrate sodium sulfide as a precursor which resulted in 84 4 phenol red dye degradation within 105 min under uv light irradiation zns zn0 49gd0 01s and zn0 47gd0 03s qds were fabricated by poornaprakash et al following a hydrothermal route reported that zn0 47gd0 03s qds exhibit higher efficacy for degradation of phenol red dye 91 2 in comparison to zns 78 8 and zn0 49gd0 01s 84 4 qds as depicted in fig 4d the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs profiles revealed maximum red shift absorption for 0 47 zn 0 03 gds qds followed by 0 49 zn 0 01 gd s and pristine zns the bandgaps of zns 3 84 ev 0 49 zn 0 01 gd s 3 71 ev and 0 47 zn 0 03 gd s 0 67 ev qds respectively were higher as compared to bulk zns 3 67 ev due to quantum confinement effect besides the decreased bandgap was due to the increased gd iii doping content that further ascribed to sp f interactions among the lanthanide ions and host 89 5 zns qds based heterojunctions the heterojunction is an interface that occurs between two dissimilar semiconductors having different band structures 90 91 this strategy has been utilized to improve charge separation inhibit the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs and enhance the photocatalytic performance 92 depending on the band alignment of the conduction and valence band edges the heterostructures are of three types ie type i straddling gap heterojunction where the valence and conduction band of semiconductor ii sc ii is higher than semiconductor i sc i that results in the formation of the straddling gap fig 5 a here the photoexcited electrons move from the conduction band of sc ii to conduction band of sc i whereas holes from sc ii were transferred to valence band of sc i thus both the electrons and holes were accumulated in sc i that lead to higher recombination rate that further resulted in lower redox potential the type i heterojunction is accompanied by certain limitations includes trifling charge separation because of potential discontinuity in energy band positions type ii heterojunction system corresponds to staggered gap alignment suitable for the spatial charge separation as depicted in fig 5b in type ii heterojunctions both the conduction band and valence band edge of the sc i is lower than the corresponding conduction band and valence band edge of the sc ii this heterojunction exhibits a better charge carrier separation with enhanced lifetime of the excitons type iii broken gap the type iii heterojunction system have tainted band alignments that signifies the broken band gap where the charge migration route is not feasible the construction of type iii heterojunction photocatalyst is similar to that of type ii except the staggered band alignment becomes so extreme that there is no overlap between the band gaps of the two photocatalyst fig 5c thus type iii heterojunction is considered unsuitable for the migration and separation of electron hole pairs 93 among these systems type ii heterojunctions are considered effective for conventional charge migration and separation route thereby enhancing wide light absorption with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency 94 5 1 conventional type ii zns qds based heterojunction system to better understand the enhanced photocatalytic activity labiadh et al reported the mechanism of forming heterojunction between tio2 and cu zns qds the photocatalytic mechanism involves transference of photogenerated electron from conduction band of cu zns 3 84 ev to conduction band of tio2 3 32 ev and holes are transferred from valence band of tio2 to cu zns the reactive oxidative species thus formed o2 and oh degraded 90 salicylic acid in 60 min under uv light irradiation 365 nm the effective charge separation in tio2 cu zns composite originating from the p n heterojunction is responsible for the increased lifetime of carriers and enhanced photocatalytic performance fig 6 a 49 similarly under uv light irradiation electron hole pairs are generated in the zns there is the transfer of an electron from the conduction band of zns to the conduction band of tio2 further the transferred electron hole pairs from zns to tio2 enhances the redox ability to further degrade organic pollutants fig 6b 95 when light irradiates on the photocatalytic surface excitons are separated and electron hole pairs are generated in the conduction band and valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 respectively the excitons in conduction band of mesoporous g c3n4 are simultaneously migrated to conduction band of bi2s3 and zns then again the h of bi2s3 zns are migrated to valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 in this manner meso g c3n4 acts as a bridge between the two photocatalysts semiconductor which favors the separation and transfer of photoinduced charges thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance the electrons combined in conduction band of bi2s3 and zns quickly recombine with h meanwhile the accumulation of e and h pairs in the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 assists in the generation of oh the acquired oh radical further degrade the toxic contaminants the photocatalytic mechanism involved double charge transfer of photogenerated electrons from conduction band of mesoporous g c3n4 to the conduction band of bi2s3 and zns whereas the holes from valence band of bi2s3 and zns are migrated to the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 the accumulation of electrons in the conduction band of bi2s3 and zns react with holes whereas electron hole pairs accumulated in the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 then oh further react with the holes to form oh radical that degraded 99 8 bisphenol a bpa under 325 nm light irradiation fig 6c the bet characterization method is an important technique to scrutinize the specific surface area as depicted in fig 6d the results revealed the surface areas of bi2s3 8 3 cm3 g 1 meso g c3n4 93 5 cm3 g 1 bi2s3 meso g c3n4 72 6 cm3 g 1 and zns bi2s3 meso g c3n4 78 3 cm3 g 1 respectively whereas the pore volumes of mesoporous g c3n4 bi2s3 meso g c3n4 and zns bi2s3 meso g c3n4 are 11 3 6 1 and 10 2 nm there is no significant change in the pore after recombination that affirms the presence of mesoporous structures interestingly the surface areas and pore volumes of meso g c3n4 are bigger than conventional g c3n4 and curve types confirmed the presence of mesopores 96 fig 7a depicts the photocatalytic mechanism of zns wo3 cofe2o4 nanohybrid under visible light irradiation the vb and cb edge of zns qds 2 675 3 575 ev and wo3 1 155 0 605 ev nanosheets and cofe2o4 nanoparticles being 2 23 and 0 29 ev the free radicals can further degrade 92 4 methylene blue in 240 min pl spectroscopy was used to examine the efficiency of migration trapping and recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs shown in fig 7b the lower the pl intensity the stronger the ability to assist in the separation of charge carriers and hence higher the photocatalytic performance as is evident from the figure zns qds and wo3 exhibit a strong emission peak at around 420 nm and cofe2o4 nps exhibit two pl emission peaks at 421 and 588 nm the decrease in the pl intensity of the zns wo3 nanohybrid in comparison to the pure samples is because of the charge separated state and enhanced mobility of the free charge carriers the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization technique is important to examine the charge transport behavior of the nanohybrid formed fig 7c the arc radius is related to the charge transfer process whereas a smaller arc radius indicates lower charge transfer resistance the zns wo3 nanohybrid has a larger radius than the zns wo3 cofe2o4 nanohybrid the small charge transfer was due to the formation of a hybrid structure that led to the effectual immigration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 97 emara et al reported the mechanism for cobalt doped zno zn oh 2 and their photocatalytic activity in depicted in fig 7d type ii heterojunction is formed by incorporating co with zns and each of zno co and zn oh 2 co zns is a p type semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3 5 3 9 ev whereas zno is an n type semiconductor with a bandgap of 3 1 3 3 ev this heterojunction lowers the recombination of charge carriers for photocatalytic performance 98 however type ii heterojunction is accompanied by certain drawbacks including electrostatic repulsion between electron electron and hole hole because of the electron and hole transference from the conduction band of semiconductor i to conduction band of semiconductor ii also redox potential of carriers decreases because migrating possesses relatively lower negative potential thus the development of z scheme heterojunction system appears a relatively more appropriate approach to achieve space charge separation along with the enhanced photocatalytic activity 5 2 z scheme photocatalytic system z scheme is the third and the modern heterojunction technique where the band potentials of the two semiconductors are in close proximity without any charge transfer mediator 99 the name z scheme is proposed as its charge transfer route mimics the photosynthesis process that follows photoexcitation of charge carriers which resembles the letter z in z scheme photocatalysts the surface junction between two semiconductors develops an induced electric field resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity 100 101 a shuttle redox mediator fe3 fe2 and io3 i is incorporated in the traditional z scheme system which acts as a junction between two semiconductors and helps in the transference of electrons from one photocatalyst system to another the redox mediators usage is restricted due to feasible backward reactions of electron hole pairs as redox ions serve as mediator light shielding effect ph sensitive solution and less stability of redox mediator restricts the rate of reaction despite having such drawbacks the traditional z scheme system has been exploited on a larger scale for its potential appliances 102 all solid state ass z scheme systems are the second generation of z scheme there is a replacement of shuttle redox mediator by a solid state electron which are either carbon nanotubes cnts reduced graphene oxide rgo noble metals au ag and cu or carbon based materials graphene graphene oxide go carbon dots cds all solid state ass z scheme has certain limitations such as use of noble metals as solid mediators which are photo corrosive expensive and cause the shielding effect which needs to be resolved ass z scheme is accompanied by certain limitations but still has proved its worth effectively in photocatalysis moreover the absence of redox mediators or noble metals in a direct z scheme system overcomes the problem of backward reaction photo corrosion and shielding effect and provides significant features to photocatalytic systems 103 104 the main pre requisites involve a photocatalytic system with appropriate morphology excellent stability and high redox potential for effective degradation of pollutants which can be achieved by direct z scheme systems since rapid electron hole pair recombination was persistent in every traditional photocatalytic system thus z scheme heterostructures have been established by researchers to overcome this issue and attain superior photocatalytic efficacy 101 105 the inadequacies in type ii heterojunction system were evidenced in the comparative study of type ii and z scheme zns qds fe2o3 qds heterostructure deposited on rgo as shown is fig 8 a photoexcited electrons from conduction band 1 36 ev of zns qds migrate to 0 1 ev potential conduction band of fe2o3 qds simultaneously transference of holes occurs from valence band 2 66 ev of fe2o3 qds to 2 35 ev valence band of zns qds thereby following type ii conventional charge transference route this resulted in accumulation of the electrons and holes on the lower potential conduction band of fe2o3 qds and holes on the valence band of zns qds which were unfavourable for ros generation on the contrary in direct z scheme charge migration pathway fig 8b resulted in effective charge separation by recombining the lower potential electrons and holes of fe2o3 qds and zns qds respectively while the stronger redox potential electrons of zns qds and holes of fe2o3 qds were preserved for the effective generation of o2 and oh radicals for 96 45 of mb dye within 40 min of uv light irradiations to ascertain this mechanism radical scavenging experiments were performed where inhibition in mb dye photodegradation was observed as follows 11 43 35 26 and 45 82 on addition of tert butyl alcohol t buoh benzoquinone and ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta respectively as presented in fig 8c thus the influence of reactive species on mb degradation was found to be oh o2 h which was in support of direct z scheme mechanism 97 106 a synergistic combination of type ii and z scheme heterojuction was explored in a novel zns qds zno nanosphere bi4o5i2 tandem heterostructure exhibiting multichannel electron transfer route as depicted in fig 8d upon solar light radiation the electrons in the conduction band of zno were stimulated to the valence band of bi4o5i2 that further recombines with holes following z scheme charge transfer mechansim for type ii heterojuction the electrons in the conduction band of bi4o5i2 transferred to the conduction band of zns with simultaneous migration of holes from the valence band of zns to the valence band of bi4o5i2 the dual benefit of electron hole pairs separation and preservation of the reduction and oxidation abilities were obtained by type ii and z scheme systems respectively the reduced electron hole pairs recombination rate was well confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis results fig 8e displays smallest nyquist arc for zno bi4 o5i2 zns qds heterostructure in comparison to other heterojuctions which signifies reduced the overall resistance favorable for electron hole pairs separation the zno bi4o5i2 zns qds exhibited an excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of 96 2 and 95 7 for bisphenol a bpa and 2 4 5 trichlorophenol tcp respectively the improved photocatalytic efficacy was justified by the sequence of photocurrent signals obtained for zno zno zns bi4o5i2 zns zno bi4o5i2 and zno bi4o5i2 zns as shown in fig 8f the strongest photocurrent signal for zno bi4o5 i2 zns inferred that the photoexcited electrons can be stimulated on their contact surface with effecitive separation of charge carriers 107 consequently constructing a z scheme heterostructures is inferred as a progressive method to endorse excellent research potential table 1 elaborates the potential of modified zns based qds to effectively achieve high organic pollutant removal 6 future prespectives the preface of zns qds photocatalysts for organic pollutant photodegradation is commendable as evident from the research studies reported in this review zns qds have been favoured because of the suitable valence band and conduction band potentials which promotes facile generation of reactive oxidative species i e oh and o2 radicals the size dependent light absorption property of zns qds is beneficial to obtain extendend solar spectrum responsive photocatalysts however at present the major limitations of charge carrier recombination and reduced solar light absorption persists in zns qds along with other fledgling research areas that demand further studies zns qds synthetic strategies should be upgraded with a novel and direct approach with low cost boosted porosity conductivity structural modification high reinforcement that possibly will develop areas of enhanced photocatalytic performance solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis strategy has been widely applied in the zns qds based photocatalysts synthesis because it s a simple technique that removes the strong acid the effective versatile methods with non hazardous precursors eco friendly solvents short duration controlled synthesis approaches are required to enhance the photocatalytic efficacy photostability and recyclability are important parameters that effect the photocatalyst selection for the industrial purpose that further ensures the consistency of photoactivity with minimum loss of photocatalyst in each cycle there is an urgent need to explore advanced characterization techniques to extrapolate heterojunction mechanisms which claims to reduce the photoinduced charge carriers recombination rate z scheme photocatalytic system needs to be explored additionally as there are barely any reports on the zns qds framework since zns qds z scheme photocatalytic system enhances the overall photodegrdation proficiency providing ideal redox potential with better stability updated research in heterojunction formation are based on s scheme mechanism which has not been explored in zns qds the novel s scheme heterojunctions preserves higher redox capabilities and enhances solar energy utilization overcoming the drawbacks accompanied by the traditional type ii and z scheme systems hence further studies should be focused constructing s scheme based zns qds for enhanced photocatalytic efficiencies furthermore no precise study was found to clarify the up conversion photoluminescence ucpl impact of zns qds the experimental and hypothetical investigations emphasize the surface defects crystallinity and sizes of zns qds which should be directed to look for a persuading clarification on the tuning of optoelectronic properties to address these challenges it is expected to conduct research on zns qds in a more significant direction considering the above mentioned aspects 7 conclusions zinc sulfide quantum dots zns qds have fascinated researchers for organic pollutant degradation in wastewater because of their high chemical stability against oxidation and hydrolysis even when the particle size reduces to few nanometers this review enfolds the photocatalytic properties of zns qds summary of novel synthesis techniques and modulation strategies including doping and heterojuction formation the incorporation of dopants including non metals transition metals and rare earth metals are discussed as a route to increase the number of active sites for photo oxidative and reductive reactions zns qds based heterostructures architecting via type ii and direct z scheme charge transfer mechanism is also deliberated as a means of improving light absorption spectra with preservation of redox potentials for better photocatalytic proficiency zns qds based type ii heterostructes are most widely explored due to spatial chare separation of excitons the evolution of zns qds based z scheme heterostructure is still on the threshold of exploration but its potential to resolve the underlying traditional heterojuction limitations is irrefutable conclusively this review delineates the properties of zns qds as a photocatalyst and circumvent significant challenges

13339,solar light driven photocatalysis is an emerging renewable and sustainable approach in environmental remediation to mitigate organic pollutants from waste water zinc sulfide quantum dots zns qds have been utilized because of their larger surface area low cost abundant active sites non toxic nature aqueous insolubility and good thermal stability ascribing to the quantum confinement effect the accumulation of the electrons inside the qds leads to an increase in the light absorption range herein the effect of various parameters like ph and temperature variation are summarized that determines the size and varied morphologies of zns qds including their synthesis via solvothermal hydrothermal coprecipitation microwave assisted method and other emerging greener approaches in view of inherent deficiencies in zns qds namely bandgap alignment and high recombination rate some modification strategies like doping and heterojunction formation have been explored doping is preferred for tuning the band gaps for light absorption upto near infrared region nir that results in enhanced photocatalytic proficiency the formation of heterojunction strategies has been put forth owing to the effective charge separation and migration ability finally an outlook regarding unresolved challenges about zns qds photocatalyst is projected for future perspectives in this arena graphical abstract unlabelled

keywords zinc sulfide quantum dots heterojunction doping organic pollutant degradation 1 introduction rapid worldwide urbanization has led to the exploitation of water resources to an extreme levels thus impacting day to day life of human beings this demands sustainable greener technologies to address the challenge of wastewater contamination 1 3 to end this various conventional wastewater remediation techniques have been practiced including sedimentation distillation chlorination coagulation ion exchange method membrane filtration and reverse osmosis among others 4 6 however they are accompanied by limitations of excessive sludge formation high energy consumption generation of secondary pollutants low removal efficiency and higher capital investments 7 9 from the perspective of inexhaustible solar energy utilization semiconductor based photocatalysis has emerged as an economic and renewable technology for water restoration 10 11 so far researchers have identified many semiconductors as suitable photocatalysts under uv or visible light mainly depending on their band structures the photocatalytic reactions follow three sequential processes photon absorption upon solar light illumination electron hole pair formation and separation and photocatalytic surface reactions determined by the potentials of holes and electrons present in the valence and conduction band of the photocatalyst thus improved photocatalytic efficiency can be achieved by enhancing the three aforementioned processes 12 16 nevertheless the major drawback of existing photocatalysts is the rapid reassembly of electron hole pairs and limited solar spectrum absorption thus reducing the photoactivity in this context widespread research has focussed on the development of an ideal photocatalyst possessing apt bandgap with suitable band edge potentials higher surface area and slow recombination rate of charge carriers 5 17 21 one of the most promising metal chalcogenides is zinc sulfide zns due to its inherent properties that comprise higher electronic mobility water insolubility thermal stability inexpensive and non toxic nature 22 23 zns is an n type semiconductor photocatalyst with a wide bandgap of 3 68 ev with an appropriate negative redox potential of the conduction band 1 36 ev and valence band 2 35 ev exhibiting remarkable chemical stability against oxidation and hydrolysis zns exists in variant morphologies i e cubic sphalerite and hexagonal wurtzite in a tetrahedral framework 24 25 the photocatalytic efficacy of zns is low because of the high charge recombination rate utilization of solar spectrum only up to λ 420 nm and photo corrosion under the prolonged light radiations 26 30 thus the challenge to harvest solar light efficiently can be attained by decoration of zns photocatalyst with quantum dots qds making it desirable for the visible light photoactivity 31 32 the qds have attracted considerable attention for the improvement in zns photo efficiency due to their ultra small particle size 2 10 nm upconversion photoluminescence feature large surface to volume ratio tunable optical and electrical properties 33 36 usually qds are excited by uv light sources because of their wide intrinsic bandgap and allude to quantum confinement of electron hole pairs at smaller dimensions than the bohr radius qds exhibit properties that lie between that of the bulk semiconductor and discrete molecules and possess higher photocatalytic ability than its bulk counterparts 37 39 considering the drawbacks of zns qds can be utilized for bandgap engineering and surface modification to enhance the photoactivity of the pristine zns photocatalyst altogether the applicability of zns qds for wastewater remediation photocatalytic applications is a remarkable option the key foundation of this article is to present an all inclusive overview on the photocatalytic pollutant treatment using zns qds based photocatalysts earlier articles have focused on zns synthesis strategies 40 structural aspects of zns 41 and diverse photocatalytic applications from viewpoint of solar cells 42 h2 generation 43 and biosensors development 44 45 the review aims to assemble together the inspiring research articles as illustrated in fig 1 exploring the potential of modified zns qds photocatalyst for the degradation of organic and inorganic pollutants initially the photocatalytic potential of zns qds and the variant synthetic routes are introduced with the main highlight being the heterojunction formation and incorporation of doping strategies for improving the photocatalytic potential of pristine zns qds finnaly the emerging complications and probable resolutions are projected to contribute to the developments of zns qds as potential candidate among water purification techniques 2 potential of zns qds as photocatalyst zns qds have been investigated as an efficient photocatalyst because of the numerous afore mentioned advantages including excellent photoabsorption properties in the extended solar spectrum quantum confinement effects and size tunable optical features 46 47 goharshadi et al reported that due to the quantum confinement effect zns nanoparticles exhibit two types of band gaps i e 5 77 ev direct bandgap much larger than 3 07 ev indirect bandgap of bulk zns it is inferred that when the size of nanoparticles is smaller than those of the excitons the charge carriers become confined due to which the energy of excitons increases 48 the valence band 2 3 ev and conduction band 0 77 ev potentials of zns qds are suitable for the release of o2 and oh for the degradation of pollutants 49 a comparative study of photodegradation efficiency for brilliant green dye resulted in 88 83 and 81 over zns qds pristine zns and cds respectively attributed to the suppressed charge carrier recombination 50 the major drawback of zns qds is its irreversible agglomeration during the photocatalytic reactions and poor recyclability which lowers the photocatalytic degradation efficiency to overcome the limitations of lower separation limited visible light absorption strategies such as heterojunction formation and dopant incorporation have been opted to modify pristine zns qds for enhanced photocatalytic efficiency 3 synthesis of zns qds the ground breaking research has simplified the preparation of zns qds through a bottom up approach mainly via wet chemical methods i e hydrothermal and solvothermal routes 51 52 microwave assisted route 53 co precipitation 54 and greener fabrication means 55 however the chemicals involved in the synthesis procedure are complicated due to their high expense sluggish reactions and low quantum yield 56 this has necessitated the emergence of green biological fabrication as an alternative to eliminate the use of harmful solvents throughout the chemical processing the underlying principle for zns qds formation mechanism is based on generating an array of self assembled qd atoms over zns held together by ionic van der waals forces hydrogen bonding ᴨ ᴨ hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions 57 notably the size morphology and nature of synthesized zns qds are determined by the type of method precursors employed and synthesis parameters i e temperature ph and concentration of precursors as summarized in schematic representation depicted in fig 2 3 1 solvothermal and hydrothermal method a solvothermal method is a simple approach for the synthesis of zns qds without using a strong acid and surface passivating reagent to obtain desirable morphology in an energy efficient manner 58 60 poornaprakash et al reported the formation of spherical shaped ga doped zns qds using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and gallium nitrate as precursors and polyethylene glycol peg as a stabilizer the crystallite size of the pristine zns qds was found in the range of 4 3 3 1 nm whereas on the incorporation of ga 4 at the size of qds varied from 5 5 3 8 nm 61 tb3 doped zns qds with tb contents 0 0 0 5 1 0 2 0 mol and zinc blend crystal structure were efficaciously fabricated via the solvothermal approach using precursors zinc acetate hexahydrate and sodium sulfide the x ray diffraction xrd characterization technique provided direct evidence of tb3 incorporation into the zns host the intensity of dopant emission is significantly enhanced by the energy transfer from the zns host transfer efficacy increased from 29 7 to 81 2 from host to dopant with increased concentration of tb 3 from 0 5 to 2 62 the hydrothermal technique is widely deployed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions to attain distinctive morphologies of zns qds mansur and co workers studied the fabrication of crystalline spherical shaped zns qds of average size 4 4 0 4 nm using precursors zncl2 and na2s dissolved in a mixture of chitosan acetic acid solution and distilled water 63 similarly prepared zns qds responded to change in ph of chitosan solution from 4 0 to 6 0 resulting in an increase in the average size from 3 8 to 4 7 nm 64 a simple and efficient synthesis of cu doped zns qds tio2 nanocomposites with an average diameter of 2 9 0 5 nm was studied by labiadh and co workers using precursors znso4 cucl2 and 3 mercaptopropionic acid mpa as a stabilizer the improved catalytic efficacy of tio2 cu zns nanocomposite was probably because of the synergetic effects of i charge carrier separation by p n junction and ii cu zns dots can generate oh radicals thereby increased its oxidizing ability 49 this method has the benefits of low cost and toxicity which can produce qds up to size of 10 nm 3 2 co precipitation method the co precipitation technique is often deployed to generate a large number of magnetic nanoparticles and is mostly carried out in an alkaline medium using nh4oh and naoh 65 the temperature ph and concentration of precursor are the principal physicochemical factors to obtain desired precipitates also nature of anion and the ionic force are important factors that strongly impact the morphology and monodispersity of the particles ensued 66 rodriguez et al fabricated zns qds using precursors zinc nitrate and sodium sulfide and entrapped zns qds in silica zns sio2 using hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab and tetraethyl orthosilicate teos two different morphologies at crystallographic phases of interplanar distance 3 08 å corresponding to 101 plane of hexagonal wurtzite type zns and 3 15 å corresponding to 101 plane of cubic zinc blende were obtained 67 spherical shaped zns qds of average size 2 6 nm were synthesized by kaur et al via using precursors zinc acetate dihydrate and sodium sulfide in distilled water precursors under continuous stirring at neutral ph due to high density growth there was an agglomeration of quantum dots that led to the formation of smaller nanoparticle morphologies 50 3 3 microwave mw assisted method the mw assisted technique is a simple procedure that offers rapid and efficient materials production with higher reproducibility 68 this technique has attracted attention because of fast kinetics quick crystallization uniform nucleation simple control of morphology rapid warming and increase in particle size 69 cubic zinc blend structure of mn2 ion doped zns qds was fabricated using precursors zinc acetate hexahydrate thiourea and manganese acetate via mw assisted route as the concentration of dopant was increased to 4 28 the photodegradation efficacy of methyl orange reached 95 4 in 120 min under uv irradiation whereas it was only 41 2 for undoped zns it is because mn2 ions extended the lifetime of excitons of zns which resulted in the enhanced degradation of methyl orange mo 70 ayodhya et al reported the cubic shaped zns qds doped with zr2 rh3 pd2 by mw assisted synthesis using precursors zinc acetate and sodium sulfide the uv vis spectra zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds exhibited absorption edge at 320 340 nm and undoped zns qds at 370 nm the bandgap values of doped and undoped zns qds were calculated 3 88 4 2 ev which is greater than the bulk zns 3 3 ev a blue shift in absorbance was mainly due to the decreased size of zns qds irrespective of the type of dopant ions 71 3 4 green fabrication route the greener synthesis technique is simple cost effective relatively reproducible and often results in more stable nanoparticles 72 there is no requirement for high pressure energy temperature or toxic chemicals the biosynthesis technique has been proposed as an eco friendly strategy when compared to traditional chemiophysical methods with low maintenance 73 74 spherical particles of average diameter 11 08 nm zns qds were reported by jacob et al with a zinc blend crystal structure at room temperature green methodology fabricated zinc sulfide zns nanoparticles using biomass of penicillium species that was inoculated to potato dextrose broth pdb medium the obtained biomass was washed with distilled water and transferred to znso4 h2o solution the ensued zns nanoparticles were heated in a muffle furnace for removing thye protein layer covering zns nanoparticles 75 the aforementioned techniques have been extensively used but are complex inefficient and have least practical applications the chemical bath deposition method is accompanied by certain drawbacks including high temperature 900 c conditions corrosive and toxic gas production solution wastage after every deposit and proper cleaning of substrate is important in obtaining good adherent films the mw assisted route represents an efficient approach for nanomaterial synthesis with advantages of rapid heating higher reaction rates morphology control by tuning various parameters of the reaction mw assited synthesis also reduces the thermal gradients that provide ideal growth conditions for the uniform size distribution of formed nanomaterials various chemical and physical methods are used to synthesize nanoparticles nps as they require higher radiations and extremely concentrated reductants and stabilizers that are toxic to the environment and living beings thus organic methods are approaching to fill the void even though different synthetic strategies are accessible hydrothermal and solvothermal routes are widely used as they are solution based strategies these methods possess advantages namely high crystallinity closed system conditions easily scalable and low temperature conditions in contrast desirable morphology of zns qds was attainable via hydrothermal and solvothermal methods which does not require sophisticated equipment widely deployed is solvothermal process as there is minimal loss of catalyst with extreme recovery rate 4 doping of zns qds doping is a process of adding entities called dopants to a pure semiconductor to extend the light absorption the purpose of doping is to tune the bandgap improve charge kinetics reduce rapid electron hole pair recombination rate expand surface and interface characteristics 76 77 generally additional energy levels are introduced by the doped ions into the band structure which can be exploited to trap electrons and holes to separate carriers from the bands thereby allowing effective diffusion of carriers at the surface 60 78 79 unexpectedly the photocatalytic activities rely emphatically on crystalline faces to overcome these limitations the structure of semiconductor based zns qds can be tuned via elemental doping to regulate the band positions various doping strategies such as non metal transition metal rare earth metal dopants are utilized to satisfy the various prerequisites for enhancing the performance in a semiconductor photocatalyst framework 4 1 non metal doped zns qds the characteristic properties of nonmetals like higher ionization energies and large electronegativity empower them to increase electrons that leads to stronger lattice structure formation 21 80 moreover non metal dopants exhibit low thermal variation in chemical nature with increased light absorption upto visible region owing to narrow band gap 81 82 this was evidenced in first time reported research on ga doped zns qds exhibiting trivial blue shift absorption as displayed in fig 3 a uv diffuse reflectance spectroscopy drs spectra it was observed that undoped zns qds and 2 4 ga doped zns qds showed absorption peaks at 332 nm 325 nm and 318 nm respectively consequently higher bandgap edge potentials at 3 92 ev 3 84 ev and 3 75 ev were obtained for 4 2 ga doped zns qds and pristine zns qds this was attributed to the decreased qds size on increasing the concentration of ga dopant upto 4 leading to generation of sulfur vacancies thereby increasing fluorescence efficiency the photocatalytic degradation results were in accordance as maximum of 98 phenol red dye was removed over 4 ga doped zns qds within 140 min of irradiations whereas only 77 and 96 phenol red dye was eliminated by pristine zns qds and 2 ga doped zns qds 61 4 2 transition metal doped zns qds apart from non metal doping transition metal doping is an important alternative to alleviate water contamination issues transition metals such as fe ag pd 2 and mn 2 have been used to functionalize zns qds with better charge mobility and improved absorption in the visible region 83 fig 3b present the effect of doped mn2 ions on the electronic band structure of zns under uv light mechanistic studies have revealed that the incorporated mn ions in the lattice of zns enhanced the charge carriers separation by forming acceptor levels below the conduction band the photodegradation mechanism being initiated with the generation of e h pair on the surface of zns photocatalyst under uv light irradiation the incorporated mn2 ion and generated sulfur vacancy vs 2 serve as reservoir that efficiently trap the photogenerated e leading to the improved photoactivity of as fabricated mn zns the overall photocatalytic efficacy was determined by the generated reactive oxidative species oh o2 that efficiently decomposed 95 4 mo dye into non toxic co2 and h2o in 120 min 70 rajabi et al fabricated fe3 ion doped zns qds via chemical precipitation method at room temperature for decolorization of malachite green the photocatalyst showed excellent visible light activity for malachite green mg degradation 90 in 90 min under uv radiations 619 nm along with higher stability where the average size of 1 7 0 2 nm was obtained for the the pristine zns qds and fe3 doped zns qds the lifetime of charge carriers electrons holes rely on the nature volume of dopant and morphology of the semiconductor the photodecolorization of malachite green with changed mole fraction x 0 00 0 01 0 03 0 05 and 0 07 is shown in fig 3c also a positive effect of 1 0 to 5 0 was experienced on the decolorization efficacy of zns the decreased decolorization efficiency was observed at x 0 07 highest mole fraction of fe impurity 84 similarly zinc blended crystal structure fe 3 doped zns quantum dots of average diameter of 3 nm were synthesized via chemical precipitation method using 2 mercaptoethanol the ensued qds exhibited excellent degradation efficiency 95 of victoria blue r vbr due to higher surface area and rapid transference of excitons to the nanoparticles surface the decrease in particle size and a corresponding increase in energy band from 3 68 to 4 58 4 75 ev determined the increased lifetime of excitons that further enhanced the photocatalytic proficiency consequently increase in zns bandgap is due to the decrease in particle size to 10 nm on doping with fe 3 ions the efficacy of photocatalyst strongly rely on the effect of solution ph during the reaction fig 3d illustrates the ph range from 2 to 13 for degradation efficiency for victoria blue r dye maximum degradation efficiency was attained at an alkaline ph range of 10 after 90 min of light irradiation and declined with increase in the ph range thus ph 10 was considered as the optimum range for the maximum degradation efficiency 85 cubic zinc blended structure of average size 2 38 to 2 46 nm of mn zns qds were synthesized via mw assisted techniquewhich showed 95 6 degradation of methyl orange under uv light irradiation broad and asymmetric emission peaks were observed in photoluminescence spectra pl of undoped zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds depicted in fig 4 a the pl spectra of undoped zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds exhibited emission at 420 450 nm whereas pure zns qds exhibited emissions at 421 and 483 nm the pl spectra of the zr2 rh3 and pd2 doped zns qds comprised of dissimilar peaks at around 431 438 and 435 nm whereas undoped zns qds also displayed a sharp peak at 440 nm 71 a conventional chemical method has been deployed for the fabrication of zns and ag doped zns qds ag doped quantum dots showed excellent photocatalytic activity for the degradation of strychnine in comparison to un doped catalysts under uv irradiation the brunauer emmett teller bet analysis of ag doped zns qds exhibits larger surface area 89 54 m2 g than zns i e 78 25 m2 g as ag loading on zns qds which provides more reaction sites for photocatalytic activity fig 4b depicts the time resolved pl spectra that showed the longer decay value 0 22 3 21 12 52 for ag doped zns qds in comparison to zns qds that exhibits decay time value at 0 16 1 21 7 25 this was due to the active charge transference across the silver interface and zns qds the ag doped zns qds showed larger decay time that suggests better charge separation with ag doping a resistance in the excitation of photogenerated electrons from conduction band to valence band was higher in ag doped zns qds than pristine zns qds at different time intervals as depicted in fig 4c this can be attributed to the impedence caused by zns qds due to higher charge transfer with ag dopant 86 4 3 rare earth metal doped zns qds rare earth metals with 4f and 5d states are considered as the ideal dopants when compared to transition metals for the modification of the structural electronic and optical properties 87 furthermore they tend to form complexes with various organic compounds through interaction with functional groups of f orbital thereby improving the photoactivity 88 rare earth metal have been incorporated in zns qds via hydrothermal route using zinc nitrate sodium sulfide as a precursor which resulted in 84 4 phenol red dye degradation within 105 min under uv light irradiation zns zn0 49gd0 01s and zn0 47gd0 03s qds were fabricated by poornaprakash et al following a hydrothermal route reported that zn0 47gd0 03s qds exhibit higher efficacy for degradation of phenol red dye 91 2 in comparison to zns 78 8 and zn0 49gd0 01s 84 4 qds as depicted in fig 4d the uv vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy uv drs profiles revealed maximum red shift absorption for 0 47 zn 0 03 gds qds followed by 0 49 zn 0 01 gd s and pristine zns the bandgaps of zns 3 84 ev 0 49 zn 0 01 gd s 3 71 ev and 0 47 zn 0 03 gd s 0 67 ev qds respectively were higher as compared to bulk zns 3 67 ev due to quantum confinement effect besides the decreased bandgap was due to the increased gd iii doping content that further ascribed to sp f interactions among the lanthanide ions and host 89 5 zns qds based heterojunctions the heterojunction is an interface that occurs between two dissimilar semiconductors having different band structures 90 91 this strategy has been utilized to improve charge separation inhibit the recombination rate of photogenerated electron hole pairs and enhance the photocatalytic performance 92 depending on the band alignment of the conduction and valence band edges the heterostructures are of three types ie type i straddling gap heterojunction where the valence and conduction band of semiconductor ii sc ii is higher than semiconductor i sc i that results in the formation of the straddling gap fig 5 a here the photoexcited electrons move from the conduction band of sc ii to conduction band of sc i whereas holes from sc ii were transferred to valence band of sc i thus both the electrons and holes were accumulated in sc i that lead to higher recombination rate that further resulted in lower redox potential the type i heterojunction is accompanied by certain limitations includes trifling charge separation because of potential discontinuity in energy band positions type ii heterojunction system corresponds to staggered gap alignment suitable for the spatial charge separation as depicted in fig 5b in type ii heterojunctions both the conduction band and valence band edge of the sc i is lower than the corresponding conduction band and valence band edge of the sc ii this heterojunction exhibits a better charge carrier separation with enhanced lifetime of the excitons type iii broken gap the type iii heterojunction system have tainted band alignments that signifies the broken band gap where the charge migration route is not feasible the construction of type iii heterojunction photocatalyst is similar to that of type ii except the staggered band alignment becomes so extreme that there is no overlap between the band gaps of the two photocatalyst fig 5c thus type iii heterojunction is considered unsuitable for the migration and separation of electron hole pairs 93 among these systems type ii heterojunctions are considered effective for conventional charge migration and separation route thereby enhancing wide light absorption with enhanced photocatalytic efficiency 94 5 1 conventional type ii zns qds based heterojunction system to better understand the enhanced photocatalytic activity labiadh et al reported the mechanism of forming heterojunction between tio2 and cu zns qds the photocatalytic mechanism involves transference of photogenerated electron from conduction band of cu zns 3 84 ev to conduction band of tio2 3 32 ev and holes are transferred from valence band of tio2 to cu zns the reactive oxidative species thus formed o2 and oh degraded 90 salicylic acid in 60 min under uv light irradiation 365 nm the effective charge separation in tio2 cu zns composite originating from the p n heterojunction is responsible for the increased lifetime of carriers and enhanced photocatalytic performance fig 6 a 49 similarly under uv light irradiation electron hole pairs are generated in the zns there is the transfer of an electron from the conduction band of zns to the conduction band of tio2 further the transferred electron hole pairs from zns to tio2 enhances the redox ability to further degrade organic pollutants fig 6b 95 when light irradiates on the photocatalytic surface excitons are separated and electron hole pairs are generated in the conduction band and valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 respectively the excitons in conduction band of mesoporous g c3n4 are simultaneously migrated to conduction band of bi2s3 and zns then again the h of bi2s3 zns are migrated to valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 in this manner meso g c3n4 acts as a bridge between the two photocatalysts semiconductor which favors the separation and transfer of photoinduced charges thereby enhancing the photocatalytic performance the electrons combined in conduction band of bi2s3 and zns quickly recombine with h meanwhile the accumulation of e and h pairs in the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 assists in the generation of oh the acquired oh radical further degrade the toxic contaminants the photocatalytic mechanism involved double charge transfer of photogenerated electrons from conduction band of mesoporous g c3n4 to the conduction band of bi2s3 and zns whereas the holes from valence band of bi2s3 and zns are migrated to the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 the accumulation of electrons in the conduction band of bi2s3 and zns react with holes whereas electron hole pairs accumulated in the valence band of mesoporous g c3n4 then oh further react with the holes to form oh radical that degraded 99 8 bisphenol a bpa under 325 nm light irradiation fig 6c the bet characterization method is an important technique to scrutinize the specific surface area as depicted in fig 6d the results revealed the surface areas of bi2s3 8 3 cm3 g 1 meso g c3n4 93 5 cm3 g 1 bi2s3 meso g c3n4 72 6 cm3 g 1 and zns bi2s3 meso g c3n4 78 3 cm3 g 1 respectively whereas the pore volumes of mesoporous g c3n4 bi2s3 meso g c3n4 and zns bi2s3 meso g c3n4 are 11 3 6 1 and 10 2 nm there is no significant change in the pore after recombination that affirms the presence of mesoporous structures interestingly the surface areas and pore volumes of meso g c3n4 are bigger than conventional g c3n4 and curve types confirmed the presence of mesopores 96 fig 7a depicts the photocatalytic mechanism of zns wo3 cofe2o4 nanohybrid under visible light irradiation the vb and cb edge of zns qds 2 675 3 575 ev and wo3 1 155 0 605 ev nanosheets and cofe2o4 nanoparticles being 2 23 and 0 29 ev the free radicals can further degrade 92 4 methylene blue in 240 min pl spectroscopy was used to examine the efficiency of migration trapping and recombination of the photogenerated electron hole pairs shown in fig 7b the lower the pl intensity the stronger the ability to assist in the separation of charge carriers and hence higher the photocatalytic performance as is evident from the figure zns qds and wo3 exhibit a strong emission peak at around 420 nm and cofe2o4 nps exhibit two pl emission peaks at 421 and 588 nm the decrease in the pl intensity of the zns wo3 nanohybrid in comparison to the pure samples is because of the charge separated state and enhanced mobility of the free charge carriers the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis characterization technique is important to examine the charge transport behavior of the nanohybrid formed fig 7c the arc radius is related to the charge transfer process whereas a smaller arc radius indicates lower charge transfer resistance the zns wo3 nanohybrid has a larger radius than the zns wo3 cofe2o4 nanohybrid the small charge transfer was due to the formation of a hybrid structure that led to the effectual immigration and separation of photoinduced charge carriers 97 emara et al reported the mechanism for cobalt doped zno zn oh 2 and their photocatalytic activity in depicted in fig 7d type ii heterojunction is formed by incorporating co with zns and each of zno co and zn oh 2 co zns is a p type semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3 5 3 9 ev whereas zno is an n type semiconductor with a bandgap of 3 1 3 3 ev this heterojunction lowers the recombination of charge carriers for photocatalytic performance 98 however type ii heterojunction is accompanied by certain drawbacks including electrostatic repulsion between electron electron and hole hole because of the electron and hole transference from the conduction band of semiconductor i to conduction band of semiconductor ii also redox potential of carriers decreases because migrating possesses relatively lower negative potential thus the development of z scheme heterojunction system appears a relatively more appropriate approach to achieve space charge separation along with the enhanced photocatalytic activity 5 2 z scheme photocatalytic system z scheme is the third and the modern heterojunction technique where the band potentials of the two semiconductors are in close proximity without any charge transfer mediator 99 the name z scheme is proposed as its charge transfer route mimics the photosynthesis process that follows photoexcitation of charge carriers which resembles the letter z in z scheme photocatalysts the surface junction between two semiconductors develops an induced electric field resulting in enhanced photocatalytic activity 100 101 a shuttle redox mediator fe3 fe2 and io3 i is incorporated in the traditional z scheme system which acts as a junction between two semiconductors and helps in the transference of electrons from one photocatalyst system to another the redox mediators usage is restricted due to feasible backward reactions of electron hole pairs as redox ions serve as mediator light shielding effect ph sensitive solution and less stability of redox mediator restricts the rate of reaction despite having such drawbacks the traditional z scheme system has been exploited on a larger scale for its potential appliances 102 all solid state ass z scheme systems are the second generation of z scheme there is a replacement of shuttle redox mediator by a solid state electron which are either carbon nanotubes cnts reduced graphene oxide rgo noble metals au ag and cu or carbon based materials graphene graphene oxide go carbon dots cds all solid state ass z scheme has certain limitations such as use of noble metals as solid mediators which are photo corrosive expensive and cause the shielding effect which needs to be resolved ass z scheme is accompanied by certain limitations but still has proved its worth effectively in photocatalysis moreover the absence of redox mediators or noble metals in a direct z scheme system overcomes the problem of backward reaction photo corrosion and shielding effect and provides significant features to photocatalytic systems 103 104 the main pre requisites involve a photocatalytic system with appropriate morphology excellent stability and high redox potential for effective degradation of pollutants which can be achieved by direct z scheme systems since rapid electron hole pair recombination was persistent in every traditional photocatalytic system thus z scheme heterostructures have been established by researchers to overcome this issue and attain superior photocatalytic efficacy 101 105 the inadequacies in type ii heterojunction system were evidenced in the comparative study of type ii and z scheme zns qds fe2o3 qds heterostructure deposited on rgo as shown is fig 8 a photoexcited electrons from conduction band 1 36 ev of zns qds migrate to 0 1 ev potential conduction band of fe2o3 qds simultaneously transference of holes occurs from valence band 2 66 ev of fe2o3 qds to 2 35 ev valence band of zns qds thereby following type ii conventional charge transference route this resulted in accumulation of the electrons and holes on the lower potential conduction band of fe2o3 qds and holes on the valence band of zns qds which were unfavourable for ros generation on the contrary in direct z scheme charge migration pathway fig 8b resulted in effective charge separation by recombining the lower potential electrons and holes of fe2o3 qds and zns qds respectively while the stronger redox potential electrons of zns qds and holes of fe2o3 qds were preserved for the effective generation of o2 and oh radicals for 96 45 of mb dye within 40 min of uv light irradiations to ascertain this mechanism radical scavenging experiments were performed where inhibition in mb dye photodegradation was observed as follows 11 43 35 26 and 45 82 on addition of tert butyl alcohol t buoh benzoquinone and ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta respectively as presented in fig 8c thus the influence of reactive species on mb degradation was found to be oh o2 h which was in support of direct z scheme mechanism 97 106 a synergistic combination of type ii and z scheme heterojuction was explored in a novel zns qds zno nanosphere bi4o5i2 tandem heterostructure exhibiting multichannel electron transfer route as depicted in fig 8d upon solar light radiation the electrons in the conduction band of zno were stimulated to the valence band of bi4o5i2 that further recombines with holes following z scheme charge transfer mechansim for type ii heterojuction the electrons in the conduction band of bi4o5i2 transferred to the conduction band of zns with simultaneous migration of holes from the valence band of zns to the valence band of bi4o5i2 the dual benefit of electron hole pairs separation and preservation of the reduction and oxidation abilities were obtained by type ii and z scheme systems respectively the reduced electron hole pairs recombination rate was well confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis results fig 8e displays smallest nyquist arc for zno bi4 o5i2 zns qds heterostructure in comparison to other heterojuctions which signifies reduced the overall resistance favorable for electron hole pairs separation the zno bi4o5i2 zns qds exhibited an excellent photocatalytic degradation efficiencies of 96 2 and 95 7 for bisphenol a bpa and 2 4 5 trichlorophenol tcp respectively the improved photocatalytic efficacy was justified by the sequence of photocurrent signals obtained for zno zno zns bi4o5i2 zns zno bi4o5i2 and zno bi4o5i2 zns as shown in fig 8f the strongest photocurrent signal for zno bi4o5 i2 zns inferred that the photoexcited electrons can be stimulated on their contact surface with effecitive separation of charge carriers 107 consequently constructing a z scheme heterostructures is inferred as a progressive method to endorse excellent research potential table 1 elaborates the potential of modified zns based qds to effectively achieve high organic pollutant removal 6 future prespectives the preface of zns qds photocatalysts for organic pollutant photodegradation is commendable as evident from the research studies reported in this review zns qds have been favoured because of the suitable valence band and conduction band potentials which promotes facile generation of reactive oxidative species i e oh and o2 radicals the size dependent light absorption property of zns qds is beneficial to obtain extendend solar spectrum responsive photocatalysts however at present the major limitations of charge carrier recombination and reduced solar light absorption persists in zns qds along with other fledgling research areas that demand further studies zns qds synthetic strategies should be upgraded with a novel and direct approach with low cost boosted porosity conductivity structural modification high reinforcement that possibly will develop areas of enhanced photocatalytic performance solvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis strategy has been widely applied in the zns qds based photocatalysts synthesis because it s a simple technique that removes the strong acid the effective versatile methods with non hazardous precursors eco friendly solvents short duration controlled synthesis approaches are required to enhance the photocatalytic efficacy photostability and recyclability are important parameters that effect the photocatalyst selection for the industrial purpose that further ensures the consistency of photoactivity with minimum loss of photocatalyst in each cycle there is an urgent need to explore advanced characterization techniques to extrapolate heterojunction mechanisms which claims to reduce the photoinduced charge carriers recombination rate z scheme photocatalytic system needs to be explored additionally as there are barely any reports on the zns qds framework since zns qds z scheme photocatalytic system enhances the overall photodegrdation proficiency providing ideal redox potential with better stability updated research in heterojunction formation are based on s scheme mechanism which has not been explored in zns qds the novel s scheme heterojunctions preserves higher redox capabilities and enhances solar energy utilization overcoming the drawbacks accompanied by the traditional type ii and z scheme systems hence further studies should be focused constructing s scheme based zns qds for enhanced photocatalytic efficiencies furthermore no precise study was found to clarify the up conversion photoluminescence ucpl impact of zns qds the experimental and hypothetical investigations emphasize the surface defects crystallinity and sizes of zns qds which should be directed to look for a persuading clarification on the tuning of optoelectronic properties to address these challenges it is expected to conduct research on zns qds in a more significant direction considering the above mentioned aspects 7 conclusions zinc sulfide quantum dots zns qds have fascinated researchers for organic pollutant degradation in wastewater because of their high chemical stability against oxidation and hydrolysis even when the particle size reduces to few nanometers this review enfolds the photocatalytic properties of zns qds summary of novel synthesis techniques and modulation strategies including doping and heterojuction formation the incorporation of dopants including non metals transition metals and rare earth metals are discussed as a route to increase the number of active sites for photo oxidative and reductive reactions zns qds based heterostructures architecting via type ii and direct z scheme charge transfer mechanism is also deliberated as a means of improving light absorption spectra with preservation of redox potentials for better photocatalytic proficiency zns qds based type ii heterostructes are most widely explored due to spatial chare separation of excitons the evolution of zns qds based z scheme heterostructure is still on the threshold of exploration but its potential to resolve the underlying traditional heterojuction limitations is irrefutable conclusively this review delineates the properties of zns qds as a photocatalyst and circumvent significant challenges encountered for the further expansion of photocatalytic properties of these systems declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
