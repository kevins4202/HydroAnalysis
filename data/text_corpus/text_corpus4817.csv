24085,we identify lagrangian coherent vortices in a global mesoscale eddy permitting ocean model using the rotation based method of haller et al 2016 we present an analysis of the acute sensitivity of the identification results to varying the method s free parameters and develop physically justified parameter choices that allow for systematic vortex identification in contrast to prior vortex studies we probe the broad spectrum of coherency in the ocean by determining free parameter choices that partition the spectrum into distinct coherency classes allowing for the identification of strictly coherent moderately coherent and leaky vortices our tuning methodology is grounded in a combination of sensitivity analysis convergence tests and consideration of the ocean model s physics to aid in this process we introduce the coherency index a novel lagrangian diagnostic for mathematically quantifying the degree of material coherency of a lagrangian vortex we aim for this manuscript and the accompanying open access code to serve as a manual and toolset for the oceanographer interested in harnessing a rigorous lagrangian method to uncover coherent structures in ocean models and observations keywords coherent structures mesoscale eddies vortex identification lagrangian analysis rclv 1 introduction transient ocean mesoscale fluctuations play a central role in the global climate system transporting climate relevant tracers such as heat and carbon in satellite observations and numerical simulations a portion of these fluctuations take the form of materially coherent vortices i e vortices whose interior material coheres together consensus has not emerged however as to the abundance of these coherent vortices in the global oceans and the magnitude of the associated transport in the literature coherent transport questions have been investigated primarily through the lens of eulerian based vortex identification a set of techniques that attempt to diagnose coherent structures via anomaly contours of an eulerian field e g sea level anomaly or okubo weiss parameter of okubo 1970 weiss 1991 to compute transport estimates these studies make the fundamental assumption that eulerian vortex contours trap and transport their material interior for recent examples see raj et al 2016 dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a b many studies justify this assumption by considering ug c where ug is the maximum geostrophic speed within the vortex and c is the mean translation speed chelton et al 2007 2011 when this diagnostic parameter is greater than unity rotation dominates over translation indicating that the identified feature departs from linear dynamics and can advect a parcel of trapped fluid chelton et al 2011 as practitioners of this methodology acknowledge the mere presence of some ability to trap fluid does not quantitatively guarantee complete material coherence over a vortex s total lifetime zhang et al 2014a dovidio et al 2013 nonetheless past studies make this assumption to reach estimates suggesting that identified vortices collectively play a significant role in global ocean transport dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b petersen et al 2013 on the other hand several studies have called into question the ability of eulerian vortex identification methods to correctly diagnose material transport abernathey and haller 2018 haller et al 2016 beron vera et al 2015 dovidio et al 2013 froyland et al 2007 and references therein the community s development of rigorous lagrangian based methods has cast doubt on eulerian vortex methodology challenging the notion that eulerian anomaly fields and diagnostics such as ug c can reliably uncover material transport in contrast lagrangian techniques exploit material trajectories the fundamental elements of fluid transport and thus provide direct access to the transport structure of ocean flows a feature common to both lagrangian and eulerian vortex identification methods however is the prominent role of free parameters including those related to numerical implementation for a lagrangian method the number of free parameters varies from 3 to 4 depending on the implementation in the case of the lagrangian averaged vorticity deviation lavd method of haller et al 2016 and up to 6 7 for the geodesic black hole vortex method of haller and beron vera 2013 an informative discussion of the strengths weaknesses and free parameters of lagrangian vortex algorithms can be found in hadjighasem et al 2017 which demonstrates promising results for the lavd method for reference the identification of the popular eulerian sea surface height ssh eddies of chelton et al 2011 required nine free parameters 1 1 the free parameters of chelton et al 2011 are as follows minimum ssh threshold for all pixels inside anti cyclonic eddies maximum ssh threshold for all pixels inside anti cyclonic eddies minimum ssh threshold for all pixels inside cyclonic eddies maximum ssh threshold for all pixels inside cyclonic eddies minimum number of pixels within eddy maximum number of pixels within eddy eddy ssh amplitude threshold maximum distance between interior eddy points and the choice of the number of pixels within a local neighborhood of an ssh extremum it may be inevitable that these free parameters exist after all a vortex identification algorithm must take a global field e g sea surface height velocity lavd as input and return a discrete object as output as in mathematics passing from the continuous to the discrete limit requires the introduction of a threshold or tolerance the presence of free parameters presents a challenge for the oceanographer whose desire is to identify physical structures that exist in the ocean independent of the particulars of an identification method to complicate matters the relationship between the mathematical parameters of the lagrangian method and the physics of the identified structures is opaque for example distinguishing between coherent versus incoherent sets of trajectories with the transport operator or spectral clustering approach boils down to a delicate mathematical task identifying a gap in the eigenvalues of an operator s spectrum froyland et al 2007 hadjighasem et al 2016 without exploring and understanding the physical significance of varying this parameter the oceanographer cannot harness the method to objectively shed light on ocean transport in the applied mathematics literature that introduced these lagrangian techniques the methods sensitivity and free parameters are not always systematically examined for example the authors of several leading vortex methods in the comparison paper of hadjighasem et al 2017 omit details on how the method was tuned we therefore rely on our expertise and experience to choose a reasonable set of parameters for each method with the intention that i the choice of parameter s results in the most favorable outcome for the corresponding method and ii the outcome is robust i e small variations in the parameters do not lead to drastic changes in the outcome thus while the applied mathematics literature provides promising tools it lacks instructions on how to physically rationalize a tuning of the sensitive parameters furthermore the literature lacks a clear definition of a favorable outcome which suggests that the final results are determined by the author s preferences rather reproducible objectives our paper aims to help fill this gap in the existing literature by creating a bridge that spans from the methods papers of the applied math community to the vortex census studies of oceanography our objective is to implement and apply a lagrangian based vortex identification method to a high resolution global ocean model conduct a rigorous and thorough sensitivity analysis and arrive at a physically justified tuning that systematically identifies materially coherent vortices we focus on a particular vortex identification method the lavd method of haller et al 2016 but in conducting our analysis aim to provide a tuning methodology that is relevant for other techniques wherever possible we strive to lend physical interpretation to the variation of the mathematical parameters in doing so we have taken steps to ensure that the tuning is robust in the sense that small adjustments to the free parameters do not produce large changes in the results stemming from this effort we introduce a new lagrangian based diagnostic of material coherency which we refer to as the coherency index this diagnostic allows us to precisely quantify the sensitivity of the identified vortices coherency to varying the method s free parameters beyond this usage the diagnostic has broad applicability and could be employed to compare the coherency of vortices across data sets models and identification methods 2 method and materials 2 1 the lavd method haller et al 2016 introduced a lagrangian based vortex identification abbreviated as the lavd method that exploits rotational coherence as a proxy for material coherence we have implemented the lavd identification method in an open source python package floater available at https github com rabernat floater the intuition for the method springs from the observation that fluid trajectories inside a coherent vortex are spatially and rotationally organized in bands layered concentrically about a rotating near circular core this combined spatial and rotational organization makes it possible to detect materially coherent objects via a trajectory based metric of rotation in particular we consider two dimensional flow and examine the relative vorticity defined as ζ x v y u and equal to twice the fluid s local rotation speed relative to the earth s rotation let a fluid element be labeled by a material label a and its position in physical space at time t be notated as x a t we introduce the lagrangian relative vorticity field ζ x a t t which takes as input a particular material trajectory and a specific time for convenience we choose to label the material by its position in physical space at some reference time t 0 so that a x 0 we are interested in characterizing not just the instantaneous local rotation but the average local rotation experienced by a material element over a finite time interval t i t f to do so we define the lagrangian averaged vorticity deviation 1 lavd t i t f x 0 1 t f t i t i t f ζ x x 0 τ τ ζ τ d τ where ζ is the domain average of the relative vorticity field haller et al 2016 for a given time interval lavd assigns a single scalar to each trajectory the magnitude of which describes the average amount of local rotation experienced by the material element to understand the rotational structure of the flow the convention is to visualize the lagrangian field lavd t i t f x 0 by plotting the value for each material element in the element s initial physical location i e x x 0 t i an example visualization is shown in fig 1 for the kuroshio current in the noaa gfdl cm2 6 model detailed in the following section the algorithm utilizes this representation of lavd t i t f x 0 which we simply refer to as the lavd field for t i t f to identify rotationally coherent vortices we now return to our earlier observation that coherent vortices are composed of collectively rotating fluid that is organized into concentric bands around a rotating near circular core interpreting this feature in terms of the lavd field provides the definition of a rotationally coherent lagrangian vortex rclv as a nested family of isolavd contours containing an innermost lavd maximum the outer boundary of the rclv is determined by a threshold on the convexity of the contour 2 2 a contour is convex if the line segment joining any pair of interior points lies entirely within the contour e g squares ovals and circles are convex but crescents or star shaped polygons are not a sample nested family of lavd contours is shown for an agulhas ring in fig 2 as explored in detail in section 3 3 the convexity threshold is the primary free parameter of the lavd method the coherency and population of the identified rclvs are acutely sensitive to the convexity threshold the above presentation is oriented towards the oceanographer but we refer readers to haller et al 2016 and haller 2016 for a rigorous and mathematical presentation of how lavd naturally arises from a dynamic polar decomposition of the deformation gradient the definition of an rclv relies on the empirically supported hypothesis that the more convex an lavd contour the more the interior fluid rotates together and by extension the more the fluid coheres it is worth noting that this connection between lavd contour convexity and material coherency while critical to the method lacks rigorous mathematical justification for general finite contours the justification is empirical and motivated by the near circular cross section generally observed for stable vortices haller et al 2016 the majority of section 3 3 is devoted to investigating this empirical relationship as a preliminary demonstration of the method we compare the evolution of vortex material identified by the method to randomly selected control fluid as shown in fig 3 the rotationally coherent object diagnosed by the method exhibits a high degree of material coherence in this particular case we find a downwelling vortex that contracts the surface material into a localized patch in general we also find upwelling rclvs that disperse material and non divergent rclvs that preserve their area the control material however is widely dispersed and stirred with the environmental fluid 2 1 1 implementation details given lagrangian trajectories the lavd method reduces the problem of identifying coherent vortices to the computational task of finding convex contours in a scalar field i e lavd this computational task belongs to the field of image processing and is amenable to multi core parallelization and less demanding in comparison to other lagrangian vortex identification methods as discussed in hadjighasem et al 2017 contour identification which also forms the basis of eulerian vortex algorithms is a well studied task that can be accomplished with existing optimized routines we take advantage of python s popular scikit image package described in van der walt et al 2014 the scalability of the underlying computational task allows vortices to be identified not just in the limited domains lagrangian vortex methods are typically developed and tested on e g cat s eye flow bickley jet and others in hadjighasem et al 2017 but also in the high resolution global domains of ocean models in the past this global identification was only computationally feasible with eulerian vortex methods as in petersen et al 2013 to apply the image processing methods we create a two dimensional image from the lavd scalar field a pixel gives the value of the corresponding particle s lavd the global domain we employ for this study spans all 360 in longitude and from 80 s to 64 n in latitude this domain is covered with a lagrangian particle mesh at a uniform resolution of 1 32 producing an lavd image with dimensions of 11 520 4608 pixels note that we respect the spherical geometry when computing areas and distances by using the appropriate local tangent plane projections identifying local maxima and contours in an image requires the introduction of two free parameters a parameter to control how many local maxima are extracted from the image and a parameter that sets an lavd increment for identifying contours similar parameters are also found in many eulerian sea surface anomaly methods chelton et al 2007 frenger et al 2015 the fundamental difference is that our underlying field is derived from lagrangian quantities for this study we inform our determination of these parameters by consideration of a the length scale of rclv permitted by the ocean model b sensitivity analysis and c convergence checks these efforts are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 while these free parameters are inherent to the method and equivalent parameters can be found in the original paper s matlab implementation publicly available at hadjighasem 2016 they are not discussed in the original manuscript of haller et al 2016 the other free parameter the convexity threshold which is fundamentally related to the coherency of the vortex is discussed in section 3 3 2 2 the cm2 6 coupled climate model we identify rclvs in the noaa gfdl cm2 6 coupled climate model which makes use of a 0 1 ocean model component the ocean component is based on the mom5 code of griffies 2012 and uses a z vertical coordinate quasi eulerian horizontal grid spacing is roughly 11 km in the equatorial region and 5 km in the high latitudes the atmospheric component makes use of a 50 km configuration with a full diurnal cycle of air sea fluxes communicated to the ocean every 20 min hence the ocean experiences a broad and realistic spacetime range of forcing cm2 6 has generated a growing suite of publications considering the role of explicitly represented ocean eddies in the climate system delworth et al 2012 winton et al 2014 griffies et al 2015 dufour et al 2015 saba et al 2016 goddard et al 2017 dufour et al 2017 to maintain the horizontal isotropy of the grid and account for variations in the rossby deformation radius with latitude the meridional spacing of the model s grid decreases towards the poles at its furthest extent near 80 s the meridional spacing reaches a minimum of approximately 1 24 the model s resolution permits organized turbulent structures at the mesoscale and parametrizes the effect of the unresolved sub grid scale dynamics on the mesoscale features as described in griffies et al 2015 a theoretical minimum of four grid cells is required to construct the basic circular velocity field pattern of a vortex as depicted in fig 4 accordingly we intend to identify coherent vortices with length scales greater than or equal to the length of two grid cells which varies from a minimum of 10 km at high latitudes to a maximum of 20 km at the equator when this computationally demanding simulation was run a decision was made to output horizontal velocities at daily averaged frequency at the sea surface and monthly averaged frequency for the full water column because the monthly averaged velocities are highly smoothed they are not suitable for detecting mesoscale coherent structures consequently this study is limited to considering advection by the near surface horizontal flow top model grid point representing a depth of 10 m the lagrangian trajectories generated by this flow can be considered to be the approximate trajectories of inertial particles whose strong buoyancy effectively constrains them to remain close to the sea surface haller and sapsis 2008 maxey and riley 1983 examples of such particles include surface debris and pollutants as well as drogued drifters while this flow is two dimensional three dimensional motions can be inferred from the convergence and divergence of trajectories as is discussed in detail in subsequent sections 2 3 lagrangian particle mesh because linearly interpolating the velocity field allows us to probe length scales slightly finer than the grid scale which is greater or equal to 1 24 we cover the domain with a lagrangian particle mesh of uniform 1 32 resolution this lagrangian particle resolution corresponds to initializing a nominal 4 4 array of particles in the interior of each nominal 0 1 0 1 velocity cell as shown in fig 4 in this work we advect the lagrangian particles in the daily mean surface currents from the pre industrial cm2 6 simulation of 200 years advection using archived velocity fields is conducted with the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 adcroft et al 2014 in offline mode as described in abernathey and marshall 2013 trajectories are integrated using a 4 th order runge kutta scheme with a timestep of 900 0 s velocity fields are interpolated from the arakawa b grid of mom5 to an arakawa c grid required for the mitgcm arakawa and r lamb 1977 the mom5 b grid is based on the murray tripolar grid of murray 1996 which has a standard quasi mercator latitude by longitude format south of 65 n but contains a non spherical grid north of 65 n with singularities over northern canada and northern russia griffies 2012 to avoid the complexities associated with interpolating from the non spherical polar region of the b grid to a spherical c grid the domain is truncated at 65 n the lagrangian particle mesh covers this near global domain at 1 32 resolution with 37 million particles the lavd and position of each lagrangian particle is output and saved daily for example fig 3 exhibits particle trajectories after 60 days of advection for a 30 day interval we distribute the advection of the global particle mesh in mitgcm over 128 processors this computation takes an hour and produces 32gb of trajectory data 3 results we proceed to analyze rclv identified in cm2 6 and walk through how to rigorously determine the method s free parameters in order to yield robust results we will take the trajectory data as given and thus do not conduct a sensitivity analysis of the lagrangian trajectory computation e g we do not address sensitivity to the advection time step spatial resolution of the velocity field or vorticity computation we only concern ourselves with the sensitivity of the free parameters inherent to the lavd method which is the objective of the paper without loss of generality we conduct this free parameter analysis on rclv identified in a 30 day window 3 1 minimum distance following the rclv recipe we seek closed and convex contours that encircle local maximum lavd pixels the first step is to identify local maximum lavd pixels using the skimage feature peak local max method by definition a local maximum exists with respect to a neighborhood whose extent requires specification thus introducing a new parameter min distance which is the minimum allowable number of lavd pixels separating two local maxima the largest possible number of local maxima can be extracted with min distance 1 we note that the lavd machinery is designed to identify stand alone vortices the problem of vortex merger and detecting multi core vortex structures as discussed in hughes and miller 2017 is beyond the purview of this project given our focus on identifying single core rclvs and considering our former observation that the smallest vortex that is theoretically permitted by the model occupies 4 grid cells we expect a minimum separation of at least three grid cells between lavd maxima at the respective centers of two neighboring rclvs as illustrated in fig 4 interpreting this criterion in terms of the nominal 4 4 lavd pixel array in the interior of each grid cell provides the requirement that lavd maxima should be at least 12 pixels apart sensitivity analysis reveals that identification results largely do not depend on slight variations in min distance in practice we find that mesoscale vortex features are almost always separated by at least a hundred kilometers a demonstration of this characteristic spacing is shown in fig 5 even though the number of local maxima strongly varies the final identified vortex field is identical the prominent and isolated mesoscale anomaly is separated from its nearest neighbor maxima by at least 20 pixels global identification with min distance set to 5 10 and 15 pixels also yielded identical rclv fields we have used min distance 10 in the following analysis 3 2 contour increment given a local lavd maximum the next step in the identification process is to find the outermost convex isolavd contour that encloses the maximum we numerically identify this boundary contour by iterating through the nested contour field starting from the maximum and expanding outward the iterative search terminates when a contour is identified that exceeds the convexity threshold contours are found using the skimage measure find contours method which implements the marching cubes algorithm of lorensen and cline 1987 to find contours the method linearly interpolates between the image s discrete pixels as a result the contour field is continuous a distinct contour exists for every value in the interval between the minimum and maximum lavd pixel values in the image to make progress we are required to specify a fixed lavd increment with which to iterate through the nested contour field this contour increment introduces another free parameter to the method fig 2 displays the nested contour field for the agulhas ring field of fig 8 a contour increment of 4 10 7 s 1 was employed to produce this contour field a coarse lavd contour increment will distort the geometry of the lavd field giving rise to a problematic coupling between the convexity deficiency and the contour increment we desire that the effects of varying the free parameters to be independent and must ensure that the contour increment is fine enough to resolve the contour convexity and minimize the coupling with convexity deficiency on the other hand we expect that the amortized time complexity of the vortex search varies inversely with the contour increment an excessively fine contour increment will thus require great computational cost yet minimally impact the grid scale features of the rclv boundary arriving at a contour increment that balances the competing interests resolving the contour convexity vs minimizing computation time requires understanding how the lavd varies from pixel to pixel we assess this variation by for instance taking the average of the difference between the lavd value at a pixel and the lavd value at its four neighboring pixels 2 δ lavd i j k l neighbors lavd i j lavd k l 4 where is the absolute value and the sum runs over the indices of the contiguous pixels neighbors i 1 j i 1 j i j 1 i j 1 fig 6 presents this averaged difference field for the agulhas lavd field previously plotted in fig 2 with the exception of fewer than ten pixels in the local 128 by 128 pixel domain the pixel to pixel variation in lavd exceeds 10 8 s 1 we thus expect that a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 appropriately resolve the grid scale rclv features we verify this hypothesis by conducting a sensitivity analysis in which we compare rclv boundaries identified with varying choices of contour increment the resulting contours are shown in fig 6 per our expectations convergence is achieved with a contour increment between 10 7 to 10 8 s 1 on a global scale we tested the robustness of the contour increment choice by comparing identification with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 to 10 9 s 1 both resultant datasets contained the same number of vortices and there was less than a 1 difference in cumulative area between the two datasets as a result we have employed a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 in this paper for reference rclv detection with floater on a global lavd image with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 takes roughly 3 h 3 3 convexity deficiency for the lavd method the fundamental tuning question is how to determine the boundary of the rclv using knowledge of the lavd contours convexity to this end we utilize the convexity deficiency abbreviated as cd as a measure of the convexity of a 2d lavd contour cd is equal to the area between the contour and its convex hull divided by the area enclosed by the contour haller et al 2016 the convex hull of a curve is the smallest convex set that contains the curve as shown in fig 7 if a curve has a small value of cd then the curve is nearly convex while plots in the vein of fig 3 evince a sound connection between lavd contours and material coherency they do not directly address the question of how to determine the convexity deficiency parameter this question is particularly important because the rclv identification results are highly sensitive to variations in cd this sensitivity is demonstrated in fig 8 for the rclv detection of an agulhas ring varying cd from 0 01 to 0 15 results in a concentric set of rclv boundaries with increasingly large spiral filaments this spiral shape is ubiquitous to rclvs and reflects the fact that rclvs decay from the outside towards the center by unrolling their exterior layer by layer this unrolling motion can be seen in fig 9 which shows the fate of the agulhas ring material interior rclvs were identified using only the first 30 days of trajectory data but trajectories past 30 days are shown to demonstrate the vortex decay process all the vortices become less compact with time but the higher cd cases show a faster deterioration with material globally breaking away from the core vortex and dispersing aside from expanding the boundaries of previously identified rclvs increasing the cd also leads to the identification of new structures this behavior is demonstrated in fig 10 which displays the detection results for a domain in the south atlantic with agulhas ring activity the number of the identified structures varies sharply with the cd identification with cd choices of 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 yields 3 11 20 and 24 vortices respectively as we might expect the three rclvs identified with cd 01 remain compact and coherent over the 30 day advection in comparison the structures that appear only at higher cd exhibit more filamentary tails and less compact geometry we emphasize that varying cd changes not only the number but also the nature of the identified rclv in the subsequent section we introduce a statistical measure to quantify this difference in coherency behavior to settle on a value of cd thus requires a subjective judgment of how coherent a feature must be in order to merit distinguishing it from the turbulent environmental fluid as a coherent structure to avoid this subjectivity the idea of simply setting cd 0 and eliminating it as a free parameter may sound appealing the consequence is that rclv boundaries are strictly convex polygons composed of edges with length equal to the resolution of the lagrangian particle mesh upon closer examination we find that this choice is unsatisfactory we have merely transformed the ambiguity in determining cd into an ambiguity in choosing the lagrangian mesh resolution perhaps part of the uncertainty here is due to the somewhat ill defined nature of a coherent structure s boundary this ambiguity is even present in mcwilliams original work on 2d quasi geostrophic turbulence where he steers clear of quantifying the boundary and a precise distinction between vortex and environment is challenging mcwilliams 1984 recently wang et al 2016 studied the life cycle of an agulhas ring using lagrangian based vortex detection and showed that periodic coherence regain events during which the vortex entrains surrounding fluid complicate this distinction between environment and vortex this ambiguity in the definition of a coherent structure s boundary along with the acute sensitivity of the method to cd motivates the idea of not settling on a single value of cd rather we argue that it is appropriate and desirable to leverage the sensitivity to cd in order to separate rclvs into three broad classes strictly coherent moderately coherent and weakly coherent aka leaky in order to accomplish this goal we need to choose three representative cd values for each coherency class while there is some subjectivity in choosing representative cd values this setup is arguably better motivated than the alternative of simply choosing a single cd for all of the analysis this approach also has the advantage of revealing dynamical insight on the geographical distribution of coherency in the ocean for instance it may be valuable to know what regions form leaky vortices exclusively or which regions experience a high frequency of strict coherent vortex formation 3 4 coherency index to achieve a coherency categorization based on cd we have to make precise the relationship between material coherency and cd to this end we introduce a coherency index to quantify an rclv s spatial compactness we compute the variance of the particle positions 3 σ 2 t x t x t 2 where indicates an average over the set of rclv particles and is the standard euclidean distance a coherent vortex remains spatially compact under advection to assess the change in spatial compactness over a time interval 0 t we compute the coherency index ci 4 ci σ 2 0 σ 2 t σ 2 0 the sign and magnitude of ci specify the material coherency of an rclv by construction ci is positive for vortices that are strongly coherent with a theoretical limit of ci 1 for vigorously downwelling vortices that contract to a point as in fig 3 for a weakly coherent vortex that sheds material σ 2 t can be arbitrarily larger than σ 2 0 and ci becomes arbitrarily negative fig 11presents sample vortex motions and their associated cis the vortices were selected from the vortex field discussed earlier in panel d of fig 10 as we might expect the ci metric penalizes a vortex for dispersing and developing filaments and rewards a vortex for growing more compact we also observe that ci values close to zero correspond to vortices whose movements closely resemble solid body motion in prior literature the variance of lagrangian particle displacements has been used to quantify how sets of particles spread out over time see the review of lacasce 2008 and references therein this quantity known as the dispersion is given by 5 d t x t x 0 x t x 0 2 note that d t measures how the particles disperse over the time interval 0 t while σ 2 t measures only the instantaneous spatial distribution of the particles at a fixed time t we now explain several reasons why d t has limited utility as a coherency metric first we note the problematic dependence of d t on the vortex s area which governs the spatial scale of the displacements the same value of d t can correspond to a fairly coherent large vortex and to a leaky small vortex this undesirable feature of d t is demonstrated in fig 11 a similar point is illustrated in fig 2 of lacasce 2008 with the conclusion being that w hile the dispersion reflects the clouds size it is fairly insensitive to the clouds distribution in space another fundamental limitation of d t is the quantity s inability to distinguish between radial expansion versus contraction consider a particle cloud with circular symmetry that is radially expanded or contracted since the vortex maintains its circular shape the mean displacement x t x 0 is zero by symmetry the value of d t is then set by only the magnitude of the change in the vortex s radius d t is ignorant of whether the change in the vortex s radius is positive or negative and thus cannot distinguish between expansion and contraction therefore d t overlooks a signature difference between upwelling and downwelling vortices these limitations of d t are not shared by ci which is independent of vortex area and capable of distinguishing expansion from contraction to further understand the relationship between ci and the convexity deficiency we conduct a global identification of rclvs for various choices of convexity deficiency we then compute and compare the coherency index distributions all calculations are done with a global 30 day lavd field the results are summarized in the table below and displayed in fig 12 note that a limited spatial region of this global data set was previously shown in fig 10 number mean ci median ci cd 0 01 109 0 28 0 48 cd 0 05 346 0 18 0 20 cd 0 1 579 0 48 0 11 cd 0 15 789 0 74 0 03 cd 0 2 1014 0 91 0 03 cd 0 25 1250 1 17 0 08 cd 0 3 1534 1 47 0 16 the clear trend aligns with our expectations the higher the value of convexity deficiency the greater the number of identified leaky vortices this fact is reflected by the coherency index distributions medians means and quartiles all shifting uniformly down the y axis towards negatives ci values in fig 12 first we observe that for the strictest convexity deficiency threshold of cd 0 01 the mean convexity index is positive indicating that the method is primarily identifying coherent objects that grow more compact with time at cd 0 05 the mean value of the convexity index changes sign to 18 this signals a coherency regime change although the median is still positive there are now many dispersive rclvs in the dataset all subsequent larger values of cd intensify the leakiness and shift the mean further negative the key point here is that to classify the strictly coherent rclvs we should choose a cd 0 05 the next shift in coherency regime occurs between cd 0 15 and cd 0 2 in this interval the median changes sign revealing that at cd 0 2 most identified vortices are leaky the proximity of the mean to the 1st quartile of data also reflects the presence of very incoherent vortices since most vortices leak and some do so to an extreme degree we conclude that between cd 0 15 and cd 0 2 we transition to the weakly coherent regime these findings suggest that we employ parameter choices of cd 0 01 cd 0 1 and cd 0 25 to survey the three different types of vortices in summary we delineated between the leaky and moderately coherent regimes by when the mean coherency index is approximately zero we then defined the end of the moderately coherent by when the median coherency index is approximately zero sample results for the cd values corresponding to these definitions are shown in fig 13 for a domain in the pacific ocean the varying dispersive nature of the identified vortices is in agreement with our expectations based on the above definitions the broad fluctuation in the results emphasizes the importance of understanding the method s sensitivity and how it relates to the physics of the identified vortices before applying the method to address vortex census questions importantly we find an order of magnitude more leaky vortices than strictly coherent vortices censuses conducted with cd 0 01 versus cd 0 25 would consequently reach rclv net transport estimates that differ by at least an order of magnitude for comparison we have included panel a of figure 14 to demonstrate the dispersive nature of randomly selected patches of fluid the control results are characterized by a ci distribution with an approximate mean of 7 and median of 5 4 discussion and conclusions the above analysis demonstrated that the lavd method results are highly sensitive to variations in the free parameters convexity deficiency min distance and contour increment we also described however that this sensitivity can be physically rationalized enabling the oceanographer to utilize the method to reveal objective structures through convergence analysis we have demonstrated that the full mesoscale vortex field can be detected with min distance 10 and that the nested lavd contour fields can be fully resolved with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 subsequently we introduced a coherency index to quantify the coherent versus dispersive nature of the identification results this diagnostic enabled us to select tunings of the convexity deficiency that explore the entire spectrum of coherency in the ocean in particular we showed that convexity deficiency choices of 0 01 0 1 and 0 25 are representative values for strictly moderately and weakly coherent vortices note that because resolution and dynamics vary from model to model these exact values may only be appropriate for our specific model dataset however the tuning methodology developed here should be equally effective and relevant for applying the method to other models and observations furthermore the coherency index provides a means to compare and assess results across models and even identification methods forthcoming work builds on the foundation laid in this paper and presents the results from a global census of vortices for each coherency class in cm2 6 our analysis was limited to the two dimensional surface manifestation of the vortex flow but coherent vortices are of course fully three dimensional structures the significant computational challenge posed by the 3d problem in conjunction with the absence of subsurface daily velocity field data in our model put 3d considerations beyond the scope of this study we share this 2d limitation with nearly all other vortex studies the lavd methodology however naturally extends to three dimensions in which a three dimensional array of lagrangian particles may be employed to search for convex isosurfaces of lavd as in section 11 of haller et al 2016 by only studying the surface realization of the vortex we are neglecting the vertical motion responsible for the upwelling and downwelling the presence of this vertical motion however can still be directly inferred and quantitatively addressed within the context of our 2d results by invoking three dimensional incompressibility we expect that horizontal motion dominates over vertical motion for vortices that show no signs of convergence divergence i e ci 0 as in fig 11c d for downwelling vortices however the horizontal motion of a surface constrained lagrangian particle may differ significantly from the horizontal motion of the fully 3d fluid trajectory consider the downwelling vortex of fig 3 the vortex has an initial horizontal surface area of 3 5 104 km2 and the depth of the ocean model s surface grid cell is 10 m giving a total initial volume of 350 km3 in the surface layer after 60 days of advection this material has been compressed to a narrow core with an area of 430 km2 consequently we infer that the vortex downwelled over the 60 day interval with a vertical volume transport of 6 7 104 m3 s or 6 7 10 2 sv assuming that the downwelling occurred in the vortex core we also estimate a characteristic downwelling velocity of 1 6 10 4 m s or 13 5 m day thus if the vortex column penetrates less than approximately 800 m into the ocean interior surface fluid may escape the coherent structure by being pumped down through the vortex column and exiting at depth future research should aim to explore this 3d structure of coherent vortices in terms of the detection method implementing a root finding algorithm in the contour search could potentially improve the algorithm currently we conduct the contour search by stepping through the lavd field at a fixed contour increment root finding algorithms e g the bisection method as described in burden and faires 1985 are designed to rapidly converge on the features of a function by taking taking variably sized steps consider a family of lavd contours and let cd x give the convexity deficiency of the contour with lavd x suppose that the desired cd threshold for rclv identification is cd o the rclv boundary is then specified by cd x cd o and x can be found using a root finding algorithm root finding would eliminate the need to specify a fixed contour increment efforts are underway to implement

24085,we identify lagrangian coherent vortices in a global mesoscale eddy permitting ocean model using the rotation based method of haller et al 2016 we present an analysis of the acute sensitivity of the identification results to varying the method s free parameters and develop physically justified parameter choices that allow for systematic vortex identification in contrast to prior vortex studies we probe the broad spectrum of coherency in the ocean by determining free parameter choices that partition the spectrum into distinct coherency classes allowing for the identification of strictly coherent moderately coherent and leaky vortices our tuning methodology is grounded in a combination of sensitivity analysis convergence tests and consideration of the ocean model s physics to aid in this process we introduce the coherency index a novel lagrangian diagnostic for mathematically quantifying the degree of material coherency of a lagrangian vortex we aim for this manuscript and the accompanying open access code to serve as a manual and toolset for the oceanographer interested in harnessing a rigorous lagrangian method to uncover coherent structures in ocean models and observations keywords coherent structures mesoscale eddies vortex identification lagrangian analysis rclv 1 introduction transient ocean mesoscale fluctuations play a central role in the global climate system transporting climate relevant tracers such as heat and carbon in satellite observations and numerical simulations a portion of these fluctuations take the form of materially coherent vortices i e vortices whose interior material coheres together consensus has not emerged however as to the abundance of these coherent vortices in the global oceans and the magnitude of the associated transport in the literature coherent transport questions have been investigated primarily through the lens of eulerian based vortex identification a set of techniques that attempt to diagnose coherent structures via anomaly contours of an eulerian field e g sea level anomaly or okubo weiss parameter of okubo 1970 weiss 1991 to compute transport estimates these studies make the fundamental assumption that eulerian vortex contours trap and transport their material interior for recent examples see raj et al 2016 dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2014a b many studies justify this assumption by considering ug c where ug is the maximum geostrophic speed within the vortex and c is the mean translation speed chelton et al 2007 2011 when this diagnostic parameter is greater than unity rotation dominates over translation indicating that the identified feature departs from linear dynamics and can advect a parcel of trapped fluid chelton et al 2011 as practitioners of this methodology acknowledge the mere presence of some ability to trap fluid does not quantitatively guarantee complete material coherence over a vortex s total lifetime zhang et al 2014a dovidio et al 2013 nonetheless past studies make this assumption to reach estimates suggesting that identified vortices collectively play a significant role in global ocean transport dong et al 2014 zhang et al 2014b petersen et al 2013 on the other hand several studies have called into question the ability of eulerian vortex identification methods to correctly diagnose material transport abernathey and haller 2018 haller et al 2016 beron vera et al 2015 dovidio et al 2013 froyland et al 2007 and references therein the community s development of rigorous lagrangian based methods has cast doubt on eulerian vortex methodology challenging the notion that eulerian anomaly fields and diagnostics such as ug c can reliably uncover material transport in contrast lagrangian techniques exploit material trajectories the fundamental elements of fluid transport and thus provide direct access to the transport structure of ocean flows a feature common to both lagrangian and eulerian vortex identification methods however is the prominent role of free parameters including those related to numerical implementation for a lagrangian method the number of free parameters varies from 3 to 4 depending on the implementation in the case of the lagrangian averaged vorticity deviation lavd method of haller et al 2016 and up to 6 7 for the geodesic black hole vortex method of haller and beron vera 2013 an informative discussion of the strengths weaknesses and free parameters of lagrangian vortex algorithms can be found in hadjighasem et al 2017 which demonstrates promising results for the lavd method for reference the identification of the popular eulerian sea surface height ssh eddies of chelton et al 2011 required nine free parameters 1 1 the free parameters of chelton et al 2011 are as follows minimum ssh threshold for all pixels inside anti cyclonic eddies maximum ssh threshold for all pixels inside anti cyclonic eddies minimum ssh threshold for all pixels inside cyclonic eddies maximum ssh threshold for all pixels inside cyclonic eddies minimum number of pixels within eddy maximum number of pixels within eddy eddy ssh amplitude threshold maximum distance between interior eddy points and the choice of the number of pixels within a local neighborhood of an ssh extremum it may be inevitable that these free parameters exist after all a vortex identification algorithm must take a global field e g sea surface height velocity lavd as input and return a discrete object as output as in mathematics passing from the continuous to the discrete limit requires the introduction of a threshold or tolerance the presence of free parameters presents a challenge for the oceanographer whose desire is to identify physical structures that exist in the ocean independent of the particulars of an identification method to complicate matters the relationship between the mathematical parameters of the lagrangian method and the physics of the identified structures is opaque for example distinguishing between coherent versus incoherent sets of trajectories with the transport operator or spectral clustering approach boils down to a delicate mathematical task identifying a gap in the eigenvalues of an operator s spectrum froyland et al 2007 hadjighasem et al 2016 without exploring and understanding the physical significance of varying this parameter the oceanographer cannot harness the method to objectively shed light on ocean transport in the applied mathematics literature that introduced these lagrangian techniques the methods sensitivity and free parameters are not always systematically examined for example the authors of several leading vortex methods in the comparison paper of hadjighasem et al 2017 omit details on how the method was tuned we therefore rely on our expertise and experience to choose a reasonable set of parameters for each method with the intention that i the choice of parameter s results in the most favorable outcome for the corresponding method and ii the outcome is robust i e small variations in the parameters do not lead to drastic changes in the outcome thus while the applied mathematics literature provides promising tools it lacks instructions on how to physically rationalize a tuning of the sensitive parameters furthermore the literature lacks a clear definition of a favorable outcome which suggests that the final results are determined by the author s preferences rather reproducible objectives our paper aims to help fill this gap in the existing literature by creating a bridge that spans from the methods papers of the applied math community to the vortex census studies of oceanography our objective is to implement and apply a lagrangian based vortex identification method to a high resolution global ocean model conduct a rigorous and thorough sensitivity analysis and arrive at a physically justified tuning that systematically identifies materially coherent vortices we focus on a particular vortex identification method the lavd method of haller et al 2016 but in conducting our analysis aim to provide a tuning methodology that is relevant for other techniques wherever possible we strive to lend physical interpretation to the variation of the mathematical parameters in doing so we have taken steps to ensure that the tuning is robust in the sense that small adjustments to the free parameters do not produce large changes in the results stemming from this effort we introduce a new lagrangian based diagnostic of material coherency which we refer to as the coherency index this diagnostic allows us to precisely quantify the sensitivity of the identified vortices coherency to varying the method s free parameters beyond this usage the diagnostic has broad applicability and could be employed to compare the coherency of vortices across data sets models and identification methods 2 method and materials 2 1 the lavd method haller et al 2016 introduced a lagrangian based vortex identification abbreviated as the lavd method that exploits rotational coherence as a proxy for material coherence we have implemented the lavd identification method in an open source python package floater available at https github com rabernat floater the intuition for the method springs from the observation that fluid trajectories inside a coherent vortex are spatially and rotationally organized in bands layered concentrically about a rotating near circular core this combined spatial and rotational organization makes it possible to detect materially coherent objects via a trajectory based metric of rotation in particular we consider two dimensional flow and examine the relative vorticity defined as ζ x v y u and equal to twice the fluid s local rotation speed relative to the earth s rotation let a fluid element be labeled by a material label a and its position in physical space at time t be notated as x a t we introduce the lagrangian relative vorticity field ζ x a t t which takes as input a particular material trajectory and a specific time for convenience we choose to label the material by its position in physical space at some reference time t 0 so that a x 0 we are interested in characterizing not just the instantaneous local rotation but the average local rotation experienced by a material element over a finite time interval t i t f to do so we define the lagrangian averaged vorticity deviation 1 lavd t i t f x 0 1 t f t i t i t f ζ x x 0 τ τ ζ τ d τ where ζ is the domain average of the relative vorticity field haller et al 2016 for a given time interval lavd assigns a single scalar to each trajectory the magnitude of which describes the average amount of local rotation experienced by the material element to understand the rotational structure of the flow the convention is to visualize the lagrangian field lavd t i t f x 0 by plotting the value for each material element in the element s initial physical location i e x x 0 t i an example visualization is shown in fig 1 for the kuroshio current in the noaa gfdl cm2 6 model detailed in the following section the algorithm utilizes this representation of lavd t i t f x 0 which we simply refer to as the lavd field for t i t f to identify rotationally coherent vortices we now return to our earlier observation that coherent vortices are composed of collectively rotating fluid that is organized into concentric bands around a rotating near circular core interpreting this feature in terms of the lavd field provides the definition of a rotationally coherent lagrangian vortex rclv as a nested family of isolavd contours containing an innermost lavd maximum the outer boundary of the rclv is determined by a threshold on the convexity of the contour 2 2 a contour is convex if the line segment joining any pair of interior points lies entirely within the contour e g squares ovals and circles are convex but crescents or star shaped polygons are not a sample nested family of lavd contours is shown for an agulhas ring in fig 2 as explored in detail in section 3 3 the convexity threshold is the primary free parameter of the lavd method the coherency and population of the identified rclvs are acutely sensitive to the convexity threshold the above presentation is oriented towards the oceanographer but we refer readers to haller et al 2016 and haller 2016 for a rigorous and mathematical presentation of how lavd naturally arises from a dynamic polar decomposition of the deformation gradient the definition of an rclv relies on the empirically supported hypothesis that the more convex an lavd contour the more the interior fluid rotates together and by extension the more the fluid coheres it is worth noting that this connection between lavd contour convexity and material coherency while critical to the method lacks rigorous mathematical justification for general finite contours the justification is empirical and motivated by the near circular cross section generally observed for stable vortices haller et al 2016 the majority of section 3 3 is devoted to investigating this empirical relationship as a preliminary demonstration of the method we compare the evolution of vortex material identified by the method to randomly selected control fluid as shown in fig 3 the rotationally coherent object diagnosed by the method exhibits a high degree of material coherence in this particular case we find a downwelling vortex that contracts the surface material into a localized patch in general we also find upwelling rclvs that disperse material and non divergent rclvs that preserve their area the control material however is widely dispersed and stirred with the environmental fluid 2 1 1 implementation details given lagrangian trajectories the lavd method reduces the problem of identifying coherent vortices to the computational task of finding convex contours in a scalar field i e lavd this computational task belongs to the field of image processing and is amenable to multi core parallelization and less demanding in comparison to other lagrangian vortex identification methods as discussed in hadjighasem et al 2017 contour identification which also forms the basis of eulerian vortex algorithms is a well studied task that can be accomplished with existing optimized routines we take advantage of python s popular scikit image package described in van der walt et al 2014 the scalability of the underlying computational task allows vortices to be identified not just in the limited domains lagrangian vortex methods are typically developed and tested on e g cat s eye flow bickley jet and others in hadjighasem et al 2017 but also in the high resolution global domains of ocean models in the past this global identification was only computationally feasible with eulerian vortex methods as in petersen et al 2013 to apply the image processing methods we create a two dimensional image from the lavd scalar field a pixel gives the value of the corresponding particle s lavd the global domain we employ for this study spans all 360 in longitude and from 80 s to 64 n in latitude this domain is covered with a lagrangian particle mesh at a uniform resolution of 1 32 producing an lavd image with dimensions of 11 520 4608 pixels note that we respect the spherical geometry when computing areas and distances by using the appropriate local tangent plane projections identifying local maxima and contours in an image requires the introduction of two free parameters a parameter to control how many local maxima are extracted from the image and a parameter that sets an lavd increment for identifying contours similar parameters are also found in many eulerian sea surface anomaly methods chelton et al 2007 frenger et al 2015 the fundamental difference is that our underlying field is derived from lagrangian quantities for this study we inform our determination of these parameters by consideration of a the length scale of rclv permitted by the ocean model b sensitivity analysis and c convergence checks these efforts are described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 while these free parameters are inherent to the method and equivalent parameters can be found in the original paper s matlab implementation publicly available at hadjighasem 2016 they are not discussed in the original manuscript of haller et al 2016 the other free parameter the convexity threshold which is fundamentally related to the coherency of the vortex is discussed in section 3 3 2 2 the cm2 6 coupled climate model we identify rclvs in the noaa gfdl cm2 6 coupled climate model which makes use of a 0 1 ocean model component the ocean component is based on the mom5 code of griffies 2012 and uses a z vertical coordinate quasi eulerian horizontal grid spacing is roughly 11 km in the equatorial region and 5 km in the high latitudes the atmospheric component makes use of a 50 km configuration with a full diurnal cycle of air sea fluxes communicated to the ocean every 20 min hence the ocean experiences a broad and realistic spacetime range of forcing cm2 6 has generated a growing suite of publications considering the role of explicitly represented ocean eddies in the climate system delworth et al 2012 winton et al 2014 griffies et al 2015 dufour et al 2015 saba et al 2016 goddard et al 2017 dufour et al 2017 to maintain the horizontal isotropy of the grid and account for variations in the rossby deformation radius with latitude the meridional spacing of the model s grid decreases towards the poles at its furthest extent near 80 s the meridional spacing reaches a minimum of approximately 1 24 the model s resolution permits organized turbulent structures at the mesoscale and parametrizes the effect of the unresolved sub grid scale dynamics on the mesoscale features as described in griffies et al 2015 a theoretical minimum of four grid cells is required to construct the basic circular velocity field pattern of a vortex as depicted in fig 4 accordingly we intend to identify coherent vortices with length scales greater than or equal to the length of two grid cells which varies from a minimum of 10 km at high latitudes to a maximum of 20 km at the equator when this computationally demanding simulation was run a decision was made to output horizontal velocities at daily averaged frequency at the sea surface and monthly averaged frequency for the full water column because the monthly averaged velocities are highly smoothed they are not suitable for detecting mesoscale coherent structures consequently this study is limited to considering advection by the near surface horizontal flow top model grid point representing a depth of 10 m the lagrangian trajectories generated by this flow can be considered to be the approximate trajectories of inertial particles whose strong buoyancy effectively constrains them to remain close to the sea surface haller and sapsis 2008 maxey and riley 1983 examples of such particles include surface debris and pollutants as well as drogued drifters while this flow is two dimensional three dimensional motions can be inferred from the convergence and divergence of trajectories as is discussed in detail in subsequent sections 2 3 lagrangian particle mesh because linearly interpolating the velocity field allows us to probe length scales slightly finer than the grid scale which is greater or equal to 1 24 we cover the domain with a lagrangian particle mesh of uniform 1 32 resolution this lagrangian particle resolution corresponds to initializing a nominal 4 4 array of particles in the interior of each nominal 0 1 0 1 velocity cell as shown in fig 4 in this work we advect the lagrangian particles in the daily mean surface currents from the pre industrial cm2 6 simulation of 200 years advection using archived velocity fields is conducted with the mitgcm marshall et al 1997 adcroft et al 2014 in offline mode as described in abernathey and marshall 2013 trajectories are integrated using a 4 th order runge kutta scheme with a timestep of 900 0 s velocity fields are interpolated from the arakawa b grid of mom5 to an arakawa c grid required for the mitgcm arakawa and r lamb 1977 the mom5 b grid is based on the murray tripolar grid of murray 1996 which has a standard quasi mercator latitude by longitude format south of 65 n but contains a non spherical grid north of 65 n with singularities over northern canada and northern russia griffies 2012 to avoid the complexities associated with interpolating from the non spherical polar region of the b grid to a spherical c grid the domain is truncated at 65 n the lagrangian particle mesh covers this near global domain at 1 32 resolution with 37 million particles the lavd and position of each lagrangian particle is output and saved daily for example fig 3 exhibits particle trajectories after 60 days of advection for a 30 day interval we distribute the advection of the global particle mesh in mitgcm over 128 processors this computation takes an hour and produces 32gb of trajectory data 3 results we proceed to analyze rclv identified in cm2 6 and walk through how to rigorously determine the method s free parameters in order to yield robust results we will take the trajectory data as given and thus do not conduct a sensitivity analysis of the lagrangian trajectory computation e g we do not address sensitivity to the advection time step spatial resolution of the velocity field or vorticity computation we only concern ourselves with the sensitivity of the free parameters inherent to the lavd method which is the objective of the paper without loss of generality we conduct this free parameter analysis on rclv identified in a 30 day window 3 1 minimum distance following the rclv recipe we seek closed and convex contours that encircle local maximum lavd pixels the first step is to identify local maximum lavd pixels using the skimage feature peak local max method by definition a local maximum exists with respect to a neighborhood whose extent requires specification thus introducing a new parameter min distance which is the minimum allowable number of lavd pixels separating two local maxima the largest possible number of local maxima can be extracted with min distance 1 we note that the lavd machinery is designed to identify stand alone vortices the problem of vortex merger and detecting multi core vortex structures as discussed in hughes and miller 2017 is beyond the purview of this project given our focus on identifying single core rclvs and considering our former observation that the smallest vortex that is theoretically permitted by the model occupies 4 grid cells we expect a minimum separation of at least three grid cells between lavd maxima at the respective centers of two neighboring rclvs as illustrated in fig 4 interpreting this criterion in terms of the nominal 4 4 lavd pixel array in the interior of each grid cell provides the requirement that lavd maxima should be at least 12 pixels apart sensitivity analysis reveals that identification results largely do not depend on slight variations in min distance in practice we find that mesoscale vortex features are almost always separated by at least a hundred kilometers a demonstration of this characteristic spacing is shown in fig 5 even though the number of local maxima strongly varies the final identified vortex field is identical the prominent and isolated mesoscale anomaly is separated from its nearest neighbor maxima by at least 20 pixels global identification with min distance set to 5 10 and 15 pixels also yielded identical rclv fields we have used min distance 10 in the following analysis 3 2 contour increment given a local lavd maximum the next step in the identification process is to find the outermost convex isolavd contour that encloses the maximum we numerically identify this boundary contour by iterating through the nested contour field starting from the maximum and expanding outward the iterative search terminates when a contour is identified that exceeds the convexity threshold contours are found using the skimage measure find contours method which implements the marching cubes algorithm of lorensen and cline 1987 to find contours the method linearly interpolates between the image s discrete pixels as a result the contour field is continuous a distinct contour exists for every value in the interval between the minimum and maximum lavd pixel values in the image to make progress we are required to specify a fixed lavd increment with which to iterate through the nested contour field this contour increment introduces another free parameter to the method fig 2 displays the nested contour field for the agulhas ring field of fig 8 a contour increment of 4 10 7 s 1 was employed to produce this contour field a coarse lavd contour increment will distort the geometry of the lavd field giving rise to a problematic coupling between the convexity deficiency and the contour increment we desire that the effects of varying the free parameters to be independent and must ensure that the contour increment is fine enough to resolve the contour convexity and minimize the coupling with convexity deficiency on the other hand we expect that the amortized time complexity of the vortex search varies inversely with the contour increment an excessively fine contour increment will thus require great computational cost yet minimally impact the grid scale features of the rclv boundary arriving at a contour increment that balances the competing interests resolving the contour convexity vs minimizing computation time requires understanding how the lavd varies from pixel to pixel we assess this variation by for instance taking the average of the difference between the lavd value at a pixel and the lavd value at its four neighboring pixels 2 δ lavd i j k l neighbors lavd i j lavd k l 4 where is the absolute value and the sum runs over the indices of the contiguous pixels neighbors i 1 j i 1 j i j 1 i j 1 fig 6 presents this averaged difference field for the agulhas lavd field previously plotted in fig 2 with the exception of fewer than ten pixels in the local 128 by 128 pixel domain the pixel to pixel variation in lavd exceeds 10 8 s 1 we thus expect that a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 appropriately resolve the grid scale rclv features we verify this hypothesis by conducting a sensitivity analysis in which we compare rclv boundaries identified with varying choices of contour increment the resulting contours are shown in fig 6 per our expectations convergence is achieved with a contour increment between 10 7 to 10 8 s 1 on a global scale we tested the robustness of the contour increment choice by comparing identification with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 to 10 9 s 1 both resultant datasets contained the same number of vortices and there was less than a 1 difference in cumulative area between the two datasets as a result we have employed a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 in this paper for reference rclv detection with floater on a global lavd image with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 takes roughly 3 h 3 3 convexity deficiency for the lavd method the fundamental tuning question is how to determine the boundary of the rclv using knowledge of the lavd contours convexity to this end we utilize the convexity deficiency abbreviated as cd as a measure of the convexity of a 2d lavd contour cd is equal to the area between the contour and its convex hull divided by the area enclosed by the contour haller et al 2016 the convex hull of a curve is the smallest convex set that contains the curve as shown in fig 7 if a curve has a small value of cd then the curve is nearly convex while plots in the vein of fig 3 evince a sound connection between lavd contours and material coherency they do not directly address the question of how to determine the convexity deficiency parameter this question is particularly important because the rclv identification results are highly sensitive to variations in cd this sensitivity is demonstrated in fig 8 for the rclv detection of an agulhas ring varying cd from 0 01 to 0 15 results in a concentric set of rclv boundaries with increasingly large spiral filaments this spiral shape is ubiquitous to rclvs and reflects the fact that rclvs decay from the outside towards the center by unrolling their exterior layer by layer this unrolling motion can be seen in fig 9 which shows the fate of the agulhas ring material interior rclvs were identified using only the first 30 days of trajectory data but trajectories past 30 days are shown to demonstrate the vortex decay process all the vortices become less compact with time but the higher cd cases show a faster deterioration with material globally breaking away from the core vortex and dispersing aside from expanding the boundaries of previously identified rclvs increasing the cd also leads to the identification of new structures this behavior is demonstrated in fig 10 which displays the detection results for a domain in the south atlantic with agulhas ring activity the number of the identified structures varies sharply with the cd identification with cd choices of 0 01 0 05 0 1 0 15 yields 3 11 20 and 24 vortices respectively as we might expect the three rclvs identified with cd 01 remain compact and coherent over the 30 day advection in comparison the structures that appear only at higher cd exhibit more filamentary tails and less compact geometry we emphasize that varying cd changes not only the number but also the nature of the identified rclv in the subsequent section we introduce a statistical measure to quantify this difference in coherency behavior to settle on a value of cd thus requires a subjective judgment of how coherent a feature must be in order to merit distinguishing it from the turbulent environmental fluid as a coherent structure to avoid this subjectivity the idea of simply setting cd 0 and eliminating it as a free parameter may sound appealing the consequence is that rclv boundaries are strictly convex polygons composed of edges with length equal to the resolution of the lagrangian particle mesh upon closer examination we find that this choice is unsatisfactory we have merely transformed the ambiguity in determining cd into an ambiguity in choosing the lagrangian mesh resolution perhaps part of the uncertainty here is due to the somewhat ill defined nature of a coherent structure s boundary this ambiguity is even present in mcwilliams original work on 2d quasi geostrophic turbulence where he steers clear of quantifying the boundary and a precise distinction between vortex and environment is challenging mcwilliams 1984 recently wang et al 2016 studied the life cycle of an agulhas ring using lagrangian based vortex detection and showed that periodic coherence regain events during which the vortex entrains surrounding fluid complicate this distinction between environment and vortex this ambiguity in the definition of a coherent structure s boundary along with the acute sensitivity of the method to cd motivates the idea of not settling on a single value of cd rather we argue that it is appropriate and desirable to leverage the sensitivity to cd in order to separate rclvs into three broad classes strictly coherent moderately coherent and weakly coherent aka leaky in order to accomplish this goal we need to choose three representative cd values for each coherency class while there is some subjectivity in choosing representative cd values this setup is arguably better motivated than the alternative of simply choosing a single cd for all of the analysis this approach also has the advantage of revealing dynamical insight on the geographical distribution of coherency in the ocean for instance it may be valuable to know what regions form leaky vortices exclusively or which regions experience a high frequency of strict coherent vortex formation 3 4 coherency index to achieve a coherency categorization based on cd we have to make precise the relationship between material coherency and cd to this end we introduce a coherency index to quantify an rclv s spatial compactness we compute the variance of the particle positions 3 σ 2 t x t x t 2 where indicates an average over the set of rclv particles and is the standard euclidean distance a coherent vortex remains spatially compact under advection to assess the change in spatial compactness over a time interval 0 t we compute the coherency index ci 4 ci σ 2 0 σ 2 t σ 2 0 the sign and magnitude of ci specify the material coherency of an rclv by construction ci is positive for vortices that are strongly coherent with a theoretical limit of ci 1 for vigorously downwelling vortices that contract to a point as in fig 3 for a weakly coherent vortex that sheds material σ 2 t can be arbitrarily larger than σ 2 0 and ci becomes arbitrarily negative fig 11presents sample vortex motions and their associated cis the vortices were selected from the vortex field discussed earlier in panel d of fig 10 as we might expect the ci metric penalizes a vortex for dispersing and developing filaments and rewards a vortex for growing more compact we also observe that ci values close to zero correspond to vortices whose movements closely resemble solid body motion in prior literature the variance of lagrangian particle displacements has been used to quantify how sets of particles spread out over time see the review of lacasce 2008 and references therein this quantity known as the dispersion is given by 5 d t x t x 0 x t x 0 2 note that d t measures how the particles disperse over the time interval 0 t while σ 2 t measures only the instantaneous spatial distribution of the particles at a fixed time t we now explain several reasons why d t has limited utility as a coherency metric first we note the problematic dependence of d t on the vortex s area which governs the spatial scale of the displacements the same value of d t can correspond to a fairly coherent large vortex and to a leaky small vortex this undesirable feature of d t is demonstrated in fig 11 a similar point is illustrated in fig 2 of lacasce 2008 with the conclusion being that w hile the dispersion reflects the clouds size it is fairly insensitive to the clouds distribution in space another fundamental limitation of d t is the quantity s inability to distinguish between radial expansion versus contraction consider a particle cloud with circular symmetry that is radially expanded or contracted since the vortex maintains its circular shape the mean displacement x t x 0 is zero by symmetry the value of d t is then set by only the magnitude of the change in the vortex s radius d t is ignorant of whether the change in the vortex s radius is positive or negative and thus cannot distinguish between expansion and contraction therefore d t overlooks a signature difference between upwelling and downwelling vortices these limitations of d t are not shared by ci which is independent of vortex area and capable of distinguishing expansion from contraction to further understand the relationship between ci and the convexity deficiency we conduct a global identification of rclvs for various choices of convexity deficiency we then compute and compare the coherency index distributions all calculations are done with a global 30 day lavd field the results are summarized in the table below and displayed in fig 12 note that a limited spatial region of this global data set was previously shown in fig 10 number mean ci median ci cd 0 01 109 0 28 0 48 cd 0 05 346 0 18 0 20 cd 0 1 579 0 48 0 11 cd 0 15 789 0 74 0 03 cd 0 2 1014 0 91 0 03 cd 0 25 1250 1 17 0 08 cd 0 3 1534 1 47 0 16 the clear trend aligns with our expectations the higher the value of convexity deficiency the greater the number of identified leaky vortices this fact is reflected by the coherency index distributions medians means and quartiles all shifting uniformly down the y axis towards negatives ci values in fig 12 first we observe that for the strictest convexity deficiency threshold of cd 0 01 the mean convexity index is positive indicating that the method is primarily identifying coherent objects that grow more compact with time at cd 0 05 the mean value of the convexity index changes sign to 18 this signals a coherency regime change although the median is still positive there are now many dispersive rclvs in the dataset all subsequent larger values of cd intensify the leakiness and shift the mean further negative the key point here is that to classify the strictly coherent rclvs we should choose a cd 0 05 the next shift in coherency regime occurs between cd 0 15 and cd 0 2 in this interval the median changes sign revealing that at cd 0 2 most identified vortices are leaky the proximity of the mean to the 1st quartile of data also reflects the presence of very incoherent vortices since most vortices leak and some do so to an extreme degree we conclude that between cd 0 15 and cd 0 2 we transition to the weakly coherent regime these findings suggest that we employ parameter choices of cd 0 01 cd 0 1 and cd 0 25 to survey the three different types of vortices in summary we delineated between the leaky and moderately coherent regimes by when the mean coherency index is approximately zero we then defined the end of the moderately coherent by when the median coherency index is approximately zero sample results for the cd values corresponding to these definitions are shown in fig 13 for a domain in the pacific ocean the varying dispersive nature of the identified vortices is in agreement with our expectations based on the above definitions the broad fluctuation in the results emphasizes the importance of understanding the method s sensitivity and how it relates to the physics of the identified vortices before applying the method to address vortex census questions importantly we find an order of magnitude more leaky vortices than strictly coherent vortices censuses conducted with cd 0 01 versus cd 0 25 would consequently reach rclv net transport estimates that differ by at least an order of magnitude for comparison we have included panel a of figure 14 to demonstrate the dispersive nature of randomly selected patches of fluid the control results are characterized by a ci distribution with an approximate mean of 7 and median of 5 4 discussion and conclusions the above analysis demonstrated that the lavd method results are highly sensitive to variations in the free parameters convexity deficiency min distance and contour increment we also described however that this sensitivity can be physically rationalized enabling the oceanographer to utilize the method to reveal objective structures through convergence analysis we have demonstrated that the full mesoscale vortex field can be detected with min distance 10 and that the nested lavd contour fields can be fully resolved with a contour increment of 10 8 s 1 subsequently we introduced a coherency index to quantify the coherent versus dispersive nature of the identification results this diagnostic enabled us to select tunings of the convexity deficiency that explore the entire spectrum of coherency in the ocean in particular we showed that convexity deficiency choices of 0 01 0 1 and 0 25 are representative values for strictly moderately and weakly coherent vortices note that because resolution and dynamics vary from model to model these exact values may only be appropriate for our specific model dataset however the tuning methodology developed here should be equally effective and relevant for applying the method to other models and observations furthermore the coherency index provides a means to compare and assess results across models and even identification methods forthcoming work builds on the foundation laid in this paper and presents the results from a global census of vortices for each coherency class in cm2 6 our analysis was limited to the two dimensional surface manifestation of the vortex flow but coherent vortices are of course fully three dimensional structures the significant computational challenge posed by the 3d problem in conjunction with the absence of subsurface daily velocity field data in our model put 3d considerations beyond the scope of this study we share this 2d limitation with nearly all other vortex studies the lavd methodology however naturally extends to three dimensions in which a three dimensional array of lagrangian particles may be employed to search for convex isosurfaces of lavd as in section 11 of haller et al 2016 by only studying the surface realization of the vortex we are neglecting the vertical motion responsible for the upwelling and downwelling the presence of this vertical motion however can still be directly inferred and quantitatively addressed within the context of our 2d results by invoking three dimensional incompressibility we expect that horizontal motion dominates over vertical motion for vortices that show no signs of convergence divergence i e ci 0 as in fig 11c d for downwelling vortices however the horizontal motion of a surface constrained lagrangian particle may differ significantly from the horizontal motion of the fully 3d fluid trajectory consider the downwelling vortex of fig 3 the vortex has an initial horizontal surface area of 3 5 104 km2 and the depth of the ocean model s surface grid cell is 10 m giving a total initial volume of 350 km3 in the surface layer after 60 days of advection this material has been compressed to a narrow core with an area of 430 km2 consequently we infer that the vortex downwelled over the 60 day interval with a vertical volume transport of 6 7 104 m3 s or 6 7 10 2 sv assuming that the downwelling occurred in the vortex core we also estimate a characteristic downwelling velocity of 1 6 10 4 m s or 13 5 m day thus if the vortex column penetrates less than approximately 800 m into the ocean interior surface fluid may escape the coherent structure by being pumped down through the vortex column and exiting at depth future research should aim to explore this 3d structure of coherent vortices in terms of the detection method implementing a root finding algorithm in the contour search could potentially improve the algorithm currently we conduct the contour search by stepping through the lavd field at a fixed contour increment root finding algorithms e g the bisection method as described in burden and faires 1985 are designed to rapidly converge on the features of a function by taking taking variably sized steps consider a family of lavd contours and let cd x give the convexity deficiency of the contour with lavd x suppose that the desired cd threshold for rclv identification is cd o the rclv boundary is then specified by cd x cd o and x can be found using a root finding algorithm root finding would eliminate the need to specify a fixed contour increment efforts are underway to implement

24086,a 17 year 1999 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis is used to calculate the wind work to the global oceanic circulation with a focus on the global integral of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents while the wind work on the geostrophic currents estimate of the study is in good agreement with previous research our estimation of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents 5 44 tw is significantly larger than previous estimates the two main reasons for this difference are 1 the thickness of hycom s first vertical layer is 1 m and thus the surface ageostrophic currents are better represented than those in numerical models that use a thicker top layer and 2 the reanalysis is forced with hourly surface stresses and thus contains wind work contributions from high frequency wind stress variations compared against previous estimates using daily wind stress 1 introduction the wind is one of several possible mechanical energy sources to drive ocean interior mixing munk and wunsch 1998 and the wind energy input to the global oceans is the most important mechanical energy source in maintaining the oceanic general circulation huang et al 2006 the average wind mechanical energy input rate is defined as the total wind work 1 w τ v where w is the rate at which the wind stress τ works on the ocean surface current v and an overbar denotes time averaging the ocean surface current in eq 1 can be split into geostrophic v g and ageostrophic v ag components 2 v v g v ag thus the wind work input into the global ocean circulation contains both wind work on surface geostrophic currents wg and ageostrophic currents wag 3 w w g w a g τ v g τ v ag wg and wag can be further divided into mean and eddy parts as respectively shown in eqs 4 and 5 4 w g τ v g τ v g 5 w a g τ v ag τ v a g where the prime denotes fluctuations relative to the corresponding time average the different components of wind work have been explored by researchers using different methodologies and demonstrated consistencies in some and disagreements in others wunsch 1998 wang and huang 2004 huang et al 2006 von storch et al 2007 hughes and wilson 2008 1 1 previous estimates of wind work on surface geostrophic currents many efforts have been conducted to estimate the global wg prior to the satellite era only rough estimates were possible using ship drift observations to approximate v g and wind climatologies to estimate τ fofonoff 1981 oort et al 1994 wunsch 1998 provided the first detailed estimate of global wg in the satellite era using geostrophic currents calculated from satellite altimetry and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep wind stress he calculated a 4 year 1992 1996 average total global integral wg as 0 88 tw table 1 about one half the estimate given by fofonoff 1981 and oorr et al 1994 from this total 0 84 tw comes from the mean part τ v g and 0 04 tw from the eddy part τ v g in his calculation both geostrophic currents and wind stresses were averaged over a 10 day period that was determined by the topex poseidon data and the wind work on the geostrophic currents by higher frequency wind fluctuations was assumed to be small subsequently using the topex poseidon data but with two different wind stress products from ncep national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis i and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era 40 reanalysis huang et al 2006 estimated the 10 year average 1993 2003 wg as 0 84 tw table 1 consistent with wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 estimated 0 76 tw table 1 total global wg using 7 day averaged quickscat scatterometer data and geostrophic surface currents calculated from a combination of satellite altimetry and surface drifter data quickscat directly measures wind stress and thus implicitly includes the effect of ocean surface currents in the wind stress measurements this is different from the ncep wind stress used in wunsch 1998 which does not take into account the ocean surface currents duhaut and straub 2006 found that wind work on the geostrophic currents was reduced by 20 when ocean surface currents dependency is considered in the wind stress formulation to be consistent with wunsch 1998 an additional 0 19 tw of wind work was added to their original wind work estimate to account for the reduction due to the effect of ocean currents hughes and wilson 2008 therefore their total of 0 95 tw is slightly larger than the estimate by wunsch 1998 and huang et al 2006 to understand the effect of wind averaging frequency on wg zhai et al 2012 estimated wg using 7 day averaged surface geostrophic currents and wind stress derived from 6 hourly daily and monthly ncep winds they found that wind work on geostrophic currents was increased by more than 70 when 6 hourly winds are used to calculate wind stress instead of monthly mean winds numerical model output has been used to estimate the global wg such estimates include wunsch 1998 huang et al 2006 and von storch et al 2007 all three studies give similar results range from 0 84 to 1 06 tw scott and xu 2009 recognized that all these numerical studies used ncep wind stress and thus studied the uncertainties associated with wind stress products finding it to be the dominant source of error their results suggested that ignoring the surface currents in the wind stress formulation can lead to an overestimate of wg by 10 to 30 a similar finding as duhaut and straub 2006 zhai et al 2012 found even larger overestimation of wg by 50 when surface currents in the wind stress formulation are omitted 1 2 previous estimates of wind work on surface ageostrophic currents the ageostrophic current consists of the ekman currents produced by slowly varying and steady wind components and near inertial currents produced by high frequency winds the wind work on the near inertial motions has been described using a damped slab mixed layer model d asaro 1985 alford 2001 watanabe and hibiya 2002 alford 2003 it was estimated to be 0 5 tw by alford 2003 wang and huang 2004 developed a simple one dimensional 1d model using the classical ekman spiral they estimated the average global wind work input into the surface ekman currents to be 2 3 tw over a 54 year period 1948 2002 using the daily averaged wind stress data from the ncep ncar reanalysis when adding the numbers from these two studies together we get the total wind work on surface ageostrophic currents wag to be 2 8 tw table 2 since ocean general circulation models ogcm can simulate both ekman and near inertial currents they are widely used to estimate wind work on surface ageostrophic currents wag however the results vary significantly among different studies due to their choice of model resolution wind forcing and averaging time scales using the daily mean surface currents from numerical simulations forced with daily mean wind stresses huang et al 2006 estimated that the wind work on the ageostrophic surface currents was only 0 3 tw table 2 much smaller than the 2 8 tw estimated above the spatially averaged thickness of the first layer in their numerical model is about 30 m and the horizontal resolution is 1 1 von storch et al 2007 on the other hand reported a 2 7 tw table 2 of wind work on the ageostrophic surface currents using data from the ogcm for the earth simulator ofes at much finer vertical 5 m in first layer and horizontal 0 1 resolution however the ofes output was stored as snapshots on every third day and a daily averaged wind stress was applied to the numerical model 1 3 uncertainties of the wind work estimation on surface ageostrophic currents as discussed in section 1 2 there is an order of magnitude difference in previous estimate of the wind work on ageostrophic currents table 2 from 0 3 tw huang et al 2006 to 2 7 tw von storch et al 2007 and 2 8 tw that is the sum of the estimates of alford 2003 and wang and huang 2004 one reason is that neither huang et al 2006 nor von storch et al 2007 have sufficient wind stress frequency to resolve the near inertial currents at latitudes higher than 10 but since the wind work on the near inertial currents was estimated to be 0 5 tw alford 2003 most of the discrepancy comes from the wind work on the ekman currents from the theoretical point of view wang and huang 2004 suggested that they may underestimate the wind work on the ekman currents because the classical ekman spiral predicts an angle of 45 to the right left of wind stress in the northern southern hemisphere while field measurements find that the angle between the wind stress and surface drifter velocity is between 5 and 20 cushman roisin 1994 assuming the same ekman depth in their 1d model and replacing the 45 surface angle used by wang and huang 2004 with 5 20 angles the wind work would increase by 33 41 from 2 3 tw to 3 1 3 2 tw additionally their estimate is also very sensitive to the calculation of the ekman depth de the authors chose an empirical formula their eq 15 as shown below to calculate de 6 d e γ u f where u is the frictional velocity f is the coriolis parameter and γ is an empirical constant set to be 0 5 determined through a best fit of six sets of observations wang and huang 2004 their fig 2 their estimate of γ is higher than commonly used values γ 0 25 0 4 if we take the 5 20 angle and vary the γ value the wind work estimate will change to 3 8 4 1 tw if γ 0 4 is used and it is doubled if γ 0 25 is used for the numerical studies the surface current is not the current on sea surface z 0 but rather the vertical average of the currents in the first layer of the ogcm the choice of first layer thickness in the model greatly affects the magnitude of the ekman currents used in the wind work estimations assuming the diffusivity is vertically constant and taking the direction of τ as the x axis the classical solution of ekman spiral is 7 u e 2 τ ρ o f d e e z d e cos z d e π 4 where ue is the ekman velocity along the x direction ρ o is the density of the ocean and z is the vertical coordinate since the cross wind ekman current component does not contribute to the wind work we only need to integrate the along wind component ue in the first model layer 8 δ z 0 u e d z 2 τ ρ o f e δ z d e sin δ z d e where δz is the thickness of the first layer thus the ratio of the depth average ue in the first model layer uelayer to the ue at the ocean surface is 9 u e l a y e r u e z 0 d e δ z e δ z d e sin δ z d e previous studies have suggested that the surface ekman layer extends only about 10 20 m deep price et al 1987 estimated de 12 m defined by the depth of the e folding scale of the amplitude of the surface ageostrophic currents in the western sargasso sea chereskin 1995 suggested a similar value of de 18 m in the california current and a 22 m ekman depth in drake passage was reported by lenn and chereskin 2009 numerical models with the first layer thickness of 5 von storch et al 2007 10 von storch et al 2012 and 30 m huang et al 2006 underestimate the surface ekman current along the wind stress direction and thus the wind work on the surface ekman currents by 42 23 69 42 and 100 85 respectively when the ekman depth is 10 m 20 m furthermore wang and huang 2004 their eq 14 as shown below suggested that wind work on surface ekman currents generated by the variational wind stress is 10 w e 1 ρ o d e 1 f f ω n 1 2 t n 2 where ω n and tn are the frequency and magnitude of the nth component of the wind stress respectively thus all the three previous estimates of wind work on ekman currents wang and huang 2004 huang et al 2006 von storch et al 2007 lack the contribution from components with frequencies higher than the daily resolution of wind stress since they all utilized daily averaged wind stress forcing 1 4 goals of this study in this study we calculate the wind work w input to the global surface currents using model output from a 17 year global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 the model surface layer has a thickness of 1 m and thus the ocean surface ekman currents are better represented 2 the reanalysis is forced by hourly surface stress and thus is able to fully resolve near inertial currents in high latitudes and capture the wind work on surface ekman currents from the high frequency wind stress variations and 3 the reanalysis provides more realistic sea surface height ssh fields and thus more accurate surface currents than non data assimilative simulations note that in the real ocean surface gravity waves play an important role in redistributing momentum and energy in the water column through wave breaking and langmuir turbulence large eddy simulation studies have shown that both wave breaking and langmuir turbulence reduce the mean vertical velocity shear near the surface with the influence of surface gravity waves on the ekman layer mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 however ogcms including hycom used in this study usually apply a mean surface wind stress that varies smoothly in space and time on scales much greater than those of the surface gravity waves high frequency and small scale motions generated by breaking waves and langmuir turbulence are naturally filtered out by the grid resolution of the ogcms even though the 1 m thick surface layer in hycom can provide a better representation of the surface currents than the 5 30 m surface layer thicknesses in the other models mentioned in section 1 3 the surface gravity waves are not part of the model physics in any of these systems the reanalysis output contains hourly instantaneous surface currents surface stress and ssh fields this provides an opportunity to estimate both wind work on the surface geostrophic and ageostrophic currents we are especially interested in the total wind work on ageostrophic currents τ v ag since the uncertainty of the previous estimates is large although the wind stress formulation used in this hycom reanalysis takes into account the ocean surface currents pacanowski 1987 luo et al 2005 duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 xu and scott 2008 yu et al 2017 the global wind work difference due to the wind stress formulation with or without ocean surface currents is not the focus of this research and beyond the scope of this study this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the numerical model and data assimilation for the reanalysis the wind work on surface geostrophic currents is validated against previous studies in section 3 the reanalysis results of wind work on ageostrophic currents are presented in section 4 which is followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 numerical model and simulation a 17 year global hycom reanalysis from 1999 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is widely used in the ocean community http www hycom org and is the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 it has been applied to large scale marginal seas and coastal studies hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model and solves five prognostic equations two horizontal velocity components mass conservation temperature and salinity conservation a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 hycom is briefly presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model outputs grids the hycom horizontal resolution in this study is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 6 5 km at mid latitude making it globally eddy resolving the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole there are 41 hybrid z sigma and isopycnal coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the first vertical layer has a uniform layer thickness of 1 m for the output hourly instantaneous surface stress surface current velocities and ssh fields are interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution between 40 s 40 n and to 0 04 resolution poleward of these latitudes the ocean surface geostrophic currents are calculated from ssh fields assuming geostrophic balance the ageostrophic currents are the difference between the surface currents and the geostrophic currents 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a three dimensional 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 available remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom ncoda also generates synthetic temperature and salinity profiles for assimilation that are formed from the two dimensional ssh and sst using a 3d synthetic profile method the improved synthetic ocean profile helber et al 2013 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the 17 year reanalysis is separated into one 3 year stream starting in 1999 six 2 5 year streams starting in 2001 and one 3 year stream from 2013 to 2015 for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year ocean reanalysis thoppil et al 2015 yu et al 2015 on december 1 of the previous year except the very first stream started in june 1998 atmospheric forcing for this reanalysis is from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 the wind stress formulation in the model includes the ocean surface currents the ncep cfsr 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the surface stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents the surface stress in the previous 20 year ocean reanalysis used to initialize the model does not include the ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation include ocean surface current is applied to the model the mesoscale eddy field adjusts to the satellite altimeter data within the first month yu et al 2015 but the basin wide kinetic energy takes another 6 months to reach equilibrium thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output i e july 2001 june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here reanalysis data from january 1999 to june 2001 in the first stream and from july 2013 to december 2015 in the last stream are used in the analysis 3 wind work on geostrophic currents in this study the overbar terms in eqs 1 5 are 17 year averages and the prime terms are eddy components relative to the 17 year average of ocean currents and wind stress all figures are presented in the latitude range from 80 s to 80 n while global integrals are given in the region between 63 s and 63 n to be consistent with previous studies a detailed description of the wind work terms in eq 4 is given in this section 3 1 the mean part of the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g the 17 year average mean wind stress τ and geostrophic currents v g are used to calculate the mean part of the wind work on the surface geostrophic currents to be consistent with wunsch 1998 the equatorial region within 3 of the equator is omitted from these calculations the two components τ x u g and τ y v g of τ v g are shown in fig 1 a and c respectively the global 63 s 63 n to be consistent with wunsch 1998 integral table 3 shows the dominance of τ x u g 0 78 tw relative to τ y v g 0 03 tw which are 0 02 and 0 01 tw smaller than the wunsch 1998 estimate respectively this is due to the inclusion of surface current in the wind stress formulation in our model that reduces the wind work duhaut and straub 2006 please note that the two decimal points do not imply an absolute accuracy of 0 01 tw but are given to allow a comparison with the numbers of the same order by wunsch 1998 the spatial patterns are very similar to that found in previous studies wunsch 1998 von storch et al 2007 hughes and wilson 2008 scotts and xu 2009 zhai et al 2012 the most significant positive input of τ x u g comes from the antarctic circumpolar current acc in the southern ocean the gulf stream the kuroshio wunsch 1998 and the caribbean current hughes and wilson 2008 seventy one percent of the global integral of τ x u g occurs to the south of 40 s due to the persistent strong winds above the acc that is the world s strongest current system fig 1b the most significant negative values of τ x u g are found over the north equatorial countercurrent fig 1a and b which is the same as hughes and wilson 2008 their fig 1 twenty one percent of the global integral of τ x u g comes from tropical subtropical regions within 20 of the equator notice that although the gulf stream and kuroshio have their strong signatures in the global pattern fig 1a their contributions to τ x u g are small when integrated zonally fig 1b this is because the ocean surface areas occupied by both current systems are small and thus their contributions are smeared out by the zonal integration τ y v g fig 1c is much smaller than τ x u g and 91 of the wind work occurs within 20 of the equator fig 1d the total mean component of the wind work on geostrophic currents τ v g fig 1e thus follows closely the spatial distribution of τ x u g fig 1a its global integral is 0 81 tw with 69 of the wind work occurring to the south of 40 s and another 23 occurring within 20 of the equator fig 1f 3 2 the eddy part of the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g to calculate v g we first calculate 10 day average ssh from the hourly ssh outputs and then the 10 day average geostrophic current v g is calculated assuming geostrophic equilibrium following wunsch 1998 v g is the difference between the 10 day average geostrophic current and the 17 year average geostrophic current the surface stress is also averaged every 10 day period to calculate τ unlike the mean part both components τ x u g and τ y v g of τ v g show similar magnitude and their spatial patterns fig 2 a and c are very similar to wunsch 1998 the most dominant positive contribution comes from the tropics and the most dominant negative values occur in the southern ocean fig 2a d like wunsch 1998 the reanalysis results also show significant positive and negative contributions in the western monsoon region of the indian ocean the global integral of τ x u g and τ y v g in our calculation is 0 042 and 0 057 tw table 4 respectively in comparison to 0 029 and 0 01 tw in wunsch 1998 these differences mainly come from the high mesoscale eddy activity regions south of 40 s the agulhas current the kuroshio extension and the gulf stream duhaut and straub 2006 pointed out that the reduction of geostrophic wind work due to the surface currents in the wind stress formulation is the strongest in regions of high mesoscale eddy activity hughes and wilson 2008 further show that more than 75 of this effect is represented by τ v g thus the negative values of τ v g fig 2a and c found in the southern ocean the agulhas current the kuroshio extension and the gulf stream can be attributed to the effect of including ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation which is not included in wunsch 1998 the spatial distribution of τ v g and its zonal integral are shown in fig 2e and f they look very similar to fig 5a in hughes and wilson 2008 which also contains the effect of ocean currents in their wind stress formulation there are strong positive and negative contributions in the tropics with positive contributions dominating and strong negative contributions in the regions with strong mesoscale eddy activity however a closer inspection reveals that our results have a systematic low bias in comparison with hughes and wilson 2008 the integral between 20 s and 20 n in our model is 0 027 tw that is smaller than the hughes and wilson 2008 0 039 tw estimate in our zonal integration fig 2f the magnitude of negative contributions from the southern hemisphere around 40 s is larger than the maximum positive contribution around 10 n fig 2f which is opposite to the findings by hughes and wilson 2008 their fig 5a our total integral south of 20 s is 0 103 tw quadruple the integral of 0 026 tw for the same region in hughes and wilson 2008 their table 3 the global integral of τ v g of the reanalysis is 0 099 tw compared with 0 009 tw in hughes and wilson 2008 and 0 039 tw in wunsch 1998 there are two possibilities that can contribute to these differences the first is that the reduction of geostrophic wind work due to the surface currents via the wind stress is probably diluted in hughes and wilson 2008 in order to be able to fully resolve the effect of ocean currents on wind work via wind stress formulation the wind stress and current measurements need to be matched well enough in time and space for the mesoscale features in both currents and wind stresses field to be aligned it is possible that this requirement was not met for observations hughes and wilson 2008 the second possibility comes from the spatial resolution of the available data as mentioned in section 2 1 the horizontal resolution of the hycom reanalysis is eddy resolving at 0 08 the data used by wunsch 1998 were gridded at 2 resolution which is not able to resolve mesoscale eddies the data used by hughes and wilson 2008 were gridded on a 1 3 mercator grid which is eddy permitting but not able to fully resolve the mesoscale eddies properly thus the spatial resolution of available data may limit hughes and wilson 2008 from fully capturing the contribution of mesoscale eddies on τ v g and the decreasing trend of τ v g 0 039 0 009 0 099 tw with the increase of the spatial resolution among the three studies supports this assumption 3 3 the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g both the spatial pattern fig 3 a and its zonal integral fig 3b of the 17 year average total wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g agree well with hughes and wilson 2008 the most dominant contribution comes from the southern ocean which accounts for 70 of the total wind work on the geostrophic currents the global integral is 0 71 tw 19 less than the estimate of 0 88 tw in wunsch 1998 and 7 less than the 0 76 tw estimate in hughes and wilson 2008 among the 0 17 tw reduction compared to the wunsch 1998 0 14 tw 82 comes from τ v g this clearly supports the idea that most of the reduction of τ v g by including the ocean currents in the wind stress formulation comes from the eddy part τ v g of the wind work duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 4 wind work on ageostrophic currents the hourly ageostrophic currents are calculated as the difference between the hourly surface currents and the corresponding 10 day average surface geostrophic currents the sensitivity of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents to the choice of different geostrophic average periods is discussed in section 5 1 the 17 year average ageostrophic currents are calculated as the difference between the 17 year average surface currents and surface geostrophic currents 4 1 the mean part of the 17 year average wind work on the ageostrophic currents τ v ag the 17 year average mean wind stress τ and ocean surface ageostrophic currents v ag are used to calculate the mean part of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents since the 17 year average ageostrophic currents are surface ekman currents classical theory tells us that the mean part of the wind work on the surface ekman currents wang and huang 2004 is 11 τ v ag τ 2 ρ o f d e we should expect a high correlation between τ v ag and the magnitude of the mean wind stress indeed the spatial distribution of τ v ag fig 4 a in our model is very similar to the mean wind stress magnitude fig 5 a with a high correlation coefficient of 0 95 the global integral of τ v ag is 1 28 tw table 3 its main contribution comes from two regions with the largest contribution 47 from the southern ocean south of 40 s fig 4a and b due to the strong currents driven by strong wind stress and the second largest contribution 35 from the tropical subtropical region within 20 of the equator 4 2 comparing τ v ag with wang and huang 2004 the 1 28 tw global integral of τ v ag is in decent agreement with the von storch et al 2007 1 06 tw estimate but more than double the wang and huang 2004 0 54 tw estimate however the 75 contribution from the southern hemisphere in our calculation is almost the same as the 74 estimate in wang and huang 2004 to understand the magnitude difference between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 τ v ag is also estimated theoretically in the same way as wang and huang 2004 their eqs 15 and 13 by applying the 17 year average surface stress to eqs 6 and 11 the spatial distribution of the theoretical estimate fig 5b is very similar to what s calculated from the reanalysis data fig 4a with a high spatial correlation of 0 97 the meridional variation of the zonal integral fig 5c is also in good agreement with the reanalysis fig 4b but the wind work magnitude of the theoretical estimate is much smaller with a 0 46 tw global integral which is in much better agreement with the wang and huang 2004 0 54 tw estimate kelly et al 2001 find that including surface currents in the wind stress formulation reduces the wind stress magnitude thus the 0 08 tw difference between our theoretical estimate and wang and huang 2004 can mainly be attributed to the smaller surface stress in the reanalysis induced by the inclusion of surface currents in the wind stress formulation since the choice of wind stress data only makes a very small difference in the estimate of τ v ag using the same method the large difference 1 28 vs 0 54 tw between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 resides in their usage of eqs 6 and 11 to estimate the wind work vs the internal physics in hycom eq 11 is derived from the classical ekman spiral that predicts a constant 45 angle wang and huang 2004 between the surface ekman current and wind stress as can be seen from fig 5d this angle varies significantly with location in the southern ocean where most of the wind work occurs the average angle fig 5e is 34 according to our discussion in section 1 3 the wind work calculated from the reanalysis can be 17 larger cos 34 cos 45 than that calculated using the classical theory in this region assuming the same ekman depth for a given mean wind stress dataset the wind work is inversely proportional to the ekman depth eq 6 according to eq 11 the wang and huang 2004 estimation will be doubled to 1 08 tw if γ 0 25 is used in eq 6 and their estimate can be further increased to 1 26 tw when we consider the angle difference in the southern ocean which is in close agreement with our 1 28 tw estimate 4 3 the eddy part of the 17 year average wind work on surface ageostrophic currents τ v ag τ v g is much smaller than τ v g but τ v a g fig 4c is much larger than τ v ag fig 4a the global 63 s 63 n integral of τ v a g is 4 15 tw table 4 and is more than double the 1 83 tw estimated by wang and huang 2004 despite the large magnitude difference both estimates of τ v a g show 60 of the corresponding contribution from the southern hemisphere τ v a g fig 4c and d is very strong over two regions the southern ocean and the subpolar basins in the north pacific and north atlantic oceans the southern ocean to the south of 40 s contributes 43 to the global integral while the northern storm track regions to the north of 30 n contributes another 26 the eddy ageostrophic wind work is strong over the storm track regions due to the strong synoptic wind variability and is in general small in the tropical subtropical region fig 4c but the tropical indian ocean and south china sea show moderate values of τ v a g probably due to monsoon activities in the regions 4 4 comparing τ v ag with wang and huang 2004 the spatial pattern fig 4e and its zonal integral fig 4f of τ v a g τ v ag τ v a g are very similar to these reported by wang and huang 2004 their fig 3 but with much larger magnitude the three regions that make significant contributions to τ v a g in the reanalysis are consistent with wang and huang 2004 namely 1 the acc 2 the storm track regions in the north atlantic and north pacific oceans and 3 the south china sea and south indian ocean arabian sea furthermore despite the magnitude difference the ratio of the southern hemisphere contribution 67 to the global integral of τ v a g 5 44 tw in the reanalysis is similar to the 63 estimate in wang and huang 2004 the difference of the global integral of these two estimates is 3 14 tw part of the 3 14 tw wind work difference comes from the wind work on the near inertial currents the nyquist frequency of the hourly surface stress forcing 0 5 cycles per hour for the reanalysis is much higher than the inertial frequency in the global ocean thus the reanalysis is capable of fully resolving the near inertial currents while the wang and huang 2004 2 3 tw estimate is wind work purely on surface ekman currents it would be the best if the wind work on the near inertial currents can be calculated using the reanalysis output by temporally filtering the near inertial surface stresses and currents but this is not practical due to the memory limitations for the 17 year hourly time series of the global eddy resolving grid resolution 4500 3298 so the 0 5 tw estimate from alford 2003 is taken as a reference of the contribution of the global wind work on the near inertial currents to the 3 14 tw wind work difference the 0 6 tw estimate from watanabe and hibiya 2002 is 20 larger than the estimate of alford 2003 but it doesn t change our conclusions the 3 14 tw wind work difference can also be partially explained by the frequency difference of wind stress used in the two estimates with hourly wind stress in the reanalysis being much higher than the daily wind stress used in wang and huang 2004 to quantify this effect we calculate the wind work on the ageostrophic currents with the daily averaged outputs to be consistent with wang and huang 2004 its spatial pattern and zonal integral fig 6 a and b are very similar to the hourly results fig 4e and f and the global integral is 4 18 tw 1 26 tw less than the hourly reanalysis results the differences between these two estimates are shown in fig 6c and d there are two regions that mainly contribute to this difference the acc and the storm track regions in the north atlantic and north pacific oceans fig 6c since much of the time dependence of the wind stress in the tropics is seasonal whereas the time dependence of the wind stress at the mid latitudes is more dominated by synoptic time scales von storch et al 2007 zhai et al 2012 the 1 26 tw global integral difference contains two parts 1 the high frequency daily to hourly wind work contribution to the ekman currents according to eq 10 and 2 the difference from the wind work on the near inertial currents the daily averaged reanalysis output is sufficient to resolve near inertial currents within 10 of the equator so the contribution of near inertial current in this region cannot be reflected by this difference since alford 2003 fig 1 suggests that 0 10 tw of the wind work on near inertial currents comes within 10 of the equator and 0 40 tw in the remaining global ocean we calculate that the wind work difference due to the high frequency wind stress daily to hourly variation on ekman currents is 0 86 tw 1 26 tw 0 4 tw in total the wind stress frequency difference and the wind work on inertial currents together counts for 1 36 tw 0 86 tw 0 5 tw of wind work difference between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 the remaining 1 78 tw difference is likely coming from the over estimate of ekman depth and the constant 45 angle between wind stress and surface ekman current in wang and huang 2004 as discussed in section 4 2 4 5 comparing τ v ag with von storch et al 2007 our total wind work on the surface ageostrophic currents is also much larger than the 2 7 tw estimated by von storch et al 2007 the difference between the reanalysis and von storch et al 2007 is likely due to three major reasons first the 1 m thickness of hycom s first layer allows it to represent 90 95 of the surface ekman current when the ekman depth is 10 20 m whereas the 5 m thick first layer in von storch 2007 only allows their numerical model to represent 58 77 of the surface ekman current second von storch et al 2007 forced their numerical model with daily wind stress according to section 4 4 this leads to an underestimate of 1 26 tw wind work due to the lack of the high frequency wind stress contribution from daily to hourly to the wind work on ekman currents and not being able to resolve the near inertial currents at latitudes poleward of 10 third the reanalysis stores hourly surface output while von storch et al 2007 stores snapshots every three days this likely leads to an underestimate of the wind work in their study for example von storch et al 2012 analyzed data from the german consortium project storm ncep simulation which was forced by 6 hourly ncep ncar reanalysis 1 kalnay et al 1996 wind stress to estimate the wind work using accumulated second moments they were able to obtain a 20 higher value in the eddy part of the wind work than the estimate in von storch et al 2007 even with a thicker first layer of 10 m as mentioned in von storch et al 2012 the higher eddy part of wind work on surface currents in comparison with the estimate in von storch et al 2007 can be a direct consequence of calculating the eddy part of wind work using accumulated second moments rather than snapshots sampled every three days 5 discussions and conclusions in this study we calculate the wind work on the surface currents from a 17 year global hycom reanalysis with hourly surface stress surface currents and ssh outputs the reanalysis is forced with a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents the hourly 10 m wind velocities are obtained from the 0 3125 resolution ncep cfsr datasets at every time step the surface stress is calculated using the cfsr 10 m wind velocities and surface currents from the reanalysis for the mean part of the wind work our estimate of τ v g agrees well with previous research wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 in both the global integral 0 81 tw and the meridional variation of the zonal integral however the global integral of τ v ag is estimated to be 1 28 tw which is more than double the 0 54 tw estimate in wang and huang 2004 the reason for this significant difference is most likely due to the fact that there are large uncertainties in the estimate of the ekman depth in wang and huang 2004 in addition wang and huang 2004 used a constant angle of 45 between wind stress and surface ekman currents in their estimate while this angle can have large spatial variations in the real ocean as for the eddy part of the wind work the global integral of eddy wind work on the surface ageostrophic currents τ v a g is 4 15 tw much larger than the wang and huang 2004 1 83 tw estimate however the fact that the global integral of τ v g is much smaller than τ v g and the global integral of τ v a g is larger than that of τ v ag agrees well with the previous studies by wunsch 1998 wang and huang 2004 and hughes and wilson 2008 the spatial pattern of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents τ v a g is very similar to that reported by wang and huang 2004 their fig 3 but the 5 44 tw global integral is much larger the 3 14 tw difference can be attributed to three parts 1 the wind work on the near inertial currents contributes 0 5 tw 2 the higher frequency wind stress daily to hourly contributes 0 86 tw wind work on surface ekman currents and 3 the remaining 1 78 tw difference most likely comes from the underestimation by wang and huang 2004 from overestimating the ekman depth and using a constant 45 angle between the wind stress and surface ekman currents rather than spatially varying angle as indicated by observations 5 1 sensitivity study of the different geostrophic average period to the wind work on ageostrophic currents in this study geostrophic currents are calculated from 10 day average reanalysis ssh fields and the ageostrophic currents are defined as the departure from the 10 day average geostrophic currents the 10 day average period is an arbitrary choice chosen to be consistent with wunsch 1998 geostrophic flow also exists in periods less than 10 days and can contaminate the calculation of ageostrophic currents and thus the wind work on the ageostrophic currents the difference is the eddy part of the high frequency wind work on the geostrophic currents to address how sensitive is wind work on the ageostrophic currents to the choice of the geostrophic average period we calculate the eddy part of wind work on geostrophic currents τ v o g using hourly and daily average reanalysis surface stress and ssh output to calculate geostrophic currents assuming geostrophic equilibrium τ v o g calculated from hourly and daily average output shares very similar spatial patterns not shown with that from 10 day average output fig 2 the global integral changes only by 0 008 and 0 015 tw table 5 when daily average and hourly reanalysis output are used to calculate wind work on geostrophic currents instead of the 10 day average those differences are negligible to the wind work on ageostrophic currents 5 44 tw thus wind work on the ageostrophic currents is not sensitive to the choice of the geostrophic average period 5 2 total wind work on the global ocean currents the total wind work on the global ocean currents is estimated as 6 15 tw figure 3c and d when calculated using hourly reanalysis output the most important area is the acc in the southern ocean fig 3d which contributes 46 to the total wind work another 20 comes from the tropical subtropical region within 20 of the equator and 12 comes from northern hemisphere storm track regions in the area 40 60 n previously the total wind work on the global ocean currents was estimated to be 3 7 tw as the sum of the 0 88 tw input to the geostrophic currents wunsch 1998 2 3 tw input to the ageostrophic currents without near inertial motion wang and huang 2004 and 0 5 tw input to the near inertial currents alford 2003 our estimate which contains all the spectrum mentioned above is much larger the equatorial region within 3 of the equator is omitted from our estimate and provides an additional 0 2 tw to the global integral of the total wind work to the global ocean circulation the global integral in this study is integrated from 63 s 63 n contributions beyond this region to the wind work on geostrophic currents and the mean part of wind work on the ageostrophic currents are negligible but for the eddy part of wind work on the ageostrophic currents there is an additional 0 4 tw poleward of 63 5 3 impact of the thickness of the surface layer in section 1 3 the classical ekman spiral theory discussion indicates that wind work on ekman currents is reduced when calculated with vertical mean currents in this section we calculate wind work on the ageostrophic currents using the vertical mean ageostrophic currents in the top 5 m and 30 m to show how much of the wind work is reduced compared with the reanalysis results for june 2004 in these calculations we assume the vertical shear of the geostrophic currents is negligible in the top 30 m of the water column to calculate the ageostrophic currents below the surface layer the wind work on the ageostrophic currents calculated from the vertical mean ageostrophic currents in the top 5 m 30 m is only 78 15 of that calculated using the currents in the top 1 m in another words the total wind work on the ageostrophic currents can be reduced by 22 85 when a 5 m 30 m first layer thickness instead of 1 m is used in the reanalysis applying these ratios to the wind work on ageostrophic currents calculated with daily average output 4 18 tw section 4 4 gives us 3 3 tw 0 6 tw of wind work on ageostrophic currents if the hycom surface layer thickness is 5 m 30 m these estimates are in closer agreement with 2 7 tw in von storch et al 2007 who uses a first layer of 5 m thickness and the 0 3 tw in huang et al 2006 who uses a first layer of 30 m thickness 5 4 impact on the kinetic energy budget and dissipation in the ekman layer the estimate from this study is very useful for the global kinetic energy budget analysis since wind work on the surface currents is the most important mechanical energy source in maintaining the oceanic general circulation wind work on ageostrophic currents through the subinertial range is fully dissipated in the ekman layer on supporting turbulence and mixing only in the steady state wang and huang 2004 the increase of wind work on the ageostrophic currents through the increase of the wind stress frequency clearly demonstrates that the high frequency variability can be important for inputting energy into the global ocean circulation since the majority of this additional energy must be dissipated inside the ekman layer this provides additional information of the mixing process inside the ekman layer how much of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents passes through the ekman layer is unknown and is a topic for the future research as suggested by von storch et al 2007 about 5 0 14 tw of the wind work on ageostrophic currents escapes the surface layer of 110 m thickness the 110 m depth is much deeper than the ekman depth in general but even if we apply the same ratio to the reanalysis 0 3 tw of wind work on the ageostrophic currents would be transported into the sub surface layer and play a major role in the oceanic circulation

24086,a 17 year 1999 2015 hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis is used to calculate the wind work to the global oceanic circulation with a focus on the global integral of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents while the wind work on the geostrophic currents estimate of the study is in good agreement with previous research our estimation of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents 5 44 tw is significantly larger than previous estimates the two main reasons for this difference are 1 the thickness of hycom s first vertical layer is 1 m and thus the surface ageostrophic currents are better represented than those in numerical models that use a thicker top layer and 2 the reanalysis is forced with hourly surface stresses and thus contains wind work contributions from high frequency wind stress variations compared against previous estimates using daily wind stress 1 introduction the wind is one of several possible mechanical energy sources to drive ocean interior mixing munk and wunsch 1998 and the wind energy input to the global oceans is the most important mechanical energy source in maintaining the oceanic general circulation huang et al 2006 the average wind mechanical energy input rate is defined as the total wind work 1 w τ v where w is the rate at which the wind stress τ works on the ocean surface current v and an overbar denotes time averaging the ocean surface current in eq 1 can be split into geostrophic v g and ageostrophic v ag components 2 v v g v ag thus the wind work input into the global ocean circulation contains both wind work on surface geostrophic currents wg and ageostrophic currents wag 3 w w g w a g τ v g τ v ag wg and wag can be further divided into mean and eddy parts as respectively shown in eqs 4 and 5 4 w g τ v g τ v g 5 w a g τ v ag τ v a g where the prime denotes fluctuations relative to the corresponding time average the different components of wind work have been explored by researchers using different methodologies and demonstrated consistencies in some and disagreements in others wunsch 1998 wang and huang 2004 huang et al 2006 von storch et al 2007 hughes and wilson 2008 1 1 previous estimates of wind work on surface geostrophic currents many efforts have been conducted to estimate the global wg prior to the satellite era only rough estimates were possible using ship drift observations to approximate v g and wind climatologies to estimate τ fofonoff 1981 oort et al 1994 wunsch 1998 provided the first detailed estimate of global wg in the satellite era using geostrophic currents calculated from satellite altimetry and the national centers for environmental prediction ncep wind stress he calculated a 4 year 1992 1996 average total global integral wg as 0 88 tw table 1 about one half the estimate given by fofonoff 1981 and oorr et al 1994 from this total 0 84 tw comes from the mean part τ v g and 0 04 tw from the eddy part τ v g in his calculation both geostrophic currents and wind stresses were averaged over a 10 day period that was determined by the topex poseidon data and the wind work on the geostrophic currents by higher frequency wind fluctuations was assumed to be small subsequently using the topex poseidon data but with two different wind stress products from ncep national center for atmospheric research ncar reanalysis i and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts era 40 reanalysis huang et al 2006 estimated the 10 year average 1993 2003 wg as 0 84 tw table 1 consistent with wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 estimated 0 76 tw table 1 total global wg using 7 day averaged quickscat scatterometer data and geostrophic surface currents calculated from a combination of satellite altimetry and surface drifter data quickscat directly measures wind stress and thus implicitly includes the effect of ocean surface currents in the wind stress measurements this is different from the ncep wind stress used in wunsch 1998 which does not take into account the ocean surface currents duhaut and straub 2006 found that wind work on the geostrophic currents was reduced by 20 when ocean surface currents dependency is considered in the wind stress formulation to be consistent with wunsch 1998 an additional 0 19 tw of wind work was added to their original wind work estimate to account for the reduction due to the effect of ocean currents hughes and wilson 2008 therefore their total of 0 95 tw is slightly larger than the estimate by wunsch 1998 and huang et al 2006 to understand the effect of wind averaging frequency on wg zhai et al 2012 estimated wg using 7 day averaged surface geostrophic currents and wind stress derived from 6 hourly daily and monthly ncep winds they found that wind work on geostrophic currents was increased by more than 70 when 6 hourly winds are used to calculate wind stress instead of monthly mean winds numerical model output has been used to estimate the global wg such estimates include wunsch 1998 huang et al 2006 and von storch et al 2007 all three studies give similar results range from 0 84 to 1 06 tw scott and xu 2009 recognized that all these numerical studies used ncep wind stress and thus studied the uncertainties associated with wind stress products finding it to be the dominant source of error their results suggested that ignoring the surface currents in the wind stress formulation can lead to an overestimate of wg by 10 to 30 a similar finding as duhaut and straub 2006 zhai et al 2012 found even larger overestimation of wg by 50 when surface currents in the wind stress formulation are omitted 1 2 previous estimates of wind work on surface ageostrophic currents the ageostrophic current consists of the ekman currents produced by slowly varying and steady wind components and near inertial currents produced by high frequency winds the wind work on the near inertial motions has been described using a damped slab mixed layer model d asaro 1985 alford 2001 watanabe and hibiya 2002 alford 2003 it was estimated to be 0 5 tw by alford 2003 wang and huang 2004 developed a simple one dimensional 1d model using the classical ekman spiral they estimated the average global wind work input into the surface ekman currents to be 2 3 tw over a 54 year period 1948 2002 using the daily averaged wind stress data from the ncep ncar reanalysis when adding the numbers from these two studies together we get the total wind work on surface ageostrophic currents wag to be 2 8 tw table 2 since ocean general circulation models ogcm can simulate both ekman and near inertial currents they are widely used to estimate wind work on surface ageostrophic currents wag however the results vary significantly among different studies due to their choice of model resolution wind forcing and averaging time scales using the daily mean surface currents from numerical simulations forced with daily mean wind stresses huang et al 2006 estimated that the wind work on the ageostrophic surface currents was only 0 3 tw table 2 much smaller than the 2 8 tw estimated above the spatially averaged thickness of the first layer in their numerical model is about 30 m and the horizontal resolution is 1 1 von storch et al 2007 on the other hand reported a 2 7 tw table 2 of wind work on the ageostrophic surface currents using data from the ogcm for the earth simulator ofes at much finer vertical 5 m in first layer and horizontal 0 1 resolution however the ofes output was stored as snapshots on every third day and a daily averaged wind stress was applied to the numerical model 1 3 uncertainties of the wind work estimation on surface ageostrophic currents as discussed in section 1 2 there is an order of magnitude difference in previous estimate of the wind work on ageostrophic currents table 2 from 0 3 tw huang et al 2006 to 2 7 tw von storch et al 2007 and 2 8 tw that is the sum of the estimates of alford 2003 and wang and huang 2004 one reason is that neither huang et al 2006 nor von storch et al 2007 have sufficient wind stress frequency to resolve the near inertial currents at latitudes higher than 10 but since the wind work on the near inertial currents was estimated to be 0 5 tw alford 2003 most of the discrepancy comes from the wind work on the ekman currents from the theoretical point of view wang and huang 2004 suggested that they may underestimate the wind work on the ekman currents because the classical ekman spiral predicts an angle of 45 to the right left of wind stress in the northern southern hemisphere while field measurements find that the angle between the wind stress and surface drifter velocity is between 5 and 20 cushman roisin 1994 assuming the same ekman depth in their 1d model and replacing the 45 surface angle used by wang and huang 2004 with 5 20 angles the wind work would increase by 33 41 from 2 3 tw to 3 1 3 2 tw additionally their estimate is also very sensitive to the calculation of the ekman depth de the authors chose an empirical formula their eq 15 as shown below to calculate de 6 d e γ u f where u is the frictional velocity f is the coriolis parameter and γ is an empirical constant set to be 0 5 determined through a best fit of six sets of observations wang and huang 2004 their fig 2 their estimate of γ is higher than commonly used values γ 0 25 0 4 if we take the 5 20 angle and vary the γ value the wind work estimate will change to 3 8 4 1 tw if γ 0 4 is used and it is doubled if γ 0 25 is used for the numerical studies the surface current is not the current on sea surface z 0 but rather the vertical average of the currents in the first layer of the ogcm the choice of first layer thickness in the model greatly affects the magnitude of the ekman currents used in the wind work estimations assuming the diffusivity is vertically constant and taking the direction of τ as the x axis the classical solution of ekman spiral is 7 u e 2 τ ρ o f d e e z d e cos z d e π 4 where ue is the ekman velocity along the x direction ρ o is the density of the ocean and z is the vertical coordinate since the cross wind ekman current component does not contribute to the wind work we only need to integrate the along wind component ue in the first model layer 8 δ z 0 u e d z 2 τ ρ o f e δ z d e sin δ z d e where δz is the thickness of the first layer thus the ratio of the depth average ue in the first model layer uelayer to the ue at the ocean surface is 9 u e l a y e r u e z 0 d e δ z e δ z d e sin δ z d e previous studies have suggested that the surface ekman layer extends only about 10 20 m deep price et al 1987 estimated de 12 m defined by the depth of the e folding scale of the amplitude of the surface ageostrophic currents in the western sargasso sea chereskin 1995 suggested a similar value of de 18 m in the california current and a 22 m ekman depth in drake passage was reported by lenn and chereskin 2009 numerical models with the first layer thickness of 5 von storch et al 2007 10 von storch et al 2012 and 30 m huang et al 2006 underestimate the surface ekman current along the wind stress direction and thus the wind work on the surface ekman currents by 42 23 69 42 and 100 85 respectively when the ekman depth is 10 m 20 m furthermore wang and huang 2004 their eq 14 as shown below suggested that wind work on surface ekman currents generated by the variational wind stress is 10 w e 1 ρ o d e 1 f f ω n 1 2 t n 2 where ω n and tn are the frequency and magnitude of the nth component of the wind stress respectively thus all the three previous estimates of wind work on ekman currents wang and huang 2004 huang et al 2006 von storch et al 2007 lack the contribution from components with frequencies higher than the daily resolution of wind stress since they all utilized daily averaged wind stress forcing 1 4 goals of this study in this study we calculate the wind work w input to the global surface currents using model output from a 17 year global hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom reanalysis this research differs and improves on previous studies in that 1 the model surface layer has a thickness of 1 m and thus the ocean surface ekman currents are better represented 2 the reanalysis is forced by hourly surface stress and thus is able to fully resolve near inertial currents in high latitudes and capture the wind work on surface ekman currents from the high frequency wind stress variations and 3 the reanalysis provides more realistic sea surface height ssh fields and thus more accurate surface currents than non data assimilative simulations note that in the real ocean surface gravity waves play an important role in redistributing momentum and energy in the water column through wave breaking and langmuir turbulence large eddy simulation studies have shown that both wave breaking and langmuir turbulence reduce the mean vertical velocity shear near the surface with the influence of surface gravity waves on the ekman layer mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 however ogcms including hycom used in this study usually apply a mean surface wind stress that varies smoothly in space and time on scales much greater than those of the surface gravity waves high frequency and small scale motions generated by breaking waves and langmuir turbulence are naturally filtered out by the grid resolution of the ogcms even though the 1 m thick surface layer in hycom can provide a better representation of the surface currents than the 5 30 m surface layer thicknesses in the other models mentioned in section 1 3 the surface gravity waves are not part of the model physics in any of these systems the reanalysis output contains hourly instantaneous surface currents surface stress and ssh fields this provides an opportunity to estimate both wind work on the surface geostrophic and ageostrophic currents we are especially interested in the total wind work on ageostrophic currents τ v ag since the uncertainty of the previous estimates is large although the wind stress formulation used in this hycom reanalysis takes into account the ocean surface currents pacanowski 1987 luo et al 2005 duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 xu and scott 2008 yu et al 2017 the global wind work difference due to the wind stress formulation with or without ocean surface currents is not the focus of this research and beyond the scope of this study this paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the numerical model and data assimilation for the reanalysis the wind work on surface geostrophic currents is validated against previous studies in section 3 the reanalysis results of wind work on ageostrophic currents are presented in section 4 which is followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 numerical model and simulation a 17 year global hycom reanalysis from 1999 to 2015 is used for this study hycom is widely used in the ocean community http www hycom org and is the ocean model component for the present operational us navy global ocean forecast system metzger et al 2014 it has been applied to large scale marginal seas and coastal studies hycom is a primitive equation general ocean circulation model and solves five prognostic equations two horizontal velocity components mass conservation temperature and salinity conservation a detailed description of hycom physics is provided by bleck 2002 hycom is briefly presented below with emphasis on the numerical aspects that are relevant to this study there are no tides or surface waves in this reanalysis 2 1 model outputs grids the hycom horizontal resolution in this study is 0 08 1 12 5 that is 9 km at the equator and 6 5 km at mid latitude making it globally eddy resolving the grid is uniform cylindrical from 78 64 s 66 s mercator between 66 s 47 n and includes a bipolar patch north of 47 n providing 3 5 km grid spacing at the north pole there are 41 hybrid z sigma and isopycnal coordinate layers vertically with potential density referenced to 2000 m the first vertical layer has a uniform layer thickness of 1 m for the output hourly instantaneous surface stress surface current velocities and ssh fields are interpolated to a uniform 0 08 resolution between 40 s 40 n and to 0 04 resolution poleward of these latitudes the ocean surface geostrophic currents are calculated from ssh fields assuming geostrophic balance the ageostrophic currents are the difference between the surface currents and the geostrophic currents 2 2 data assimilation the data assimilation technique employed for the reanalysis is a three dimensional 3d variational scheme used within the navy coupled ocean data assimilation ncoda cummings 2005 cummings and smedstad 2013 available remotely sensed sea surface temperature sst ssh sea ice concentration and in situ observations of temperature and salinity from profiles ships and moored and drifting buoys are all assimilated into hycom ncoda also generates synthetic temperature and salinity profiles for assimilation that are formed from the two dimensional ssh and sst using a 3d synthetic profile method the improved synthetic ocean profile helber et al 2013 2 3 initialization and surface forcing the 17 year reanalysis is separated into one 3 year stream starting in 1999 six 2 5 year streams starting in 2001 and one 3 year stream from 2013 to 2015 for each stream the initialization state comes from a previous 20 year ocean reanalysis thoppil et al 2015 yu et al 2015 on december 1 of the previous year except the very first stream started in june 1998 atmospheric forcing for this reanalysis is from the 0 3125 hourly ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 the wind stress formulation in the model includes the ocean surface currents the ncep cfsr 10 m wind velocities are read by hycom and the surface stress is calculated at every time step taking into account the ocean surface currents the surface stress in the previous 20 year ocean reanalysis used to initialize the model does not include the ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation when the new wind stress formulation include ocean surface current is applied to the model the mesoscale eddy field adjusts to the satellite altimeter data within the first month yu et al 2015 but the basin wide kinetic energy takes another 6 months to reach equilibrium thus while the 2 5 year streams start on december 1 of the previous year and end after 31 months of integration i e the end of june only the last two years of output i e july 2001 june 2003 from each 2 5 year stream are used in the analysis here reanalysis data from january 1999 to june 2001 in the first stream and from july 2013 to december 2015 in the last stream are used in the analysis 3 wind work on geostrophic currents in this study the overbar terms in eqs 1 5 are 17 year averages and the prime terms are eddy components relative to the 17 year average of ocean currents and wind stress all figures are presented in the latitude range from 80 s to 80 n while global integrals are given in the region between 63 s and 63 n to be consistent with previous studies a detailed description of the wind work terms in eq 4 is given in this section 3 1 the mean part of the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g the 17 year average mean wind stress τ and geostrophic currents v g are used to calculate the mean part of the wind work on the surface geostrophic currents to be consistent with wunsch 1998 the equatorial region within 3 of the equator is omitted from these calculations the two components τ x u g and τ y v g of τ v g are shown in fig 1 a and c respectively the global 63 s 63 n to be consistent with wunsch 1998 integral table 3 shows the dominance of τ x u g 0 78 tw relative to τ y v g 0 03 tw which are 0 02 and 0 01 tw smaller than the wunsch 1998 estimate respectively this is due to the inclusion of surface current in the wind stress formulation in our model that reduces the wind work duhaut and straub 2006 please note that the two decimal points do not imply an absolute accuracy of 0 01 tw but are given to allow a comparison with the numbers of the same order by wunsch 1998 the spatial patterns are very similar to that found in previous studies wunsch 1998 von storch et al 2007 hughes and wilson 2008 scotts and xu 2009 zhai et al 2012 the most significant positive input of τ x u g comes from the antarctic circumpolar current acc in the southern ocean the gulf stream the kuroshio wunsch 1998 and the caribbean current hughes and wilson 2008 seventy one percent of the global integral of τ x u g occurs to the south of 40 s due to the persistent strong winds above the acc that is the world s strongest current system fig 1b the most significant negative values of τ x u g are found over the north equatorial countercurrent fig 1a and b which is the same as hughes and wilson 2008 their fig 1 twenty one percent of the global integral of τ x u g comes from tropical subtropical regions within 20 of the equator notice that although the gulf stream and kuroshio have their strong signatures in the global pattern fig 1a their contributions to τ x u g are small when integrated zonally fig 1b this is because the ocean surface areas occupied by both current systems are small and thus their contributions are smeared out by the zonal integration τ y v g fig 1c is much smaller than τ x u g and 91 of the wind work occurs within 20 of the equator fig 1d the total mean component of the wind work on geostrophic currents τ v g fig 1e thus follows closely the spatial distribution of τ x u g fig 1a its global integral is 0 81 tw with 69 of the wind work occurring to the south of 40 s and another 23 occurring within 20 of the equator fig 1f 3 2 the eddy part of the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g to calculate v g we first calculate 10 day average ssh from the hourly ssh outputs and then the 10 day average geostrophic current v g is calculated assuming geostrophic equilibrium following wunsch 1998 v g is the difference between the 10 day average geostrophic current and the 17 year average geostrophic current the surface stress is also averaged every 10 day period to calculate τ unlike the mean part both components τ x u g and τ y v g of τ v g show similar magnitude and their spatial patterns fig 2 a and c are very similar to wunsch 1998 the most dominant positive contribution comes from the tropics and the most dominant negative values occur in the southern ocean fig 2a d like wunsch 1998 the reanalysis results also show significant positive and negative contributions in the western monsoon region of the indian ocean the global integral of τ x u g and τ y v g in our calculation is 0 042 and 0 057 tw table 4 respectively in comparison to 0 029 and 0 01 tw in wunsch 1998 these differences mainly come from the high mesoscale eddy activity regions south of 40 s the agulhas current the kuroshio extension and the gulf stream duhaut and straub 2006 pointed out that the reduction of geostrophic wind work due to the surface currents in the wind stress formulation is the strongest in regions of high mesoscale eddy activity hughes and wilson 2008 further show that more than 75 of this effect is represented by τ v g thus the negative values of τ v g fig 2a and c found in the southern ocean the agulhas current the kuroshio extension and the gulf stream can be attributed to the effect of including ocean surface currents in the wind stress formulation which is not included in wunsch 1998 the spatial distribution of τ v g and its zonal integral are shown in fig 2e and f they look very similar to fig 5a in hughes and wilson 2008 which also contains the effect of ocean currents in their wind stress formulation there are strong positive and negative contributions in the tropics with positive contributions dominating and strong negative contributions in the regions with strong mesoscale eddy activity however a closer inspection reveals that our results have a systematic low bias in comparison with hughes and wilson 2008 the integral between 20 s and 20 n in our model is 0 027 tw that is smaller than the hughes and wilson 2008 0 039 tw estimate in our zonal integration fig 2f the magnitude of negative contributions from the southern hemisphere around 40 s is larger than the maximum positive contribution around 10 n fig 2f which is opposite to the findings by hughes and wilson 2008 their fig 5a our total integral south of 20 s is 0 103 tw quadruple the integral of 0 026 tw for the same region in hughes and wilson 2008 their table 3 the global integral of τ v g of the reanalysis is 0 099 tw compared with 0 009 tw in hughes and wilson 2008 and 0 039 tw in wunsch 1998 there are two possibilities that can contribute to these differences the first is that the reduction of geostrophic wind work due to the surface currents via the wind stress is probably diluted in hughes and wilson 2008 in order to be able to fully resolve the effect of ocean currents on wind work via wind stress formulation the wind stress and current measurements need to be matched well enough in time and space for the mesoscale features in both currents and wind stresses field to be aligned it is possible that this requirement was not met for observations hughes and wilson 2008 the second possibility comes from the spatial resolution of the available data as mentioned in section 2 1 the horizontal resolution of the hycom reanalysis is eddy resolving at 0 08 the data used by wunsch 1998 were gridded at 2 resolution which is not able to resolve mesoscale eddies the data used by hughes and wilson 2008 were gridded on a 1 3 mercator grid which is eddy permitting but not able to fully resolve the mesoscale eddies properly thus the spatial resolution of available data may limit hughes and wilson 2008 from fully capturing the contribution of mesoscale eddies on τ v g and the decreasing trend of τ v g 0 039 0 009 0 099 tw with the increase of the spatial resolution among the three studies supports this assumption 3 3 the 17 year average wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g both the spatial pattern fig 3 a and its zonal integral fig 3b of the 17 year average total wind work on the surface geostrophic currents τ v g agree well with hughes and wilson 2008 the most dominant contribution comes from the southern ocean which accounts for 70 of the total wind work on the geostrophic currents the global integral is 0 71 tw 19 less than the estimate of 0 88 tw in wunsch 1998 and 7 less than the 0 76 tw estimate in hughes and wilson 2008 among the 0 17 tw reduction compared to the wunsch 1998 0 14 tw 82 comes from τ v g this clearly supports the idea that most of the reduction of τ v g by including the ocean currents in the wind stress formulation comes from the eddy part τ v g of the wind work duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 4 wind work on ageostrophic currents the hourly ageostrophic currents are calculated as the difference between the hourly surface currents and the corresponding 10 day average surface geostrophic currents the sensitivity of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents to the choice of different geostrophic average periods is discussed in section 5 1 the 17 year average ageostrophic currents are calculated as the difference between the 17 year average surface currents and surface geostrophic currents 4 1 the mean part of the 17 year average wind work on the ageostrophic currents τ v ag the 17 year average mean wind stress τ and ocean surface ageostrophic currents v ag are used to calculate the mean part of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents since the 17 year average ageostrophic currents are surface ekman currents classical theory tells us that the mean part of the wind work on the surface ekman currents wang and huang 2004 is 11 τ v ag τ 2 ρ o f d e we should expect a high correlation between τ v ag and the magnitude of the mean wind stress indeed the spatial distribution of τ v ag fig 4 a in our model is very similar to the mean wind stress magnitude fig 5 a with a high correlation coefficient of 0 95 the global integral of τ v ag is 1 28 tw table 3 its main contribution comes from two regions with the largest contribution 47 from the southern ocean south of 40 s fig 4a and b due to the strong currents driven by strong wind stress and the second largest contribution 35 from the tropical subtropical region within 20 of the equator 4 2 comparing τ v ag with wang and huang 2004 the 1 28 tw global integral of τ v ag is in decent agreement with the von storch et al 2007 1 06 tw estimate but more than double the wang and huang 2004 0 54 tw estimate however the 75 contribution from the southern hemisphere in our calculation is almost the same as the 74 estimate in wang and huang 2004 to understand the magnitude difference between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 τ v ag is also estimated theoretically in the same way as wang and huang 2004 their eqs 15 and 13 by applying the 17 year average surface stress to eqs 6 and 11 the spatial distribution of the theoretical estimate fig 5b is very similar to what s calculated from the reanalysis data fig 4a with a high spatial correlation of 0 97 the meridional variation of the zonal integral fig 5c is also in good agreement with the reanalysis fig 4b but the wind work magnitude of the theoretical estimate is much smaller with a 0 46 tw global integral which is in much better agreement with the wang and huang 2004 0 54 tw estimate kelly et al 2001 find that including surface currents in the wind stress formulation reduces the wind stress magnitude thus the 0 08 tw difference between our theoretical estimate and wang and huang 2004 can mainly be attributed to the smaller surface stress in the reanalysis induced by the inclusion of surface currents in the wind stress formulation since the choice of wind stress data only makes a very small difference in the estimate of τ v ag using the same method the large difference 1 28 vs 0 54 tw between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 resides in their usage of eqs 6 and 11 to estimate the wind work vs the internal physics in hycom eq 11 is derived from the classical ekman spiral that predicts a constant 45 angle wang and huang 2004 between the surface ekman current and wind stress as can be seen from fig 5d this angle varies significantly with location in the southern ocean where most of the wind work occurs the average angle fig 5e is 34 according to our discussion in section 1 3 the wind work calculated from the reanalysis can be 17 larger cos 34 cos 45 than that calculated using the classical theory in this region assuming the same ekman depth for a given mean wind stress dataset the wind work is inversely proportional to the ekman depth eq 6 according to eq 11 the wang and huang 2004 estimation will be doubled to 1 08 tw if γ 0 25 is used in eq 6 and their estimate can be further increased to 1 26 tw when we consider the angle difference in the southern ocean which is in close agreement with our 1 28 tw estimate 4 3 the eddy part of the 17 year average wind work on surface ageostrophic currents τ v ag τ v g is much smaller than τ v g but τ v a g fig 4c is much larger than τ v ag fig 4a the global 63 s 63 n integral of τ v a g is 4 15 tw table 4 and is more than double the 1 83 tw estimated by wang and huang 2004 despite the large magnitude difference both estimates of τ v a g show 60 of the corresponding contribution from the southern hemisphere τ v a g fig 4c and d is very strong over two regions the southern ocean and the subpolar basins in the north pacific and north atlantic oceans the southern ocean to the south of 40 s contributes 43 to the global integral while the northern storm track regions to the north of 30 n contributes another 26 the eddy ageostrophic wind work is strong over the storm track regions due to the strong synoptic wind variability and is in general small in the tropical subtropical region fig 4c but the tropical indian ocean and south china sea show moderate values of τ v a g probably due to monsoon activities in the regions 4 4 comparing τ v ag with wang and huang 2004 the spatial pattern fig 4e and its zonal integral fig 4f of τ v a g τ v ag τ v a g are very similar to these reported by wang and huang 2004 their fig 3 but with much larger magnitude the three regions that make significant contributions to τ v a g in the reanalysis are consistent with wang and huang 2004 namely 1 the acc 2 the storm track regions in the north atlantic and north pacific oceans and 3 the south china sea and south indian ocean arabian sea furthermore despite the magnitude difference the ratio of the southern hemisphere contribution 67 to the global integral of τ v a g 5 44 tw in the reanalysis is similar to the 63 estimate in wang and huang 2004 the difference of the global integral of these two estimates is 3 14 tw part of the 3 14 tw wind work difference comes from the wind work on the near inertial currents the nyquist frequency of the hourly surface stress forcing 0 5 cycles per hour for the reanalysis is much higher than the inertial frequency in the global ocean thus the reanalysis is capable of fully resolving the near inertial currents while the wang and huang 2004 2 3 tw estimate is wind work purely on surface ekman currents it would be the best if the wind work on the near inertial currents can be calculated using the reanalysis output by temporally filtering the near inertial surface stresses and currents but this is not practical due to the memory limitations for the 17 year hourly time series of the global eddy resolving grid resolution 4500 3298 so the 0 5 tw estimate from alford 2003 is taken as a reference of the contribution of the global wind work on the near inertial currents to the 3 14 tw wind work difference the 0 6 tw estimate from watanabe and hibiya 2002 is 20 larger than the estimate of alford 2003 but it doesn t change our conclusions the 3 14 tw wind work difference can also be partially explained by the frequency difference of wind stress used in the two estimates with hourly wind stress in the reanalysis being much higher than the daily wind stress used in wang and huang 2004 to quantify this effect we calculate the wind work on the ageostrophic currents with the daily averaged outputs to be consistent with wang and huang 2004 its spatial pattern and zonal integral fig 6 a and b are very similar to the hourly results fig 4e and f and the global integral is 4 18 tw 1 26 tw less than the hourly reanalysis results the differences between these two estimates are shown in fig 6c and d there are two regions that mainly contribute to this difference the acc and the storm track regions in the north atlantic and north pacific oceans fig 6c since much of the time dependence of the wind stress in the tropics is seasonal whereas the time dependence of the wind stress at the mid latitudes is more dominated by synoptic time scales von storch et al 2007 zhai et al 2012 the 1 26 tw global integral difference contains two parts 1 the high frequency daily to hourly wind work contribution to the ekman currents according to eq 10 and 2 the difference from the wind work on the near inertial currents the daily averaged reanalysis output is sufficient to resolve near inertial currents within 10 of the equator so the contribution of near inertial current in this region cannot be reflected by this difference since alford 2003 fig 1 suggests that 0 10 tw of the wind work on near inertial currents comes within 10 of the equator and 0 40 tw in the remaining global ocean we calculate that the wind work difference due to the high frequency wind stress daily to hourly variation on ekman currents is 0 86 tw 1 26 tw 0 4 tw in total the wind stress frequency difference and the wind work on inertial currents together counts for 1 36 tw 0 86 tw 0 5 tw of wind work difference between the reanalysis and wang and huang 2004 the remaining 1 78 tw difference is likely coming from the over estimate of ekman depth and the constant 45 angle between wind stress and surface ekman current in wang and huang 2004 as discussed in section 4 2 4 5 comparing τ v ag with von storch et al 2007 our total wind work on the surface ageostrophic currents is also much larger than the 2 7 tw estimated by von storch et al 2007 the difference between the reanalysis and von storch et al 2007 is likely due to three major reasons first the 1 m thickness of hycom s first layer allows it to represent 90 95 of the surface ekman current when the ekman depth is 10 20 m whereas the 5 m thick first layer in von storch 2007 only allows their numerical model to represent 58 77 of the surface ekman current second von storch et al 2007 forced their numerical model with daily wind stress according to section 4 4 this leads to an underestimate of 1 26 tw wind work due to the lack of the high frequency wind stress contribution from daily to hourly to the wind work on ekman currents and not being able to resolve the near inertial currents at latitudes poleward of 10 third the reanalysis stores hourly surface output while von storch et al 2007 stores snapshots every three days this likely leads to an underestimate of the wind work in their study for example von storch et al 2012 analyzed data from the german consortium project storm ncep simulation which was forced by 6 hourly ncep ncar reanalysis 1 kalnay et al 1996 wind stress to estimate the wind work using accumulated second moments they were able to obtain a 20 higher value in the eddy part of the wind work than the estimate in von storch et al 2007 even with a thicker first layer of 10 m as mentioned in von storch et al 2012 the higher eddy part of wind work on surface currents in comparison with the estimate in von storch et al 2007 can be a direct consequence of calculating the eddy part of wind work using accumulated second moments rather than snapshots sampled every three days 5 discussions and conclusions in this study we calculate the wind work on the surface currents from a 17 year global hycom reanalysis with hourly surface stress surface currents and ssh outputs the reanalysis is forced with a wind stress formulation that takes into account the ocean surface currents the hourly 10 m wind velocities are obtained from the 0 3125 resolution ncep cfsr datasets at every time step the surface stress is calculated using the cfsr 10 m wind velocities and surface currents from the reanalysis for the mean part of the wind work our estimate of τ v g agrees well with previous research wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 in both the global integral 0 81 tw and the meridional variation of the zonal integral however the global integral of τ v ag is estimated to be 1 28 tw which is more than double the 0 54 tw estimate in wang and huang 2004 the reason for this significant difference is most likely due to the fact that there are large uncertainties in the estimate of the ekman depth in wang and huang 2004 in addition wang and huang 2004 used a constant angle of 45 between wind stress and surface ekman currents in their estimate while this angle can have large spatial variations in the real ocean as for the eddy part of the wind work the global integral of eddy wind work on the surface ageostrophic currents τ v a g is 4 15 tw much larger than the wang and huang 2004 1 83 tw estimate however the fact that the global integral of τ v g is much smaller than τ v g and the global integral of τ v a g is larger than that of τ v ag agrees well with the previous studies by wunsch 1998 wang and huang 2004 and hughes and wilson 2008 the spatial pattern of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents τ v a g is very similar to that reported by wang and huang 2004 their fig 3 but the 5 44 tw global integral is much larger the 3 14 tw difference can be attributed to three parts 1 the wind work on the near inertial currents contributes 0 5 tw 2 the higher frequency wind stress daily to hourly contributes 0 86 tw wind work on surface ekman currents and 3 the remaining 1 78 tw difference most likely comes from the underestimation by wang and huang 2004 from overestimating the ekman depth and using a constant 45 angle between the wind stress and surface ekman currents rather than spatially varying angle as indicated by observations 5 1 sensitivity study of the different geostrophic average period to the wind work on ageostrophic currents in this study geostrophic currents are calculated from 10 day average reanalysis ssh fields and the ageostrophic currents are defined as the departure from the 10 day average geostrophic currents the 10 day average period is an arbitrary choice chosen to be consistent with wunsch 1998 geostrophic flow also exists in periods less than 10 days and can contaminate the calculation of ageostrophic currents and thus the wind work on the ageostrophic currents the difference is the eddy part of the high frequency wind work on the geostrophic currents to address how sensitive is wind work on the ageostrophic currents to the choice of the geostrophic average period we calculate the eddy part of wind work on geostrophic currents τ v o g using hourly and daily average reanalysis surface stress and ssh output to calculate geostrophic currents assuming geostrophic equilibrium τ v o g calculated from hourly and daily average output shares very similar spatial patterns not shown with that from 10 day average output fig 2 the global integral changes only by 0 008 and 0 015 tw table 5 when daily average and hourly reanalysis output are used to calculate wind work on geostrophic currents instead of the 10 day average those differences are negligible to the wind work on ageostrophic currents 5 44 tw thus wind work on the ageostrophic currents is not sensitive to the choice of the geostrophic average period 5 2 total wind work on the global ocean currents the total wind work on the global ocean currents is estimated as 6 15 tw figure 3c and d when calculated using hourly reanalysis output the most important area is the acc in the southern ocean fig 3d which contributes 46 to the total wind work another 20 comes from the tropical subtropical region within 20 of the equator and 12 comes from northern hemisphere storm track regions in the area 40 60 n previously the total wind work on the global ocean currents was estimated to be 3 7 tw as the sum of the 0 88 tw input to the geostrophic currents wunsch 1998 2 3 tw input to the ageostrophic currents without near inertial motion wang and huang 2004 and 0 5 tw input to the near inertial currents alford 2003 our estimate which contains all the spectrum mentioned above is much larger the equatorial region within 3 of the equator is omitted from our estimate and provides an additional 0 2 tw to the global integral of the total wind work to the global ocean circulation the global integral in this study is integrated from 63 s 63 n contributions beyond this region to the wind work on geostrophic currents and the mean part of wind work on the ageostrophic currents are negligible but for the eddy part of wind work on the ageostrophic currents there is an additional 0 4 tw poleward of 63 5 3 impact of the thickness of the surface layer in section 1 3 the classical ekman spiral theory discussion indicates that wind work on ekman currents is reduced when calculated with vertical mean currents in this section we calculate wind work on the ageostrophic currents using the vertical mean ageostrophic currents in the top 5 m and 30 m to show how much of the wind work is reduced compared with the reanalysis results for june 2004 in these calculations we assume the vertical shear of the geostrophic currents is negligible in the top 30 m of the water column to calculate the ageostrophic currents below the surface layer the wind work on the ageostrophic currents calculated from the vertical mean ageostrophic currents in the top 5 m 30 m is only 78 15 of that calculated using the currents in the top 1 m in another words the total wind work on the ageostrophic currents can be reduced by 22 85 when a 5 m 30 m first layer thickness instead of 1 m is used in the reanalysis applying these ratios to the wind work on ageostrophic currents calculated with daily average output 4 18 tw section 4 4 gives us 3 3 tw 0 6 tw of wind work on ageostrophic currents if the hycom surface layer thickness is 5 m 30 m these estimates are in closer agreement with 2 7 tw in von storch et al 2007 who uses a first layer of 5 m thickness and the 0 3 tw in huang et al 2006 who uses a first layer of 30 m thickness 5 4 impact on the kinetic energy budget and dissipation in the ekman layer the estimate from this study is very useful for the global kinetic energy budget analysis since wind work on the surface currents is the most important mechanical energy source in maintaining the oceanic general circulation wind work on ageostrophic currents through the subinertial range is fully dissipated in the ekman layer on supporting turbulence and mixing only in the steady state wang and huang 2004 the increase of wind work on the ageostrophic currents through the increase of the wind stress frequency clearly demonstrates that the high frequency variability can be important for inputting energy into the global ocean circulation since the majority of this additional energy must be dissipated inside the ekman layer this provides additional information of the mixing process inside the ekman layer how much of the wind work on the ageostrophic currents passes through the ekman layer is unknown and is a topic for the future research as suggested by von storch et al 2007 about 5 0 14 tw of the wind work on ageostrophic currents escapes the surface layer of 110 m thickness the 110 m depth is much deeper than the ekman depth in general but even if we apply the same ratio to the reanalysis 0 3 tw of wind work on the ageostrophic currents would be transported into the sub surface layer and play a major role in the oceanic circulation

24087,we present sea ice kinetic energy budgets to quantify the relative importance of the various energy sinks in a viscous plastic sea ice model to this end we study two idealized model domains where energy dissipation associated with shear and axial ridge lead building deformation can be analyzed independently we find that when only shear deformation is present either at the domain boundary induced by the no slip boundary condition or within the model domain induced by gradients in the surface air stress the energy dissipated through friction reduces in relative importance as the spatial resolution of the model is increased in the limit where the spatial resolution tends to zero the simulated sea ice drift tends to the analytical solution giving us confidence in the numerical implementation of the governing differential equation increasing spatial resolution leads to a localization of deformation along the shear lines effectively increasing the area over which energy is input by the wind which is not compensated for by frictional shear dissipation for instance at 40 km spatial resolution 64 and 29 of the input power is dissipated through shear deformation and water drag respectively while at 5 km spatial resolution 54 and 43 of the input power is dissipated by the respective processes these values approach the respective values of 53 and 47 found analytically for this particular model configuration the overall result is a 64 increase in the domain total sea ice kinetic energy when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km due to the finer representation of shear lines in convergence the mean kinetic energy and potential energy do not depend meaningfully on the spatial resolution in this case the structure of the thickness and concentration fields effectively sets the velocity gradient near the boundary provided that the plastic deformation wave associated with the ridge building process is resolved keywords sea ice arctic numerical modeling rheology 1 introduction the power input by the surface winds into the arctic sea ice cover is the main source of its kinetic energy drift speed in the widely used viscous plastic vp sea ice model of hibler 1979 this energy is largely dissipated by water drag during the summer months during the winter months kinetic energy dissipation due to friction associated with ridging and shear become important as well bouchat and tremblay 2014 for instance pritchard 1981 found that roughly one third of the power input by the surface wind was lost to the ocean in the beaufort sea during winter while the remaining power was assumed to be dissipated by internal ice friction furthermore pritchard 1988 showed that the partitioning of shear and divergent deformation in a plastic model is related to the shape of the yield curve and the associated flow rule used to define the sea ice rheology sea ice deformation dissipates energy through friction in both shear and ridging kinetic energy is also converted to potential energy during ridge building as work must be done to raise the ice against gravity bouchat and tremblay 2014 found that in the vp sea ice model the majority of the power input is transferred to the ocean with approximately 15 of the arctic wide annual power input being dissipated by internal ice mechanics the authors found that of that 15 frictional shear dissipation accounts for roughly 75 of the internal sea ice stress dissipation in march with the frictional ridging dissipation and potential energy increase accounting for 15 and 10 respectively recently spreen et al 2016 showed that in a coupled ice ocean model forced by reanalysis data the magnitude of arctic averaged sea ice deformation rates at a variety of spatial resolutions are approximately 50 lower in the vp model when compared to the radarsat geophysical processor system rgps satellite observations the authors found that there was a 6 increase in the areal mean deformation rate when the spatial resolution was increased from 18 km to 4 5 km this indicates that increasing the spatial resolution leads to better agreement between simulated and observed deformation statistics in this paper we quantify the power input and dissipation in the vp sea ice model as the spatial resolution is increased to this end we study two idealized model domains and forcing fields one where energy is dissipated only in shear and one where energy is dissipated primarily in convergence divergence ridge building or lead opening in these idealized situations we can solve the steady state sea ice momentum equation analytically in the case of pure shear we find that the simulated mean sea ice velocity is far from the analytical solution at coarse spatial resolution 40 km but approaches the analytic solution as the spatial resolution is increased we find that this increase in the sea ice velocity is due to a reduction in the relative importance of frictional energy dissipation in shear compared to water drag dissipation when divergence or convergence is the primary mode of failure the numerical solution does not show a strong dependence on spatial resolution 2 model description the 2 d sea ice momentum balance is given by 1 ρ i h u t ρ i h f z u τ a τ w ρ i h g h d σ where ρi is the density of sea ice h is the grid cell mean sea ice thickness u is the 2 d horizontal sea ice velocity vector f is the coriolis parameter τ a is the surface air stress τ w is the stress imparted on the bottom of the ice by the ocean g is the gravitational acceleration hd is the sea surface dynamic height and σ is the vertically integrated 2 d internal ice stress tensor using quadratic drag laws e g mcphee 1982 the effective surface air and ocean stress acting on the ice τ a and τ w are given by 2 τ a ρ a c d a u a g u a g cos θ a z u a g sin θ a 3 τ w ρ w c d w u u w g u u w g cos θ w z u u w g sin θ w where u a g and u w g are the geostrophic velocities of the atmosphere and ocean θa and θw are the turning angles of the atmosphere and ocean and z is the unit vector normal to the ice surface note that in eq 2 we have assumed that the wind speed is much greater than the sea ice drift speed i e u a g u following hibler 1979 we assume that the sea ice behaves as a viscous plastic vp material with an elliptical yield curve and normal flow rule the internal stress tensor for the vp constitutive law is written as a function of the strain rates ϵ i j and the parameterized ice strength p 4 σ i j 2 η ϵ i j ζ η ϵ k k p 2 δ i j where the strain rates ϵ i j are given by ϵ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and δij is the kronecker delta function in a plastic material the bulk and shear viscosities ζ and η follow from the choice of yield curve and flow rule for the vp model of hibler 1979 they are given by 5 ζ p 2 δ 6 η ζ e 2 where δ ϵ 11 ϵ 22 2 ϵ 11 ϵ 22 e 2 2 ϵ 12 e 2 and e is the aspect ratio of the yield curve note that δ can be written as a function of the strain rate invariants as 7 δ ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 where ϵ i is the mean compressive strain rate i e the divergence and ϵ i i is the maximum shear strain rate this notation will prove useful in the limit where δ goes to zero ζ and η tend to infinity in this case we use the regularization of ζ proposed by lemieux and tremblay 2009 8 ζ ζ max tanh p 2 δ ζ max where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and ζ max 2 5 10 8 p this regularization allows for the viscous coefficients to vary smoothly with the strain rates as the local stress state transitions from viscous to plastic and vice versa the mass and momentum conservation laws are coupled via the ice strength p 9 p p h exp c 1 a where p is the sea ice compressive strength and c is the sea ice concentration dependence parameter hibler 1979 eq 9 is first used to compute the viscous coefficients ζ and η the replacement pressure method is then used to recalculate the ice strength as p p r 2 δ ζ using ζ from eq 8 note that pr only differs from p as calculated from eq 9 when the ice is in the viscous regime i e grid cells where ζ ζ max hibler and ip 1995 the recalculated ice strength is then used in the constitutive law eq 4 the replacement pressure method insures that the ice does not deform due to gradients in the sea ice thickness or strength in the viscous regime of the model the corollary to this is that the sea ice thickness can go slowly to infinity when the forcing is relatively weak but persistent kimmritz et al 2017 the temporal evolution of h and a are governed by two continuity equations which can be written as 10 h t h u s a 11 a t a u s h where sa and sh are thermodynamic source terms for the sea ice concentration and thickness respectively in the following we consider only dynamic effects s a s h 0 the values of parameters used in this model are defined in table 1 unless otherwise noted in the text 3 kinetic energy equation following bouchat and tremblay 2014 the kinetic energy of the vp sea ice model can be written as 12 k t h u 1 2 ρ u u h t u ρ h u t where k is the local kinetic energy per unit area k 1 2 ρ h u u the term h is associated with changes in inertia due to increasing or decreasing sea ice thickness and therefore mass this term has been shown to be negligible in pan arctic simulations bouchat and tremblay 2014 this is also the case in all simulations presented in the following the term u is associated with changes in inertia due to increasing or decreasing sea ice velocity this term can be decomposed into several terms associated with the various forces acting on the sea ice these terms are defined by taking the dot product of u with the vp momentum eq 1 performing this operation we find 13 u u ρ h u t w o g i where w is the power input by the surface wind stress u τ a o is the power gained or lost to the ocean through drag u τ w g is the rate of work done positive or negative to change the potential energy due to the sea surface slope ρ h g u h d and i is the power dissipated by internal sea ice friction as well as the rate of work required to increase decrease the gravitational potential energy of the ice due to lifting lowering its center of gravity of the ice i is given by u σ g is identically zero in all simulations presented in the following as we will only consider cases with a static i e flat ocean the power associated with internal ice mechanics i can be further decomposed as 14 i i t i p d i d i i where it is the power laterally transferred by internal ice stress propagation given by 15 i t u σ this term can be written as a flux across a boundary by applying the divergence theorem all domains presented in this study have no net flux into or out of the domain since we use periodic boundaries and thus this term is identically zero when integrated over the domain ip is associated with the change of internal energy to mechanical kinetic potential energy due to the redistribution of sea ice mass viscous fluid flow 3e this term is given by 16 i p p 2 ϵ i ip acts as an energy sink when the sea ice motion is convergent and as an energy source when the sea ice motion is divergent in the following we separate ip into i p and i p where the superscript corresponds to the sign of ϵ i di and dii are the energy dissipated through friction by divergence positive or negative and shear respectively they are given by 17 d i ζ ϵ i 2 18 d i i η ϵ i i 2 substituting eqs 5 6 into eqs 17 18 we find 19 d i p ϵ i 2 2 ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 20 d i i p ϵ i i 2 2 e 2 ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 dissipation in divergence or convergence is in general accompanied by changes to the sea ice thickness and concentration which will affect ζ in eq 17 through the dependence on thickness and concentration in the ice strength parameterization eq 9 note that in the case of negligible shear eq 16 and eq 19 will exactly compensate one another when pure shear deformation is present the deformation will not change the sea ice thickness or concentration and thus the sea ice strength will remain constant we will see in the following that this distinction between shear dissipation and tension compression dissipation is important 4 model configuration 4 1 domain we define two idealized domains in order to study the model response to resolution for different modes of mechanical failure shear and tension compression both domains are squares with dimensions of 2000 km by 2000 km the first domain consists of walls at x 0 km and x 2000 km where impermeability and no slip boundary conditions u v 0 are applied periodic boundary conditions ϕ y 0 ϕ y l where ϕ u v h a are applied at the top and bottom of the domain at y 0 km and y 2000 km in this domain the sea ice fails purely in shear this domain is termed shr see fig 1 left panel for a schematic diagram the second domain consists of two vertical edges at x 0 km and x 2000 km where periodic boundary conditions are applied and two horizontal walls at y 0 km and y 2000 km where impermeability and no slip boundary conditions are applied in this configuration the axial strain rate is maximum in the y direction and 0 in the x direction this implies that shear is present along planes that are angled with respect to the domain boundaries from mohr s circle we will see in the following that most of the dissipation is associated with ridging as opposed to shear in this model configuration this domain is termed cmp see fig 1 right panel for a schematic diagram in all simulations ocean points have ice thickness and concentration equal to 3 m and 100 at the beginning of the simulations the initial ice velocity is u v 0 m s everywhere in the domain 4 2 forcing in both the shr and cmp domains the model is forced with spatially and temporally uniform southward winds for the shr simulations the magnitude of the wind forcing is 5 m s unless otherwise noted in the text this provides sufficient wind stress to cause shear failure at the land ice interface for the cmp simulations the magnitude of the wind forcing is 8 m s this leads to an integrated surface stress which exceeds the sea ice compressive strength at the southern edge of the domain and therefore ridging will take place in the following we set the coriolis parameter and the air and water turning angles to zero this is done in order to have the surface wind stress act only in the y direction for simplicity 4 3 numerical scheme in all model simulations the momentum equation eq 1 is solved numerically using the jacobian free newton krylov jfnk method lemieux et al 2010 the jfnk solver is iterated for each model timestep until the root mean square velocity error in the domain is less than 10 3 cm s the advective timestep of the model is 10 minutes note that the implicit explicit imex method as described in lemieux et al 2014 is used for coupling the momentum equation to the mass and concentration equations eq 1 eqs 10 and 11 this insures that the plastic wave in the cmp experiment is resolved for all model spatial resolutions williams et al 2017 5 results 5 1 shr experiment 5 1 1 analytical solution in the shr domain with no forcing in the x direction the ice will deform purely in shear we assume zero horizontal velocity due to symmetry and no structure of the solution in the y direction due to periodic boundary conditions note that these assumptions are confirmed by the numerical simulations presented in the following section furthermore assuming a static ocean the momentum eq 1 simplifies to 21 ρ h v t τ w y τ a y x σ 12 where v is the sea ice velocity in the y direction and σ 12 is the shear stress the thickness and concentration remain constant in time since the flow is non divergent we seek the domain averaged steady state sea ice drift speed in the along wind direction to this end we set the time derivative term equal to zero and we integrate the v momentum eq 21 in the x direction see fig 1 for a schematic of the domain performing this operation we find 22 0 0 l c d w ρ w v 2 c d a ρ a v a 2 x σ 12 d x where l is the length of the domain in the x direction and va is the wind speed integrating eq 22 yields 23 0 c d w ρ w v 2 l c d a ρ a v a 2 l σ 12 x l σ 12 x 0 the shear stress at the boundaries is known from the yield curve assuming the deformation at the wall is plastic and non divergent i e purely shear in the case of the vp rheology and forcing in the negative y direction σ 12 can be written from eq 4 as 24 σ 12 p 2 e x 0 p 2 e x l substituting eq 24 into the integrated momentum eq 23 we find 25 0 c d w ρ w v 2 l c d a ρ a v a 2 l p e or after isolating the speed of the ice 26 v c d a ρ a v a 2 c d w ρ w p l ρ w c d w e the first term of the solution is the free drift speed the second term is a correction that is linearly related to the shear stress at the wall p 2 e for the shr domain and forcing outlined above and using the parameter values listed in table 1 we find v 5 7 cm s where we have chosen the negative root because of the direction of the wind forcing note that from the ratios of the terms in eq 25 we see that 53 of input wind power is dissipated by the plastic shear deformation while 47 is lost through ocean drag for this particular domain configuration when the second term under the radical exceeds the first the assumption of plasticity breaks down i e eq 24 is no longer valid 5 1 2 numerical solution the simulated ice velocity field in the shr experiment is characterized by two sharp shear lines along the walls with a rapid transition to a center channel drift speed which is a function of the model spatial resolution the sharpness of the sea ice velocity gradient depends on the spatial resolution of the model simulation in particular we see an increasing localization of energy dissipated in plastic shear along the wall as the spatial resolution of the model is increased fig 2 the width of the region with non zero shear dissipation dii decreases from approximately 160 km at 40 km resolution to approximately 20 km at 5 km resolution this indicates that the number of grid cells needed to resolve the shear line is roughly constant regardless of the spatial resolution of the mode in other words the shear friction between the ice and the wall induces a sharper gradient in sea ice velocity as the spatial resolution is increased this is in line with results from bouchat and tremblay 2014 who found that the area of sea ice undergoing plastic deformation decreases as the spatial resolution increases in a pan arctic model due to the sharpening of deformation features the reduction in area over which plastic deformation takes place counteracts the local increase in energy dissipation in shear as the resolution of the model is increased the net effect is that the domain integrated power dissipated in shear decreases with respect to the input power as the spatial resolution increases we find that 64 of the total power input by the wind is dissipated by friction associated with shear dii at 40 km resolution while 54 of the total power input is dissipated by friction associated with shear dii at 5 km resolution table 2 this is in agreement with the analytical solution where 53 of the input energy being dissipated though plastic shear deformation there is a corresponding increase in the area of undeformed ice in the interior of the channel fig 3 this results in an increased domain integrated sea ice velocity this effect is compounded by the fact that the power input by the wind depends directly on the sea ice drift speed see eq 13 we find that the frictional dissipation of energy in shear does not compensate for the increased power input by the wind and thus the kinetic energy of the sea ice increases the resulting effect is that the sea ice velocity in the center of the channel increases by approximately 32 when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km fig 3 this increase in the mean drift speed in the channel is roughly linear with spatial resolution with the simulated mean drift speed approaching the analytical solution presented above as the spatial resolution tends to zero the increased power input by the wind is dissipated by water drag we find that the percentage of the total power input by the wind which is dissipated by water drag increases from roughly 29 to 43 when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km table 2 we see that increasing the resolution brings the percentage of energy lost through ocean drag closer to that of the analytical solution 47 note that the energy budget shows 4 larger error at 40 km resolution compared to 5 km we attribute this difference in error to the smoothing of the strain rate required to calculate the energy budget at the center of the grid cells in the simulation presented above the shear failure is induced because of our choice of boundary conditions i e no slip below we verify that the conclusions still holds if the shear failure occurs within the model domain i e when it is resolved by the model physics we find that the effect of increasing spatial resolution on the relative importance of water drag and shear friction in terms of energy dissipation is also observed when the deformation occurs within the domain interior and with periodic boundary conditions applied in both the x and y directions to exemplify this point we modify the wind forcing to be 27 v a 10 m s 0 x l 4 10 m s l 4 x 3 l 4 10 m s 3 l 4 x l the magnitude of the wind speed has been increased to 10 m s in order to ensure plastic behavior without the application of no slip boundary conditions in this case the fraction of the input energy dissipated by shear friction decreases by 11 when the resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km again there is an increase in the sea ice drift speed in the center of the domain of 26 fig 4 which leads to an increase in the relative importance of water drag dissipation this is analogous to the shr domain simulations described above and implies that the boundary conditions are not directly the cause of the dependence on the spatial resolution of the model described here note that shear line is resolved in roughly 5 grid cells regardless of the spatial resolution of the model 5 2 cmp experiment 5 2 1 analysis in the cmp domain with no forcing in the x direction we assume the x component of the velocity to be zero due to symmetry the ocean is assumed to be at rest furthermore we assume no dependence on the x direction due to the periodic boundary conditions the relevant momentum equation in this case is 28 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y y σ 22 substituting in the constitutive law eq 4 we find 29 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y y ζ η v y 1 2 p y the thickness and concentration equations for this case are 30 h t v h y h v y 0 31 a t v a y a v y 0 we can simplify the bulk and shear viscosity which appear in the v momentum equation as 32 ζ η p 2 1 e 2 v y substituting this expression into the v momentum eq 29 we find 33 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y 1 2 p y 1 e 2 1 where the sign of the radical term is determined by the sign of v y substituting the sea ice strength parameterization eq 9 into the v momentum equation this becomes 34 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y λ h y c h a y where λ p 2 1 e 2 1 exp c 1 a we see that the velocity gradient in the y direction is effectively set by the gradient in thickness and concentration in other words there is a length scale in the vp model associated with ridge building which is set by the speed of plastic waves and the time over which it has propagated williams et al 2017 in this case the steady state solution is only reached when the thickness of the ice no longer increases neglecting viscous creep at that point the ice thickness gradient will be able to resist the wind forcing and the ice velocity will go to zero the steady state thickness profile can then be found by setting the inertia and water drag terms in eq 34 to zero and integrating in the y direction we do not perform this operation here as we are interested in the energy budget in the case when the inertial term is small but not when the ice is at rest 5 2 2 cmp numerical solution after 6 hrs of forcing the sea ice velocity changes by less than 0 001 cm s over each 10 minute timestep we therefore consider the numerical solution to be effectively in steady state although the thickness field is still slowly evolving the simulated sea ice velocity field in the cmp domain is characterized by southward flow which slows rapidly to zero in the vicinity of the southern wall where the ridge is forming the velocity field is constant in the x direction and the horizontal velocity is effectively zero everywhere by symmetry due to the periodic boundary condition the ice diverges from the top wall creating a sharp velocity gradient which reduces the local ice thickness and concentration at the southern boundary a ridge forms as the ice converges at 5 10 and 20 km resolution the ridge extends 60 km north of the wall while at 40 km resolution it extends 80 km this is due to the spatial discretization and not due to changes in the speed of propagation of the plastic wave with resolution williams et al 2017 we find that the percentage of the input power dissipated by friction associated with ridging d i remains constant at 20 for all spatial resolutions table 3 this can also be seen by integrating d i in the y direction fig 5 the integrated dissipation increases rapidly in the ridging zone and then remains constant as we move away from the southern wall for all spatial resolutions the fact that frictional dissipation d i does not largely change with resolution is in contrast to the results from the shr domain where there was a decrease in frictional shear dissipation dii as the spatial resolution was increased in the cmp experiment the mean speed of the ice remains constant to within 1 at all spatial resolutions it follows that the energy input by wind and the energy dissipation due to water drag remain constant as well with respect to resolution table 3 note that the ridge that forms along the southern wall contains the same volume of ice irrespective of the spatial resolution at all resolutions the lead opening at the top of the domain is confined to one single grid cell this is because divergence is only present in the first open water grid cell adjacent to the wall note that this divergence is due to the choice of boundary conditions which imply that deformation is required for sea ice drift away from the boundary whether this boundary condition commonly used in the sea ice modelling community is physical or not in the case of offshore velocity is an open question see for instance sirven and tremblay 2014 we discuss this in more detail in the following section we find that there is a decrease in conversion of internal energy to mechanical energy due to divergence i p as the resolution is increased in fact the internal energy decrease due to divergence is 8 of the input power by the wind at 40 km resolution in this case the energy change i p and the power dissipated in friction in tension compression d i are identical apart from a difference in sign assuming no shear see eq 16 20 at 5 km resolution both the internal energy decrease due to divergence i p and the frictional energy dissipated in divergence d i are negligible 6 discussion in the case of pure shear in the vp model the width of the lead where dissipation is present scales as δx indicating no inherent length scale below which the numerical solution is independent of the model spatial resolution this is an undesirable feature since there should be in principle a non zero characteristic length scale associated with the important physical processes in the model in geophysical sea ice shear deformation is typically accompanied by dilatation divergence associated with the opening or closing of leads due to the complex geometry of the ice floes overland and pease 1988 tremblay and mysak 1997 stern and moritz 2002 found from studies of satellite observations that there is non negligible divergence during shear events this dilatation gives an inherent length scale to the width of a shear line which is lacking in the vp rheology this process can be accounted for naturally by treating sea ice as a granular material and expressing the macroscopic coefficient of friction in terms of the friction between floes with a mean angle of orientation of contact normals tremblay and mysak 1997 we have shown here in idealized simulations that in shear failure the frictional energy dissipation depends on the spatial resolution and results in first order changes to the simulated velocity field in other words the relative importance of internal sea ice dissipation to water drag dissipation depends on the spatial resolution of the model losch et al 2010 found that opting for free slip instead of no slip boundary conditions effectively increased the sea ice drift speed by up to 2 cm s and thus the sea ice kinetic energy in coastal regions this is in line with what we have presented above as free slip boundary conditions eliminate the shear energy dissipation due to friction with the coastline hutter 2015 showed that in some cases the number of shear lines also increases as the spatial resolution increases this may provide a counter effect to the decreased importance of shear dissipation noted in out studies with a constant number of shear lines a detailed analysis of these two competing effects is left for future work in the vp rheology energy is dissipated through friction when the ice deforms in shear divergence or any combination of the two in this rheology energy is dissipated even in the case of positive divergence or zero divergence i e pure shear deformation when the internal ice pressure is zero this is in contradiction with coulombic friction describing a granular material such as sea ice where energy is dissipated only when there is a normal force acting across the sliding plane rothrock 1975 note that this is one of the assumptions taken into account in the proposed tear drop yield curve of rothrock 1975 if we consider that the grid cell divergence in the vp model is effectively a mean over a relatively large area then it could be that there is in fact some areas within the grid cell where the normal force is non zero and therefore some frictional dissipation of energy is relevant an example of this would be if we consider a relatively small amount of divergence in the vp model to be associated with dilatation along a sliding line this would imply that there are contact points along the sliding line resulting in a normal force regardless of the net divergence in the larger area however as the divergence increases beyond a threshold associated with the net amount dilatation it is clear that the frictional energy dissipation should rapidly tend towards zero in the vp model the expected decrease in frictional dissipation in divergence will only happen due to the resulting changes to the thickness and concentration field associated with divergence and not due to the sea ice rheology we argue that a careful study into the way these processes are represented in the vp model is of interest in order to improve the physical basis of the model sirven and tremblay 2014 have studied a viscous plastic sea ice model with a mohr coulomb yield curve in a similar domain configuration as the shr domain discussed here they found that applying no slip boundary conditions over constrains the problem such that no unique solution exists while if slip is permitted at the boundary a unique solution can be found analytically we do not find this to be so in the case of the vp rheology rather we find that the no slip boundary conditions result in a sharpening of the velocity gradients near the boundaries as the spatial resolution of the model is increased this results in a net reduction in the frictional energy dissipated in shear and a simulated sea ice drift which approaches the analytical solution as the spatial resolution is increased that said the physicality of no slip boundary conditions at the land ice interface is still the subject of question it is clear that sea ice sliding along a coastline would feel shear stress due to friction with the land however we see no reason to assume that this shear stress induced by the land would lead to zero velocity at the boundary the case where there is a component of the wind forcing directed offshore would in theory reduce the friction felt by the ice and allow increased slip we propose that a more physical boundary condition would be imposed on the internal stress imparted on the ice at the boundary and would allow for divergent motion at the land ice interface how exactly to formulate and apply such a boundary condition for the vp model is left for future work 7 conclusion we have shown that in the vp sea ice model the simulated velocity field depends on the spatial resolution of the model and approaches the analytical solution as the spatial resolution is increased in particular we find that in simulations with identical forcing the mean sea ice drift speed increases by roughly 32 when the spatial resolution of the model is increased from 40 km to 5 km the velocity increase associated with increased spatial resolution is explained by changes to the sea ice energy budget we find that the local frictional energy dissipation in shear increases with spatial resolution however the area where dissipation occurs decreases with increasing resolution resulting in a net reduction in the fraction of input power dissipated by friction in shear at 5 km spatial resolution the fraction of input power dissipated in friction is within 1 of the analytical value the sharpening of the shear dissipation region leads to an increase in the domain total power input by the wind which increases the sea ice drift speed this leads to a further increase in input power from the wind further increasing the sea ice drift speed until the water drag is able to compensate we find that an analogous effect occurs when the shear deformation occurs within the model domain i e far from where the boundary conditions are applied we have shown that in ridging convergence the gradients of thickness and concentration set the velocity gradient in the ridging region we find that the simulated thickness and velocity are not affected by changing the model spatial resolution therefore the net frictional energy dissipation and work done to increase the internal energy in ridging remains effectively constant with spatial resolution we find that the net frictional dissipation in lead opening divergence decreases as spatial resolution is increased the results from this study show that the partitioning of energy dissipated in shear along leads convergence in ridges and through water drag depends on the spatial resolution therefore the mechanical strength parameters of the elliptical yield curve commonly used in the viscous plastic sea ice model p and e should likely be adjusted to compensate for these effects before we can make a precise recommendation as to how to modify the mechanical strength parameters in viscous plastic sea ice model simulations where the number of shear and ridging lead opening features varies must be performed with realistic geometry and forcing fields note that as the spatial resolution increases the number of simulated linear kinematic features lkfs increases e g hutter 2015 and while the integrated frictional dissipation associated with one lkf decreases it remains to be determined whether the net integrated energy dissipated in shear in a more realistic domain with more lkfs could will increase or decrease we argue that careful analysis of the relative importance of the different energy sinks in the vp model is necessary as the spatial resolution of the model is increased the current tendency in the community is to keep the mechanical strength properties of sea ice constant as the resolution is increased we argue that this may have resulted in unintended changes to the simulated sea ice velocity thickness and deformation fields due to the dependence of the energy partitioning on the spatial resolution of the model we intend to further study this effect in the arctic domain with more realistic wind forcing and model geometry where both

24087,we present sea ice kinetic energy budgets to quantify the relative importance of the various energy sinks in a viscous plastic sea ice model to this end we study two idealized model domains where energy dissipation associated with shear and axial ridge lead building deformation can be analyzed independently we find that when only shear deformation is present either at the domain boundary induced by the no slip boundary condition or within the model domain induced by gradients in the surface air stress the energy dissipated through friction reduces in relative importance as the spatial resolution of the model is increased in the limit where the spatial resolution tends to zero the simulated sea ice drift tends to the analytical solution giving us confidence in the numerical implementation of the governing differential equation increasing spatial resolution leads to a localization of deformation along the shear lines effectively increasing the area over which energy is input by the wind which is not compensated for by frictional shear dissipation for instance at 40 km spatial resolution 64 and 29 of the input power is dissipated through shear deformation and water drag respectively while at 5 km spatial resolution 54 and 43 of the input power is dissipated by the respective processes these values approach the respective values of 53 and 47 found analytically for this particular model configuration the overall result is a 64 increase in the domain total sea ice kinetic energy when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km due to the finer representation of shear lines in convergence the mean kinetic energy and potential energy do not depend meaningfully on the spatial resolution in this case the structure of the thickness and concentration fields effectively sets the velocity gradient near the boundary provided that the plastic deformation wave associated with the ridge building process is resolved keywords sea ice arctic numerical modeling rheology 1 introduction the power input by the surface winds into the arctic sea ice cover is the main source of its kinetic energy drift speed in the widely used viscous plastic vp sea ice model of hibler 1979 this energy is largely dissipated by water drag during the summer months during the winter months kinetic energy dissipation due to friction associated with ridging and shear become important as well bouchat and tremblay 2014 for instance pritchard 1981 found that roughly one third of the power input by the surface wind was lost to the ocean in the beaufort sea during winter while the remaining power was assumed to be dissipated by internal ice friction furthermore pritchard 1988 showed that the partitioning of shear and divergent deformation in a plastic model is related to the shape of the yield curve and the associated flow rule used to define the sea ice rheology sea ice deformation dissipates energy through friction in both shear and ridging kinetic energy is also converted to potential energy during ridge building as work must be done to raise the ice against gravity bouchat and tremblay 2014 found that in the vp sea ice model the majority of the power input is transferred to the ocean with approximately 15 of the arctic wide annual power input being dissipated by internal ice mechanics the authors found that of that 15 frictional shear dissipation accounts for roughly 75 of the internal sea ice stress dissipation in march with the frictional ridging dissipation and potential energy increase accounting for 15 and 10 respectively recently spreen et al 2016 showed that in a coupled ice ocean model forced by reanalysis data the magnitude of arctic averaged sea ice deformation rates at a variety of spatial resolutions are approximately 50 lower in the vp model when compared to the radarsat geophysical processor system rgps satellite observations the authors found that there was a 6 increase in the areal mean deformation rate when the spatial resolution was increased from 18 km to 4 5 km this indicates that increasing the spatial resolution leads to better agreement between simulated and observed deformation statistics in this paper we quantify the power input and dissipation in the vp sea ice model as the spatial resolution is increased to this end we study two idealized model domains and forcing fields one where energy is dissipated only in shear and one where energy is dissipated primarily in convergence divergence ridge building or lead opening in these idealized situations we can solve the steady state sea ice momentum equation analytically in the case of pure shear we find that the simulated mean sea ice velocity is far from the analytical solution at coarse spatial resolution 40 km but approaches the analytic solution as the spatial resolution is increased we find that this increase in the sea ice velocity is due to a reduction in the relative importance of frictional energy dissipation in shear compared to water drag dissipation when divergence or convergence is the primary mode of failure the numerical solution does not show a strong dependence on spatial resolution 2 model description the 2 d sea ice momentum balance is given by 1 ρ i h u t ρ i h f z u τ a τ w ρ i h g h d σ where ρi is the density of sea ice h is the grid cell mean sea ice thickness u is the 2 d horizontal sea ice velocity vector f is the coriolis parameter τ a is the surface air stress τ w is the stress imparted on the bottom of the ice by the ocean g is the gravitational acceleration hd is the sea surface dynamic height and σ is the vertically integrated 2 d internal ice stress tensor using quadratic drag laws e g mcphee 1982 the effective surface air and ocean stress acting on the ice τ a and τ w are given by 2 τ a ρ a c d a u a g u a g cos θ a z u a g sin θ a 3 τ w ρ w c d w u u w g u u w g cos θ w z u u w g sin θ w where u a g and u w g are the geostrophic velocities of the atmosphere and ocean θa and θw are the turning angles of the atmosphere and ocean and z is the unit vector normal to the ice surface note that in eq 2 we have assumed that the wind speed is much greater than the sea ice drift speed i e u a g u following hibler 1979 we assume that the sea ice behaves as a viscous plastic vp material with an elliptical yield curve and normal flow rule the internal stress tensor for the vp constitutive law is written as a function of the strain rates ϵ i j and the parameterized ice strength p 4 σ i j 2 η ϵ i j ζ η ϵ k k p 2 δ i j where the strain rates ϵ i j are given by ϵ i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i and δij is the kronecker delta function in a plastic material the bulk and shear viscosities ζ and η follow from the choice of yield curve and flow rule for the vp model of hibler 1979 they are given by 5 ζ p 2 δ 6 η ζ e 2 where δ ϵ 11 ϵ 22 2 ϵ 11 ϵ 22 e 2 2 ϵ 12 e 2 and e is the aspect ratio of the yield curve note that δ can be written as a function of the strain rate invariants as 7 δ ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 where ϵ i is the mean compressive strain rate i e the divergence and ϵ i i is the maximum shear strain rate this notation will prove useful in the limit where δ goes to zero ζ and η tend to infinity in this case we use the regularization of ζ proposed by lemieux and tremblay 2009 8 ζ ζ max tanh p 2 δ ζ max where tanh is the hyperbolic tangent function and ζ max 2 5 10 8 p this regularization allows for the viscous coefficients to vary smoothly with the strain rates as the local stress state transitions from viscous to plastic and vice versa the mass and momentum conservation laws are coupled via the ice strength p 9 p p h exp c 1 a where p is the sea ice compressive strength and c is the sea ice concentration dependence parameter hibler 1979 eq 9 is first used to compute the viscous coefficients ζ and η the replacement pressure method is then used to recalculate the ice strength as p p r 2 δ ζ using ζ from eq 8 note that pr only differs from p as calculated from eq 9 when the ice is in the viscous regime i e grid cells where ζ ζ max hibler and ip 1995 the recalculated ice strength is then used in the constitutive law eq 4 the replacement pressure method insures that the ice does not deform due to gradients in the sea ice thickness or strength in the viscous regime of the model the corollary to this is that the sea ice thickness can go slowly to infinity when the forcing is relatively weak but persistent kimmritz et al 2017 the temporal evolution of h and a are governed by two continuity equations which can be written as 10 h t h u s a 11 a t a u s h where sa and sh are thermodynamic source terms for the sea ice concentration and thickness respectively in the following we consider only dynamic effects s a s h 0 the values of parameters used in this model are defined in table 1 unless otherwise noted in the text 3 kinetic energy equation following bouchat and tremblay 2014 the kinetic energy of the vp sea ice model can be written as 12 k t h u 1 2 ρ u u h t u ρ h u t where k is the local kinetic energy per unit area k 1 2 ρ h u u the term h is associated with changes in inertia due to increasing or decreasing sea ice thickness and therefore mass this term has been shown to be negligible in pan arctic simulations bouchat and tremblay 2014 this is also the case in all simulations presented in the following the term u is associated with changes in inertia due to increasing or decreasing sea ice velocity this term can be decomposed into several terms associated with the various forces acting on the sea ice these terms are defined by taking the dot product of u with the vp momentum eq 1 performing this operation we find 13 u u ρ h u t w o g i where w is the power input by the surface wind stress u τ a o is the power gained or lost to the ocean through drag u τ w g is the rate of work done positive or negative to change the potential energy due to the sea surface slope ρ h g u h d and i is the power dissipated by internal sea ice friction as well as the rate of work required to increase decrease the gravitational potential energy of the ice due to lifting lowering its center of gravity of the ice i is given by u σ g is identically zero in all simulations presented in the following as we will only consider cases with a static i e flat ocean the power associated with internal ice mechanics i can be further decomposed as 14 i i t i p d i d i i where it is the power laterally transferred by internal ice stress propagation given by 15 i t u σ this term can be written as a flux across a boundary by applying the divergence theorem all domains presented in this study have no net flux into or out of the domain since we use periodic boundaries and thus this term is identically zero when integrated over the domain ip is associated with the change of internal energy to mechanical kinetic potential energy due to the redistribution of sea ice mass viscous fluid flow 3e this term is given by 16 i p p 2 ϵ i ip acts as an energy sink when the sea ice motion is convergent and as an energy source when the sea ice motion is divergent in the following we separate ip into i p and i p where the superscript corresponds to the sign of ϵ i di and dii are the energy dissipated through friction by divergence positive or negative and shear respectively they are given by 17 d i ζ ϵ i 2 18 d i i η ϵ i i 2 substituting eqs 5 6 into eqs 17 18 we find 19 d i p ϵ i 2 2 ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 20 d i i p ϵ i i 2 2 e 2 ϵ i 2 e 2 ϵ i i 2 dissipation in divergence or convergence is in general accompanied by changes to the sea ice thickness and concentration which will affect ζ in eq 17 through the dependence on thickness and concentration in the ice strength parameterization eq 9 note that in the case of negligible shear eq 16 and eq 19 will exactly compensate one another when pure shear deformation is present the deformation will not change the sea ice thickness or concentration and thus the sea ice strength will remain constant we will see in the following that this distinction between shear dissipation and tension compression dissipation is important 4 model configuration 4 1 domain we define two idealized domains in order to study the model response to resolution for different modes of mechanical failure shear and tension compression both domains are squares with dimensions of 2000 km by 2000 km the first domain consists of walls at x 0 km and x 2000 km where impermeability and no slip boundary conditions u v 0 are applied periodic boundary conditions ϕ y 0 ϕ y l where ϕ u v h a are applied at the top and bottom of the domain at y 0 km and y 2000 km in this domain the sea ice fails purely in shear this domain is termed shr see fig 1 left panel for a schematic diagram the second domain consists of two vertical edges at x 0 km and x 2000 km where periodic boundary conditions are applied and two horizontal walls at y 0 km and y 2000 km where impermeability and no slip boundary conditions are applied in this configuration the axial strain rate is maximum in the y direction and 0 in the x direction this implies that shear is present along planes that are angled with respect to the domain boundaries from mohr s circle we will see in the following that most of the dissipation is associated with ridging as opposed to shear in this model configuration this domain is termed cmp see fig 1 right panel for a schematic diagram in all simulations ocean points have ice thickness and concentration equal to 3 m and 100 at the beginning of the simulations the initial ice velocity is u v 0 m s everywhere in the domain 4 2 forcing in both the shr and cmp domains the model is forced with spatially and temporally uniform southward winds for the shr simulations the magnitude of the wind forcing is 5 m s unless otherwise noted in the text this provides sufficient wind stress to cause shear failure at the land ice interface for the cmp simulations the magnitude of the wind forcing is 8 m s this leads to an integrated surface stress which exceeds the sea ice compressive strength at the southern edge of the domain and therefore ridging will take place in the following we set the coriolis parameter and the air and water turning angles to zero this is done in order to have the surface wind stress act only in the y direction for simplicity 4 3 numerical scheme in all model simulations the momentum equation eq 1 is solved numerically using the jacobian free newton krylov jfnk method lemieux et al 2010 the jfnk solver is iterated for each model timestep until the root mean square velocity error in the domain is less than 10 3 cm s the advective timestep of the model is 10 minutes note that the implicit explicit imex method as described in lemieux et al 2014 is used for coupling the momentum equation to the mass and concentration equations eq 1 eqs 10 and 11 this insures that the plastic wave in the cmp experiment is resolved for all model spatial resolutions williams et al 2017 5 results 5 1 shr experiment 5 1 1 analytical solution in the shr domain with no forcing in the x direction the ice will deform purely in shear we assume zero horizontal velocity due to symmetry and no structure of the solution in the y direction due to periodic boundary conditions note that these assumptions are confirmed by the numerical simulations presented in the following section furthermore assuming a static ocean the momentum eq 1 simplifies to 21 ρ h v t τ w y τ a y x σ 12 where v is the sea ice velocity in the y direction and σ 12 is the shear stress the thickness and concentration remain constant in time since the flow is non divergent we seek the domain averaged steady state sea ice drift speed in the along wind direction to this end we set the time derivative term equal to zero and we integrate the v momentum eq 21 in the x direction see fig 1 for a schematic of the domain performing this operation we find 22 0 0 l c d w ρ w v 2 c d a ρ a v a 2 x σ 12 d x where l is the length of the domain in the x direction and va is the wind speed integrating eq 22 yields 23 0 c d w ρ w v 2 l c d a ρ a v a 2 l σ 12 x l σ 12 x 0 the shear stress at the boundaries is known from the yield curve assuming the deformation at the wall is plastic and non divergent i e purely shear in the case of the vp rheology and forcing in the negative y direction σ 12 can be written from eq 4 as 24 σ 12 p 2 e x 0 p 2 e x l substituting eq 24 into the integrated momentum eq 23 we find 25 0 c d w ρ w v 2 l c d a ρ a v a 2 l p e or after isolating the speed of the ice 26 v c d a ρ a v a 2 c d w ρ w p l ρ w c d w e the first term of the solution is the free drift speed the second term is a correction that is linearly related to the shear stress at the wall p 2 e for the shr domain and forcing outlined above and using the parameter values listed in table 1 we find v 5 7 cm s where we have chosen the negative root because of the direction of the wind forcing note that from the ratios of the terms in eq 25 we see that 53 of input wind power is dissipated by the plastic shear deformation while 47 is lost through ocean drag for this particular domain configuration when the second term under the radical exceeds the first the assumption of plasticity breaks down i e eq 24 is no longer valid 5 1 2 numerical solution the simulated ice velocity field in the shr experiment is characterized by two sharp shear lines along the walls with a rapid transition to a center channel drift speed which is a function of the model spatial resolution the sharpness of the sea ice velocity gradient depends on the spatial resolution of the model simulation in particular we see an increasing localization of energy dissipated in plastic shear along the wall as the spatial resolution of the model is increased fig 2 the width of the region with non zero shear dissipation dii decreases from approximately 160 km at 40 km resolution to approximately 20 km at 5 km resolution this indicates that the number of grid cells needed to resolve the shear line is roughly constant regardless of the spatial resolution of the mode in other words the shear friction between the ice and the wall induces a sharper gradient in sea ice velocity as the spatial resolution is increased this is in line with results from bouchat and tremblay 2014 who found that the area of sea ice undergoing plastic deformation decreases as the spatial resolution increases in a pan arctic model due to the sharpening of deformation features the reduction in area over which plastic deformation takes place counteracts the local increase in energy dissipation in shear as the resolution of the model is increased the net effect is that the domain integrated power dissipated in shear decreases with respect to the input power as the spatial resolution increases we find that 64 of the total power input by the wind is dissipated by friction associated with shear dii at 40 km resolution while 54 of the total power input is dissipated by friction associated with shear dii at 5 km resolution table 2 this is in agreement with the analytical solution where 53 of the input energy being dissipated though plastic shear deformation there is a corresponding increase in the area of undeformed ice in the interior of the channel fig 3 this results in an increased domain integrated sea ice velocity this effect is compounded by the fact that the power input by the wind depends directly on the sea ice drift speed see eq 13 we find that the frictional dissipation of energy in shear does not compensate for the increased power input by the wind and thus the kinetic energy of the sea ice increases the resulting effect is that the sea ice velocity in the center of the channel increases by approximately 32 when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km fig 3 this increase in the mean drift speed in the channel is roughly linear with spatial resolution with the simulated mean drift speed approaching the analytical solution presented above as the spatial resolution tends to zero the increased power input by the wind is dissipated by water drag we find that the percentage of the total power input by the wind which is dissipated by water drag increases from roughly 29 to 43 when the spatial resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km table 2 we see that increasing the resolution brings the percentage of energy lost through ocean drag closer to that of the analytical solution 47 note that the energy budget shows 4 larger error at 40 km resolution compared to 5 km we attribute this difference in error to the smoothing of the strain rate required to calculate the energy budget at the center of the grid cells in the simulation presented above the shear failure is induced because of our choice of boundary conditions i e no slip below we verify that the conclusions still holds if the shear failure occurs within the model domain i e when it is resolved by the model physics we find that the effect of increasing spatial resolution on the relative importance of water drag and shear friction in terms of energy dissipation is also observed when the deformation occurs within the domain interior and with periodic boundary conditions applied in both the x and y directions to exemplify this point we modify the wind forcing to be 27 v a 10 m s 0 x l 4 10 m s l 4 x 3 l 4 10 m s 3 l 4 x l the magnitude of the wind speed has been increased to 10 m s in order to ensure plastic behavior without the application of no slip boundary conditions in this case the fraction of the input energy dissipated by shear friction decreases by 11 when the resolution is increased from 40 km to 5 km again there is an increase in the sea ice drift speed in the center of the domain of 26 fig 4 which leads to an increase in the relative importance of water drag dissipation this is analogous to the shr domain simulations described above and implies that the boundary conditions are not directly the cause of the dependence on the spatial resolution of the model described here note that shear line is resolved in roughly 5 grid cells regardless of the spatial resolution of the model 5 2 cmp experiment 5 2 1 analysis in the cmp domain with no forcing in the x direction we assume the x component of the velocity to be zero due to symmetry the ocean is assumed to be at rest furthermore we assume no dependence on the x direction due to the periodic boundary conditions the relevant momentum equation in this case is 28 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y y σ 22 substituting in the constitutive law eq 4 we find 29 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y y ζ η v y 1 2 p y the thickness and concentration equations for this case are 30 h t v h y h v y 0 31 a t v a y a v y 0 we can simplify the bulk and shear viscosity which appear in the v momentum equation as 32 ζ η p 2 1 e 2 v y substituting this expression into the v momentum eq 29 we find 33 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y 1 2 p y 1 e 2 1 where the sign of the radical term is determined by the sign of v y substituting the sea ice strength parameterization eq 9 into the v momentum equation this becomes 34 ρ h v t c d w ρ w v 2 τ a y λ h y c h a y where λ p 2 1 e 2 1 exp c 1 a we see that the velocity gradient in the y direction is effectively set by the gradient in thickness and concentration in other words there is a length scale in the vp model associated with ridge building which is set by the speed of plastic waves and the time over which it has propagated williams et al 2017 in this case the steady state solution is only reached when the thickness of the ice no longer increases neglecting viscous creep at that point the ice thickness gradient will be able to resist the wind forcing and the ice velocity will go to zero the steady state thickness profile can then be found by setting the inertia and water drag terms in eq 34 to zero and integrating in the y direction we do not perform this operation here as we are interested in the energy budget in the case when the inertial term is small but not when the ice is at rest 5 2 2 cmp numerical solution after 6 hrs of forcing the sea ice velocity changes by less than 0 001 cm s over each 10 minute timestep we therefore consider the numerical solution to be effectively in steady state although the thickness field is still slowly evolving the simulated sea ice velocity field in the cmp domain is characterized by southward flow which slows rapidly to zero in the vicinity of the southern wall where the ridge is forming the velocity field is constant in the x direction and the horizontal velocity is effectively zero everywhere by symmetry due to the periodic boundary condition the ice diverges from the top wall creating a sharp velocity gradient which reduces the local ice thickness and concentration at the southern boundary a ridge forms as the ice converges at 5 10 and 20 km resolution the ridge extends 60 km north of the wall while at 40 km resolution it extends 80 km this is due to the spatial discretization and not due to changes in the speed of propagation of the plastic wave with resolution williams et al 2017 we find that the percentage of the input power dissipated by friction associated with ridging d i remains constant at 20 for all spatial resolutions table 3 this can also be seen by integrating d i in the y direction fig 5 the integrated dissipation increases rapidly in the ridging zone and then remains constant as we move away from the southern wall for all spatial resolutions the fact that frictional dissipation d i does not largely change with resolution is in contrast to the results from the shr domain where there was a decrease in frictional shear dissipation dii as the spatial resolution was increased in the cmp experiment the mean speed of the ice remains constant to within 1 at all spatial resolutions it follows that the energy input by wind and the energy dissipation due to water drag remain constant as well with respect to resolution table 3 note that the ridge that forms along the southern wall contains the same volume of ice irrespective of the spatial resolution at all resolutions the lead opening at the top of the domain is confined to one single grid cell this is because divergence is only present in the first open water grid cell adjacent to the wall note that this divergence is due to the choice of boundary conditions which imply that deformation is required for sea ice drift away from the boundary whether this boundary condition commonly used in the sea ice modelling community is physical or not in the case of offshore velocity is an open question see for instance sirven and tremblay 2014 we discuss this in more detail in the following section we find that there is a decrease in conversion of internal energy to mechanical energy due to divergence i p as the resolution is increased in fact the internal energy decrease due to divergence is 8 of the input power by the wind at 40 km resolution in this case the energy change i p and the power dissipated in friction in tension compression d i are identical apart from a difference in sign assuming no shear see eq 16 20 at 5 km resolution both the internal energy decrease due to divergence i p and the frictional energy dissipated in divergence d i are negligible 6 discussion in the case of pure shear in the vp model the width of the lead where dissipation is present scales as δx indicating no inherent length scale below which the numerical solution is independent of the model spatial resolution this is an undesirable feature since there should be in principle a non zero characteristic length scale associated with the important physical processes in the model in geophysical sea ice shear deformation is typically accompanied by dilatation divergence associated with the opening or closing of leads due to the complex geometry of the ice floes overland and pease 1988 tremblay and mysak 1997 stern and moritz 2002 found from studies of satellite observations that there is non negligible divergence during shear events this dilatation gives an inherent length scale to the width of a shear line which is lacking in the vp rheology this process can be accounted for naturally by treating sea ice as a granular material and expressing the macroscopic coefficient of friction in terms of the friction between floes with a mean angle of orientation of contact normals tremblay and mysak 1997 we have shown here in idealized simulations that in shear failure the frictional energy dissipation depends on the spatial resolution and results in first order changes to the simulated velocity field in other words the relative importance of internal sea ice dissipation to water drag dissipation depends on the spatial resolution of the model losch et al 2010 found that opting for free slip instead of no slip boundary conditions effectively increased the sea ice drift speed by up to 2 cm s and thus the sea ice kinetic energy in coastal regions this is in line with what we have presented above as free slip boundary conditions eliminate the shear energy dissipation due to friction with the coastline hutter 2015 showed that in some cases the number of shear lines also increases as the spatial resolution increases this may provide a counter effect to the decreased importance of shear dissipation noted in out studies with a constant number of shear lines a detailed analysis of these two competing effects is left for future work in the vp rheology energy is dissipated through friction when the ice deforms in shear divergence or any combination of the two in this rheology energy is dissipated even in the case of positive divergence or zero divergence i e pure shear deformation when the internal ice pressure is zero this is in contradiction with coulombic friction describing a granular material such as sea ice where energy is dissipated only when there is a normal force acting across the sliding plane rothrock 1975 note that this is one of the assumptions taken into account in the proposed tear drop yield curve of rothrock 1975 if we consider that the grid cell divergence in the vp model is effectively a mean over a relatively large area then it could be that there is in fact some areas within the grid cell where the normal force is non zero and therefore some frictional dissipation of energy is relevant an example of this would be if we consider a relatively small amount of divergence in the vp model to be associated with dilatation along a sliding line this would imply that there are contact points along the sliding line resulting in a normal force regardless of the net divergence in the larger area however as the divergence increases beyond a threshold associated with the net amount dilatation it is clear that the frictional energy dissipation should rapidly tend towards zero in the vp model the expected decrease in frictional dissipation in divergence will only happen due to the resulting changes to the thickness and concentration field associated with divergence and not due to the sea ice rheology we argue that a careful study into the way these processes are represented in the vp model is of interest in order to improve the physical basis of the model sirven and tremblay 2014 have studied a viscous plastic sea ice model with a mohr coulomb yield curve in a similar domain configuration as the shr domain discussed here they found that applying no slip boundary conditions over constrains the problem such that no unique solution exists while if slip is permitted at the boundary a unique solution can be found analytically we do not find this to be so in the case of the vp rheology rather we find that the no slip boundary conditions result in a sharpening of the velocity gradients near the boundaries as the spatial resolution of the model is increased this results in a net reduction in the frictional energy dissipated in shear and a simulated sea ice drift which approaches the analytical solution as the spatial resolution is increased that said the physicality of no slip boundary conditions at the land ice interface is still the subject of question it is clear that sea ice sliding along a coastline would feel shear stress due to friction with the land however we see no reason to assume that this shear stress induced by the land would lead to zero velocity at the boundary the case where there is a component of the wind forcing directed offshore would in theory reduce the friction felt by the ice and allow increased slip we propose that a more physical boundary condition would be imposed on the internal stress imparted on the ice at the boundary and would allow for divergent motion at the land ice interface how exactly to formulate and apply such a boundary condition for the vp model is left for future work 7 conclusion we have shown that in the vp sea ice model the simulated velocity field depends on the spatial resolution of the model and approaches the analytical solution as the spatial resolution is increased in particular we find that in simulations with identical forcing the mean sea ice drift speed increases by roughly 32 when the spatial resolution of the model is increased from 40 km to 5 km the velocity increase associated with increased spatial resolution is explained by changes to the sea ice energy budget we find that the local frictional energy dissipation in shear increases with spatial resolution however the area where dissipation occurs decreases with increasing resolution resulting in a net reduction in the fraction of input power dissipated by friction in shear at 5 km spatial resolution the fraction of input power dissipated in friction is within 1 of the analytical value the sharpening of the shear dissipation region leads to an increase in the domain total power input by the wind which increases the sea ice drift speed this leads to a further increase in input power from the wind further increasing the sea ice drift speed until the water drag is able to compensate we find that an analogous effect occurs when the shear deformation occurs within the model domain i e far from where the boundary conditions are applied we have shown that in ridging convergence the gradients of thickness and concentration set the velocity gradient in the ridging region we find that the simulated thickness and velocity are not affected by changing the model spatial resolution therefore the net frictional energy dissipation and work done to increase the internal energy in ridging remains effectively constant with spatial resolution we find that the net frictional dissipation in lead opening divergence decreases as spatial resolution is increased the results from this study show that the partitioning of energy dissipated in shear along leads convergence in ridges and through water drag depends on the spatial resolution therefore the mechanical strength parameters of the elliptical yield curve commonly used in the viscous plastic sea ice model p and e should likely be adjusted to compensate for these effects before we can make a precise recommendation as to how to modify the mechanical strength parameters in viscous plastic sea ice model simulations where the number of shear and ridging lead opening features varies must be performed with realistic geometry and forcing fields note that as the spatial resolution increases the number of simulated linear kinematic features lkfs increases e g hutter 2015 and while the integrated frictional dissipation associated with one lkf decreases it remains to be determined whether the net integrated energy dissipated in shear in a more realistic domain with more lkfs could will increase or decrease we argue that careful analysis of the relative importance of the different energy sinks in the vp model is necessary as the spatial resolution of the model is increased the current tendency in the community is to keep the mechanical strength properties of sea ice constant as the resolution is increased we argue that this may have resulted in unintended changes to the simulated sea ice velocity thickness and deformation fields due to the dependence of the energy partitioning on the spatial resolution of the model we intend to further study this effect in the arctic domain with more realistic wind forcing and model geometry where both

24088,spatial extremes assessment of geophysical variables represents a complex field largely because of the great variety of existing methodologies employed at different complexity levels generally making use of multivariate techniques this manuscript investigates the feasibility of a different approach namely regional frequency analysis rfa consisting into dividing the area of study into homogeneous regions whose normalized data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques rfa is employed to analyse the spatial assessment of extreme significant wave heights within the north east atlantic ocean this expanse provides the physical basis for the determination of homogeneous regions identified by means of typical storm footprints which allow the clustering of similar extreme events furthermore a spatio temporal criterion for storm tracking is implemented and incorporated into the analysis since it is assumed that extreme marine events on a basin scale may be influenced by the same low pressure systems following similar trajectories a 23 year wave hindcast database at high spatial resolution provided by the wwiii model on unstructured mesh grid covering the celtic sea the english channel and the bay of biscay was employed to perform the analysis due to the large size of the dataset more than 110 000 spatial locations a limited number of points were selected either uniformly or guided by the bathymetry in both situations rfa proves effective in clustering homogeneous regions physically and statistically its reliability is based on the varying impact of major meteorological events on different areas at different scales the spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights achieved by means of rfa are consistent with results of a pointwise model with findings generally more smoothed in proximity to steep gradients and when ranging from offshore to coastal areas the adoption of a spatio temporal declustering allows more detailed wave patterns to be reproduced on a smaller spatial scale especially in the vicinity of channel systems effects of swell are also described accurately keywords regional frequency analysis spatial extremes extreme waves storm footprints 1 introduction spatial extremes analysis is usually employed for mapping spatial return level estimates taking into account possible spatial dependencies in their entirety within this complex framework multivariate techniques are largely employed pickands 1981 haan 1984 cooley et al 2007 buishand et al 2008 padoan et al 2010 padoan 2013 davison et al 2012 shaby and reich 2012 fuentes et al 2013 among which copula approaches de waal and van gelder 2005 jane et al 2016 on the contrary simplified approaches based on the processing of spatial information to extrapolate a local response for return level estimates are sometimes proposed avoiding the adoption of multivariate technique as performed by buishand et al 2008 blanchet and lehning 2010 jonathan and ewans 2011 and sartini et al 2017 where a spatial maximum likelihood estimate is developed in order to define a possible spatial control law governing local extremes parameters on the basis of suitable covariates in blanchet and lehning 2010 a smoothing generalized extreme value gev model incorporating spatial covariates is applied for mapping spatial return estimates of snow depths another approach is provided by padoan et al 2010 where a composite likelihood approach is applied on extreme precipitation levels for fitting max stable processes in carreau and girard 2011 a different approach based on the development of a weighted likelihood function applied for analysing both synthetic and empirical rainfall data in the french mediterranean region is described another interesting example describing an application for extreme sea states analysis is provided by yu et al 2014 with incorporation of multiple covariates in a model developed in such a way as to couple gev parameters across the spatio directional domain through a gaussian graphical three dimensional thin membrane model another kind of approach called regional frequency analysis rfa dalrymple 1960 divides the area of study into homogeneous zones whose normalized data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques this study focuses on the latter approach rfa has been largely used in the framework of hydrology and for flooding studies bradley 1998 burn 1990 cunnane 1988 merz and blöschl 2005 chebana and ouarda 2008 2009 other works are focused on the study of suspended sediments tramblay et al 2010 while only a few contributions with specific focus on marine environment are available such as the works of bardet et al 2011 bernardara et al 2011 weiss and bernardara 2013 and andreewsky et al 2017 wherein regional frequency analysis is performed on modelling extreme storm surges and those developed by van gelder et al 2000 hosking 2012 weiss et al 2014a and weiss et al 2014b applied to extreme waves more recently rfa was carried out on a 44 y wave hindcast database to estimate regional extreme significant wave heights on different locations of the offshore portugal by lucas et al 2017 the present work is based on the application of rfa on extreme significant wave heights following the approach proposed by weiss et al 2014a and developed on the basis of the work of van gelder and neykov 1998 where a statistically homogeneity criterion is presumed valid on the basis of physical homogeneity more precisely homogeneous regions are identified by means of typical storm footprints since these areas are expected to be impacted similarly by the same extreme events since methodologies as well as the selection criterion for grouping regions as homogeneous can strongly influence results different approaches have been implemented and proposed for instance alila 1999 renard 2011 and chérif and bargaoui 2013 use a hierarchical approach for clustering data while in satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 and gabriele and chiaravalloti 2013 meteorological information is exploited for defining homogeneous regions in wang et al 2014 spatial dependence is incorporated into rfa by means of a max stable process otherwise a principal component analysis based on appropriate covariates can be used for defining area selection criterion similarly to morin et al 1979 the present study moves in the framework proposed by weiss et al 2014a to analyse extreme significant wave heights over a very detailed area of the french atlantic coast covering the english channel and the bay of biscay making use of a 23 y wave hindcast database on unstructured mesh at very high resolution moreover we propose to address three research questions 1 what is the reliability of rfa clustering this issue is addressed by comparing rfa results with the ones of a pointwise analysis of extreme waves on the area at the same resolution the question of the impact of using annual or monthly maxima is then explored furthermore this comparative exercise is also useful to identify and to discuss critically the physical processes underlying the formation of rfa induced homogeneous regions 2 what is the feasibility of rfa application on a unstructured very high resolution dataset 110 000 points over the whole channel biscay area rfa is known to be computationally intensive and we propose to alleviate this burden by selecting a limited number of points either via a uniform selection over space homogeneous mesh strategy or by guiding the selection using a physical criterion unstructured mesh strategy 3 what is the sensitivity of rfa method in relation to the choice of declustering criterion this criterion is one of the methods major pillars since it constrains the selection of storm footprints we tested the robustness of the findings of question 1 in relation to this choice by using either a full spatiotemporal or a purely temporal criterion the manuscript is organized as follows first a description of the wave hindcast database and statistical models is provided in section 2 then results achieved with rfa are discussed and compared in section 3 with those provided by means of a point wise approach on the basis of the main geophysical processes affecting the area of study finally some comments and conclusions are offered in section 4 2 models and data 2 1 wave hindcast data the 23 y wave hindcast database homere boudière et al 2013 has been employed to develop the analysis homere is a sea states hindcast database based on wavewatch iii model version 4 11 running over an unstructured mesh fig 1 a covering the english channel and bay of biscay ngug over the temporal span 1994 2016 the data set includes 37 global parameters as well as frequency spectra on a very high resolution grid 110 000 points together with directional spectra on a high resolution grid covering more than 4000 points with an hourly time step more details on parameterisation forcing and hindcast validation assessed by means of i n s i t u measurements from directional buoys remote sensing from satellite altimeters and output from the noaa ncep configuration of ww3 are available in boudière et al 2013 a map of bathymetry is reported in fig 1 b together with the spatial distribution of maximum significant wave height values achieved for each grid point during the entire period of simulation fig 1 c 2 2 the pointwise model rfa was preceded by a point by point generalized extreme value gev analysis coles 2001 developed on different blocks of significant wave heights maxima annual and monthly maxima the aim is not only to provide a basis for comparing rfa results with the ones achieved by means of a pointwise extreme analysis developed on the area at the same resolution but also to discuss the physical processes responsible for the formation of rfa homogeneous regions moreover the impact of using annual or monthly maxima extracted considering both omnidirectional and dominant seas is explored with the purpose of extracting as much information as possible about the assessment of wave spatial fields as well as for setting up rfa properly e g for selecting an optimal number of extreme events 2 3 eofs analysis empirical orthogonal functions eofs analysis is applied on significant wave heights fields covering the entire area of study it extracts most pertinent information by reducing dimensionality of a large dataset retaining as much variability as possible on the basis of explained variance consequently it may be regarded as a further indicator of spatial assessment of the most severe sea storms associated with intense meteorological events 2 4 regional frequency analysis rfa was carried out on the homere database following the method implemented by weiss et al 2014b where the criterion at the base of the formation of homogeneous regions is physically defined in this way statistical homogeneity is guaranteed by physical criteria following the approach suggested by van gelder and neykov 1998 more precisely the basic idea is to identify typical storm footprints in order to cluster regions as homogeneous defined as being impacted by the same extreme events clearly some simplifications must be adopted for defining regions on the basis of storm footprints the requirement of physical homogeneity is met if storms impacting sites found in a given region can be assumed to remain confined within the region which they are affecting this is reasonably assumed since this work is developed on a synoptic scale on the other hand the complexity of the study area suggests a possible overlapping and crossing of meteorological processes more detailed on a meso scale further enhanced by the peculiar topography of the coastline furthermore since it may be assumed that extreme marine events on a basin scale are influenced by the same perturbations acting on the areas covering similar instants and directions a spatio temporal criterion for tracking marine storms is implemented and incorporated into the analysis a selection of points extracted from the original database was used to perform the analysis for two main reasons first rfa performed on the whole dataset implies prohibitive computational costs since it is based on the full dataset rather than on maxima samples as with traditional techniques e g gev or pot thus since it relies on the full dataset 110 000 points 166 000 temporal instants some issues related to memory limit can arise subsequently a good rfa requires that observations at different sites be independent since a same storm is expected to impact several sites the spatial resolution of the wave hindcast dataset is too high for this requirement to be satisfied as a consequence a procedure of storms extraction was developed in order to select independent events in both space and time see the following paragraph extraction of storms in this way the procedure of extraction is applied in relation to storm spatiotemporal propagation in order to guarantee a proper detection of these physical events moreover this prevented analysis from being too computationally expensive safeguarding however the guarantee of independence between sites a map of the extremal index leadbetter 1983 smith and weissman 1994 calculated on these series is reported in fig 2 which shows a weak dependence between sites more pronounced in coastal areas as expected on the other hand since the extracted points should be representative enough concerning different extreme events propagating in space and time the procedure of extraction of points could possibly influence results rfa approaches the question of return levels assessment through the following main steps extraction of storms as demonstrated by weiss et al 2014b storms are here classified and characterized by means of a corresponding marine variable since a storm is defined as a physical event able to generate marine extremes it was established to measure significant wave heights thus for a given site the definition of an extreme event arises directly from a specific threshold being exceeded here selected as a defined quantile computed from the complete time series of significant wave heights the spatiotemporal declustering procedure considers storms to be systems propagating both in space and time wherein extremes are considered spatiotemporal neighbours therefore belonging to the same storm if they occur within δ hours and they are localized among the η nearest associated phenomena more precisely the algorithm performs a first spatial clustering collecting sites neighbours in space impacted by the same storm each site is connected to its η nearest neighbours in a graph structure sites not impacted by the same storm are removed from the graph connections then the remaining connections are subjected to a new spatial clustering until marked spatial clusters are identified as spatiotemporal neighbours if at least one site in each cluster is among the η nearest neighbours occurring within δ hours of any site in that cluster finally these spatiotemporal neighbours are merged as spatial clusters since they are presumed to belong to the same storm it must be emphasized that the selection of parameters p δ η where p is the p quantile of the temporal series chosen for threshold selection for the extraction of storms can guarantee a proper detection of physical events which can also strongly influence results for instance choosing too low a value of p with too high a δ could lead to the merging of different storms while too high a p and low an η could lead to the separation of associated events clearly the problem is reduced to p δ in case of a simpler temporal declustering fig 3 shows the area of study impacted by different storms acting at various spatial scales formation of homogeneous regions once storm footprints impacting an area have been identified and once sites are clustered in such a way that they belong to the impact area of a typical storm the objective becomes that of defining homogeneous regions on the basis of a storm propagation criterion if the probability p i j that both sites i and j are impacted by a given storm is defined as 1 p i j p z s i 1 z s j 1 z s i z s j 1 where z s i is the bernoulli variable equal to 1 if site i is impacted by the storm s among s storms impacting the area a dissimilarity index estimated for each possible pair of sites can be defined as 2 d i j 1 p i j thus regions are grouped according to their similarity expressed in terms of 2 where d i j 0 means that a storm impacting a site necessarily affects the other while d i j 1 means the opposite in particular ward s hierarchical clustering algorithm ward 1963 is applied as an agglomeration hierarchical method where each site is initially assigned to its own region and the closest pair of regions is merged until only one region remains once the whole study area is partitioned into r regions an optimal number of them should be set on the basis of the goodness of the clustering procedure the approach here used is twofold firstly mojena s stopping rule method mojena 1977 is employed to get an initial idea of the dissimilarity between clusters such defined as the level at which the hierarchy exhibits a significant jump in dendrogram heights later the individuation of possible breaks in the evolution of standardized dendrogram heights in function of the number of clusters is used as a method of confirmation or optimization preparation of samples for statistical analysis once the physical extraction of storms has been performed by imposing a physical threshold the statistical sample is selected by adopting a second statistical threshold defined in terms of traditional univariate techniques and thus affected by the well known issues related to its definition sartini et al 2015b note that the adoption of a double threshold represents a further guarantee of independence between samples threshold selection is a critical issue widely discussed which requires a sound balance between variability and bias in this study since observations from several sites are used we focus only on the most extreme events setting properly the value of the average number of extreme events per year in such a way that only two extreme events per month so 24 storms per year may be considered as a good compromise between sample size and stochastic independence between maxima verification of statistical homogeneity in regions once physically homogeneous regions have been defined they should satisfy the requirement of statistical homogeneity as well here the criterion proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 based on the individuation of discordant sites in a given region in terms of l moments is used a certain level of tolerance in the dispersion between sites is allowed considering the degree of statistical homogeneity within a given region an automatic procedure for the achievement of the requirement of statistical homogeneity was implemented for each region the hosking and wallis test hosking and wallis 1993 was performed identifying and automatically removing discordant sites until convergence was achieved extreme values analysis excesses of significant wave heights are modelled by means of a non stationary generalized pareto distribution gpd sartini et al 2015a avoiding the use of any covariate so as not to influence the analysis by adding information regarding possible spatial dependences terms related to long term trends are here neglected since a 23 y sample is not considered large enough to be representative of long term processes the choice of adopting a non stationary model was determined by to the better values achieved by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 achieved with respect to the traditional approach furthermore the time varying model allows the formulation of an initial insight into the different seasonality levels exhibited in the area the problem is posed as xi gpd ui γi k where xi are the excesses from the statistical threshold ui at site i γi is the local scale parameter and the shape parameter k is constant over the whole region since statistical homogeneity is ensured observations from sites in a given region are expected to follow the same regional probability distribution with specific behaviours at sites governed by a local index representing the local specificities of a site often chosen as the mean value of observations registered here it is defined as the storm statistical threshold ui on site observations are normalized with respect to the local index and the distribution of normalized variable is presumed to be independent of the site according to the regional homogeneity hypothesis following hosking and wallis 1993 the two regional parameters γ k can be estimated by means of the regional l moment method 3 k 2 λ 1 r 1 λ 2 r γ 1 k λ 1 r 1 where the regional sample r order l moment λ r r is defined as 4 λ r r i 1 n n i λ r i u i i 1 n n i where λ r i is the sample r order l moment for site i 1 n and ni the sample size finally for each site i long term return levels are achieved re scaling the estimates by the local index as normalized variables were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme wave analysis on homere database a point by point gev analysis has been developed using different selections of block maxima 3 1 1 gev on monthly maxima omnidirectional seas first a gev analysis using time blocks corresponding to months was performed significant wave heights maxima were extracted for each time block considering waves coming from all directions the spatial distribution of mean direction extracted associated to absolute maxima fig 4 a reveals that the most severe regimes come from the north west in particular the damping effects triggered by the bathymetry shelf are clearly visible with abrupt changes of directions while the local distribution of direction close to the coastal areas of bay of biscay seems to suggest the rotation of wave fronts as an effect of the orientation of coastline which can turn into a superimposition of different sea states a similar consideration can be made concerning waves propagating within channel areas suggesting that possible wave dynamics processes may be active on a mesoscale results related to gev analysis performed on monthly maxima are reported in fig 5 more precisely results reveal quite a smoothed spatial distribution for both location and scale parameters fig 5 a and b while shape parameters fig c exhibit more diversified behaviour on a spatial scale weakly positive values of shape parameters attributable to a fréchet distribution are registered in coastal areas as well as in the southern areas of the bay of biscay close to spain and in proximity of the western part of the celtic sea an abrupt change to negative values can be observed in proximity of transition regions of bathymetry as along the armorican shelf and the armorican margin a weibull behaviour is also found in the english channel and in the northern part of the celtic sea close to ireland the various arrangements of shape parameter are probably linked to the different statistical distributions whose tails falling off as a polynomial decreasing exponentially and finite tails differ by sea type e g open or coastal seas swell and bimodal seas return levels achieved for significant wave heights related to a return period of 200 years fig 5 d clearly reflect the spatial distribution of such parameters in particular of the shape parameter with higher return level estimates registered in the western offshore area of the celtic sea as expected the effect of abrupt changes of bathymetry steepness in proximity to the armorican shelf and the armorican margin is also clearly visible it is interesting to note that the effect of the continental slope is much more pronounced on the 200 y return value than on the global maxima this effect is clearly visible with regard to the shape parameter where abruptly changing from positive to negative values 3 1 2 gev on monthly maxima dominant seas following gev analysis on monthly maxima extracted from omnidirectional seas the same analysis was performed on monthly maxima extracted from dominant seas such defined as those sectors which generate the most energy more precisely for each grid node the dominant mean direction has been fixed whereon a sector of 60 has been centred for defining the range of directions used for the extraction of maxima the extent of exposure was defined on the basis of on average values of directional spreading and of directional spectra so as to be representative enough due to the oceanic nature of the waves for this area the spatial distribution of mean directions associated with absolute significant wave height maxima reveals something different fig 4 b when compared with the previous one fig 4 a while the mean direction related to the most severe storms in the western celtic sea is associated with events coming from the north west as expected here the refraction effect performed by the bathymetry shelf is more evident with a marked projection of a sort of shadow cone together with the rotation of wave fronts as can be observed near the coastal areas close to the armorican shelf and in the southern region of the bay of biscay this behaviour suggests the presence of different kinds of crossing sea states furthermore a more detailed distribution on a lower spatial scale is registered within the english channel and in the southern north sea close to the netherlands finally directions associated with sea states belonging to the northern celtic sea seem to be more westward than the ones registered with the omnidirectional seas as a consequence of the different typology of maxima extracted the parameters of gev analysis developed on fig 6 are quite different from those previously discussed fig 5 while the distribution of the location parameters maintains its smoothed character fig 6 a the scale parameter seems to be more diversified in the western part of the celtic sea close to the north atlantic ocean fig 6 b similarly the shape parameter fig 6 c reveals a planar assessment more detailed on a lower spatial scale especially in the western and central areas of the celtic sea together with a major extension of the area in which the fréchet cut falls the bathymetry shelf effect is enhanced in proximity to the armorican shelf and to the armorican margin with marked weibull behaviour as a consequence the 200 y return levels of significant wave heights fig 6 d seem to be more diversified on a spatial scale especially in the western areas while the bathymetry effect is more marked 3 1 3 gev on annual maxima finally for the sake of completeness gev analysis on annual maxima of significant wave heights was carried out in order to test the impact of dataset length on the quality of results since simulations performed by wwiii cover a temporal axis of 23 years a database of similar dimensions was extracted for each location results achieved for gev parameters reveal something interesting fig 7 while the spatial assessment of location parameter is fully in agreement with those provided in the previous cases therefore data for location parameters are not reported here the distribution of scale fig 7 a and shape parameters fig 7 b reveal a greater spatial variability in the planar distribution of scale parameters some marked areas can be observed which are characterized by higher values placed at the sides of the continental margin as well as in the northern part of the celtic sea and at the entrance to the english channel also shape parameters exhibit a similar but complementary behaviour in that regions associated with higher values of scale parameters correspond to lower values of shape ones as a consequence marked weibull behaviour is associated with the above mentioned regions characterized by higher values of scale parameters while a fréchet distribution is found in proximity to the eastern part of the bay of biscay close to the aquitaine shelf and in western areas of the celtic sea close to the gollum channel system and between the celtic shelf and the celtic margin since return levels of significant wave heights associated with those gev parameters are quite unreliable when compared to results provided by gev analyses previously carried out and also in relation to the spatial distribution of absolute maxima of significant wave heights with very high estimates achieved in proximity to areas associated with the fréchet distribution they are not reported here it should be noted that as a consequence of the limited dataset size fittings are carried out on the bulk of empirical annual maxima and not on the tail so that the behaviour of waves when they are in their typical states is captured while processes at more extreme levels are missing we investigated the relationship between maximum likelihood estimation mle and probability weighted moments pwm for estimating parameters of extreme value models when using such a small data set fig 8 a shows the different distributions of return levels of significant heights achieved by means of both approaches for the aquitaine location fig 8 b even if the probability weighted moments method provides lower estimates when compared with maximum likelihood approach due to its ability to capture the tail of maxima it does not perform satisfactory statistical analysis e g good values of statistical indices thus different results generated by gev parameters when using annual maxima can be attributed to reliance on an inadequate dataset only 23 maxima per grid point on the other hand annual maxima are supposed to be able to detect only few typologies of sea states strongly influenced by a variety of complex geophysical phenomena ranging from the influence of bathymetry together with processes at a mesoscale when using monthly maxima different types of sea states are captured leading to a more smoothed solution generally speaking on the basis of findings provided here it is recommended that extreme value analysis be based on monthly maxima in case of not sufficiently long time series monthly maxima selection should be developed considering the directional seas if an accurate description of spatial wave patterns is needed e g for the management of marine operations a qualitative comparison of results achieved for return levels of significant wave heights figs 5 d and 6 d with the spatial distribution of absolute maxima of significant wave heights fig 1 c reveals similar spatial arrangements furthermore spatial return levels distribution proves to be very close to the spatial distribution of the first mode associated with the empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition performed on significant wave heights responsible for more than the 80 of the explained variance fig 9 a this assessment is clearly associated with the strong meteorological events coming from the atlantic sea responsible for the spatial distribution of the most severe sea storms another mode is associated to a lesser extent with a marked distinction of events affecting respectively the northern north celtic sea and the english channel and the southern areas from the celtic margin downward of the domain fig 9 b with an intensification of storm events in the bay of biscay the other minor modes responsible for a negligible percentage of variance are associated with of sea states situated in the western celtic sea and in the eastern areas of the bay of biscay and the english channel fig 9 c furthermore similar sea states relevant to the celtic sea and the southern part of bay of biscay are registered as connected to events affecting the northern part of the bay together with the english channel with a marked division of the two different sea types in proximity to the armorican margin fig 9 d 3 2 rfa on homogeneous mesh rfa was initially developed on a selection of about 1800 points extracted from the original dataset in in such a way as to cover homogeneously the whole area fig 10 a the procedure of extraction is performed here without the adoption of any optimization criterion thus the first trial s objective is to verify the method s accuracy and sensitivity and to acquire an initial overview of results in particular results achieved imposing respectively the temporal and the spatiotemporal criterion for clustering homogeneous regions were compared a first extraction of physical storms more than 1900 storms was carried out using temporal clustering following the approach described in the previous section with the threshold selected set at the 0 995 quantile of each time series méndez et al 2006 the temporal clustering of homogeneous storms thus created allowed the formation of 7 possible regions fig 10 b according to mojena s stopping rule criterion fig 11 a it is important to underscore the fact that each proposed region matches the hosking and wallis test thanks to the optimization procedure previously described consequently all 7 regions can be considered both physically and statistically as being homogeneous the proposed regions cluster as similar events affecting the north and the south celtic sea respectively represented by red and blue colours fig 10 b as well as the north west and the south of bay of biscay in turquoise and red other events concern the english channel in green and the southern north sea in grey while another region magenta is identified in the eastern part of the southern north sea together with some sites localized along the whole eastern coastal area starting from the southern coast of the english channel down to the eastern of the bay of biscay these interesting characteristics appear to have no simple explanation it seems that some coastal processes probably caused by tides are affecting the area by inducing convergence problems of the algorithm for this reason we don t consider such region clustering fully reliable at least with regard to points close to the coast the planar distribution of the statistical threshold fig 12 a reveals a spatial assessment quite in line with the previous ones associated with the location parameter as expected higher values can be observed in the western part of the celtic sea the effect caused by the continental margin is visible too but less evident due to the effect generated by the shape parameter whose value is the same in each region some issues related to the intrinsic nature of rfa are visible at boundaries as in the northern celtic sea in proximity to ireland s southern coast especially close to saint george s channel and in the north sea close to the dutch coast a slight difference with distributions of the location parameter previously shown in gev analysis e g fig 6 a is registered within the english channel fig 12 a with a shadow effect more marked around the cherbourg octeville cape and the presence of higher sea states more confined in the first tract of the english channel between cherbourg and southampton location parameter characteristics are of interest since they arise from an analysis developed as mentioned on a selection of points equally distributed in the entire domain without any optimization criterion thus as a first sensitivity test rfa seems to be robust enough in gathering the whole complexity of different sea states starting from a reduced dataset this is of primary importance because this kind of analysis can likely be developed in areas where large amounts of data are not available e g using buoy series the spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights fig 12 b for a return period of 200 years is quite in agreement with the ones previously shown figs 5 d and 6 d the most significant difference is represented by the fact that values here provided are on average lower in comparison with the previous ones where the maximum estimate reached 22 meters it is probably due to the different kind of maxima used since here one event per year was considered together with the use of a constant shape parameter in each region which implies lower return values on the other hand it has been shown here how the use of a reduced dataset e g gev on annual maxima may lead to unreliable results from this point of view rfa seems to improve the point wise model applied to annual maxima in line with its initial purposes even if here the maxima used are not exactly the same furthermore the solution provided by rfa seems to be more smoothed even if higher estimates are registered again in the western area of the celtic sea here the results appear to be more smoothed at the western boundary as well as in the area between ireland and the uk the effect of bathymetry is also lower and smoothed the most evident difference when using the rfa approach can be noticed especially when transiting from offshore to coastal areas where a less marked distinction between the two regions is here observed the same effect is visible in proximity to the north sea where a more smoothed area is registered at the place of the most even distribution provided by gev some hot spots can be observed along the southern coast of the english channel we don t ascribe this behaviour to peculiar geophysical processes but rather to spurious results possibly produced by a border effect as described by andreewsky et al 2017 the importance of the criterion for performing the initial physical clustering of footprint storms for the definition of homogeneous regions which strongly influences wave climate assessment is now more clear in light of the results just discussed other important aspects can can likewise be observed through direct comparison by means of the spatiotemporal approach the new division into 7 homogeneous regions achieved by means of spatiodirectional criterion for identifying storms footprints is proposed in fig 10 c as can be seen the division proposed is somewhat similar to the previous one based on temporal declustering fig 10 b but some interesting differences deserve to be noted indeed even if the distribution of regions involving the celtic sea is similar with the individuation of three main regions represented by yellow blue and turquoise colours the northern one in yellow now affects the whole north celtic sea extending up to the bristol channel while the central in blue and the southern one in turquoise identify respectively storm events belonging to the central celtic sea up to the first tract of the english channel and the southern celtic sea without involving the bay of biscay the most interesting difference in the new subdivision can be observed in the bay of biscay with a marked distinction in two inner areas in red and magenta dividing the northern and the southern bay another significant difference is represented by the fact that there are not as many points associated with coastal regions as before fig 10 b now one region characterizes events coming from the north sea in gray and another one in green is identified in the english channel this interesting behaviour can be related to the intrinsic nature of the spatiotemporal declustering since the algorithm identifies storm footprints not only on the basis of similar temporal instants but also on the basis of events coming from the same direction it is clear that sites previously clustered in the yellow region are not similar from a directional point of view this fact denotes the possible presence of crossed seas in proximity to such sites since storm events are present at the same instants but coming from different areas from a quantitative point of view the spatial distribution of the location parameter does not exhibit an assessment significantly different from the previous one fig 12 a while quantitatively higher values are on average provided as a consequence the 200 y return levels of significant wave heights fig 12 d associated with the proposed division in regions are slightly higher more in agreement with those provided by gev analysis the spatial distribution achieved here is quite similar to the one previously shown fig 12 b the solution seems to be more smoothed and more homogeneous in separating seas belonging to the celtic sea and the bay of biscay as expected the hot spots observed in the previous case are not present here since the spatio directional criterion for defining storm footprints did not recognize these points as belonging to distinct regions an interesting difference can be noticed in proximity to the north sea where an area associated with higher return levels can be identified as being more confined to the central area in comparison with the previous case in which smoother solution came from nearly the entire region furthermore the most interesting difference can be observed in the first tract of the english channel up to cherbourg cape where sea states are associated with patterns more detailed on a lower spatial scale in particular the model seems to be able to reproduce better the effect due to swell if compared with traditional techniques this can be stated thanks to a direct comparison with the first components of eofs analysis of wave age fields fig 13 defined as the ratio of wave speed to wind speed in particular mode 1 fig 13 a clearly shows through a negative phase the presence of swell seas in the first section of the english channel associated with wave age higher than 1 2 this behaviour is faithfully reproduced by spatial assessment of return levels similarly the other modes fig 13 b d exhibit this feature whether clear or not it will be interesting to understand if this behaviour will be attributable to better spatial processing capable of detecting and collecting more information in assessing wave climate than the other techniques further examples will be provided in the following section in order to clarify this peculiarity 3 3 rfa on unstructured mesh to test the method robustness another test has been run using a selection of points 3000 points covering native unstructured mesh fig 14 a extracted by means of an optimizing criterion as a function of bathymetry settling the number of points selected per zone on iso values of depth the proposed division into six regions fig 14 b according to mojena s stopping rule criterion fig 11 b which satisfies the hosking and wallis test reveals an interesting clustering because it takes in only one region s events affecting the celtic sea in blue and partially the first section of english channel the gulf of gascony is characterized by the presence of two areas in red and magenta while some coastal processes are detected as single points in green within the bay of biscay as linked to events characterizing the inner english channel up to the north sea other regions characterize respectively the north sea and the northern celtic sea in gray and yellow it must be noted that a further division splitting the area of study into seven regions does not affect the spatial pattern found in the celtic sea recognized as only one region but implies a new subdivision within the english channel the proposed division into regions proved to be quite in agreement with the findings presented by weiss et al 2014a as well as with the spatial distribution of the regional shape parameter fig 15 a and b where positive estimates are registered within the celtic sea the english channel and the southern bay of biscay while negative values characterize almost the entire bay of biscay and the southern north sea return levels of significant wave heights fig 14 c do not depart markedly from those previously discussed even if some interesting differences are worthy of mention and discussion first return values are on average higher with respect to those provided in the previous application and aligned with those of the pointwise model then as already observed the method effectiveness in modelling events probably linked to swell waves is visible again and more markedly within the english channel thanks to the intrinsic nature of spatiotemporal declustering so that the same sea states may be properly detected from both the spatial and the temporal point of view furthermore even if higher return levels are registered in the celtic sea some interesting events are now detected in the northern part of the bay of biscay along the atlantic french coast starting from the southern coast of brittany fig 14 d while in the previous case smoothed solution has been provided for the whole area as a consequence rfa developed on an appropriate dataset characterized by a number of points extracted in function of the distance from the coast can be conceived an improvement of the previous test performed on homogeneous points probably not spatially detailed enough to detect properly the sub processes active in coastal areas finally the local return levels of significant wave heights achieved on six locations situated approximately at the centre of each region fig 14 b are reported in fig 16 the coordinates of each point are listed in table 1 together with related estimates of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 the estimates of 200 y return levels of significant wave heights and the number of non stationary parameters used by best performing model results reveal a good fit for all the regions in particular the region corresponding to the area covering the bay of biscay point pt 3 seems to be characterized by strong seasonal phenomena as demonstrated by the variability exhibited by location scale and shape parameters followed by the region containing the english channel exhibiting high temporal variability because of the presence of different sea states on the contrary stationary behaviour is observed for regions located respectively in the southern bay of biscay suggesting the presence of constant high sea states probably dominated by swell and in the sub area of the english channel flowing into the north sea probably shielded shielded from a good number of sea storms because of its peculiar morphology 3 4 discussion for rfa practical implementation as mentioned the present study sets out to apply rfa approach to gain insight into its reliability robustness and practical application to this end rfa has been preceded by a pointwise analysis aimed at assessing the wave climate of the area independently as a validation of the spatial distribution of the return levels results provided satisfactory answers to the three research questions 1 what is the reliability of the rfa clustering from a statistical standpoint the proposed clustering of regions is fully reliable as stated by the validity of hosking and wallis test the identification and removal of discordant sites as well as by the satisfactory values obtained from the aic criterion moreover the clustering of regions was discussed from a physical perspective on the basis of pointwise analysis results which provided an accurate description of wave climate and of the physical processes responsible for the spatial waves patterns together with findings achieved by eof decomposition of significant wave heights fields finally for the sake of completeness an additional comparison with a k means clustering hastie et al 2009 of the gev parameters was performed as done by maharaj et al 2015 and rueda et al 2017 fig 17 shows regions shows that from a purely statistically point of view the proposed clustering of regions is reliable since the hosking and wallis test is satisfied on each one these results provide sufficient similarities with rfa clustering at least with regard to the division within the north celtic sea the english channel and the north sea while rfa only identifies a southern region in the bay of biscay this suggests that rfa is probably more effective on a basin scale while the k means approach works well on a sub scale as revealed by the smaller wave fields identified in the north celtic sea and within the english channel 2 what is the feasibility of rfa application to an unstructured very high resolution dataset the analysis was applied at an intermediate spatial scale between the one of lucas et al 2017 focused on coastal areas and the one of weiss et al 2014a focused on a very large scale on the north east part of atlantic ocean allowing analysis of the wave climate of the area by means of rfa to be completed the use of a selection of points extracted from a very large dataset covering more than 110 000 points significantly reduced excessive computational costs and prevented any loss of information on a spatial scale the procedure of points selection on uniform selection over space or covering an unstructured mesh proved to be successful in providing accurate description of spatial wave climate more precisely the use of rfa on unstructured mesh points is strongly recommended for analysis of spatial wave patterns with greater sub scale detail e g for the deployment of marine structures such as wave energy converters or offshore wind turbines and in the presence of significant swell effects as a consequence of a better description of coastal sub processes extreme return levels may be slightly different from those provided when using evenly distributed points and justified by better statistics e g aic test 3 what is the relationship of the rfa methods sensitivity to the selection of a declustering criterion the adoption of a spatio temporal declustering allowed a more detailed clustering of regions as compared with the purely temporal criterion the spatial waves assessment turns out to be more detailed on a smaller spatial scales especially in confined seas e g in bays or channels while there have been no significantly different findings in open sea conditions the presence of hot spots due to spurious solutions is also reduced consequently the spatio temporal algorithm is recommended if a robust description of crossed and swell seas is required on the other hand it had higher computational costs 4 conclusions the present work focused on to analyse extreme sea states spatially in order to improve local information about wave features in a very complex area covering the french atlantic coast 23 years wave hindcast database at high spatial resolution provided by the wwiii model on an unstructured mesh grid covering the celtic sea the english channel and the bay of biscay was used to perform the analysis the approach here proposed is based on regional frequency analysis largely used within the framework of hydrology which basically involves dividing the area of study into homogeneous regions whose extreme wave data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques rfa was undertaken after a point by point gev analysis performed on each grid point of the computational mesh in order to achieve a general understanding of extreme wave behaviour and to compare it with rfa analysis based more on spatial scales the results obtained proved to be quite sensitive to the kind of time block maxima used for the analysis in particular monthly maxima registered with omnidirectional seas seem to be reliable enough for developing a robust extremes analysis representing the main spatial wave features characterizing the area due for instance to the effects caused by abrupt changes of bathymetry gradients or by the presence of crossing sea states monthly maxima obtained from dominant seas prove to be more valuable in describing wave structures on smaller spatial scales where wave fields are more diversified especially in areas where the effect of bathymetry is more pronounced on the contrary reliance on annual maxima has led to unreliable return level estimates up to more than 35 m in some areas characterized by irregular values of both scale and shape parameters such as in proximity to the continental margin or to the eastern coast of bay of biscay such estimates could be generated by the employment of different time blocks which can strongly influence results as well as the quality of maxima extracted but can also be an indicator of complex geophysical processes on a mesoscale properly detected by annual maxima and smoothed by monthly ones because more states are captured rfa method proves to be effective in clustering homogeneous regions in which statistical homogeneity is predicated on physical homogeneity and where the basic criterion used to identify typical storm footprints affects the same areas both from a temporal and from spatio temporal perspective the proposed division into regions is reliable on the basis of the main meteorological and storm events affecting areas at different scales in particular spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights achieved by means of rfa reflects the findings of the pointwise gev model with solutions generally more smoothed in the proximity to steep gradients and when ranging from off shore to coastal areas the adoption of spatio temporal declustering allowed the reproduction of wave patterns more detailed on smaller spatial scales especially when close to channel systems the effects of swell are also better described generally speaking the overall assessment of the wave climate of an area can be achieved by using a pointwise traditional model e g gev or gpd while to obtain further information about spatial scales for instance for maritime design of systems exploiting marine or thermal energy confined in peculiar areas it is necessary to use a more complex approach rfa proved effective in providing reliable estimates and in describing properly the main meteorological and geophysical systems affecting an area especially on a basin scale the approach also demonstrated itself to be a useful tool in providing accurate wave climate assessment on the basis of reliable divisions into homogeneous regions it can also be seem an improvement of the pointwise model based on a reduced dataset because only one event per year has been considered here on the other hand since the concept of storm footprint identification is more appropriate to synoptic scales this methodology could perform inadequately at sub scales it could prove necessary to adopt a support criterion to cluster regions e g by means of a suitable covariate and to focus the analysis on a specific region furthermore since the algorithm involves high computational costs it is not possible to carry out the analysis on the full dataset but rather only on selected sites consequently even if the approach is robust enough to provide reliable results operating with a reduced dataset or when modelling systems characterized by a small number of field observations it should be considered that a not fully robust procedure of site selection may influence results acknowledgements l sartini has been funded in the framework of a collaborative project

24088,spatial extremes assessment of geophysical variables represents a complex field largely because of the great variety of existing methodologies employed at different complexity levels generally making use of multivariate techniques this manuscript investigates the feasibility of a different approach namely regional frequency analysis rfa consisting into dividing the area of study into homogeneous regions whose normalized data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques rfa is employed to analyse the spatial assessment of extreme significant wave heights within the north east atlantic ocean this expanse provides the physical basis for the determination of homogeneous regions identified by means of typical storm footprints which allow the clustering of similar extreme events furthermore a spatio temporal criterion for storm tracking is implemented and incorporated into the analysis since it is assumed that extreme marine events on a basin scale may be influenced by the same low pressure systems following similar trajectories a 23 year wave hindcast database at high spatial resolution provided by the wwiii model on unstructured mesh grid covering the celtic sea the english channel and the bay of biscay was employed to perform the analysis due to the large size of the dataset more than 110 000 spatial locations a limited number of points were selected either uniformly or guided by the bathymetry in both situations rfa proves effective in clustering homogeneous regions physically and statistically its reliability is based on the varying impact of major meteorological events on different areas at different scales the spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights achieved by means of rfa are consistent with results of a pointwise model with findings generally more smoothed in proximity to steep gradients and when ranging from offshore to coastal areas the adoption of a spatio temporal declustering allows more detailed wave patterns to be reproduced on a smaller spatial scale especially in the vicinity of channel systems effects of swell are also described accurately keywords regional frequency analysis spatial extremes extreme waves storm footprints 1 introduction spatial extremes analysis is usually employed for mapping spatial return level estimates taking into account possible spatial dependencies in their entirety within this complex framework multivariate techniques are largely employed pickands 1981 haan 1984 cooley et al 2007 buishand et al 2008 padoan et al 2010 padoan 2013 davison et al 2012 shaby and reich 2012 fuentes et al 2013 among which copula approaches de waal and van gelder 2005 jane et al 2016 on the contrary simplified approaches based on the processing of spatial information to extrapolate a local response for return level estimates are sometimes proposed avoiding the adoption of multivariate technique as performed by buishand et al 2008 blanchet and lehning 2010 jonathan and ewans 2011 and sartini et al 2017 where a spatial maximum likelihood estimate is developed in order to define a possible spatial control law governing local extremes parameters on the basis of suitable covariates in blanchet and lehning 2010 a smoothing generalized extreme value gev model incorporating spatial covariates is applied for mapping spatial return estimates of snow depths another approach is provided by padoan et al 2010 where a composite likelihood approach is applied on extreme precipitation levels for fitting max stable processes in carreau and girard 2011 a different approach based on the development of a weighted likelihood function applied for analysing both synthetic and empirical rainfall data in the french mediterranean region is described another interesting example describing an application for extreme sea states analysis is provided by yu et al 2014 with incorporation of multiple covariates in a model developed in such a way as to couple gev parameters across the spatio directional domain through a gaussian graphical three dimensional thin membrane model another kind of approach called regional frequency analysis rfa dalrymple 1960 divides the area of study into homogeneous zones whose normalized data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques this study focuses on the latter approach rfa has been largely used in the framework of hydrology and for flooding studies bradley 1998 burn 1990 cunnane 1988 merz and blöschl 2005 chebana and ouarda 2008 2009 other works are focused on the study of suspended sediments tramblay et al 2010 while only a few contributions with specific focus on marine environment are available such as the works of bardet et al 2011 bernardara et al 2011 weiss and bernardara 2013 and andreewsky et al 2017 wherein regional frequency analysis is performed on modelling extreme storm surges and those developed by van gelder et al 2000 hosking 2012 weiss et al 2014a and weiss et al 2014b applied to extreme waves more recently rfa was carried out on a 44 y wave hindcast database to estimate regional extreme significant wave heights on different locations of the offshore portugal by lucas et al 2017 the present work is based on the application of rfa on extreme significant wave heights following the approach proposed by weiss et al 2014a and developed on the basis of the work of van gelder and neykov 1998 where a statistically homogeneity criterion is presumed valid on the basis of physical homogeneity more precisely homogeneous regions are identified by means of typical storm footprints since these areas are expected to be impacted similarly by the same extreme events since methodologies as well as the selection criterion for grouping regions as homogeneous can strongly influence results different approaches have been implemented and proposed for instance alila 1999 renard 2011 and chérif and bargaoui 2013 use a hierarchical approach for clustering data while in satyanarayana and srinivas 2008 and gabriele and chiaravalloti 2013 meteorological information is exploited for defining homogeneous regions in wang et al 2014 spatial dependence is incorporated into rfa by means of a max stable process otherwise a principal component analysis based on appropriate covariates can be used for defining area selection criterion similarly to morin et al 1979 the present study moves in the framework proposed by weiss et al 2014a to analyse extreme significant wave heights over a very detailed area of the french atlantic coast covering the english channel and the bay of biscay making use of a 23 y wave hindcast database on unstructured mesh at very high resolution moreover we propose to address three research questions 1 what is the reliability of rfa clustering this issue is addressed by comparing rfa results with the ones of a pointwise analysis of extreme waves on the area at the same resolution the question of the impact of using annual or monthly maxima is then explored furthermore this comparative exercise is also useful to identify and to discuss critically the physical processes underlying the formation of rfa induced homogeneous regions 2 what is the feasibility of rfa application on a unstructured very high resolution dataset 110 000 points over the whole channel biscay area rfa is known to be computationally intensive and we propose to alleviate this burden by selecting a limited number of points either via a uniform selection over space homogeneous mesh strategy or by guiding the selection using a physical criterion unstructured mesh strategy 3 what is the sensitivity of rfa method in relation to the choice of declustering criterion this criterion is one of the methods major pillars since it constrains the selection of storm footprints we tested the robustness of the findings of question 1 in relation to this choice by using either a full spatiotemporal or a purely temporal criterion the manuscript is organized as follows first a description of the wave hindcast database and statistical models is provided in section 2 then results achieved with rfa are discussed and compared in section 3 with those provided by means of a point wise approach on the basis of the main geophysical processes affecting the area of study finally some comments and conclusions are offered in section 4 2 models and data 2 1 wave hindcast data the 23 y wave hindcast database homere boudière et al 2013 has been employed to develop the analysis homere is a sea states hindcast database based on wavewatch iii model version 4 11 running over an unstructured mesh fig 1 a covering the english channel and bay of biscay ngug over the temporal span 1994 2016 the data set includes 37 global parameters as well as frequency spectra on a very high resolution grid 110 000 points together with directional spectra on a high resolution grid covering more than 4000 points with an hourly time step more details on parameterisation forcing and hindcast validation assessed by means of i n s i t u measurements from directional buoys remote sensing from satellite altimeters and output from the noaa ncep configuration of ww3 are available in boudière et al 2013 a map of bathymetry is reported in fig 1 b together with the spatial distribution of maximum significant wave height values achieved for each grid point during the entire period of simulation fig 1 c 2 2 the pointwise model rfa was preceded by a point by point generalized extreme value gev analysis coles 2001 developed on different blocks of significant wave heights maxima annual and monthly maxima the aim is not only to provide a basis for comparing rfa results with the ones achieved by means of a pointwise extreme analysis developed on the area at the same resolution but also to discuss the physical processes responsible for the formation of rfa homogeneous regions moreover the impact of using annual or monthly maxima extracted considering both omnidirectional and dominant seas is explored with the purpose of extracting as much information as possible about the assessment of wave spatial fields as well as for setting up rfa properly e g for selecting an optimal number of extreme events 2 3 eofs analysis empirical orthogonal functions eofs analysis is applied on significant wave heights fields covering the entire area of study it extracts most pertinent information by reducing dimensionality of a large dataset retaining as much variability as possible on the basis of explained variance consequently it may be regarded as a further indicator of spatial assessment of the most severe sea storms associated with intense meteorological events 2 4 regional frequency analysis rfa was carried out on the homere database following the method implemented by weiss et al 2014b where the criterion at the base of the formation of homogeneous regions is physically defined in this way statistical homogeneity is guaranteed by physical criteria following the approach suggested by van gelder and neykov 1998 more precisely the basic idea is to identify typical storm footprints in order to cluster regions as homogeneous defined as being impacted by the same extreme events clearly some simplifications must be adopted for defining regions on the basis of storm footprints the requirement of physical homogeneity is met if storms impacting sites found in a given region can be assumed to remain confined within the region which they are affecting this is reasonably assumed since this work is developed on a synoptic scale on the other hand the complexity of the study area suggests a possible overlapping and crossing of meteorological processes more detailed on a meso scale further enhanced by the peculiar topography of the coastline furthermore since it may be assumed that extreme marine events on a basin scale are influenced by the same perturbations acting on the areas covering similar instants and directions a spatio temporal criterion for tracking marine storms is implemented and incorporated into the analysis a selection of points extracted from the original database was used to perform the analysis for two main reasons first rfa performed on the whole dataset implies prohibitive computational costs since it is based on the full dataset rather than on maxima samples as with traditional techniques e g gev or pot thus since it relies on the full dataset 110 000 points 166 000 temporal instants some issues related to memory limit can arise subsequently a good rfa requires that observations at different sites be independent since a same storm is expected to impact several sites the spatial resolution of the wave hindcast dataset is too high for this requirement to be satisfied as a consequence a procedure of storms extraction was developed in order to select independent events in both space and time see the following paragraph extraction of storms in this way the procedure of extraction is applied in relation to storm spatiotemporal propagation in order to guarantee a proper detection of these physical events moreover this prevented analysis from being too computationally expensive safeguarding however the guarantee of independence between sites a map of the extremal index leadbetter 1983 smith and weissman 1994 calculated on these series is reported in fig 2 which shows a weak dependence between sites more pronounced in coastal areas as expected on the other hand since the extracted points should be representative enough concerning different extreme events propagating in space and time the procedure of extraction of points could possibly influence results rfa approaches the question of return levels assessment through the following main steps extraction of storms as demonstrated by weiss et al 2014b storms are here classified and characterized by means of a corresponding marine variable since a storm is defined as a physical event able to generate marine extremes it was established to measure significant wave heights thus for a given site the definition of an extreme event arises directly from a specific threshold being exceeded here selected as a defined quantile computed from the complete time series of significant wave heights the spatiotemporal declustering procedure considers storms to be systems propagating both in space and time wherein extremes are considered spatiotemporal neighbours therefore belonging to the same storm if they occur within δ hours and they are localized among the η nearest associated phenomena more precisely the algorithm performs a first spatial clustering collecting sites neighbours in space impacted by the same storm each site is connected to its η nearest neighbours in a graph structure sites not impacted by the same storm are removed from the graph connections then the remaining connections are subjected to a new spatial clustering until marked spatial clusters are identified as spatiotemporal neighbours if at least one site in each cluster is among the η nearest neighbours occurring within δ hours of any site in that cluster finally these spatiotemporal neighbours are merged as spatial clusters since they are presumed to belong to the same storm it must be emphasized that the selection of parameters p δ η where p is the p quantile of the temporal series chosen for threshold selection for the extraction of storms can guarantee a proper detection of physical events which can also strongly influence results for instance choosing too low a value of p with too high a δ could lead to the merging of different storms while too high a p and low an η could lead to the separation of associated events clearly the problem is reduced to p δ in case of a simpler temporal declustering fig 3 shows the area of study impacted by different storms acting at various spatial scales formation of homogeneous regions once storm footprints impacting an area have been identified and once sites are clustered in such a way that they belong to the impact area of a typical storm the objective becomes that of defining homogeneous regions on the basis of a storm propagation criterion if the probability p i j that both sites i and j are impacted by a given storm is defined as 1 p i j p z s i 1 z s j 1 z s i z s j 1 where z s i is the bernoulli variable equal to 1 if site i is impacted by the storm s among s storms impacting the area a dissimilarity index estimated for each possible pair of sites can be defined as 2 d i j 1 p i j thus regions are grouped according to their similarity expressed in terms of 2 where d i j 0 means that a storm impacting a site necessarily affects the other while d i j 1 means the opposite in particular ward s hierarchical clustering algorithm ward 1963 is applied as an agglomeration hierarchical method where each site is initially assigned to its own region and the closest pair of regions is merged until only one region remains once the whole study area is partitioned into r regions an optimal number of them should be set on the basis of the goodness of the clustering procedure the approach here used is twofold firstly mojena s stopping rule method mojena 1977 is employed to get an initial idea of the dissimilarity between clusters such defined as the level at which the hierarchy exhibits a significant jump in dendrogram heights later the individuation of possible breaks in the evolution of standardized dendrogram heights in function of the number of clusters is used as a method of confirmation or optimization preparation of samples for statistical analysis once the physical extraction of storms has been performed by imposing a physical threshold the statistical sample is selected by adopting a second statistical threshold defined in terms of traditional univariate techniques and thus affected by the well known issues related to its definition sartini et al 2015b note that the adoption of a double threshold represents a further guarantee of independence between samples threshold selection is a critical issue widely discussed which requires a sound balance between variability and bias in this study since observations from several sites are used we focus only on the most extreme events setting properly the value of the average number of extreme events per year in such a way that only two extreme events per month so 24 storms per year may be considered as a good compromise between sample size and stochastic independence between maxima verification of statistical homogeneity in regions once physically homogeneous regions have been defined they should satisfy the requirement of statistical homogeneity as well here the criterion proposed by hosking and wallis 1993 based on the individuation of discordant sites in a given region in terms of l moments is used a certain level of tolerance in the dispersion between sites is allowed considering the degree of statistical homogeneity within a given region an automatic procedure for the achievement of the requirement of statistical homogeneity was implemented for each region the hosking and wallis test hosking and wallis 1993 was performed identifying and automatically removing discordant sites until convergence was achieved extreme values analysis excesses of significant wave heights are modelled by means of a non stationary generalized pareto distribution gpd sartini et al 2015a avoiding the use of any covariate so as not to influence the analysis by adding information regarding possible spatial dependences terms related to long term trends are here neglected since a 23 y sample is not considered large enough to be representative of long term processes the choice of adopting a non stationary model was determined by to the better values achieved by the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 achieved with respect to the traditional approach furthermore the time varying model allows the formulation of an initial insight into the different seasonality levels exhibited in the area the problem is posed as xi gpd ui γi k where xi are the excesses from the statistical threshold ui at site i γi is the local scale parameter and the shape parameter k is constant over the whole region since statistical homogeneity is ensured observations from sites in a given region are expected to follow the same regional probability distribution with specific behaviours at sites governed by a local index representing the local specificities of a site often chosen as the mean value of observations registered here it is defined as the storm statistical threshold ui on site observations are normalized with respect to the local index and the distribution of normalized variable is presumed to be independent of the site according to the regional homogeneity hypothesis following hosking and wallis 1993 the two regional parameters γ k can be estimated by means of the regional l moment method 3 k 2 λ 1 r 1 λ 2 r γ 1 k λ 1 r 1 where the regional sample r order l moment λ r r is defined as 4 λ r r i 1 n n i λ r i u i i 1 n n i where λ r i is the sample r order l moment for site i 1 n and ni the sample size finally for each site i long term return levels are achieved re scaling the estimates by the local index as normalized variables were used 3 results and discussion 3 1 extreme wave analysis on homere database a point by point gev analysis has been developed using different selections of block maxima 3 1 1 gev on monthly maxima omnidirectional seas first a gev analysis using time blocks corresponding to months was performed significant wave heights maxima were extracted for each time block considering waves coming from all directions the spatial distribution of mean direction extracted associated to absolute maxima fig 4 a reveals that the most severe regimes come from the north west in particular the damping effects triggered by the bathymetry shelf are clearly visible with abrupt changes of directions while the local distribution of direction close to the coastal areas of bay of biscay seems to suggest the rotation of wave fronts as an effect of the orientation of coastline which can turn into a superimposition of different sea states a similar consideration can be made concerning waves propagating within channel areas suggesting that possible wave dynamics processes may be active on a mesoscale results related to gev analysis performed on monthly maxima are reported in fig 5 more precisely results reveal quite a smoothed spatial distribution for both location and scale parameters fig 5 a and b while shape parameters fig c exhibit more diversified behaviour on a spatial scale weakly positive values of shape parameters attributable to a fréchet distribution are registered in coastal areas as well as in the southern areas of the bay of biscay close to spain and in proximity of the western part of the celtic sea an abrupt change to negative values can be observed in proximity of transition regions of bathymetry as along the armorican shelf and the armorican margin a weibull behaviour is also found in the english channel and in the northern part of the celtic sea close to ireland the various arrangements of shape parameter are probably linked to the different statistical distributions whose tails falling off as a polynomial decreasing exponentially and finite tails differ by sea type e g open or coastal seas swell and bimodal seas return levels achieved for significant wave heights related to a return period of 200 years fig 5 d clearly reflect the spatial distribution of such parameters in particular of the shape parameter with higher return level estimates registered in the western offshore area of the celtic sea as expected the effect of abrupt changes of bathymetry steepness in proximity to the armorican shelf and the armorican margin is also clearly visible it is interesting to note that the effect of the continental slope is much more pronounced on the 200 y return value than on the global maxima this effect is clearly visible with regard to the shape parameter where abruptly changing from positive to negative values 3 1 2 gev on monthly maxima dominant seas following gev analysis on monthly maxima extracted from omnidirectional seas the same analysis was performed on monthly maxima extracted from dominant seas such defined as those sectors which generate the most energy more precisely for each grid node the dominant mean direction has been fixed whereon a sector of 60 has been centred for defining the range of directions used for the extraction of maxima the extent of exposure was defined on the basis of on average values of directional spreading and of directional spectra so as to be representative enough due to the oceanic nature of the waves for this area the spatial distribution of mean directions associated with absolute significant wave height maxima reveals something different fig 4 b when compared with the previous one fig 4 a while the mean direction related to the most severe storms in the western celtic sea is associated with events coming from the north west as expected here the refraction effect performed by the bathymetry shelf is more evident with a marked projection of a sort of shadow cone together with the rotation of wave fronts as can be observed near the coastal areas close to the armorican shelf and in the southern region of the bay of biscay this behaviour suggests the presence of different kinds of crossing sea states furthermore a more detailed distribution on a lower spatial scale is registered within the english channel and in the southern north sea close to the netherlands finally directions associated with sea states belonging to the northern celtic sea seem to be more westward than the ones registered with the omnidirectional seas as a consequence of the different typology of maxima extracted the parameters of gev analysis developed on fig 6 are quite different from those previously discussed fig 5 while the distribution of the location parameters maintains its smoothed character fig 6 a the scale parameter seems to be more diversified in the western part of the celtic sea close to the north atlantic ocean fig 6 b similarly the shape parameter fig 6 c reveals a planar assessment more detailed on a lower spatial scale especially in the western and central areas of the celtic sea together with a major extension of the area in which the fréchet cut falls the bathymetry shelf effect is enhanced in proximity to the armorican shelf and to the armorican margin with marked weibull behaviour as a consequence the 200 y return levels of significant wave heights fig 6 d seem to be more diversified on a spatial scale especially in the western areas while the bathymetry effect is more marked 3 1 3 gev on annual maxima finally for the sake of completeness gev analysis on annual maxima of significant wave heights was carried out in order to test the impact of dataset length on the quality of results since simulations performed by wwiii cover a temporal axis of 23 years a database of similar dimensions was extracted for each location results achieved for gev parameters reveal something interesting fig 7 while the spatial assessment of location parameter is fully in agreement with those provided in the previous cases therefore data for location parameters are not reported here the distribution of scale fig 7 a and shape parameters fig 7 b reveal a greater spatial variability in the planar distribution of scale parameters some marked areas can be observed which are characterized by higher values placed at the sides of the continental margin as well as in the northern part of the celtic sea and at the entrance to the english channel also shape parameters exhibit a similar but complementary behaviour in that regions associated with higher values of scale parameters correspond to lower values of shape ones as a consequence marked weibull behaviour is associated with the above mentioned regions characterized by higher values of scale parameters while a fréchet distribution is found in proximity to the eastern part of the bay of biscay close to the aquitaine shelf and in western areas of the celtic sea close to the gollum channel system and between the celtic shelf and the celtic margin since return levels of significant wave heights associated with those gev parameters are quite unreliable when compared to results provided by gev analyses previously carried out and also in relation to the spatial distribution of absolute maxima of significant wave heights with very high estimates achieved in proximity to areas associated with the fréchet distribution they are not reported here it should be noted that as a consequence of the limited dataset size fittings are carried out on the bulk of empirical annual maxima and not on the tail so that the behaviour of waves when they are in their typical states is captured while processes at more extreme levels are missing we investigated the relationship between maximum likelihood estimation mle and probability weighted moments pwm for estimating parameters of extreme value models when using such a small data set fig 8 a shows the different distributions of return levels of significant heights achieved by means of both approaches for the aquitaine location fig 8 b even if the probability weighted moments method provides lower estimates when compared with maximum likelihood approach due to its ability to capture the tail of maxima it does not perform satisfactory statistical analysis e g good values of statistical indices thus different results generated by gev parameters when using annual maxima can be attributed to reliance on an inadequate dataset only 23 maxima per grid point on the other hand annual maxima are supposed to be able to detect only few typologies of sea states strongly influenced by a variety of complex geophysical phenomena ranging from the influence of bathymetry together with processes at a mesoscale when using monthly maxima different types of sea states are captured leading to a more smoothed solution generally speaking on the basis of findings provided here it is recommended that extreme value analysis be based on monthly maxima in case of not sufficiently long time series monthly maxima selection should be developed considering the directional seas if an accurate description of spatial wave patterns is needed e g for the management of marine operations a qualitative comparison of results achieved for return levels of significant wave heights figs 5 d and 6 d with the spatial distribution of absolute maxima of significant wave heights fig 1 c reveals similar spatial arrangements furthermore spatial return levels distribution proves to be very close to the spatial distribution of the first mode associated with the empirical orthogonal function eof decomposition performed on significant wave heights responsible for more than the 80 of the explained variance fig 9 a this assessment is clearly associated with the strong meteorological events coming from the atlantic sea responsible for the spatial distribution of the most severe sea storms another mode is associated to a lesser extent with a marked distinction of events affecting respectively the northern north celtic sea and the english channel and the southern areas from the celtic margin downward of the domain fig 9 b with an intensification of storm events in the bay of biscay the other minor modes responsible for a negligible percentage of variance are associated with of sea states situated in the western celtic sea and in the eastern areas of the bay of biscay and the english channel fig 9 c furthermore similar sea states relevant to the celtic sea and the southern part of bay of biscay are registered as connected to events affecting the northern part of the bay together with the english channel with a marked division of the two different sea types in proximity to the armorican margin fig 9 d 3 2 rfa on homogeneous mesh rfa was initially developed on a selection of about 1800 points extracted from the original dataset in in such a way as to cover homogeneously the whole area fig 10 a the procedure of extraction is performed here without the adoption of any optimization criterion thus the first trial s objective is to verify the method s accuracy and sensitivity and to acquire an initial overview of results in particular results achieved imposing respectively the temporal and the spatiotemporal criterion for clustering homogeneous regions were compared a first extraction of physical storms more than 1900 storms was carried out using temporal clustering following the approach described in the previous section with the threshold selected set at the 0 995 quantile of each time series méndez et al 2006 the temporal clustering of homogeneous storms thus created allowed the formation of 7 possible regions fig 10 b according to mojena s stopping rule criterion fig 11 a it is important to underscore the fact that each proposed region matches the hosking and wallis test thanks to the optimization procedure previously described consequently all 7 regions can be considered both physically and statistically as being homogeneous the proposed regions cluster as similar events affecting the north and the south celtic sea respectively represented by red and blue colours fig 10 b as well as the north west and the south of bay of biscay in turquoise and red other events concern the english channel in green and the southern north sea in grey while another region magenta is identified in the eastern part of the southern north sea together with some sites localized along the whole eastern coastal area starting from the southern coast of the english channel down to the eastern of the bay of biscay these interesting characteristics appear to have no simple explanation it seems that some coastal processes probably caused by tides are affecting the area by inducing convergence problems of the algorithm for this reason we don t consider such region clustering fully reliable at least with regard to points close to the coast the planar distribution of the statistical threshold fig 12 a reveals a spatial assessment quite in line with the previous ones associated with the location parameter as expected higher values can be observed in the western part of the celtic sea the effect caused by the continental margin is visible too but less evident due to the effect generated by the shape parameter whose value is the same in each region some issues related to the intrinsic nature of rfa are visible at boundaries as in the northern celtic sea in proximity to ireland s southern coast especially close to saint george s channel and in the north sea close to the dutch coast a slight difference with distributions of the location parameter previously shown in gev analysis e g fig 6 a is registered within the english channel fig 12 a with a shadow effect more marked around the cherbourg octeville cape and the presence of higher sea states more confined in the first tract of the english channel between cherbourg and southampton location parameter characteristics are of interest since they arise from an analysis developed as mentioned on a selection of points equally distributed in the entire domain without any optimization criterion thus as a first sensitivity test rfa seems to be robust enough in gathering the whole complexity of different sea states starting from a reduced dataset this is of primary importance because this kind of analysis can likely be developed in areas where large amounts of data are not available e g using buoy series the spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights fig 12 b for a return period of 200 years is quite in agreement with the ones previously shown figs 5 d and 6 d the most significant difference is represented by the fact that values here provided are on average lower in comparison with the previous ones where the maximum estimate reached 22 meters it is probably due to the different kind of maxima used since here one event per year was considered together with the use of a constant shape parameter in each region which implies lower return values on the other hand it has been shown here how the use of a reduced dataset e g gev on annual maxima may lead to unreliable results from this point of view rfa seems to improve the point wise model applied to annual maxima in line with its initial purposes even if here the maxima used are not exactly the same furthermore the solution provided by rfa seems to be more smoothed even if higher estimates are registered again in the western area of the celtic sea here the results appear to be more smoothed at the western boundary as well as in the area between ireland and the uk the effect of bathymetry is also lower and smoothed the most evident difference when using the rfa approach can be noticed especially when transiting from offshore to coastal areas where a less marked distinction between the two regions is here observed the same effect is visible in proximity to the north sea where a more smoothed area is registered at the place of the most even distribution provided by gev some hot spots can be observed along the southern coast of the english channel we don t ascribe this behaviour to peculiar geophysical processes but rather to spurious results possibly produced by a border effect as described by andreewsky et al 2017 the importance of the criterion for performing the initial physical clustering of footprint storms for the definition of homogeneous regions which strongly influences wave climate assessment is now more clear in light of the results just discussed other important aspects can can likewise be observed through direct comparison by means of the spatiotemporal approach the new division into 7 homogeneous regions achieved by means of spatiodirectional criterion for identifying storms footprints is proposed in fig 10 c as can be seen the division proposed is somewhat similar to the previous one based on temporal declustering fig 10 b but some interesting differences deserve to be noted indeed even if the distribution of regions involving the celtic sea is similar with the individuation of three main regions represented by yellow blue and turquoise colours the northern one in yellow now affects the whole north celtic sea extending up to the bristol channel while the central in blue and the southern one in turquoise identify respectively storm events belonging to the central celtic sea up to the first tract of the english channel and the southern celtic sea without involving the bay of biscay the most interesting difference in the new subdivision can be observed in the bay of biscay with a marked distinction in two inner areas in red and magenta dividing the northern and the southern bay another significant difference is represented by the fact that there are not as many points associated with coastal regions as before fig 10 b now one region characterizes events coming from the north sea in gray and another one in green is identified in the english channel this interesting behaviour can be related to the intrinsic nature of the spatiotemporal declustering since the algorithm identifies storm footprints not only on the basis of similar temporal instants but also on the basis of events coming from the same direction it is clear that sites previously clustered in the yellow region are not similar from a directional point of view this fact denotes the possible presence of crossed seas in proximity to such sites since storm events are present at the same instants but coming from different areas from a quantitative point of view the spatial distribution of the location parameter does not exhibit an assessment significantly different from the previous one fig 12 a while quantitatively higher values are on average provided as a consequence the 200 y return levels of significant wave heights fig 12 d associated with the proposed division in regions are slightly higher more in agreement with those provided by gev analysis the spatial distribution achieved here is quite similar to the one previously shown fig 12 b the solution seems to be more smoothed and more homogeneous in separating seas belonging to the celtic sea and the bay of biscay as expected the hot spots observed in the previous case are not present here since the spatio directional criterion for defining storm footprints did not recognize these points as belonging to distinct regions an interesting difference can be noticed in proximity to the north sea where an area associated with higher return levels can be identified as being more confined to the central area in comparison with the previous case in which smoother solution came from nearly the entire region furthermore the most interesting difference can be observed in the first tract of the english channel up to cherbourg cape where sea states are associated with patterns more detailed on a lower spatial scale in particular the model seems to be able to reproduce better the effect due to swell if compared with traditional techniques this can be stated thanks to a direct comparison with the first components of eofs analysis of wave age fields fig 13 defined as the ratio of wave speed to wind speed in particular mode 1 fig 13 a clearly shows through a negative phase the presence of swell seas in the first section of the english channel associated with wave age higher than 1 2 this behaviour is faithfully reproduced by spatial assessment of return levels similarly the other modes fig 13 b d exhibit this feature whether clear or not it will be interesting to understand if this behaviour will be attributable to better spatial processing capable of detecting and collecting more information in assessing wave climate than the other techniques further examples will be provided in the following section in order to clarify this peculiarity 3 3 rfa on unstructured mesh to test the method robustness another test has been run using a selection of points 3000 points covering native unstructured mesh fig 14 a extracted by means of an optimizing criterion as a function of bathymetry settling the number of points selected per zone on iso values of depth the proposed division into six regions fig 14 b according to mojena s stopping rule criterion fig 11 b which satisfies the hosking and wallis test reveals an interesting clustering because it takes in only one region s events affecting the celtic sea in blue and partially the first section of english channel the gulf of gascony is characterized by the presence of two areas in red and magenta while some coastal processes are detected as single points in green within the bay of biscay as linked to events characterizing the inner english channel up to the north sea other regions characterize respectively the north sea and the northern celtic sea in gray and yellow it must be noted that a further division splitting the area of study into seven regions does not affect the spatial pattern found in the celtic sea recognized as only one region but implies a new subdivision within the english channel the proposed division into regions proved to be quite in agreement with the findings presented by weiss et al 2014a as well as with the spatial distribution of the regional shape parameter fig 15 a and b where positive estimates are registered within the celtic sea the english channel and the southern bay of biscay while negative values characterize almost the entire bay of biscay and the southern north sea return levels of significant wave heights fig 14 c do not depart markedly from those previously discussed even if some interesting differences are worthy of mention and discussion first return values are on average higher with respect to those provided in the previous application and aligned with those of the pointwise model then as already observed the method effectiveness in modelling events probably linked to swell waves is visible again and more markedly within the english channel thanks to the intrinsic nature of spatiotemporal declustering so that the same sea states may be properly detected from both the spatial and the temporal point of view furthermore even if higher return levels are registered in the celtic sea some interesting events are now detected in the northern part of the bay of biscay along the atlantic french coast starting from the southern coast of brittany fig 14 d while in the previous case smoothed solution has been provided for the whole area as a consequence rfa developed on an appropriate dataset characterized by a number of points extracted in function of the distance from the coast can be conceived an improvement of the previous test performed on homogeneous points probably not spatially detailed enough to detect properly the sub processes active in coastal areas finally the local return levels of significant wave heights achieved on six locations situated approximately at the centre of each region fig 14 b are reported in fig 16 the coordinates of each point are listed in table 1 together with related estimates of the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 the estimates of 200 y return levels of significant wave heights and the number of non stationary parameters used by best performing model results reveal a good fit for all the regions in particular the region corresponding to the area covering the bay of biscay point pt 3 seems to be characterized by strong seasonal phenomena as demonstrated by the variability exhibited by location scale and shape parameters followed by the region containing the english channel exhibiting high temporal variability because of the presence of different sea states on the contrary stationary behaviour is observed for regions located respectively in the southern bay of biscay suggesting the presence of constant high sea states probably dominated by swell and in the sub area of the english channel flowing into the north sea probably shielded shielded from a good number of sea storms because of its peculiar morphology 3 4 discussion for rfa practical implementation as mentioned the present study sets out to apply rfa approach to gain insight into its reliability robustness and practical application to this end rfa has been preceded by a pointwise analysis aimed at assessing the wave climate of the area independently as a validation of the spatial distribution of the return levels results provided satisfactory answers to the three research questions 1 what is the reliability of the rfa clustering from a statistical standpoint the proposed clustering of regions is fully reliable as stated by the validity of hosking and wallis test the identification and removal of discordant sites as well as by the satisfactory values obtained from the aic criterion moreover the clustering of regions was discussed from a physical perspective on the basis of pointwise analysis results which provided an accurate description of wave climate and of the physical processes responsible for the spatial waves patterns together with findings achieved by eof decomposition of significant wave heights fields finally for the sake of completeness an additional comparison with a k means clustering hastie et al 2009 of the gev parameters was performed as done by maharaj et al 2015 and rueda et al 2017 fig 17 shows regions shows that from a purely statistically point of view the proposed clustering of regions is reliable since the hosking and wallis test is satisfied on each one these results provide sufficient similarities with rfa clustering at least with regard to the division within the north celtic sea the english channel and the north sea while rfa only identifies a southern region in the bay of biscay this suggests that rfa is probably more effective on a basin scale while the k means approach works well on a sub scale as revealed by the smaller wave fields identified in the north celtic sea and within the english channel 2 what is the feasibility of rfa application to an unstructured very high resolution dataset the analysis was applied at an intermediate spatial scale between the one of lucas et al 2017 focused on coastal areas and the one of weiss et al 2014a focused on a very large scale on the north east part of atlantic ocean allowing analysis of the wave climate of the area by means of rfa to be completed the use of a selection of points extracted from a very large dataset covering more than 110 000 points significantly reduced excessive computational costs and prevented any loss of information on a spatial scale the procedure of points selection on uniform selection over space or covering an unstructured mesh proved to be successful in providing accurate description of spatial wave climate more precisely the use of rfa on unstructured mesh points is strongly recommended for analysis of spatial wave patterns with greater sub scale detail e g for the deployment of marine structures such as wave energy converters or offshore wind turbines and in the presence of significant swell effects as a consequence of a better description of coastal sub processes extreme return levels may be slightly different from those provided when using evenly distributed points and justified by better statistics e g aic test 3 what is the relationship of the rfa methods sensitivity to the selection of a declustering criterion the adoption of a spatio temporal declustering allowed a more detailed clustering of regions as compared with the purely temporal criterion the spatial waves assessment turns out to be more detailed on a smaller spatial scales especially in confined seas e g in bays or channels while there have been no significantly different findings in open sea conditions the presence of hot spots due to spurious solutions is also reduced consequently the spatio temporal algorithm is recommended if a robust description of crossed and swell seas is required on the other hand it had higher computational costs 4 conclusions the present work focused on to analyse extreme sea states spatially in order to improve local information about wave features in a very complex area covering the french atlantic coast 23 years wave hindcast database at high spatial resolution provided by the wwiii model on an unstructured mesh grid covering the celtic sea the english channel and the bay of biscay was used to perform the analysis the approach here proposed is based on regional frequency analysis largely used within the framework of hydrology which basically involves dividing the area of study into homogeneous regions whose extreme wave data are clustered and treated with univariate techniques rfa was undertaken after a point by point gev analysis performed on each grid point of the computational mesh in order to achieve a general understanding of extreme wave behaviour and to compare it with rfa analysis based more on spatial scales the results obtained proved to be quite sensitive to the kind of time block maxima used for the analysis in particular monthly maxima registered with omnidirectional seas seem to be reliable enough for developing a robust extremes analysis representing the main spatial wave features characterizing the area due for instance to the effects caused by abrupt changes of bathymetry gradients or by the presence of crossing sea states monthly maxima obtained from dominant seas prove to be more valuable in describing wave structures on smaller spatial scales where wave fields are more diversified especially in areas where the effect of bathymetry is more pronounced on the contrary reliance on annual maxima has led to unreliable return level estimates up to more than 35 m in some areas characterized by irregular values of both scale and shape parameters such as in proximity to the continental margin or to the eastern coast of bay of biscay such estimates could be generated by the employment of different time blocks which can strongly influence results as well as the quality of maxima extracted but can also be an indicator of complex geophysical processes on a mesoscale properly detected by annual maxima and smoothed by monthly ones because more states are captured rfa method proves to be effective in clustering homogeneous regions in which statistical homogeneity is predicated on physical homogeneity and where the basic criterion used to identify typical storm footprints affects the same areas both from a temporal and from spatio temporal perspective the proposed division into regions is reliable on the basis of the main meteorological and storm events affecting areas at different scales in particular spatial assessment of return levels of significant wave heights achieved by means of rfa reflects the findings of the pointwise gev model with solutions generally more smoothed in the proximity to steep gradients and when ranging from off shore to coastal areas the adoption of spatio temporal declustering allowed the reproduction of wave patterns more detailed on smaller spatial scales especially when close to channel systems the effects of swell are also better described generally speaking the overall assessment of the wave climate of an area can be achieved by using a pointwise traditional model e g gev or gpd while to obtain further information about spatial scales for instance for maritime design of systems exploiting marine or thermal energy confined in peculiar areas it is necessary to use a more complex approach rfa proved effective in providing reliable estimates and in describing properly the main meteorological and geophysical systems affecting an area especially on a basin scale the approach also demonstrated itself to be a useful tool in providing accurate wave climate assessment on the basis of reliable divisions into homogeneous regions it can also be seem an improvement of the pointwise model based on a reduced dataset because only one event per year has been considered here on the other hand since the concept of storm footprint identification is more appropriate to synoptic scales this methodology could perform inadequately at sub scales it could prove necessary to adopt a support criterion to cluster regions e g by means of a suitable covariate and to focus the analysis on a specific region furthermore since the algorithm involves high computational costs it is not possible to carry out the analysis on the full dataset but rather only on selected sites consequently even if the approach is robust enough to provide reliable results operating with a reduced dataset or when modelling systems characterized by a small number of field observations it should be considered that a not fully robust procedure of site selection may influence results acknowledgements l sartini has been funded in the framework of a collaborative project

24089,in this study we consider the influence of icebergs on the ocean when they are modeled as occupying physical space to answer the question of how the melting of icebergs and subsequent distribution of meltwater in the water column might be accurately parameterized in climate models iceberg melt is analyzed by comparing in situ melt rates calculated via the three equation parameterization which was developed for application under ice shelves with the commonly used bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt our results suggest an updated velocity independent version of the basal melt parameterization for tabular icebergs for use in calculating the basal melt rate of icebergs that are large relative to the deformation radius to account for the changes in ocean properties caused by the physical presence of a large iceberg in the ocean keywords icebergs melting meltwater modeling parameterization msc 2017 1 introduction the greenland and antarctic ice sheets accumulate mass when snow falling on their surfaces does not melt over the course of the year and compacts into ice over time the ice sheets maintain equilibrium by losing mass through a combination of surface and subsurface melt and discharging icebergs from their marine terminating margins hanna et al 2013 recent estimates suggest that the discharge of icebergs accounts for approximately half of the mass loss from the greenland and antarctic ice sheets depoorter et al 2013 from a climate modeling perspective this mass flux to the ocean is of interest for several reasons firstly the supply of meltwater to the ocean influences the properties of the water column increasing stability if it is deposited in an almost undiluted surface layer i e when there is not significant mixing with the saline ambient water as the melt plume rises to the surface and potentially decreasing stability if it is released at depth increased water column stability in polar regions is associated with suppressed convection and enhanced sea ice formation while decreased stability promotes convection and dampens sea ice growth gade 1993 stephenson et al 2011 helly et al 2011 merino et al 2016 secondly enhanced nutrient availability has been observed in iceberg melt plumes which promotes biological blooms and the sequestration of carbon by the ocean smith et al 2007 duprat et al 2016 there has consequently been an increased interest in understanding iceberg trajectories and melt patterns in recent years with a to improving the representation of their influence on the ocean in global climate models two different parameterizations of glacial ice melting in seawater currently exist depending on whether the ice is attached to an ice sheet in the form of an ice shelf or detached from it as an iceberg that has calved into the ocean within the ice shelf modeling community the three equation model of melt mcphee et al 1987 holland and jenkins 1999 is used while in the iceberg modeling community bulk melt rate parameterizations weeks and campbell 1973 bigg et al 1996 gladstone et al 2001 martin and adcroft 2010 are usually employed to circumvent the need to explicitly resolve icebergs in the ocean however in both scenarios it is the same physical process namely the melting of ice in seawater that is being represented and thus the two parameterizations should agree the bulk iceberg melt parameterizations used in current global climate models account for iceberg decay via wave erosion at their margins surface melt by the air and subsurface melt by the ocean el tahan et al 1987 savage 2001 bigg 2016 of these the rate of wave erosion is generally the largest at 0 5 1 m d 1 even in calm ocean conditions followed by the subsurface melt 1 m d 1 and then surface melt 0 02 m d 1 often neglected in climate models bigg 2016 savage 2001 the process of edge erosion is parametrized as a continuous decay rate in units of m d 1 and the wave erosion rate is only applied to the iceberg sides which generally account for a smaller area than the base in this study we focus on subsurface melt as opposed to edge wasting since the predominant disagreement between the representation of iceberg and ice shelf decay occurs in the parameterization of subsurface melting subsurface melt may further be divided into subsurface side melt and subsurface basal melt and it is this latter process that is the focus of this study the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt in units of m d 1 is given by 1 m b c t o t i u o u i 0 8 l 0 2 for ocean temperature to c ice temperature ti generally taken to be constant at t i 4 c relative ice ocean velocity u o u i ms 1 iceberg length l m and dimensional constant c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 weeks and campbell 1973 bigg et al 1996 gladstone et al 2001 savage 2001 martin and adcroft 2010 for the bulk parameterization above the ocean properties to and uo are typically taken from a single grid cell kubat et al 2007 martin and adcroft 2010 although there have been recent modifications to spatially average these properties over the surface area occupied by the iceberg rackow et al 2017 in the standard bulk parameterization the surface to and uo are used although some recent models have taken the values of to and uo at the basal depth silva et al 2006 marsh et al 2015 merino et al 2016 rackow et al 2017 while bulk parameterizations are typically employed to represent the melting of glacial ice that is in the form of icebergs in global climate models a different formulation of melting is generally applied to the glacial ice constituting ice shelves this is the three equation parameterization of melting holland and jenkins 1999 which comprises equations for the freezing point dependence on pressure and salinity the conservation of heat and the conservation of salt for temperature t salinity s and pressure p these may be expressed as 2 t b α s b β δ p b 3 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b 4 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b where the subscript o is used to denote far field ocean properties b denotes boundary layer properties and i denotes ice properties the heat transfer coefficient γt is parameterized as a function of the velocity adjacent to the ice face and the remainder of the variables are constants defined in table 1 and described fully in section 4 1 in general this parameterization is not applied to calculate iceberg melt although in theory the same physics should apply to this problem as to the melting of sea ice and ice shelves there have been some modeling attempts to apply the three equation parameterization to calculate iceberg melt rates jansen et al 2007 rackow et al 2017 but to date this has been done using far field properties without including an iceberg with physical mass in the flow one notable exception is stern et al 2017 who model a drifting tabular iceberg submerged in the ocean using a melt parameterization which is a hybrid between the 3 equation model and the bulk parameterization in what follows we use an idealized numerical model to compare the three equation parameterization of ice shelf melt holland and jenkins 1999 and the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt weeks and campbell 1973 in a configuration that explicitly includes an iceberg that acts as an obstacle to the ocean flow in which it is situated it is found that there are large discrepancies between the bulk formulation of melting and the parameterized three equation melt rate if the far field flow properties are used in the bulk formulation in addition there is a multiplicative difference between the two parameterizations even when the appropriate basal properties are used in the bulk parameterization we find that this difference is a result of the representation of the heat transfer coefficient differing between the two parameterizations consequently an updated bulk basal melt parameterization is proposed for large tabular icebergs r 15 km which estimates the basal flow properties as a function of the free flow properties for models that do not embed icebergs physically into the ocean and accounts for the identified multiplicative difference between the two approaches mentioned above the structure of this paper is as follows the numerical model used and simulations conducted are described in section 2 and the results of these experiments are given in section 3 section 4 is a discussion of the results in which we compare the theory underlying the three equation and bulk models of melt to reconcile these two parameterizations and thus make recommended adaptations to the parameterization of iceberg basal melt in global climate models conclusions follow in section 5 2 methods 2 1 ocean model we consider the ocean only modular ocean model mom6 of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl hallberg et al 2013 in an idealized configuration at 5 km resolution the domain is a zonally re entrant channel in a rotating frame coriolis parameter f 1 4 10 4 s 1 with rigid meridional boundaries of length x 1500 km width y 1000 km and depth z 1000 m fig 1 the flow is forced by a wind stress applied to the ocean surface of the form 5 τ x τ y τ 0 sin π y y 0 where τ 0 0 01 pa in the control experiment the model is spun up for one year from an initial stationary state with a spatially uniform temperature field of control value t 1 c the initial salinity field is horizontally uniform and increases linearly with depth between s 32 psu at the surface and s 38 psu at the ocean bed this high salinity stratification was engineered to generate a realistic open ocean value of the rossby deformation radius rd 15 km a value that is representative of polar oceans chelton et al 1998 in the shallow model domain which was employed for numerical tractability 2 2 ice model the iceberg is modeled using gfdl s ice shelf module goldberg et al 2012 this is achieved by holding the position of the iceberg fixed and considering the channel flow to be the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean in the iceberg s frame of reference while icebergs often drift in close agreement with the vertically averaged ocean velocity over their depth the presence of strong wind forcing or any vertical shear in the ocean currents will result in a non zero relative ice ocean velocity at the iceberg base fitzmaurice et al 2016 and it is this relative velocity that the channel flow represents the iceberg is positioned at x y 250 km 500 km the iceberg has a circular cross section with edges that slope linearly upwards over a horizontal lengthscale l side 20 km fig 1 c note that the non smooth iceberg perimeter is a consequence of the coarseness in the model resolution for our control simulation we use an iceberg of tabular dimensions with basal radius r 20 km and maximum draft d 400 m and internal temperature of 10 c due to the large dimensions of the iceberg the flow beneath it should be similar to that beneath an ice shelf and so this is an appropriate set up in which to conduct a comparison of the three equation parameterization of melting and the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt iceberg melt is turned off during the one year model spin up following this period melt is parameterized by the three equation model using the in situ temperature salinity and velocity of the flow but the iceberg shape does not evolve as the melting occurs i e the melt is parameterized by fluxes in to the ocean while the actual iceberg shape remains constant as in asay davis et al 2016 2 3 numerical experiments a series of numerical experiments summarized in table 2 are performed to test how the iceberg and ice shelf parameterizations of melt compare in different parameter regimes in these perturbation experiments we sequentially vary the flow velocity the ocean and ice temperature and the iceberg radius both in absolute terms and relative to the rossby deformation radius rd 15 km in the control simulation the purpose of this is to test the agreement between the three equation melt rate modeled beneath the iceberg fig 1 b and the melt rate as predicted by the bulk melt rate parameterization eq 1 in the bulk melt rate parameterization mb is a function of u i u o to ti and l by varying each of these terms in turn we can assess the agreement of the two different parameterizations of melting across parameter space in what follows diagnostics presented are six month averages starting from the second month after melting was turned on unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 control run under control conditions there is an eddying channel flow fig 1 a that induces downstream cooling and freshening as the iceberg melts fig 1 d the presence of the iceberg submerged in the flow causes a depression of the isopycnals upstream of the iceberg fig 1 c as a consequence of the surface wind forcing piling up water against the upstream face of the iceberg this induces an anticyclonic counter clockwise flow around the iceberg due to the southern hemispheric rotating frame which in turn leads to the presence of a higher velocity on the southern side than the northern side of the iceberg the melting of the iceberg as parameterized by the three equation model is thus asymmetric with a higher melt rate observed on the southern side of the iceberg than on the northern side fig 1 b however the melt rate over the base of the iceberg inner black circle in fig 1 b which will be the focus of this study is relatively spatially uniform the melting of the iceberg results in downstream cooling and freshening at the surface fig 1 d 3 2 perturbation experiments 3 2 1 varying flow velocity in the first perturbation experiment we vary the upstream i e windward flow speed by changing the value of τ 0 in eq 5 while holding the ocean temperature and internal ice temperature constant at their control values we then calculate the in situ basal melt rate using the three equation parameterization and compare this with the bulk melt rate parameterization based on the upstream x 0 km y 500 km flow properties fig 2 a it is found that the melt rate is approximately constant independent of the upstream u contradicting the u 0 8 dependence predicted by the bulk parameterization eq 1 the numerical configuration employed here allows us to directly examine the basal flow properties rather than just using the surface flow properties as proxies for these values as is typically done when calculating iceberg basal melt using the bulk parameterization of melting we consequently re calculate the bulk parameterization eq 1 using the basal flow speed and the basal temperature we find that the three equation melt rate collapses onto this bulk curve fig 2 b if two modifications are made to the standard bulk formula firstly the ice temperature canonically taken to be t i 4 c is found to be inappropriate and instead should be replaced by the in situ melting temperature of ice this may be approximated beneath an iceberg which is generally not at great depth as t f α s o β for α 5 73 10 2 c psu 1 and β 9 39 10 2 c where the upstream basal so may be used as an adequate first order approximation of the basal salinity holland and jenkins 1999 and we have neglected the second order pressure term and the higher order salinity terms for simplicity secondly the multiplicative constant in the bulk melt rate parameterization typically taken to be c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 is found to be too low and instead the three equation melt rate collapses onto the bulk curve 6 m b c t o t f u o 0 8 l 0 2 for c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 fig 2 b here the relative ice ocean velocity u o u i u o as the iceberg is held fixed the dependence of the basal flow speed on the upstream flow speed and the multiplicative difference between the parameterizations are discussed in section 4 3 2 2 varying ocean and ice temperature we next consider the influence of varying ocean temperature in the range t o 0 4 c on the melt rate holding the upstream flow speed fixed at its control value it is found that contrary to eq 1 there is a nonlinear dependence of the basal melt rate on the upstream ocean temperature in the parameterized three equation melt rate fig 3 a this nonlinear dependence of the melt rate on temperature can be attributed to an increase in the basal flow speed as to is increased this is demonstrated by the fact that the three equation melt rates collapse onto the bulk melt rate curve given by eq 6 for c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 when the basal flow speed as opposed to the upstream flow speed is used in this parameterization fig 3 b again the ice temperature ti in this parameterization has been replaced by the in situ freezing temperature t f α s o β the use of tf rather than ti in the bulk parameterization of basal melt is further supported by the fact that when the ocean temperature is held fixed at t o 1 c and the internal ice temperature is varied between 10 and 0 c in our numerical simulations we find that the internal ice temperature has a negligible effect on the three equation parameterized melt rate the three equation parameterization calculates the melt rate from the difference between the heat flux from the ocean to the ice ocean boundary layer and the heat flux from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ice section 4 1 the agreement of the bulk parameterization with the three equation parameterization of melt when ti is replaced by tf indicates that the contribution of the heat flux from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ice is small and it is the heat flux from the ocean into the ice ocean boundary layer that dominates melting 3 2 3 varying iceberg radius finally we consider varying the iceberg basal radius between 5 and 50 km holding the free flow speed and the ocean temperature fixed at their control values the bulk parameterization of basal melt eq 1 predicts a length dependence of l 0 2 in the melt rate but fig 4 a illustrates that the three equation parameterization has a stronger dependence on iceberg radius than this if instead the bulk parameterization is calculated as a function of the average velocity and temperature beneath the iceberg in the numerical model and ti replaced with the in situ freezing temperature tf the bulk parameterization is a good predictor of the in situ melt rate for large r rd 15 km icebergs up to the previously discussed multiplicative factor of approximately 5 fig 4 b at small values of r there is a smaller multiplicative difference between the two parameterizations this point is discussed in section 4 1 3 2 4 varying ocean stratification and iceberg side slope although the ocean stratification and the iceberg side slope do not enter the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt these properties are of interest because of their potential to influence the conditions downstream of a melting iceberg in the perturbation experiments we observed that the melting of the iceberg induced downstream i e lee side cooling and freshening at the surface it has been proposed that an iceberg melting in a cold over warm stratification might produce an increase in downstream temperature if the iceberg melt plume entrains sufficient ambient water as it rises stern et al 2017 we have not succeeded in finding a region in parameter space in which there is warming downstream of the iceberg in our numerical simulations even in the case of a strong cold over warm stratification in the vertical temperature field however the degree to which there is downstream cooling and freshening was found to be a function of the iceberg side slope with steeper iceberg sides resulting in a meltwater layer at the surface that is more diluted by the entrainment of ambient water in the limiting case of vertical iceberg sides the downstream temperature and salinity anomaly tended to zero given the inability of the hydrostatic numerical model considered here to explicitly simulate vertical melt plumes the feasibility of downstream warming with a plume resolving model would be an interesting topic of future study 4 discussion there are two main points that come out of the analysis in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 the first is that there is a multiplicative difference of approximately factor 5 between the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt and the in situ three equation parameterized melt rate the second is that the upstream flow properties uo to traditionally used in the bulk parameterization to calculate the basal melt rate of icebergs are not representative of the basal flow properties in reality fig 5 illustrates schematically how the basal flow might be determined by the basal melt plume properties ub tb rather than the upstream flow properties we address these two points sequentially first comparing the theory underlying the two melt rate parameterizations in section 4 1 to understand the origin of the multiplicative difference between them and subsequently addressing how the basal flow properties might be predicted as a function of the upstream flow properties which are used in this study to estimate the far field properties traditionally used in the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt as upstream in the channel is less influenced by the embedded iceberg in section 4 2 4 1 theoretical comparison of melt rate parameterizations the parameterization of iceberg basal melt originates from the theory of heat exchange for a finite flat plate in a background flow which has been an extensively studied problem in engineering since the early twentieth century the rate of heat exchange is described by the heat transfer coefficient γt which has units of w m 2 k 1 and is given by 7 γ t k o t nu l where k o t is the thermal conductivity of the fluid w m 1 c 1 l is the length of the plate m and nu is the average nusselt number over the plate weeks and campbell 1973 for a flat plate that is sufficiently long for both laminar and turbulent regimes to exist along its length the average nusselt number is given by 8 nu 0 037 re 0 8 pr 1 3 where re is the reynold s number and pr is the prandtl number of the flow eckert and drake 1959 in a 1973 paper it was argued weeks and campbell 1973 that the iceberg basal melt rate could be expressed as m b q ρ i l f where the heat flux is q γ t δ t here ρi is the density of ice lf is the latent heat of fusion and δ t t o t i is the temperature difference between the ocean and the ice the authors proceeded by using eq 8 above to substitute for γt and formulated the reynolds number of the flow as re u l ν where lengthscale l is the iceberg length m velocity scale u u o u i is the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean m s 1 and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 thus 9 γ t 0 037 k o t pr 1 3 ν 0 8 u 0 8 l 0 2 and hence in units of m s 1 10 m b γ t δ t ρ i l f 0 037 k o t pr 1 3 ρ i l f ν 0 8 u 0 8 t o t i l 0 2 to convert the above equation to units of m d 1 a multiplicative factor of 86 400 must be applied on applying this factor and substituting for typical polar oceanic values at approximately to 0 c of k o t 0 563 w m 1 c 1 pr 13 1 and ν 1 826 10 6 m2 s 1 eq 10 becomes the familiar parameterization of iceberg basal melt in units of m d 1 11 m b 0 58 u 0 8 t o t i l 0 2 where 0 58 is a dimensional constant with units c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 note that this constant is a composite of laboratory derived physical constants as opposed to being tuned to observations of icebergs melt rates the three equation parameterization was developed specifically for the problem of ice melting in water it originates from expressions for the freezing point dependence the conservation of heat and the conservation of salt mcphee et al 1987 holland and jenkins 1999 these may be written as 12 t b α s b β δ p b 13 q i t q o t q latent t ρ i m b l f 14 q i s q o s q brine s ρ i m b s i s b where ocean boundary layer and ice properties use subscripts o b and i respectively here α β and δ are constants the variable q denotes fluxes of heat superscript t or salinity superscript s and lf is again the latent heat of fusion note that the melt rate mb is related to the meltwater flux wo seen in other studies holland and jenkins 1999 by ρ i m b ρ o w o now 15 q i o t ρ i o c p i o κ i o t t i o z k i o t t i o z where we have used the fact that conductivity k is related to diffusivity κ by k ρ c p κ so the conservation of heat may be written as 16 k i t h t b t i k o t nu h t b t o ρ i m b l f here nu allows for turbulence in the boundary layer of thickness h the parameter 17 γ t k o t nu h is the heat transfer coefficient and is generally parameterized as 18 γ t ρ o c p o u γ t γ m where u c d u is the friction velocity and the γ s are the turbulent and molecular exchange parameters respectively note that there is varied use of the parameter γt in the literature with some studies defining γt as a heat exchange velocity units ms 1 rather than a true heat transfer coefficient units w m 2 k 1 and thus omitting the factor ρcp in the equation above holland and jenkins 1999 substituting for the heat transfer coefficient and rearranging eq 16 becomes 19 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b conducting a similar analysis for the conservation of salt and assuming that s i 0 and thus q i s 0 gives 20 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b where γ s nu k o s h represents the turbulent transfer of salt across the boundary layer analogously to γt holland and jenkins 1999 all together then the equations become 21 t b α s b β δ p b 22 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b 23 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b note that if we assume that the ice and the boundary

derive the bulk melt rate now it becomes clear that the two parameterizations differ primarily in their representation of the heat transfer coefficient with 25 γ t bulk k o t nu l k o t 0 037 pr 1 3 u 0 8 ν 0 8 l 0 2 26 γ t 3 em k o t nu h ρ o c p o c d u γ t γ m the problem of reconciling the bulk and three equation parameterizations may now be reduced to that of determining the range of validity of the two different representations of γt the bulk heat transfer coefficient γ t bulk was derived empirically from laboratory scale flows eckert and drake 1959 taking the reynolds number re u l ν where l is the characteristic lengthscale of the flow for flow past a finite body this characteristic length should be taken as the length of the body but at some point this ceases to be the appropriate characteristic lengthscale in the ocean this is certainly the case when the iceberg is large relative to the rossby deformation radius thus at lengthscales greater than the deformation radius there is more reason to trust the three equation heat transfer coefficient conversely the three equation heat transfer coefficient γ t 3em assumes fully developed thermal and turbulent boundary layers along the entire ice surface this is not true at small lengthscales where leading edge effects are important thus at small lengthscales there is more reason to trust that γ t bulk is the representative heat transfer coefficient in between the limiting cases of small r laboratory scales where γ t bulk applies and large r scales greater than the deformation radius where γ t 3em applies there should exist a matching region between the two representations of the heat transfer coefficient an extensive exploration of basal melt rates in this parameter space using either laboratory studies or direct numerical simulations dns would be required to find the exact form this matching should take one such hypothetical matching is illustrated in fig 6 comparing the heat transfer coefficients it is found that there is approximately a factor 5 difference between γ t bulk and γ t 3em in the region of parameter space covered by our numerical experiments star in fig 6 this goes some way towards explaining the discrepancy between the typically used value of c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 and the value c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 that is required for the bulk parameterization to agree with the three equation parameterization in the numerical experiments of section 3 for this experiment the iceberg radius was greater than the deformation radius and thus outside of the range of validity of the bulk parameterization heat transfer coefficient suggesting the three equation melt rate be trusted in this case 4 2 dependence of basal conditions on upstream flow properties even with the correct heat transfer coefficient the bulk melt rate parameterization requires the correct basal flow properties to be input in order for it to agree with the three equation parameterization of the melt rate we thus proceed by considering how the basal flow properties may be determined as a function of the upstream flow properties for the icebergs that we are interested in modeling in the following subsections we consider in turn the influence of the upstream flow speed the upstream temperature and the iceberg radius on the basal properties fig 7 4 2 1 dependence on upstream flow speed the basal flow speed is approximately independent of the upstream flow speed fig 7 a and the basal temperature is likewise constant at a little over a degree less than the upstream temperature fig 7 d key to understanding this is the fact that even at negligible free flow speeds the ice melting causes meltwater to flow outwards under the influence of buoyancy and produce a non zero velocity at the iceberg base in addition the fact that a finite dimensional iceberg acts as an obstacle to the flow changes the relative velocity between the ice base and the ocean the blocking effect is enhanced by the fact that icebergs are subject to the influence of rotation and when they become large relative to the rossby deformation radius a taylor column forms under the ice reducing the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean fig 8 thus in a rotating frame of reference the velocity at the base of the ice is approximately constant at the speed of the meltwater layer the resultant melt rate dependence on velocity is comparable to that observed in laboratory studies of the dependence of the side melt rate of ice blocks on a background flow fitzmaurice et al 2017 these experiments found that side melting is controlled by the side melt plume speed when this is higher than the background flow speed comparably this study suggests that the basal melting is controlled by the basal meltwater speed when this is higher than the background flow speed which is uniformly the case for large icebergs due to the formation of a taylor column of reduced flow under the iceberg see section 4 2 3 however the relevant velocity is now that of a horizontally spreading gravity current as opposed to a vertical melt plume speed so we hypothesize that it will scale as g h for reduced gravity g and meltwater layer thickness h vallis 2017 4 2 2 dependence on upstream temperature the basal flow speed is an increasing function of the upstream temperature to fig 7 b the linear best fit to this relationship is 27 u b c t o d where c 0 004 0 003 ms 1 c 1 and d 0 02 0 01 ms 1 this agrees with the suggestion above that the basal flow speed is that of the meltwater layer as at higher flow temperatures we would expect more melting and thus a greater meltwater layer thickness h we would also expect the value of the reduced gravity g to be greater due to the increased density difference between the meltwater and the ambient water at higher ambient water temperatures consequently we would expect the meltwater layer velocity g h to increase with to the basal temperature is related to the upstream temperature by 28 t b a t o b where a 0 7 0 1 is dimensionless and b 1 2 0 1 c line of best fit in fig 7 e this indicates the water in contact with the iceberg base is a mixture of the ambient water at t t o and the meltwater with t t f 4 2 3 dependence on iceberg radius with increasing iceberg radius there is a reduction in the basal flow speed which begins to level off at r 15 km fig 7 c the reduction in the basal flow speed between r 5 and r 15 km relates to the formation of a taylor column under the iceberg when as it approaches the scale of r 15 km an occurrence that has previously been posited crepon et al 1988 we tested the robustness of this attribution by holding the iceberg radius fixed and varying the coriolis parameter f in our numerical simulations and found that the same reduction in basal velocity is seen as the ratio l rd increases where rd is the rossby radius of deformation fig 8 d the formation of the taylor column can be seen in sections of the zonal velocity as the coriolis parameter f is varied fig 8 a c once the taylor column is fully formed there is minimal contribution to the basal velocity from the upstream flow and the basal u remains constant at the speed of the meltwater layer in addition to the reduction in basal velocity with increasing iceberg radius there is a reduction in the temperature at the base of the iceberg which begins to level off at r 15 km fig 7 f this may again be attributed to the formation of a taylor column under the iceberg as a similar pattern is produced by varying coriolis parameter f and considering the basal temperature as a function of l rd fig 8 e physically the reduction in basal flow with the formation of a taylor column may be limiting the exchange of ambient water with the water underneath the iceberg and thus resulting in a depressed basal temperature 4 3 restricting parameter space we have seen that introducing an iceberg to a flow influences uo and to at the ice ocean interface we have further argued that the bulk parameterization of basal melt is still applicable if the correct flow adjusted uo and to are used in the parameterization the correct heat transfer coefficient is used and the in situ freezing point tf is used in place of the ice temperature ti over all of parameter space the basal properties are iceberg lengthscale dependent functions of the upstream ocean properties 29 u b f l u o t o 30 t b g l u o t o and there is an unknown matching function between the bulk and three equation heat transfer coefficients so in order to parameterize iceberg basal melt without explicitly modeling the finite dimensional iceberg the two dimensional functions f and g must be known for all iceberg scales l and the heat transfer coefficient matching function must be known our lack of knowledge of the heat transfer coefficient matching function in particular poses a significant barrier to our ability to parameterize iceberg basal melt rates across the full range of iceberg sizes however parameter space can be restricted by considering the contribution to total melt from icebergs of different size classes and limiting our attention to those icebergs that contribute the most to the total melt previous studies have used observed iceberg size distributions to deduce the contribution from icebergs of different size classes to the total iceberg area tournadre et al 2016 stern et al 2016 a similar argument can be applied to show that the majority of iceberg basal melt comes from large icebergs details in appendix a 80 of basal melt comes from icebergs with radii greater than 20 km even though icebergs of this size represent less than 8 of all icebergs and half of all basal melt comes from icebergs with radii greater than 50 km fig 9 thus accurately representing the basal melt of large icebergs is of most importance from a modeling perspective and we have seen that for these icebergs the three equation heat transfer coefficient is more physical than the bulk heat transfer coefficient and the basal properties are approximately independent of the iceberg lengthscale fig 7 c and f it is important to emphasize that the above argument only provides information about the proportion of basal melt from icebergs of different sizes and makes no statement about the absolute contribution of basal melt to total melt as breaking is the dominant contributor to iceberg deterioration and this reduces icebergs to sizes at which side melt is the main source of melting it may indeed be the case that the total quantity of basal melt is small compared to the total quantity of side melt however as this paper concentrates on basal melting the question at hand is whether basal melting is a bigger contributor from large icebergs or from small icebergs side erosion and side melt rather than basal melt are dominant for small icebergs which means that it is less important to know the correct basal melting for small icebergs hence we focus on large icebergs in this study which is concerned solely with basal melt 4 4 proposed melt rate parameterization adaptations our numerical experiments have shown that the bulk melt rate parameterization agrees with the three equation parameterization of melting up to a multiplicative factor provided the correct basal u t are used and the ice temperature is replaced by the ocean freezing temperature tf we have argued that large radius r rd icebergs are the dominant contributors to iceberg basal meltwater and thus accurately representing the basal melt of large icebergs is of greatest importance from a modeling perspective the accurate representation of iceberg side melt and wave erosion is of greatest importance for small icebergs but these deterioration mechanisms are not the focus of this study this is especially true in the southern hemisphere where large tabular icebergs dominate the mass distribution for such icebergs we have seen that the three equation heat transfer coefficient is more physical than the bulk heat transfer coefficient further for icebergs of this size the basal flow speed is approximately constant at the meltwater layer speed and is independent of the relative ice ocean velocity represented here by the channel flow speed as the iceberg position was held fixed the basal temperature is related to the upstream temperature in c by t b 0 7 t o 1 2 the meltwater layer speed m s 1 is related to the upstream temperature c by u b 0 004 t o 0 02 in the northern hemisphere tabular icebergs are more rare and past models involving only smaller icebergs are likely to have greater validity we consequently propose the following for use in calculating the basal melt rate of large r rd km icebergs 31 m b γ t δ t ρ i l f γ t 3 em a t o b t f ρ i l f where tf is the in situ freezing temperature and 32 γ t 3 em ρ o c p o c d u b γ t γ m ρ o c p o c d c t o d γ t γ m here the heat transfer coefficient has been expressed as a function of the basal flow speed which is given by u b c t o d note that a factor of 86 400 would need to be applied to this expression to produce a melt rate in units of m d 1 as opposed to m s 1 from the lines of best fit in fig 7 a 0 7 0 1 dimensionless b 1 2 0 1 c c 0 004 0 003 ms 1 c 1 and d 0 02 0 01 ms 1 eqs 27 and 28 for icebergs that are large relative to the deformation radius this parameterization agrees more closely with the three equation parameterization of basal melt than the commonly used bulk parameterization fig 10 particularly as the relative ice ocean velocity or the ocean temperature become large in these regimes the old parameterization may overestimate the basal melt rate by factor 2 when u o u i 0 1 ms 1 or underestimate the basal melt rate by factor 5 when to 5 c while icebergs that are smaller than the deformation radius are estimated to contribute less than 20 of iceberg basal melt to the ocean significant challenges remain if we do wish to accurately parameterize their basal melting an important endeavor as all icebergs will at some stage in their lifespan exist in this size class it is not be appropriate to use the three equation parameterization at small scales because the turbulence beneath the iceberg is not fully developed instead modifications must be made to the bulk parameterization of melting firstly it is unclear what form the heat transfer coefficient should take if these icebergs are larger than laboratory dimensions it is reasonable to assume that some matching exists between the laboratory scale bulk heat transfer coefficient and the large scale three equation heat transfer coefficient fig 6 but further studies are needed to determine the form of this matching secondly even if the heat transfer coefficient were known the basal flow properties are lengthscale dependent functions of the upstream flow properties for small r rd icebergs thus for each iceberg lengthscale below the deformation radius both the heat transfer coefficient and the dependence of the basal flow properties on the upstream flow properties must be found in order to parameterize the basal melt rate 5 conclusions in this paper we address the fact that there are currently two different parameterizations to represent the melting of ice used in the different communities of ice shelf and iceberg modelers respectively the former community uses the temperature salinity and velocity fields adjacent to the ice to determine melt rates and these fields respond to the injection of meltwater as melting occurs the latter community relies on bulk parameterizations based on the flow properties that are unaffected by the presence of a melting iceberg in essence as though the iceberg were levitating above the ocean these two parameterizations represent the same physical process namely the melting of ice and as such should agree across parameter space by introducing an iceberg to an idealized re entrant channel flow using gfdl s ice shelf model we directly compared the melt parameterized using the three equation parameterization to that predicted by the bulk parameterization of melt using the upstream flow properties i e the flow unmodified by the physical presence of the iceberg it was found that there are three sources of discrepancy between the two parameterizations firstly the upstream flow properties are not representative of the basal flow properties when an iceberg occupying physical space is introduced to the flow and thus the bulk parameterization of basal melt diverges from the three equation parameterization of melt if the correct basal properties are not used secondly even when the correct basal u and t are applied in the bulk parameterization of melt there is approximately a factor 5 difference between this and the three equation parameterization of melt for an iceberg of the control dimensions thirdly the temperature that governs the rate of heat flux from the ocean to the ice is the in situ freezing temperature tf rather than the internal ice temperature to understand the discrepancy between the melt parameterizations we returned to the theoretical formulation of the two parameterizations and found that they differ in their representations of the heat transfer coefficient γt we argued that the use of a reynolds number based on the lengthscale of the iceberg in the bulk parameterization of melt is inappropriate for tabular icebergs given their large scale r 15 km and that this leads to the observed multiplicative difference between the heat transfer coefficients in the two parameterizations conversely the use of the three equation heat transfer coefficient would be unphysical at small iceberg scales for which the thermal and turbulent boundary layers are not fully formed over the majority of the ice length and leading edge effects are still important to the mean melt rate a matching between the two representations of the heat transfer coefficient is required at intermediate scales and remains an important topic of future study in the absence of a known matching between the heat transfer coefficients we proceeded by restricting our consideration to large icebergs r rd which we showed probabilistically to be the dominant contributors of iceberg basal melt to the ocean although it is worth noting that iceberg basal melt is likely not the dominant contributor to total iceberg melt due to the formation of a taylor column under such icebergs we found that the basal flow speed was approximately independent of the upstream flow speed and instead was simply a linear function of the ambient water temperature the basal temperature was likewise a linear function of the upstream temperature we thus propose an updated parameterization to calculate the basal melt rate of tabular icebergs with r rd eq 31 which is independent of the upstream flow speed and which is based on the more physical at this scale three equation heat transfer coefficient finally we noted that there is downstream cooling and freshening at the surface associated with the melting of an iceberg with physical size in these numerical runs however the degree to which this cooling and freshening occurs is a function of the iceberg side slope with the downstream sst and sss anomalies tending to zero as the iceberg slope becomes infinite this leaves reason to suppose that downstream warming may have been possible if the model had explicitly resolved vertical entraining melt plumes past efforts to model icebergs in gcms have focused on smaller icebergs because of the numerical difficulties involved in modeling larger tabular icebergs however recent studies have highlighted the importance of modeling larger icebergs especially in the southern hemisphere and there has consequently been an effort towards including larger icebergs in gcms the results presented in this study suggest that the melt rate formulations used for small icebergs are not appropriate for these larger icebergs this paper suggests an alternative parametrization that can be used when representing large tabular icebergs as point particles

is given by a 1 p a a a 3 2 for a a a 10 1 10 4 km2 tournadre et al 2016 we would like to use this distribution to estimate the proportion of basal melt that comes from icebergs of different radii we start by changing variables from iceberg area a to iceberg radius r using the change of variables formula for probability density functions a 2 p r r d d r f 1 r p a f 1 r where r f a a 1 2 this gives a probability density function for icebergs of radius r of a 3 p r r p 0 r 2 here r r r 10 1 2 10 2 km and the constant p 0 is chosen as p 0 1 r 1 r 1 to ensure that the probability density function pr integrates to 1 over this range the proportion of icebergs with radius less than any given value rc is then given by the integral a 4 prop icebergs r r c r r c p 0 r 2 d r a 5 p 0 1 r 1 r c if we assume that the basal melt flux is proportional to the iceberg basal area the proportion of basal melt coming from icebergs with radius less than a given value rc is given by the area weighted integral a 6 prop melt r r c r r c p 1 r 2 r 2 d r a 7 p 1 r c r where the constant p 1 r r 1 to ensure that the probability density function p 1 r 2 r 2 integrates to 1 over the range of the distribution r r r this is modified to a 8 prop melt r r c r r c p 2 r 2 r 1 8 d r a 9 p 2 0 8 r c 0 8 r 0 8 if we assume that the basal melt flux is inversely proportional to r 0 2 as in the bulk parameterization of basal melt again p 2 0 8 r 0 8 r 0 8 1 so that p 2 r 2 r 1 8 integrates to 1 over r r in fact the difference between the two parameterizations on the proportion of basal melt coming from icebergs of different sizes is minimal and the majority of basal melt comes from large icebergs despite these representing a small proportion of the total number of icebergs fig 9 if we follow a single iceberg through time it will predominantly deteriorate through breaking until it reaches small scales at which point side melting and wave erosion will become the dominant deterioration mechanisms however the distribution of iceberg sizes presented above tournadre et al 2016 is a steady state distribution it is thus equally true to say that at any given time this distribution can be used to infer a snapshot of the proportion of melt coming from icebergs of any given size class and these proportions remain static over time the important caveat to this argument is that it only provides information about the proportion of basal melt from icebergs of different sizes not about the contribution of basal melt to total melt if icebergs generally break down to small scales before melting by side melting and wave erosion then the proportion of total melt accounted for by basal melting and thus the proportion of total melt from tabular icebergs will be small however within the remit of this study which focuses exclusively on the parameterization of iceberg basal melting it is accurate to state that tabular icebergs are the dominant contributors and thus restrict our consideration to these icebergs 
24089,in this study we consider the influence of icebergs on the ocean when they are modeled as occupying physical space to answer the question of how the melting of icebergs and subsequent distribution of meltwater in the water column might be accurately parameterized in climate models iceberg melt is analyzed by comparing in situ melt rates calculated via the three equation parameterization which was developed for application under ice shelves with the commonly used bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt our results suggest an updated velocity independent version of the basal melt parameterization for tabular icebergs for use in calculating the basal melt rate of icebergs that are large relative to the deformation radius to account for the changes in ocean properties caused by the physical presence of a large iceberg in the ocean keywords icebergs melting meltwater modeling parameterization msc 2017 1 introduction the greenland and antarctic ice sheets accumulate mass when snow falling on their surfaces does not melt over the course of the year and compacts into ice over time the ice sheets maintain equilibrium by losing mass through a combination of surface and subsurface melt and discharging icebergs from their marine terminating margins hanna et al 2013 recent estimates suggest that the discharge of icebergs accounts for approximately half of the mass loss from the greenland and antarctic ice sheets depoorter et al 2013 from a climate modeling perspective this mass flux to the ocean is of interest for several reasons firstly the supply of meltwater to the ocean influences the properties of the water column increasing stability if it is deposited in an almost undiluted surface layer i e when there is not significant mixing with the saline ambient water as the melt plume rises to the surface and potentially decreasing stability if it is released at depth increased water column stability in polar regions is associated with suppressed convection and enhanced sea ice formation while decreased stability promotes convection and dampens sea ice growth gade 1993 stephenson et al 2011 helly et al 2011 merino et al 2016 secondly enhanced nutrient availability has been observed in iceberg melt plumes which promotes biological blooms and the sequestration of carbon by the ocean smith et al 2007 duprat et al 2016 there has consequently been an increased interest in understanding iceberg trajectories and melt patterns in recent years with a to improving the representation of their influence on the ocean in global climate models two different parameterizations of glacial ice melting in seawater currently exist depending on whether the ice is attached to an ice sheet in the form of an ice shelf or detached from it as an iceberg that has calved into the ocean within the ice shelf modeling community the three equation model of melt mcphee et al 1987 holland and jenkins 1999 is used while in the iceberg modeling community bulk melt rate parameterizations weeks and campbell 1973 bigg et al 1996 gladstone et al 2001 martin and adcroft 2010 are usually employed to circumvent the need to explicitly resolve icebergs in the ocean however in both scenarios it is the same physical process namely the melting of ice in seawater that is being represented and thus the two parameterizations should agree the bulk iceberg melt parameterizations used in current global climate models account for iceberg decay via wave erosion at their margins surface melt by the air and subsurface melt by the ocean el tahan et al 1987 savage 2001 bigg 2016 of these the rate of wave erosion is generally the largest at 0 5 1 m d 1 even in calm ocean conditions followed by the subsurface melt 1 m d 1 and then surface melt 0 02 m d 1 often neglected in climate models bigg 2016 savage 2001 the process of edge erosion is parametrized as a continuous decay rate in units of m d 1 and the wave erosion rate is only applied to the iceberg sides which generally account for a smaller area than the base in this study we focus on subsurface melt as opposed to edge wasting since the predominant disagreement between the representation of iceberg and ice shelf decay occurs in the parameterization of subsurface melting subsurface melt may further be divided into subsurface side melt and subsurface basal melt and it is this latter process that is the focus of this study the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt in units of m d 1 is given by 1 m b c t o t i u o u i 0 8 l 0 2 for ocean temperature to c ice temperature ti generally taken to be constant at t i 4 c relative ice ocean velocity u o u i ms 1 iceberg length l m and dimensional constant c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 weeks and campbell 1973 bigg et al 1996 gladstone et al 2001 savage 2001 martin and adcroft 2010 for the bulk parameterization above the ocean properties to and uo are typically taken from a single grid cell kubat et al 2007 martin and adcroft 2010 although there have been recent modifications to spatially average these properties over the surface area occupied by the iceberg rackow et al 2017 in the standard bulk parameterization the surface to and uo are used although some recent models have taken the values of to and uo at the basal depth silva et al 2006 marsh et al 2015 merino et al 2016 rackow et al 2017 while bulk parameterizations are typically employed to represent the melting of glacial ice that is in the form of icebergs in global climate models a different formulation of melting is generally applied to the glacial ice constituting ice shelves this is the three equation parameterization of melting holland and jenkins 1999 which comprises equations for the freezing point dependence on pressure and salinity the conservation of heat and the conservation of salt for temperature t salinity s and pressure p these may be expressed as 2 t b α s b β δ p b 3 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b 4 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b where the subscript o is used to denote far field ocean properties b denotes boundary layer properties and i denotes ice properties the heat transfer coefficient γt is parameterized as a function of the velocity adjacent to the ice face and the remainder of the variables are constants defined in table 1 and described fully in section 4 1 in general this parameterization is not applied to calculate iceberg melt although in theory the same physics should apply to this problem as to the melting of sea ice and ice shelves there have been some modeling attempts to apply the three equation parameterization to calculate iceberg melt rates jansen et al 2007 rackow et al 2017 but to date this has been done using far field properties without including an iceberg with physical mass in the flow one notable exception is stern et al 2017 who model a drifting tabular iceberg submerged in the ocean using a melt parameterization which is a hybrid between the 3 equation model and the bulk parameterization in what follows we use an idealized numerical model to compare the three equation parameterization of ice shelf melt holland and jenkins 1999 and the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt weeks and campbell 1973 in a configuration that explicitly includes an iceberg that acts as an obstacle to the ocean flow in which it is situated it is found that there are large discrepancies between the bulk formulation of melting and the parameterized three equation melt rate if the far field flow properties are used in the bulk formulation in addition there is a multiplicative difference between the two parameterizations even when the appropriate basal properties are used in the bulk parameterization we find that this difference is a result of the representation of the heat transfer coefficient differing between the two parameterizations consequently an updated bulk basal melt parameterization is proposed for large tabular icebergs r 15 km which estimates the basal flow properties as a function of the free flow properties for models that do not embed icebergs physically into the ocean and accounts for the identified multiplicative difference between the two approaches mentioned above the structure of this paper is as follows the numerical model used and simulations conducted are described in section 2 and the results of these experiments are given in section 3 section 4 is a discussion of the results in which we compare the theory underlying the three equation and bulk models of melt to reconcile these two parameterizations and thus make recommended adaptations to the parameterization of iceberg basal melt in global climate models conclusions follow in section 5 2 methods 2 1 ocean model we consider the ocean only modular ocean model mom6 of the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl hallberg et al 2013 in an idealized configuration at 5 km resolution the domain is a zonally re entrant channel in a rotating frame coriolis parameter f 1 4 10 4 s 1 with rigid meridional boundaries of length x 1500 km width y 1000 km and depth z 1000 m fig 1 the flow is forced by a wind stress applied to the ocean surface of the form 5 τ x τ y τ 0 sin π y y 0 where τ 0 0 01 pa in the control experiment the model is spun up for one year from an initial stationary state with a spatially uniform temperature field of control value t 1 c the initial salinity field is horizontally uniform and increases linearly with depth between s 32 psu at the surface and s 38 psu at the ocean bed this high salinity stratification was engineered to generate a realistic open ocean value of the rossby deformation radius rd 15 km a value that is representative of polar oceans chelton et al 1998 in the shallow model domain which was employed for numerical tractability 2 2 ice model the iceberg is modeled using gfdl s ice shelf module goldberg et al 2012 this is achieved by holding the position of the iceberg fixed and considering the channel flow to be the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean in the iceberg s frame of reference while icebergs often drift in close agreement with the vertically averaged ocean velocity over their depth the presence of strong wind forcing or any vertical shear in the ocean currents will result in a non zero relative ice ocean velocity at the iceberg base fitzmaurice et al 2016 and it is this relative velocity that the channel flow represents the iceberg is positioned at x y 250 km 500 km the iceberg has a circular cross section with edges that slope linearly upwards over a horizontal lengthscale l side 20 km fig 1 c note that the non smooth iceberg perimeter is a consequence of the coarseness in the model resolution for our control simulation we use an iceberg of tabular dimensions with basal radius r 20 km and maximum draft d 400 m and internal temperature of 10 c due to the large dimensions of the iceberg the flow beneath it should be similar to that beneath an ice shelf and so this is an appropriate set up in which to conduct a comparison of the three equation parameterization of melting and the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt iceberg melt is turned off during the one year model spin up following this period melt is parameterized by the three equation model using the in situ temperature salinity and velocity of the flow but the iceberg shape does not evolve as the melting occurs i e the melt is parameterized by fluxes in to the ocean while the actual iceberg shape remains constant as in asay davis et al 2016 2 3 numerical experiments a series of numerical experiments summarized in table 2 are performed to test how the iceberg and ice shelf parameterizations of melt compare in different parameter regimes in these perturbation experiments we sequentially vary the flow velocity the ocean and ice temperature and the iceberg radius both in absolute terms and relative to the rossby deformation radius rd 15 km in the control simulation the purpose of this is to test the agreement between the three equation melt rate modeled beneath the iceberg fig 1 b and the melt rate as predicted by the bulk melt rate parameterization eq 1 in the bulk melt rate parameterization mb is a function of u i u o to ti and l by varying each of these terms in turn we can assess the agreement of the two different parameterizations of melting across parameter space in what follows diagnostics presented are six month averages starting from the second month after melting was turned on unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 control run under control conditions there is an eddying channel flow fig 1 a that induces downstream cooling and freshening as the iceberg melts fig 1 d the presence of the iceberg submerged in the flow causes a depression of the isopycnals upstream of the iceberg fig 1 c as a consequence of the surface wind forcing piling up water against the upstream face of the iceberg this induces an anticyclonic counter clockwise flow around the iceberg due to the southern hemispheric rotating frame which in turn leads to the presence of a higher velocity on the southern side than the northern side of the iceberg the melting of the iceberg as parameterized by the three equation model is thus asymmetric with a higher melt rate observed on the southern side of the iceberg than on the northern side fig 1 b however the melt rate over the base of the iceberg inner black circle in fig 1 b which will be the focus of this study is relatively spatially uniform the melting of the iceberg results in downstream cooling and freshening at the surface fig 1 d 3 2 perturbation experiments 3 2 1 varying flow velocity in the first perturbation experiment we vary the upstream i e windward flow speed by changing the value of τ 0 in eq 5 while holding the ocean temperature and internal ice temperature constant at their control values we then calculate the in situ basal melt rate using the three equation parameterization and compare this with the bulk melt rate parameterization based on the upstream x 0 km y 500 km flow properties fig 2 a it is found that the melt rate is approximately constant independent of the upstream u contradicting the u 0 8 dependence predicted by the bulk parameterization eq 1 the numerical configuration employed here allows us to directly examine the basal flow properties rather than just using the surface flow properties as proxies for these values as is typically done when calculating iceberg basal melt using the bulk parameterization of melting we consequently re calculate the bulk parameterization eq 1 using the basal flow speed and the basal temperature we find that the three equation melt rate collapses onto this bulk curve fig 2 b if two modifications are made to the standard bulk formula firstly the ice temperature canonically taken to be t i 4 c is found to be inappropriate and instead should be replaced by the in situ melting temperature of ice this may be approximated beneath an iceberg which is generally not at great depth as t f α s o β for α 5 73 10 2 c psu 1 and β 9 39 10 2 c where the upstream basal so may be used as an adequate first order approximation of the basal salinity holland and jenkins 1999 and we have neglected the second order pressure term and the higher order salinity terms for simplicity secondly the multiplicative constant in the bulk melt rate parameterization typically taken to be c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 is found to be too low and instead the three equation melt rate collapses onto the bulk curve 6 m b c t o t f u o 0 8 l 0 2 for c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 fig 2 b here the relative ice ocean velocity u o u i u o as the iceberg is held fixed the dependence of the basal flow speed on the upstream flow speed and the multiplicative difference between the parameterizations are discussed in section 4 3 2 2 varying ocean and ice temperature we next consider the influence of varying ocean temperature in the range t o 0 4 c on the melt rate holding the upstream flow speed fixed at its control value it is found that contrary to eq 1 there is a nonlinear dependence of the basal melt rate on the upstream ocean temperature in the parameterized three equation melt rate fig 3 a this nonlinear dependence of the melt rate on temperature can be attributed to an increase in the basal flow speed as to is increased this is demonstrated by the fact that the three equation melt rates collapse onto the bulk melt rate curve given by eq 6 for c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 when the basal flow speed as opposed to the upstream flow speed is used in this parameterization fig 3 b again the ice temperature ti in this parameterization has been replaced by the in situ freezing temperature t f α s o β the use of tf rather than ti in the bulk parameterization of basal melt is further supported by the fact that when the ocean temperature is held fixed at t o 1 c and the internal ice temperature is varied between 10 and 0 c in our numerical simulations we find that the internal ice temperature has a negligible effect on the three equation parameterized melt rate the three equation parameterization calculates the melt rate from the difference between the heat flux from the ocean to the ice ocean boundary layer and the heat flux from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ice section 4 1 the agreement of the bulk parameterization with the three equation parameterization of melt when ti is replaced by tf indicates that the contribution of the heat flux from the ice ocean boundary layer into the ice is small and it is the heat flux from the ocean into the ice ocean boundary layer that dominates melting 3 2 3 varying iceberg radius finally we consider varying the iceberg basal radius between 5 and 50 km holding the free flow speed and the ocean temperature fixed at their control values the bulk parameterization of basal melt eq 1 predicts a length dependence of l 0 2 in the melt rate but fig 4 a illustrates that the three equation parameterization has a stronger dependence on iceberg radius than this if instead the bulk parameterization is calculated as a function of the average velocity and temperature beneath the iceberg in the numerical model and ti replaced with the in situ freezing temperature tf the bulk parameterization is a good predictor of the in situ melt rate for large r rd 15 km icebergs up to the previously discussed multiplicative factor of approximately 5 fig 4 b at small values of r there is a smaller multiplicative difference between the two parameterizations this point is discussed in section 4 1 3 2 4 varying ocean stratification and iceberg side slope although the ocean stratification and the iceberg side slope do not enter the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt these properties are of interest because of their potential to influence the conditions downstream of a melting iceberg in the perturbation experiments we observed that the melting of the iceberg induced downstream i e lee side cooling and freshening at the surface it has been proposed that an iceberg melting in a cold over warm stratification might produce an increase in downstream temperature if the iceberg melt plume entrains sufficient ambient water as it rises stern et al 2017 we have not succeeded in finding a region in parameter space in which there is warming downstream of the iceberg in our numerical simulations even in the case of a strong cold over warm stratification in the vertical temperature field however the degree to which there is downstream cooling and freshening was found to be a function of the iceberg side slope with steeper iceberg sides resulting in a meltwater layer at the surface that is more diluted by the entrainment of ambient water in the limiting case of vertical iceberg sides the downstream temperature and salinity anomaly tended to zero given the inability of the hydrostatic numerical model considered here to explicitly simulate vertical melt plumes the feasibility of downstream warming with a plume resolving model would be an interesting topic of future study 4 discussion there are two main points that come out of the analysis in sections 3 2 1 3 2 3 the first is that there is a multiplicative difference of approximately factor 5 between the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt and the in situ three equation parameterized melt rate the second is that the upstream flow properties uo to traditionally used in the bulk parameterization to calculate the basal melt rate of icebergs are not representative of the basal flow properties in reality fig 5 illustrates schematically how the basal flow might be determined by the basal melt plume properties ub tb rather than the upstream flow properties we address these two points sequentially first comparing the theory underlying the two melt rate parameterizations in section 4 1 to understand the origin of the multiplicative difference between them and subsequently addressing how the basal flow properties might be predicted as a function of the upstream flow properties which are used in this study to estimate the far field properties traditionally used in the bulk parameterization of iceberg basal melt as upstream in the channel is less influenced by the embedded iceberg in section 4 2 4 1 theoretical comparison of melt rate parameterizations the parameterization of iceberg basal melt originates from the theory of heat exchange for a finite flat plate in a background flow which has been an extensively studied problem in engineering since the early twentieth century the rate of heat exchange is described by the heat transfer coefficient γt which has units of w m 2 k 1 and is given by 7 γ t k o t nu l where k o t is the thermal conductivity of the fluid w m 1 c 1 l is the length of the plate m and nu is the average nusselt number over the plate weeks and campbell 1973 for a flat plate that is sufficiently long for both laminar and turbulent regimes to exist along its length the average nusselt number is given by 8 nu 0 037 re 0 8 pr 1 3 where re is the reynold s number and pr is the prandtl number of the flow eckert and drake 1959 in a 1973 paper it was argued weeks and campbell 1973 that the iceberg basal melt rate could be expressed as m b q ρ i l f where the heat flux is q γ t δ t here ρi is the density of ice lf is the latent heat of fusion and δ t t o t i is the temperature difference between the ocean and the ice the authors proceeded by using eq 8 above to substitute for γt and formulated the reynolds number of the flow as re u l ν where lengthscale l is the iceberg length m velocity scale u u o u i is the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean m s 1 and ν is the kinematic viscosity of water m2 s 1 thus 9 γ t 0 037 k o t pr 1 3 ν 0 8 u 0 8 l 0 2 and hence in units of m s 1 10 m b γ t δ t ρ i l f 0 037 k o t pr 1 3 ρ i l f ν 0 8 u 0 8 t o t i l 0 2 to convert the above equation to units of m d 1 a multiplicative factor of 86 400 must be applied on applying this factor and substituting for typical polar oceanic values at approximately to 0 c of k o t 0 563 w m 1 c 1 pr 13 1 and ν 1 826 10 6 m2 s 1 eq 10 becomes the familiar parameterization of iceberg basal melt in units of m d 1 11 m b 0 58 u 0 8 t o t i l 0 2 where 0 58 is a dimensional constant with units c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 note that this constant is a composite of laboratory derived physical constants as opposed to being tuned to observations of icebergs melt rates the three equation parameterization was developed specifically for the problem of ice melting in water it originates from expressions for the freezing point dependence the conservation of heat and the conservation of salt mcphee et al 1987 holland and jenkins 1999 these may be written as 12 t b α s b β δ p b 13 q i t q o t q latent t ρ i m b l f 14 q i s q o s q brine s ρ i m b s i s b where ocean boundary layer and ice properties use subscripts o b and i respectively here α β and δ are constants the variable q denotes fluxes of heat superscript t or salinity superscript s and lf is again the latent heat of fusion note that the melt rate mb is related to the meltwater flux wo seen in other studies holland and jenkins 1999 by ρ i m b ρ o w o now 15 q i o t ρ i o c p i o κ i o t t i o z k i o t t i o z where we have used the fact that conductivity k is related to diffusivity κ by k ρ c p κ so the conservation of heat may be written as 16 k i t h t b t i k o t nu h t b t o ρ i m b l f here nu allows for turbulence in the boundary layer of thickness h the parameter 17 γ t k o t nu h is the heat transfer coefficient and is generally parameterized as 18 γ t ρ o c p o u γ t γ m where u c d u is the friction velocity and the γ s are the turbulent and molecular exchange parameters respectively note that there is varied use of the parameter γt in the literature with some studies defining γt as a heat exchange velocity units ms 1 rather than a true heat transfer coefficient units w m 2 k 1 and thus omitting the factor ρcp in the equation above holland and jenkins 1999 substituting for the heat transfer coefficient and rearranging eq 16 becomes 19 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b conducting a similar analysis for the conservation of salt and assuming that s i 0 and thus q i s 0 gives 20 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b where γ s nu k o s h represents the turbulent transfer of salt across the boundary layer analogously to γt holland and jenkins 1999 all together then the equations become 21 t b α s b β δ p b 22 ρ i l f m b k i t h t b t i γ t t o t b 23 γ s s b s o ρ i s b m b note that if we assume that the ice and the boundary layer are at the same temperature and the effects of salinity are negligible eq 22 reduces to 24 ρ i l f m b γ t t o t i which is precisely the equation m b q ρ i l f γ t t o t i ρ i l f used to derive the bulk melt rate now it becomes clear that the two parameterizations differ primarily in their representation of the heat transfer coefficient with 25 γ t bulk k o t nu l k o t 0 037 pr 1 3 u 0 8 ν 0 8 l 0 2 26 γ t 3 em k o t nu h ρ o c p o c d u γ t γ m the problem of reconciling the bulk and three equation parameterizations may now be reduced to that of determining the range of validity of the two different representations of γt the bulk heat transfer coefficient γ t bulk was derived empirically from laboratory scale flows eckert and drake 1959 taking the reynolds number re u l ν where l is the characteristic lengthscale of the flow for flow past a finite body this characteristic length should be taken as the length of the body but at some point this ceases to be the appropriate characteristic lengthscale in the ocean this is certainly the case when the iceberg is large relative to the rossby deformation radius thus at lengthscales greater than the deformation radius there is more reason to trust the three equation heat transfer coefficient conversely the three equation heat transfer coefficient γ t 3em assumes fully developed thermal and turbulent boundary layers along the entire ice surface this is not true at small lengthscales where leading edge effects are important thus at small lengthscales there is more reason to trust that γ t bulk is the representative heat transfer coefficient in between the limiting cases of small r laboratory scales where γ t bulk applies and large r scales greater than the deformation radius where γ t 3em applies there should exist a matching region between the two representations of the heat transfer coefficient an extensive exploration of basal melt rates in this parameter space using either laboratory studies or direct numerical simulations dns would be required to find the exact form this matching should take one such hypothetical matching is illustrated in fig 6 comparing the heat transfer coefficients it is found that there is approximately a factor 5 difference between γ t bulk and γ t 3em in the region of parameter space covered by our numerical experiments star in fig 6 this goes some way towards explaining the discrepancy between the typically used value of c 0 58 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 and the value c 2 5 c 1 m0 4 d 1 s0 8 that is required for the bulk parameterization to agree with the three equation parameterization in the numerical experiments of section 3 for this experiment the iceberg radius was greater than the deformation radius and thus outside of the range of validity of the bulk parameterization heat transfer coefficient suggesting the three equation melt rate be trusted in this case 4 2 dependence of basal conditions on upstream flow properties even with the correct heat transfer coefficient the bulk melt rate parameterization requires the correct basal flow properties to be input in order for it to agree with the three equation parameterization of the melt rate we thus proceed by considering how the basal flow properties may be determined as a function of the upstream flow properties for the icebergs that we are interested in modeling in the following subsections we consider in turn the influence of the upstream flow speed the upstream temperature and the iceberg radius on the basal properties fig 7 4 2 1 dependence on upstream flow speed the basal flow speed is approximately independent of the upstream flow speed fig 7 a and the basal temperature is likewise constant at a little over a degree less than the upstream temperature fig 7 d key to understanding this is the fact that even at negligible free flow speeds the ice melting causes meltwater to flow outwards under the influence of buoyancy and produce a non zero velocity at the iceberg base in addition the fact that a finite dimensional iceberg acts as an obstacle to the flow changes the relative velocity between the ice base and the ocean the blocking effect is enhanced by the fact that icebergs are subject to the influence of rotation and when they become large relative to the rossby deformation radius a taylor column forms under the ice reducing the relative velocity between the ice and the ocean fig 8 thus in a rotating frame of reference the velocity at the base of the ice is approximately constant at the speed of the meltwater layer the resultant melt rate dependence on velocity is comparable to that observed in laboratory studies of the dependence of the side melt rate of ice blocks on a background flow fitzmaurice et al 2017 these experiments found that side melting is controlled by the side melt plume speed when this is higher than the background flow speed comparably this study suggests that the basal melting is controlled by the basal meltwater speed when this is higher than the background flow speed which is uniformly the case for large icebergs due to the formation of a taylor column of reduced flow under the iceberg see section 4 2 3 however the relevant velocity is now that of a horizontally spreading gravity current as opposed to a vertical melt plume speed so we hypothesize that it will scale as g h for reduced gravity g and meltwater layer thickness h vallis 2017 4 2 2 dependence on upstream temperature the basal flow speed is an increasing function of the upstream temperature to fig 7 b the linear best fit to this relationship is 27 u b c t o d where c 0 004 0 003 ms 1 c 1 and d 0 02 0 01 ms 1 this agrees with the suggestion above that the basal flow speed is that of the meltwater layer as at higher flow temperatures we would expect more melting and thus a greater meltwater layer thickness h we would also expect the value of the reduced gravity g to be greater due to the increased density difference between the meltwater and the ambient water at higher ambient water temperatures consequently we would expect the meltwater layer velocity g h to increase with to the basal temperature is related to the upstream temperature by 28 t b a t o b where a 0 7 0 1 is dimensionless and b 1 2 0 1 c line of best fit in fig 7 e this indicates the water in contact with the iceberg base is a mixture of the ambient water at t t o and the meltwater with t t f 4 2 3 dependence on iceberg radius with increasing iceberg radius there is a reduction in the basal flow speed which begins to level off at r 15 km fig 7 c the reduction in the basal flow speed between r 5 and r 15 km relates to the formation of a taylor column under the iceberg when as it approaches the scale of r 15 km an occurrence that has previously been posited crepon et al 1988 we tested the robustness of this attribution by holding the iceberg radius fixed and varying the coriolis parameter f in our numerical simulations and found that the same reduction in basal velocity is seen as the ratio l rd increases where rd is the rossby radius of deformation fig 8 d the formation of the taylor column can be seen in sections of the zonal velocity as the coriolis parameter f is varied fig 8 a c once the taylor column is fully formed there is minimal contribution to the basal velocity from the upstream flow and the basal u remains constant at the speed of the meltwater layer in addition to the reduction in basal velocity with increasing iceberg radius there is a reduction in the temperature at the base of the iceberg which begins to level off at r 15 km fig 7 f this may again be attributed to the formation of a taylor column under the iceberg as a similar pattern is produced by varying coriolis parameter f and considering the basal temperature as a function of l rd fig 8 e physically the reduction in basal flow with the formation of a taylor column may be limiting the exchange of ambient water with the water underneath the iceberg and thus resulting in a depressed basal temperature 4 3 restricting parameter space we have seen that introducing an iceberg to a flow influences uo and to at the ice ocean interface we have further argued that the bulk parameterization of basal melt is still applicable if the correct flow adjusted uo and to are used in the parameterization the correct heat transfer coefficient is used and the in situ freezing point tf is used in place of the ice temperature ti over all of parameter space the basal properties are iceberg lengthscale dependent functions of the upstream ocean properties 29 u b f l u o t o 30 t b g l u o t o and there is an unknown matching function between the bulk and three equation heat transfer coefficients so in order to parameterize iceberg basal melt without explicitly modeling the finite dimensional iceberg the two dimensional functions f and g must be known for all iceberg scales l and the heat transfer coefficient matching function must be known our lack of knowledge of the heat transfer coefficient matching function in particular poses a significant barrier to our ability to parameterize iceberg basal melt rates across the full range of iceberg sizes however parameter space can be restricted by considering the contribution to total melt from icebergs of different size classes and limiting our attention to those icebergs that contribute the most to the total melt previous studies have used observed iceberg size distributions to deduce the contribution from icebergs of different size classes to the total iceberg area tournadre et al 2016 stern et al 2016 a similar argument can be applied to show that the majority of iceberg basal melt comes from large icebergs details in appendix a 80 of basal melt comes from icebergs with radii greater than 20 km even though icebergs of this size represent less than 8 of all icebergs and half of all basal melt comes from icebergs with radii greater than 50 km fig 9 thus accurately representing the basal melt of large icebergs is of most importance from a modeling perspective and we have seen that for these icebergs the three equation heat transfer coefficient is more physical than the bulk heat transfer coefficient and the basal properties are approximately independent of the iceberg lengthscale fig 7 c and f it is important to emphasize that the above argument only provides information about the proportion of basal melt from icebergs of different sizes and makes no statement about the absolute contribution of basal melt to total melt as breaking is the dominant contributor to iceberg deterioration and this reduces icebergs to sizes at which side melt is the main source of melting it may indeed be the case that the total quantity of basal melt is small compared to the total quantity of side melt however as this paper concentrates on basal melting the question at hand is whether basal melting is a bigger contributor from large icebergs or from small icebergs side erosion and side melt rather than basal melt are dominant for small icebergs which means that it is less important to know the correct basal melting for small icebergs hence we focus on large icebergs in this study which is concerned solely with basal melt 4 4 proposed melt rate parameterization adaptations our numerical experiments have shown that the bulk melt rate parameterization agrees with the three equation parameterization of melting up to a multiplicative factor provided the correct basal u t are used and the ice temperature is replaced by the ocean freezing temperature tf we have argued that large radius r rd icebergs are the dominant contributors to iceberg basal meltwater and thus accurately representing the basal melt of large icebergs is of greatest importance from a modeling perspective the accurate representation of iceberg side melt and wave erosion is of greatest importance for small icebergs but these deterioration mechanisms are not the focus of this study this is especially true in the southern hemisphere where large tabular icebergs dominate the mass distribution for such icebergs we have seen that the three equation heat transfer coefficient is more physical than the bulk heat transfer coefficient further for icebergs of this size the basal flow speed is approximately constant at the meltwater layer speed and is independent of the relative ice ocean velocity represented here by the channel flow speed as the iceberg position was held fixed the basal temperature is related to the upstream temperature in c by t b 0 7 t o 1 2 the meltwater layer speed m s 1 is related to the upstream temperature c by u b 0 004 t o 0 02 in the northern hemisphere tabular icebergs are more rare and past models involving only smaller icebergs are likely to have greater validity we consequently propose the following for use in calculating the basal melt rate of large r rd km icebergs 31 m b γ t δ t ρ i l f γ t 3 em a t o b t f ρ i l f where tf is the in situ freezing temperature and 32 γ t 3 em ρ o c p o c d u b γ t γ m ρ o c p o c d c t o d γ t γ m here the heat transfer coefficient has been expressed as a function of the basal flow speed which is given by u b c t o d note that a factor of 86 400 would need to be applied to this expression to produce a melt rate in units of m d 1 as opposed to m s 1 from the lines of best fit in fig 7 a 0 7 0 1 dimensionless b 1 2 0 1 c c 0 004 0 003 ms 1 c 1 and d 0 02 0 01 ms 1 eqs 27 and 28 for icebergs that are large relative to the deformation radius this parameterization agrees more closely with the three equation parameterization of basal melt than the commonly used bulk parameterization fig 10 particularly as the relative ice ocean velocity or the ocean temperature become large in these regimes the old parameterization may overestimate the basal melt rate by factor 2 when u o u i 0 1 ms 1 or underestimate the basal melt rate by factor 5 when to 5 c while icebergs that are smaller than the deformation radius are estimated to contribute less than 20 of iceberg basal melt to the ocean significant challenges remain if we do wish to accurately parameterize their basal melting an important endeavor as all icebergs will at some stage in their lifespan exist in this size class it is not be appropriate to use the three equation parameterization at small scales because the turbulence beneath the iceberg is not fully developed instead modifications must be made to the bulk parameterization of melting firstly it is unclear what form the heat transfer coefficient should take if these icebergs are larger than laboratory dimensions it is reasonable to assume that some matching exists between the laboratory scale bulk heat transfer coefficient and the large scale three equation heat transfer coefficient fig 6 but further studies are needed to determine the form of this matching secondly even if the heat transfer coefficient were known the basal flow properties are lengthscale dependent functions of the upstream flow properties for small r rd icebergs thus for each iceberg lengthscale below the deformation radius both the heat transfer coefficient and the dependence of the basal flow properties on the upstream flow properties must be found in order to parameterize the basal melt rate 5 conclusions in this paper we address the fact that there are currently two different parameterizations to represent the melting of ice used in the different communities of ice shelf and iceberg modelers respectively the former community uses the temperature salinity and velocity fields adjacent to the ice to determine melt rates and these fields respond to the injection of meltwater as melting occurs the latter community relies on bulk parameterizations based on the flow properties that are unaffected by the presence of a melting iceberg in essence as though the iceberg were levitating above the ocean these two parameterizations represent the same physical process namely the melting of ice and as such should agree across parameter space by introducing an iceberg to an idealized re entrant channel flow using gfdl s ice shelf model we directly compared the melt parameterized using the three equation parameterization to that predicted by the bulk parameterization of melt using the upstream flow properties i e the flow unmodified by the physical presence of the iceberg it was found that there are three sources of discrepancy between the two parameterizations firstly the upstream flow properties are not representative of the basal flow properties when an iceberg occupying physical space is introduced to the flow and thus the bulk parameterization of basal melt diverges from the three equation parameterization of melt if the correct basal properties are not used secondly even when the correct basal u and t are applied in the bulk parameterization of melt there is approximately a factor 5 difference between this and the three equation parameterization of melt for an iceberg of the control dimensions thirdly the temperature that governs the rate of heat flux from the ocean to the ice is the in situ freezing temperature tf rather than the internal ice temperature to understand the discrepancy between the melt parameterizations we returned to the theoretical formulation of the two parameterizations and found that they differ in their representations of the heat transfer coefficient γt we argued that the use of a reynolds number based on the lengthscale of the iceberg in the bulk parameterization of melt is inappropriate for tabular icebergs given their large scale r 15 km and that this leads to the observed multiplicative difference between the heat transfer coefficients in the two parameterizations conversely the use of the three equation heat transfer coefficient would be unphysical at small iceberg scales for which the thermal and turbulent boundary layers are not fully formed over the majority of the ice length and leading edge effects are still important to the mean melt rate a matching between the two representations of the heat transfer coefficient is required at intermediate scales and remains an important topic of future study in the absence of a known matching between the heat transfer coefficients we proceeded by restricting our consideration to large icebergs r rd which we showed probabilistically to be the dominant contributors of iceberg basal melt to the ocean although it is worth noting that iceberg basal melt is likely not the dominant contributor to total iceberg melt due to the formation of a taylor column under such icebergs we found that the basal flow speed was approximately independent of the upstream flow speed and instead was simply a linear function of the ambient water temperature the basal temperature was likewise a linear function of the upstream temperature we thus propose an updated parameterization to calculate the basal melt rate of tabular icebergs with r rd eq 31 which is independent of the upstream flow speed and which is based on the more physical at this scale three equation heat transfer coefficient finally we noted that there is downstream cooling and freshening at the surface associated with the melting of an iceberg with physical size in these numerical runs however the degree to which this cooling and freshening occurs is a function of the iceberg side slope with the downstream sst and sss anomalies tending to zero as the iceberg slope becomes infinite this leaves reason to suppose that downstream warming may have been possible if the model had explicitly resolved vertical entraining melt plumes past efforts to model icebergs in gcms have focused on smaller icebergs because of the numerical difficulties involved in modeling larger tabular icebergs however recent studies have highlighted the importance of modeling larger icebergs especially in the southern hemisphere and there has consequently been an effort towards including larger icebergs in gcms the results presented in this study suggest that the melt rate formulations used for small icebergs are not appropriate for these larger icebergs this paper suggests an alternative parametrization that can be used when representing large tabular icebergs as point particles

is given by a 1 p a a a 3 2 for a a a 10 1 10 4 km2 tournadre et al 2016 we would like to use this distribution to estimate the proportion of basal melt that comes from icebergs of different radii we start by changing variables from iceberg area a to iceberg radius r using the change of variables formula for probability density functions a 2 p r r d d r f 1 r p a f 1 r where r f a a 1 2 this gives a probability density function for icebergs of radius r of a 3 p r r p 0 r 2 here r r r 10 1 2 10 2 km and the constant p 0 is chosen as p 0 1 r 1 r 1 to ensure that the probability density function pr integrates to 1 over this range the proportion of icebergs with radius less than any given value rc is then given by the integral a 4 prop icebergs r r c r r c p 0 r 2 d r a 5 p 0 1 r 1 r c if we assume that the basal melt flux is proportional to the iceberg basal area the proportion of basal melt coming from icebergs with radius less than a given value rc is given by the area weighted integral a 6 prop melt r r c r r c p 1 r 2 r 2 d r a 7 p 1 r c r where the constant p 1 r r 1 to ensure that the probability density function p 1 r 2 r 2 integrates to 1 over the range of the distribution r r r this is modified to a 8 prop melt r r c r r c p 2 r 2 r 1 8 d r a 9 p 2 0 8 r c 0 8 r 0 8 if we assume that the basal melt flux is inversely proportional to r 0 2 as in the bulk parameterization of basal melt again p 2 0 8 r 0 8 r 0 8 1 so that p 2 r 2 r 1 8 integrates to 1 over r r in fact the difference between the two parameterizations on the proportion of basal melt coming from icebergs of different sizes is minimal and the majority of basal melt comes from large icebergs despite these representing a small proportion of the total number of icebergs fig 9 if we follow a single iceberg through time it will predominantly deteriorate through breaking until it reaches small scales at which point side melting and wave erosion will become the dominant deterioration mechanisms however the distribution of iceberg sizes presented above tournadre et al 2016 is a steady state distribution it is thus equally true to say that at any given time this distribution can be used to infer a snapshot of the proportion of melt coming from icebergs of any given size class and these proportions remain static over time the important caveat to this argument is that it only provides information about the proportion of basal melt from icebergs of different sizes not about the contribution of basal melt to total melt if icebergs generally break down to small scales before melting by side melting and wave erosion then the proportion of total melt accounted for by basal melting and thus the proportion of total melt from tabular icebergs will be small however within the remit of this study which focuses exclusively on the parameterization of iceberg basal melting it is accurate to state that tabular icebergs are the dominant contributors and thus restrict our consideration to these icebergs
