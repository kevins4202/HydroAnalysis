determination of the nps concentration in wastewater streams is important for performing appropriate ecotoxicological evaluations the aim of this work was to determine the incidence of nps from 13 different elements throughout the wastewater treatment process by using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms the incidence was determined in samples of the influent post primary treatment and effluent of the activated sludge process as well as in the reclaimed water of a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in addition concentration of nps was determined in the waste activated sludge and in the anaerobic digester the concentration of metal based nps in the influent wastewater were between 1 600 and 10 700 ng l for elements such as ti fe ce mg zn and cu while that for ni al ag au co and cd was below 100 ng l concentrations in reclaimed water ranged between 0 6 and 721 ng l ranked as mg ti fe cu ni ce zn mn al co ag cd au results indicated that the activated sludge process and reclaimed water system removed 84 99 of natural and engineered metal based nps from influent to reclaimed water except for mg ni and cd where the removal ranged from 70 to 78 the highest concentrations of nps were found in the waste activated sludge and anaerobic sludge ranging from 0 5 to 39 900 ng l the size distribution of nps differed in different wastewater streams within the wwtp resulting in smaller particles in the effluent 20 180 nm than in the influent 23 233 nm for most elements conversely nps were notably larger in the waste activated sludge samples than in the anaerobic sludge or wastewater since conditions in the secondary treatment lead to precipitation of several metal based nps the incidence of metal based nps from 13 elements in wastewater decreased significatively after the conventional wastewater treatment train however anaerobic digesters store high nps concentrations hence the disposal of sludge needs to take this into account to evaluate the risk of the release of nps to the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater sludge multi element determination rate of nps nps size distribution spicp ms 1 introduction confirming the presence of engineered or natural nanoparticles nps and monitoring their concentrations in the environment are essential to understand their potential implications in environmental matrices due to the wide range of applications of nps in daily life products e g textiles cleaning agents personal care products wastewater streams receive significant loads of nps with diverse composition and a wide range of concentrations according to predictions lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 although wastewater treatment plants wwtp can potentially remove over 90 of the influent load of several nps such as ag sio2 tio2 or ceo2 cervantes avilés et al 2018 westerhoff et al 2018 it is possible that the residual concentrations of some nps and transformation products in the effluent can affect some organisms in the aquatic ecosystems such as algae crustaceans and fish cells on the reproduction and growth stages georgantzopoulou et al 2018 since the fate of biosolids from wwtp are landfills incineration plants and agricultural soils keller and lazareva 2013 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 determining the nps concentration in the sludges of secondary treatment is also relevant and quite challenging due to high ratio of solid to liquid phases in the matrix and the physical chemical and biological interactions between nps and sludge of the wwtp to determine their risk accurate quantification of nps in wastewater and sludges is needed several methods used for nanometrology and characterization of nps after synthesis have been applied for measuring their

hadioui et al 2015 mitrano et al 2012 proulx et al 2016 in this technique the passage of a single np produces a flash of ions in the icp that generate a large transient signal acquisition and quantification of each of these events in time resolved acquisition tra mode allows the determination of the number of particles in a given sample volume laborda et al 2014 montaño et al 2014 the

2020 hadioui et al 2015 besides previous studies have screened up to 40 elements in di water via spicp ms lee et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 one element per run was detected and quantified which entailed a long measurement time to perform the analysis for a wide range of elemental compositions of the nps until now measurements of several isotopes during a run for np detection have been achieved modifying a time of flight instrument with some trade offs such as data analysis lower sensitivity for some elements and drift borovinskaya et al 2013 hence the ability to detect several elements and isotopes in a single run using spicp ms can significantly reduce the overall run time and cost distinguishing np signals from the ionic background dissolved analyte is another issue when spicp ms is applied cornelis and hassellöv 2014 hadioui et al 2014 limiting the detection of small nps this is particularly challenging for samples with polydisperse np size distributions and for complex matrices such as biosolids that contains high ionic background to overcome these difficulties and provide extra information about nps discrimination and fractionation techniques as well as

avilés et al 2019b fréchette viens et al 2019 improving the particle size detection limits during spicp ms hadioui et al 2014 although the ier spicp ms has been applied to detect and quantify nps of one element at a time hadioui et al 2014 its application to detect multiple elements in wastewater has not been studied therefore the application and comparison of ier spicp ms and spicp ms for np detection and sizing in wastewater can contribute to understanding of the influence of ier when analyzing multiple elements determining detection thresholds and even to detect np based on elements without evidence of their presence in wastewater such as ni cd co mn and mg this could be possible due to the ier is able to adsorb multiple cations in a wide ph range 4 10 which covers the typical ph range of wastewater 6 8 the overall aim of this work was to determine the incidence of nps from 13 elements and their size distribution in samples from different locations within a wwtp such as influent post primary effluent reclaimed water waste activated sludge and the anaerobic digester the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the use of ier before spicp ms to improve the quantification and sizing of nps based on 13 different elements by comparing its application with conventional spicp ms 2 determine the incidence of nps in the influent post primary effluent and reclaimed water of a full scale wwtp using the ier spicp ms approach and 3 determine the size distributions of the analyzed nps in collected samples at different locations of the wwtp the goal is to provide valuable information on the concentrations and size of these different nps in wastewater effluent and sludge for realistic risk assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ultrapure water di with a

nebulizer micromist double pass cyclonic quartz spray chamber agilent and quartz torch with an internal diameter of 1 mm samples were introduced directly into the icp ms with the standard peristaltic pump through tygon tubing with an internal diameter of 1 02 mm when ier was used samples were first passed through resin column in batch mode by using polypropylene syringes then submitted to the spicp ms data of the 13 elements of interest in a sample were collected sequentially during 325 s 20 s per element in time resolved analysis tra mode using an integration time dwell time of 100 μs per point as previously reported bevers et al 2020 montaño et al 2014 with a settling time of 5 s in between elements data analyses were performed using the rapid multi element nanoparticle analysis mode of the single nanoparticle application module of agilent icp ms masshunter software version c 01 05 build 588 3 the instrumental settings used for the spicp ms analysis are summarized in table 1 calibration of the spicp ms for nps quantification was done by tuning the particle size of a reference material au np mentioned above and determining the elemental response factor for reference material and analyzed elements the 60 nm au np reference standard was diluted to 100 ng l with di to determine the nebulization efficiency ηn also known as transport efficiency to be used in the data conversion from raw signal to np size nebulization efficiency was 5 3 calculated based on the particle size method pace et al 2011 eq 1 shows the parameters considered for calculating η n where d s t

solubilization after processing based on the concentration of previous studies detecting nps in real wastewater cervantes avilés et al 2019a mitrano et al 2012 the samples and reference materials were diluted with di water to ensure np concentrations were between 10 and 100 ng l before dilution of the samples and again prior to the spicp ms analyses all suspensions were placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz to ensure that the samples were fully homogenized 2 4 procedure for detecting nps in wastewater and sludge samples the samples of wastewater and sludge were brought from 4 c to room temperature 20 c before analysis wastewater samples were vortexed then sieved through a 0 5 mm mesh sieve no 35 to avoid deposit build up in the sampler and skimmer cones tuoriniemi et al 2017 sludge samples were processed to extract metal containing nps according to our previous study huang et al 2020 briefly samples of waste sludge and anaerobic sludge were ultrasonicated 20 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz then samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g to separate the suspended biomass the supernatant of wastewater and anaerobic sludge were diluted 100 times with ultrapure water in order to evaluate the influence of using an ier for ions removal prior spicp ms analysis of multiple elements wastewater and sludge samples were divided in three sets the three sets of samples were ultrasonicated for 10 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz it should be considered that sonication may influence dissolution and aggregation of nps taurozzi et al 2012 one set of samples was submitted immediately to the spicp ms for consecutively elemental analysis without passing through the ier column in the second set of samples was evaluated the removal of nps in the ier by spiking 100 ng l of ag in the collected samples then passing 5 ml of sample through the ier column packed with chelex 100 and finally analyzing them by spicp ms the third set of wastewater and sludge samples was also passed through the ier column packed with chelex 100 prior to spicp ms analysis for particle quantification before each sample run using the ier the column was regenerated by sequentially washing it with 5 ml of 1 m hcl 5 ml of di water at ph 7 5 ml of 1 m naoh and 5 ml of di water at ph 7 the spicp ms and ier spicp ms analyses were performed in triplicate and the results of mass concentration and mean size were the average of the replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment and sludge characteristics the wastewater treatment in the studied system effectively removed soluble carbon nitrogen and phosphorous table 2 several ligands and suspended solids related with particle stability hotze et al 2010 were measured a higher concentration of s2 was observed in the influent post primary wastewater and anaerobic sludge liquor compared to other locations hence sulfidation of metal based nps especially chalcophile elements e g cu zn cd ag is expected at these points due to long hydraulic retention times such as the secondary treatment 4 6 h and the anaerobic digester up to 10 d moreover the formation of sulfuric coatings on the surface of nps can suppress the release of ions from metal based nps made of chalcophile elements the interaction of other relevant ligand such as po4 3 with metal based nps has been reported as a stabilizing agent or even forming a shell of amorphous crystal in some nps rathnayake et al 2014 these processes can occur in high content phosphate streams such as the influent 16 8 mg po4 3 l and anaerobic sludge liquor 38 mg po4 3 l regarding the tss content the concentration found in the influent waste and anaerobic sludge were 354 mg l 6820 mg l and 25 300 mg l respectively the high concentration of tss in such points suggest the hetero aggregation of nps with the biomass precipitating in the activated sludge reactors or anaerobic digesters barton et al 2015 hotze et al 2010 wang et al 2015 moreover higher conductivity in anaerobic sludge compared to waste sludge may also indicate a higher accumulation of metal based nps in the anaerobic digester table 2 conversely stabilization of particles has been observed in the presence of organic matter as dissolved organic carbon doc in water media either by steric hindrance or binding to the specific coatings wang et al 2015 influent post primary wastewater and effluent are streams with high doc 238 mg l 189 mg l and 11 5 mg l respectively in which would lead to more nps in suspension 3 2 calibration of spicp ms for consecutive elemental analysis to calibrate the spicp ms for nps analysis 100 ng l of 60 nm au nps and 100 ng l of 60 nm ag nps were used signal intensity of both au and ag were clearly differentiated from the ionic background fig 1 a the tra employed 100 μs was appropriate to observe the events separated from the baseline and signal corresponding to elements in solution fig 1b as reported previously keller et al 2018 montaño et al 2014 although the dwell time can be decreased to 100 μs to decrease the size detection limits of ag and tio2 nps hadioui et al 2019 maintaining the dwell time in 100 μs has been useful to improve the signal noise ratio when characterizing metal nps even at 10 fold higher solution concentration montaño et al 2014 regarding size of the reference material 60 nm au nps a gaussian distribution was exhibited with a mean of 59 4 nm fig 1c the calculated ηn of the reference material as well as particle density and analyte fraction table s2 were used to determine the size distribution of the spiked ag nps during the ag nps detection the dwell time at 100 μs was useful to differentiate the events particles after calibration the size distribution of 60 nm ag nps was also almost symmetric with a mean size of 60 3 nm thus the dwell time and calculated ηn were applied to other elements with the assumed densities and analyte mass fractions 3 3 metal based nanoparticles in wastewater difference between spicp ms and ier spicp ms the influence that the ier column have on np adsorption was evaluated by spiking ag nps in the collected samples and treating them with the ier recovery results indicated that after spike 100 ng l of ag nps the recovery of ag nps ranged from 85 6 to 94 2 table 3 besides there was not a significant relation between recovery percentages and sampling sites some studies with ag nps azimzada et al 2017 hadioui et al 2014 and zno nps hadioui et al 2015 found few interactions between the np concentrations and the chelex resin indicating that at most 10 of the particles were removed by the chelex resin hadioui et al 2015 pouran et al 2013 reported that zno nps can be adsorbed by chelex carboxyl group which in fact may occur for other metal based nps although the recoveries percentages of ag nps used as model nps in our study are acceptable for non analytical purposes nps based on other metal having specific coatings or with larger size could be more sensitive to the interactions with ier this study has the limitation of having evaluated the recovery of small size ag nps because the recovery of larger particles could be a function of their interaction with the resin the concentration and the size distribution of some nps could not include larger particles retained in the resin therefore it is highly recommended to carry out studies focused in the np recovery based on their size composition and coatings since the removal of nps based on different elements in the ier may occur pouran et al 2013 we based the comparison between spicp ms and ier spicp ms in the removal of dissolved content basis due to ionic content is a limitation for detection of nps the use of the ier before spicp ms analysis for wastewater samples notably reduced the ionic background concentration of the 13 elements evaluated in the wastewater figures s3 and s4 the 13 elements in the influent measured consecutively in a single run were divided into three levels a low concentration co cd au and ag b mid concentration ni mn cu zn and al and c high concentration ti fe ce and mg figures s3 and s4 after ier treatment the raw counts were reduced in the baseline this represents the partial or full removal of the dissolved fraction of the elements allowing better distinction of events particles during spicp ms reducing the solubilized analytes background in wastewater the counting of false positives was also reduced this has been also observed for ag nps hadioui et al 2014 even in wastewater azimzada et al 2017 our results also show that the removal of dissolved analytes was selective regarding wastewater stream and element fig 2 in general dissolved forms of the 13 elements in the influent were more removed 57 when compared to other wastewater sources and samples of sludges regarding the elements the divalent cations such as cu2 zn2 mg2 mn2 among others had higher affinity to the ier this is expected since the chelex resin has presented high affinity for these cations in freshwater bowles et al 2006 and seawater søndergaard et al 2015 with ion removal 80 in both cases the differential removal also reflects the complexity of the wastewater and sludge matrices and the fact that the concentration of dissolved analytes ions differed significantly prior to ier for the various elements as they are removed through the treatment processes via complexation adsorption precipitation etc the removal of the dissolved analytes fraction via ier influenced the size detection limit the size distribution and the calculated mean size for the various metal based nps the mean size decreased or increased depending on element wastewater stream and whether ier was used prior to spicp ms or not fig 3 in the case of the influent the wastewater with the highest content of analytes in solution nps size detection limit and size distribution were notably improved using the ier fig 4 moreover in the influent all metal based particles measured via ier spicp ms were 300 nm and almost all were 100 nm figure s5 for example nps based on al ag au ni cd and co were 60 nm fig 4 which are smaller than those detected without the resin this reflects the enhanced ability to detect small nps using ier for more than one element in a single run this is unlike when ier has been used for one element at a time azimzada et al 2017 related to the mean size of metal based nps in the influent the calculated mean size decreased for 12 of 13 elements determined via ier fig 3 this is in line with a previous study that measured smaller ag nps when using online chelex column prior to spicp ms hadioui et al 2014 in the particular case of mg and mn the high removal of ionic content dissolved forms of both elements by the ier in the 6 matrices fig 2 allowed to detect the smaller particles that were considered as ionic background and may explain why the mean size of np based on these elements decreased in all matrices hence this approach also is useful to measure smaller nps of the other analyzed elements in presence of high content of organic matter and major ions dissolved analytes removal results in a more accurate measurement of np size even in the presence of high content of organic matter e g influent and sludges the increase in the mean size of some nps in the other wastewater streams e g post primary effluent cannot be neglected agglomeration or aggregation is the most likely explanation since in these processes there is removal of both ionic content and organic matter the limited changes on the mean size of nps present in the reclaimed water also suggest the influence of organic matter and ionic strength on mean size variation since this filtered water contains the lowest levels of organic matter and conductivity values thus the change in measured mean size also depends on element and sample matrix although the use of ier spicp ms for partial removal of ionic background and the application of shorter dwell time allowed detection of smaller particles of analyzed 13 elements than reported by conventional spicp ms lee et al 2014 an improvement in the sensitivity is needed to detect the smaller particles than the current cut off point 3 4 incidence of nps in the wastewater treatment process ier spicp ms was applied to determine the nanoparticulate concentration for the 13 elements at various points in the wastewater treatment process it is important to mention that the concentration and types of nps in wastewater streams and sludge can be related to the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater flow of influent wastewater and to the treatment process and operating conditions e g hydraulic and sludge retention times although equalizer tanks can dampen flow variations variations in the content of some ions such as chlorine and sulfur could modify the composition of some metallic nanoparticles in the wastewater levard et al 2013 lombi et al 2013 sekine et al 2015 hence this limitation could affect the quantification of nanoparticles in the wastewater treatment process the measured nps concentrations do include the natural and engineered nps and does not include the particles that potentially were adsorbed by the ier as indicated in the previous section although some nps may include two or more elements bevers et al 2020 cervantes avilés et al 2019b gondikas et al 2018 kaegi et al 2013 kent et al 2014 the concentrations of nps reported in this study assume single element nps since the spicp ms measures one element at a time influent np concentrations were highest 1600 to 10 700 ng l for elements such as ti fe ce mg zn and cu fig 5 the concentration of ti based nps was the highest 10 700 ng l in the influent wastewater however this concentration is lower than that measured in the influent of a couple of wwtps in norway 154 34 µg l in lara and 188 44 µg l in høra respectively polesel et al 2018 and in other studies performed in wwtp influents in arizona which measured mean ti concentrations of 185 377 µg l westerhoff et al 2011 these values included the engineered and naturally occurring ti based nanoparticles such as ti silicate minerals the presence of aggregates based on cu fig 6 fe zn ti and si figure s6 were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray analysis eds performed in a pellet of the influent sample the high concentrations of such elements may include nps associated with suspended solids in wastewater li et al 2013 and also those nps related to both natural occurrence in local soils and nps with high use in applications likely they were released to wastewater keller and lazareva 2013 according to the concentration found after the conventional primary clarifier this unit was able to remove a substantial fraction of most metal based nps except for fe mn ni cd and al the removal of metal based nps such as ag based in primary treatment has been also reported to range between 3 and 92 in nine wwtps in germany li et al 2013 hence primary sludge from primary treatment can also be considered as the fate of nps although there was no significance difference p 0 05 in the concentration of nps based on fe mn ni cd and al between influent and post primary effluent as the wastewater treatment train progressed np concentrations decreased considerably for all 13 elements this was observed in the secondary effluent where the maximum np concentration was 1065 ng l for mg based nps and a minimum of 0 3 ng l for au based nps and in reclaimed water where only a few types of nps exceeded 100 ng l namely those based on cu 220 ng l fe 274 ng l ti 512 ng l and mg 710 ng l these nps can be considered as the major contributors to the nps in the environment especially to the aquatic ecosystems concentration of nps based on ag ti and zn are close to the values previously measured in wastewater influent and effluents 100 200 ng l of ag mitrano et al 2012 1500 12 ng l ti li et al 2013 and 50 ng l of zn hadioui et al 2015 the detected concentrations of nps in this and those studies are lower than that commonly applied in studies evaluating the ecotoxicological effects in model organisms therefore future studies in organisms exposed to treated effluents could consider these low concentrations in order to obtain a realistic scenario for organisms exposed to nps moreover these results indicate that conventional activated sludge treatment process followed by ultrafiltration systems is able to remove more than 88 of almost all evaluated the metal based nps reducing the potential their effects in the environment however wwtp based on other technologies such as coagulation flocculation trickling filters artificial wetlands among others should be evaluated in terms of nps occurrence removal and transformation of metal based nanoparticles after any technology applied in the wwtp facilities the accumulation of metal based nps downstream should also be evaluated as a realistic ecotoxicological scenario nps in the wastewater streams within a wwtp can include zero valent metals metal oxides metal sulfides and metal chlorides which are common stable forms of the metals kaegi et al 2013 lowry et al 2012a m d montaño et al 2014 their formation may vary due to aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the wwtp the concentration of major ligands as well as the kinetics of the transformations and the residence time of the nps in the treatment steps these factors can be considered when performing toxicological tests in scenarios that include effluent wastewater relating the measured concentrations of the metal based nps in this work with the predicted concentration ranges for wwtp effluent gottschalk et al 2013 hendren et al 2013 keller and lazareva 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 several metal nps are within the predicted scenario for nps based on ag ce ti and zn the measured values are within the predicted concentration range 0 1 600 ng l for effluent nps based on al and fe were present in lower concentration than predicted and cu based nps were in higher concentration than predicted reflecting higher use of cu based nps than estimated or more incidental nps based on cu in effluent water since there are no predicted or even detected concentrations of ni cd au co mg and mn this study also contributes evidence of their presence in wastewater influent and effluent it should be considered that mg compounds are added to the influent to increase the alkalinity and control the ph of the biological processes in wastewater treatment which likely results in the formation of mg based nps moreover the concentration of metal based nps in wastewater streams will also depend on geographical location and access to treatment facilities keller and lazareva 2013 sun et al 2014 removal of nps was observed along the wastewater treatment train the primary clarifier removed at least 10 of the initial load of most nps in the influent except for fe mn ni cd and al fig 7 after biological treatment nitrification and denitrification i e aerobic followed by anaerobic then reaeration and secondary clarifier total load removal was more than 80 for all metal based nps except for mg and ni after ultra filtration removal was 70 78 for mg ni and cd based nps and 88 99 for the rest of the elements considered given the high removal from influent to secondary effluent the majority of metal based nps transfer to the sludge as discussed below nps extracted from the waste activated sludge and anaerobic sludge using centrifugation 3800 g 10 min and 20 c represent around the 65 of np present in these matrices based on previous studies huang et al 2020 moreover the concentrations in the sludges may not reflect internalized or tightly adsorbed nps in the flocs polesel et al 2018 tuoriniemi et al 2017 which must be considered in our results despite this and as expected the content of metal based nps in the sludges was much higher than in the effluent due to their high removal in the biological processes fig 8 concentrations of metal based nps in the waste sludge ranged between 0 5 ng l for cd up to 10 970 ng l for fe the high content of fe can be attributed to its addition for phosphorous removal during the wastewater treatment process hence fe based nps are expected in the waste sludge the waste sludge is sent to the anaerobic digester where it is stored under reductive conditions for up to 10 days of hydraulic retention time this time allows the hetero aggregation settling accumulation and potential transformation of metal based nps due to the anaerobic conditions such as the steady negative redox potential 200 to 350 mv and the high alkalinity range of 2000 4000 mg caco3 l based on the results in the anaerobic digester the concentration of metal based nps can be divided into two groups of elements those with low concentration 10 400 ng l such as cd au al ag and co based nps and the second group with elements in high concentration 4600 39 900 ng l for ni mn cu zn mg ce fe and ti based nps after the anaerobic digester the main fates of these metal based nps are landfill and soil receiving biosolids lazareva and keller 2014 hence organisms in terrestrial ecosystems may be exposed to aged metal based nps and their transformation products via this pathway the mean size of the metal based nps in the wastewater varied as the treatment progresses fig 9 a in the influent and post primary there were no significant differences p 0 05 regarding mean size for all metal based nps except for fe ce and mg fig 9a however the mean size tended to decrease after biological treatment in the secondary effluent and in the reclaimed water ultra filtered by membrane with a pore size of 100 nm the mean np size did not change significantly p 0 05 some solubilization and transformation is expected to occur for several of these metal nps during aerobic conditions kaegi et al 2013 interactions with microorganisms tuoriniemi et al 2017 and interaction with major ligands ma et al 2013 in contrast the np size determined in the anaerobic sludge was smaller for almost all elements fig 9b the reducing conditions of the anaerobic digester may lead to the partial solubilization of some metal based nps or their transformation to more stable forms such as sulfides ma et al 2013 although the detection and quantification of metal based nps of upt 13 elements was better for ier spicp ms than spicp ms the application of new analytical techniques and novel approaches to detect quantify and differentiate from natural and engineered nanomaterials in the complex matrices is a research need to understand the real impacts on nanotechnology in aquatic ecosystems 4 conclusions the incidence of nps based on 13 different elements in different locations of a wwtp such as influent post primary effluent reclaimed water waste sludge and the anaerobic digester was determined via ier spicp ms the ier column removed more than 50 of the dissolved fraction of the metals which improved np size detection limits and limited over counting of false positives by reducing background levels the concentration of the 13 metal based nps measured in the influent ranged from 2 6 ng l for cd based nps up to 10 700 ng l for ti based nps the full scale wwtp removed between 84 and 99 of the metal based nps with the exception of mg ni and cd nps which were only removed 70 73 and 78 respectively the main fate of the 13 metal based nps was the anaerobic digester where concentrations ranged from 10 to 39 900 ng l for the different metal based nps size discrimination of nps was also observed along the wastewater treatment process with smaller particles detected in the effluent 20 180 nm than in the influent 20 300 nm for ti fe ce mg zn cu mn al and ni measured np concentrations in wwtp effluent were generally within predicted levels except for lower than predicted concentrations for al and fe and higher than predicted for cu based nps for np of ni cd au co mg and mn this study evidence their presence in wastewater influent and effluent and can be useful for risk assessment although in this work the incidence of nps determination did include natural and engineered np the approach done may provide valuable information regarding concentration and size distribution of nps from 13 elements that arrives to the environment via effluent and the sludge disposal declaration of competing

nanotechnology santa barbara ca 93106 usa corresponding author metal based nanoparticles nps can be found in wastewater streams which are significant pathways for the release of nps to the environment determination of the nps concentration in wastewater streams is important for performing appropriate ecotoxicological evaluations the aim of this work was to determine the incidence of nps from 13 different elements throughout the wastewater treatment process by using single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms the incidence was determined in samples of the influent post primary treatment and effluent of the activated sludge process as well as in the reclaimed water of a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp in addition concentration of nps was determined in the waste activated sludge and in the anaerobic digester the concentration of metal based nps in the influent wastewater were between 1 600 and 10 700 ng l for elements such as ti fe ce mg zn and cu while that for ni al ag au co and cd was below 100 ng l concentrations in reclaimed water ranged between 0 6 and 721 ng l ranked as mg ti fe cu ni ce zn mn al co ag cd au results indicated that the activated sludge process and reclaimed water system removed 84 99 of natural and engineered metal based nps from influent to reclaimed water except for mg ni and cd where the removal ranged from 70 to 78 the highest concentrations of nps were found in the waste activated sludge and anaerobic sludge ranging from 0 5 to 39 900 ng l the size distribution of nps differed in different wastewater streams within the wwtp resulting in smaller particles in the effluent 20 180 nm than in the influent 23 233 nm for most elements conversely nps were notably larger in the waste activated sludge samples than in the anaerobic sludge or wastewater since conditions in the secondary treatment lead to precipitation of several metal based nps the incidence of metal based nps from 13 elements in wastewater decreased significatively after the conventional wastewater treatment train however anaerobic digesters store high nps concentrations hence the disposal of sludge needs to take this into account to evaluate the risk of the release of nps to the environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wastewater sludge multi element determination rate of nps nps size distribution spicp ms 1 introduction confirming the presence of engineered or natural nanoparticles nps and monitoring their concentrations in the environment are essential to understand their potential implications in environmental matrices due to the wide range of applications of nps in daily life products e g textiles cleaning agents personal care products wastewater streams receive significant loads of nps with diverse composition and a wide range of concentrations according to predictions lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 although wastewater treatment plants wwtp can potentially remove over 90 of the influent load of several nps such as ag sio2 tio2 or ceo2 cervantes avilés et al 2018 westerhoff et al 2018 it is possible that the residual concentrations of some nps and transformation products in the effluent can affect some organisms in the aquatic ecosystems such as algae crustaceans and fish cells on the reproduction and growth stages georgantzopoulou et al 2018 since the fate of biosolids from wwtp are landfills incineration plants and agricultural soils keller and lazareva 2013 sun et al 2016 wang et al 2016 determining the nps concentration in the sludges of secondary treatment is also relevant and quite challenging due to high ratio of solid to liquid phases in the matrix and the physical chemical and biological interactions between nps and sludge of the wwtp to determine their risk accurate quantification of nps in wastewater and sludges is needed several methods used for nanometrology and characterization of nps after synthesis have been applied for measuring their

hadioui et al 2015 mitrano et al 2012 proulx et al 2016 in this technique the passage of a single np produces a flash of ions in the icp that generate a large transient signal acquisition and quantification of each of these events in time resolved acquisition tra mode allows the determination of the number of particles in a given sample volume laborda et al 2014 montaño et al 2014 the signal intensity of each measured np is then converted to a mass using information from a reference material e g au or ag nanoparticles the nebulization efficiency or transport efficiency assumptions

2020 hadioui et al 2015 besides previous studies have screened up to 40 elements in di water via spicp ms lee et al 2014 tuoriniemi et al 2012 one element per run was detected and quantified which entailed a long measurement time to perform the analysis for a wide range of elemental compositions of the nps until now measurements of several isotopes during a run for np detection have been achieved modifying a time of flight instrument with some trade offs such as data analysis lower sensitivity for some elements and drift borovinskaya et al 2013 hence the ability to detect several elements and isotopes in a single run using spicp ms can significantly reduce the overall run time and cost distinguishing np signals from the ionic background dissolved analyte is another issue when spicp ms is applied cornelis and hassellöv 2014 hadioui et al 2014 limiting the detection of small nps this is particularly challenging for samples with polydisperse np size distributions and for complex matrices such as biosolids that contains high ionic background to overcome these difficulties and provide extra information about nps discrimination and fractionation techniques as well as

one element at a time hadioui et al 2014 its application to detect multiple elements in wastewater has not been studied therefore the application and comparison of ier spicp ms and spicp ms for np detection and sizing in wastewater can contribute to understanding of the influence of ier when analyzing multiple elements determining detection thresholds and even to detect np based on elements without evidence of their presence in wastewater such as ni cd co mn and mg this could be possible due to the ier is able to adsorb multiple cations in a wide ph range 4 10 which covers the typical ph range of wastewater 6 8 the overall aim of this work was to determine the incidence of nps from 13 elements and their size distribution in samples from different locations within a wwtp such as influent post primary effluent reclaimed water waste activated sludge and the anaerobic digester the specific objectives were to 1 evaluate the use of ier before spicp ms to improve the quantification and sizing of nps based on 13 different elements by comparing its application with conventional spicp ms 2 determine the incidence of nps in the influent post primary effluent and reclaimed water of a full scale wwtp using the ier spicp ms approach and 3 determine the size distributions of the analyzed nps in collected samples at different locations of the wwtp the goal is to provide valuable information on the concentrations and size of these different nps in wastewater effluent and sludge for realistic risk assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ultrapure water di with a

conversion from raw signal to np size nebulization efficiency was 5 3 calculated based on the particle size method pace et al 2011 eq 1 shows the parameters considered for calculating η n where d s t

cm3 10 6 g µg to verify that data collection from the au np reference material was suitable for consecutive elemental analysis 100 ng l of the 60 nm ag nps was also spiked into the reference material

density ρ p is different for each of the 13 elements but constant for the same element and that the nps are spherical concentration of np c m was determined according to eq 4 where t is the acquisition time min per element 0 33 the particle densities and analyte mass fractions for the 13 types of nps are listed in the supporting information table s2 2 d 3 6 m p ρ p π 3 m p i p 1 s t d v

solubilization after processing based on the concentration of previous studies detecting nps in real wastewater cervantes avilés et al 2019a mitrano et al 2012 the samples and reference materials were diluted with di water to ensure np concentrations were between 10 and 100 ng l before dilution of the samples and again prior to the spicp ms analyses all suspensions were placed in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz to ensure that the samples were fully homogenized 2 4 procedure for detecting nps in wastewater and sludge samples the samples of wastewater and sludge were brought from 4 c to room temperature 20 c before analysis wastewater samples were vortexed then sieved through a 0 5 mm mesh sieve no 35 to avoid deposit build up in the sampler and skimmer cones tuoriniemi et al 2017 sludge samples were processed to extract metal containing nps according to our previous study huang et al 2020 briefly samples of waste sludge and anaerobic sludge were ultrasonicated 20 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz then samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g to separate the suspended biomass the supernatant of wastewater and anaerobic sludge were diluted 100 times with ultrapure water in order to evaluate the influence of using an ier for ions removal prior spicp ms analysis of multiple elements wastewater and sludge samples were divided in three sets the three sets of samples were ultrasonicated for 10 min at 280 w and a frequency of 40 khz it should be considered that sonication may influence dissolution and aggregation of nps taurozzi et al 2012 one set of samples was submitted immediately to the spicp ms for consecutively elemental analysis without passing through the ier column in the second set of samples was evaluated the removal of nps in the ier by spiking 100 ng l of ag in the collected samples then passing 5 ml of sample through the ier column packed with chelex 100 and finally analyzing them by spicp ms the third set of wastewater and sludge samples was also passed through the ier column packed with chelex 100 prior to spicp ms analysis for particle quantification before each sample run using the ier the column was regenerated by sequentially washing it with 5 ml of 1 m hcl 5 ml of di water at ph 7 5 ml of 1 m naoh and 5 ml of di water at ph 7 the spicp ms and ier spicp ms analyses were performed in triplicate and the results of mass concentration and mean size were the average of the replicates 3 results and discussion 3 1 wastewater treatment and sludge characteristics the wastewater treatment in the studied system effectively removed soluble carbon nitrogen and phosphorous table 2 several ligands and suspended solids related with particle stability hotze et al 2010 were measured a higher concentration of s2 was observed in the influent post primary wastewater and anaerobic sludge liquor compared to other locations hence sulfidation of metal based nps especially chalcophile elements e g cu zn cd ag is expected at these points due to long hydraulic retention times such as the secondary treatment 4 6 h and the anaerobic digester up to 10 d moreover the formation of sulfuric coatings on the surface of nps can suppress the release of ions from metal based nps made of chalcophile elements the interaction of other relevant ligand such as po4 3 with metal based nps has been reported as a stabilizing agent or even forming a shell of amorphous crystal in some nps rathnayake et al 2014 these processes can occur in high content phosphate streams such as the influent 16 8 mg po4 3 l and anaerobic sludge liquor 38 mg po4 3 l regarding the tss content the concentration found in the influent waste and anaerobic sludge were 354 mg l 6820 mg l and 25 300 mg l respectively the high concentration of tss in such points suggest the hetero aggregation of nps with the biomass precipitating in the activated sludge reactors or anaerobic digesters barton et al 2015 hotze et al 2010 wang et al 2015 moreover higher conductivity in anaerobic sludge compared to waste sludge may also indicate a higher accumulation of metal based nps in the anaerobic digester table 2 conversely stabilization of particles has been observed in the presence of organic matter as dissolved organic carbon doc in water media either by steric hindrance or binding to the specific coatings wang et al 2015 influent post primary wastewater and effluent are streams with high doc 238 mg l 189 mg l and 11 5 mg l respectively in which would lead to more nps in suspension 3 2 calibration of spicp ms for consecutive elemental analysis to calibrate the spicp ms for nps analysis 100 ng l of 60 nm au nps and 100 ng l of 60 nm ag nps were used signal intensity of both au and ag were clearly differentiated from the ionic background fig 1 a the tra employed 100 μs was appropriate to observe the events separated from the baseline and signal corresponding to elements in solution fig 1b as reported previously keller et al 2018 montaño et al 2014 although the dwell time can be decreased to 100 μs to decrease the size detection limits of ag and tio2 nps hadioui et al 2019 maintaining the dwell time in 100 μs has been useful to improve the signal noise ratio when characterizing metal nps even at 10 fold higher solution concentration montaño et al 2014 regarding size of the reference material 60 nm au nps a gaussian distribution was exhibited with a mean of 59 4 nm fig 1c the calculated ηn of the reference material as well as particle density and analyte fraction table s2 were used to determine the size distribution of the spiked ag nps during the ag nps detection the dwell time at 100 μs was useful to differentiate the events particles after calibration the size distribution of 60 nm ag nps was also almost symmetric with a mean size of 60 3 nm thus the dwell time and calculated ηn were applied to other elements with the assumed densities and analyte mass fractions 3 3 metal based nanoparticles in wastewater difference between spicp ms and ier spicp ms the influence that the ier column have on np adsorption was evaluated by spiking ag nps in the collected samples and treating them with the ier recovery results indicated that after spike 100 ng l of ag nps the recovery of ag nps ranged from 85 6 to 94 2 table 3 besides there was not a significant relation between recovery percentages and sampling sites some studies with ag nps azimzada et al 2017 hadioui et al 2014 and zno nps hadioui et al 2015 found few interactions between the np concentrations and the chelex resin indicating that at most 10 of the particles were removed by the chelex resin hadioui et al 2015 pouran et al 2013 reported that zno nps can be adsorbed by chelex carboxyl group which in fact may occur for other metal based nps although the recoveries percentages of ag nps used as model nps in our study are acceptable for non analytical purposes nps based on other metal having specific coatings or with larger size could be more sensitive to the interactions with ier this study has the limitation of having evaluated the recovery of small size ag nps because the recovery of larger particles could be a function of their interaction with the resin the concentration and the size distribution of some nps could not include larger particles retained in the resin therefore it is highly recommended to carry out studies focused in the np recovery based on their size composition and coatings since the removal of nps based on different elements in the ier may occur pouran et al 2013 we based the comparison between spicp ms and ier spicp ms in the removal of dissolved content basis due to ionic content is a limitation for detection of nps the use of the ier before spicp ms analysis for wastewater samples notably reduced the ionic background concentration of the 13 elements evaluated in the wastewater figures s3 and s4 the 13 elements in the influent measured consecutively in a single run were divided into three levels a low concentration co cd au and ag b mid concentration ni mn cu zn and al and c high concentration ti fe ce and mg figures s3 and s4 after ier treatment the raw counts were reduced in the baseline this represents the partial or full removal of the dissolved fraction of the elements allowing better distinction of events particles during spicp ms reducing the solubilized analytes background in wastewater the counting of false positives was also reduced this has been also observed for ag nps hadioui et al 2014 even in wastewater azimzada et al 2017 our results also show that the removal of dissolved analytes was selective regarding wastewater stream and element fig 2 in general dissolved forms of the 13 elements in the influent were more removed 57 when compared to other wastewater sources and samples of sludges regarding the elements the divalent cations such as cu2 zn2 mg2 mn2 among others had higher affinity to the ier this is expected since the chelex resin has presented high affinity for these cations in freshwater bowles et al 2006 and seawater søndergaard et al 2015 with ion removal 80 in both cases the differential removal also reflects the complexity of the wastewater and sludge matrices and the fact that the concentration of dissolved analytes ions differed significantly prior to ier for the various elements as they are removed through the treatment processes via complexation adsorption precipitation etc the removal of the dissolved analytes fraction via ier influenced the size detection limit the size distribution and the calculated mean size for the various metal based nps the mean size decreased or increased depending on element wastewater stream and whether ier was used prior to spicp ms or not fig 3 in the case of the influent the wastewater with the highest content of analytes in solution nps size detection limit and size distribution were notably improved using the ier fig 4 moreover in the influent all metal based particles measured via ier spicp ms were 300 nm and almost all were 100 nm figure s5 for example nps based on al ag au ni cd and co were 60 nm fig 4 which are smaller than those detected without the resin this reflects the enhanced ability to detect small nps using ier for more than one element in a single run this is unlike when ier has been used for one element at a time azimzada et al 2017 related to the mean size of metal based nps in the influent the calculated mean size decreased for 12 of 13 elements determined via ier fig 3 this is in line with a previous study that measured smaller ag nps when using online chelex column prior to spicp ms hadioui et al 2014 in the particular case of mg and mn the high removal of ionic content dissolved forms of both elements by the ier in the 6 matrices fig 2 allowed to detect the smaller particles that were considered as ionic background and may explain why the mean size of np based on these elements decreased in all matrices hence this approach also is useful to measure smaller nps of the other analyzed elements in presence of high content of organic matter and major ions dissolved analytes removal results in a more accurate measurement of np size even in the presence of high content of organic matter e g influent and sludges the increase in the mean size of some nps in the other wastewater streams e g post primary effluent cannot be neglected agglomeration or aggregation is the most likely explanation since in these processes there is removal of both ionic content and organic matter the limited changes on the mean size of nps present in the reclaimed water also suggest the influence of organic matter and ionic strength on mean size variation since this filtered water contains the lowest levels of organic matter and conductivity values thus the change in measured mean size also depends on element and sample matrix although the use of ier spicp ms for partial removal of ionic background and the application of shorter dwell time allowed detection of smaller particles of analyzed 13 elements than reported by conventional spicp ms lee et al 2014 an improvement in the sensitivity is needed to detect the smaller particles than the current cut off point 3 4 incidence of nps in the wastewater treatment process ier spicp ms was applied to determine the nanoparticulate concentration for the 13 elements at various points in the wastewater treatment process it is important to mention that the concentration and types of nps in wastewater streams and sludge can be related to the physicochemical characteristics of the wastewater flow of influent wastewater and to the treatment process and operating conditions e g hydraulic and sludge retention times although equalizer tanks can dampen flow variations variations in the content of some ions such as chlorine and sulfur could modify the composition of some metallic nanoparticles in the wastewater levard et al 2013 lombi et al 2013 sekine et al 2015 hence this limitation could affect the quantification of nanoparticles in the wastewater treatment process the measured nps concentrations do include the natural and engineered nps and does not include the particles that potentially were adsorbed by the ier as indicated in the previous section although some nps may include two or more elements bevers et al 2020 cervantes avilés et al 2019b gondikas et al 2018 kaegi et al 2013 kent et al 2014 the concentrations of nps reported in this study assume single element nps since the spicp ms measures one element at a time influent np concentrations were highest 1600 to 10 700 ng l for elements such as ti fe ce mg zn and cu fig 5 the concentration of ti based nps was the highest 10 700 ng l in the influent wastewater however this concentration is lower than that measured in the influent of a couple of wwtps in norway 154 34 µg l in lara and 188 44 µg l in høra respectively polesel et al 2018 and in other studies performed in wwtp influents in arizona which measured mean ti concentrations of 185 377 µg l westerhoff et al 2011 these values included the engineered and naturally occurring ti based nanoparticles such as ti silicate minerals the presence of aggregates based on cu fig 6 fe zn ti and si figure s6 were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray analysis eds performed in a pellet of the influent sample the high concentrations of such elements may include nps associated with suspended solids in wastewater li et al 2013 and also those nps related to both natural occurrence in local soils and nps with high use in applications likely they were released to wastewater keller and lazareva 2013 according to the concentration found after the conventional primary clarifier this unit was able to remove a substantial fraction of most metal based nps except for fe mn ni cd and al the removal of metal based nps such as ag based in primary treatment has been also reported to range between 3 and 92 in nine wwtps in germany li et al 2013 hence primary sludge from primary treatment can also be considered as the fate of nps although there was no significance difference p 0 05 in the concentration of nps based on fe mn ni cd and al between influent and post primary effluent as the wastewater treatment train progressed np concentrations decreased considerably for all 13 elements this was observed in the secondary effluent where the maximum np concentration was 1065 ng l for mg based nps and a minimum of 0 3 ng l for au based nps and in reclaimed water where only a few types of nps exceeded 100 ng l namely those based on cu 220 ng l fe 274 ng l ti 512 ng l and mg 710 ng l these nps can be considered as the major contributors to the nps in the environment especially to the aquatic ecosystems concentration of nps based on ag ti and zn are close to the values previously measured in wastewater influent and effluents 100 200 ng l of ag mitrano et al 2012 1500 12 ng l ti li et al 2013 and 50 ng l of zn hadioui et al 2015 the detected concentrations of nps in this and those studies are lower than that commonly applied in studies evaluating the ecotoxicological effects in model organisms therefore future studies in organisms exposed to treated effluents could consider these low concentrations in order to obtain a realistic scenario for organisms exposed to nps moreover these results indicate that conventional activated sludge treatment process followed by ultrafiltration systems is able to remove more than 88 of almost all evaluated the metal based nps reducing the potential their effects in the environment however wwtp based on other technologies such as coagulation flocculation trickling filters artificial wetlands among others should be evaluated in terms of nps occurrence removal and transformation of metal based nanoparticles after any technology applied in the wwtp facilities the accumulation of metal based nps downstream should also be evaluated as a realistic ecotoxicological scenario nps in the wastewater streams within a wwtp can include zero valent metals metal oxides metal sulfides and metal chlorides which are common stable forms of the metals kaegi et al 2013 lowry et al 2012a m d montaño et al 2014 their formation may vary due to aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the wwtp the concentration of major ligands as well as the kinetics of the transformations and the residence time of the nps in the treatment steps these factors can be considered when performing toxicological tests in scenarios that include effluent wastewater relating the measured concentrations of the metal based nps in this work with the predicted concentration ranges for wwtp effluent gottschalk et al 2013 hendren et al 2013 keller and lazareva 2013 lazareva and keller 2014 sun et al 2016 several metal nps are within the predicted scenario for nps based on ag ce ti and zn the measured values are within the predicted concentration range 0 1 600 ng l for effluent nps based on al and fe were present in lower concentration than predicted and cu based nps were in higher concentration than predicted reflecting higher use of cu based nps than estimated or more incidental nps based on cu in effluent water since there are no predicted or even detected concentrations of ni cd au co mg and mn this study also contributes evidence of their presence in wastewater influent and effluent it should be considered that mg compounds are added to the influent to increase the alkalinity and control the ph of the biological processes in wastewater treatment which likely results in the formation of mg based nps moreover the concentration of metal based nps in wastewater streams will also depend on geographical location and access to treatment facilities keller and lazareva 2013 sun et al 2014 removal of nps was observed along the wastewater treatment train the primary clarifier removed at least 10 of the initial load of most nps in the influent except for fe mn ni cd and al fig 7 after biological treatment nitrification and denitrification i e aerobic followed by anaerobic then reaeration and secondary clarifier total load removal was more than 80 for all metal based nps except for mg and ni after ultra filtration removal was 70 78 for mg ni and cd based nps and 88 99 for the rest of the elements considered given the high removal from influent to secondary effluent the majority of metal based nps transfer to the sludge as discussed below nps extracted from the waste activated sludge and anaerobic sludge using centrifugation 3800 g 10 min and 20 c represent around the 65 of np present in these matrices based on previous studies huang et al 2020 moreover the concentrations in the sludges may not reflect internalized or tightly adsorbed nps in the flocs polesel et al 2018 tuoriniemi et al 2017 which must be considered in our results despite this and as expected the content of metal based nps in the sludges was much higher than in the effluent due to their high removal in the biological processes fig 8 concentrations of metal based nps in the waste sludge ranged between 0 5 ng l for cd up to 10 970 ng l for fe the high content of fe can be attributed to its addition for phosphorous removal during the wastewater treatment process hence fe based nps are expected in the waste sludge the waste sludge is sent to the anaerobic digester where it is stored under reductive conditions for up to 10 days of hydraulic retention time this time allows the hetero aggregation settling accumulation and potential transformation of metal based nps due to the anaerobic conditions such as the steady negative redox potential 200 to 350 mv and the high alkalinity range of 2000 4000 mg caco3 l based on the results in the anaerobic digester the concentration of metal based nps can be divided into two groups of elements those with low concentration 10 400 ng l such as cd au al ag and co based nps and the second group with elements in high concentration 4600 39 900 ng l for ni mn cu zn mg ce fe and ti based nps after the anaerobic digester the main fates of these metal based nps are landfill and soil receiving biosolids lazareva and keller 2014 hence organisms in terrestrial ecosystems may be exposed to aged metal based nps and their transformation products via this pathway the mean size of the metal based nps in the wastewater varied as the treatment progresses fig 9 a in the influent and post primary there were no significant differences p 0 05 regarding mean size for all metal based nps except for fe ce and mg fig 9a however the mean size tended to decrease after biological treatment in the secondary effluent and in the reclaimed water ultra filtered by membrane with a pore size of 100 nm the mean np size did not change significantly p 0 05 some solubilization and transformation is expected to occur for several of these metal nps during aerobic conditions kaegi et al 2013 interactions with microorganisms tuoriniemi et al 2017 and interaction with major ligands ma et al 2013 in contrast the np size determined in the anaerobic sludge was smaller for almost all elements fig 9b the reducing conditions of the anaerobic digester may lead to the partial solubilization of some metal based nps or their transformation to more stable forms such as sulfides ma et al 2013 although the detection and quantification of metal based nps of upt 13 elements was better for ier spicp ms than spicp ms the application of new analytical techniques and novel approaches to detect quantify and differentiate from natural and engineered nanomaterials in the complex matrices is a research need to understand the real impacts on nanotechnology in aquatic ecosystems 4 conclusions the incidence of nps based on 13 different elements in different locations of a wwtp such as influent post primary effluent reclaimed water waste sludge and the anaerobic digester was determined via ier spicp ms the ier column removed more than 50 of the dissolved fraction of the metals which improved np size detection limits and limited over counting of false positives by reducing background levels the concentration of the 13 metal based nps measured in the influent ranged from 2 6 ng l for cd based nps up to 10 700 ng l for ti based nps the full scale wwtp removed between 84 and 99 of the metal based nps with the exception of mg ni and cd nps which were only removed 70 73 and 78 respectively the main fate of the 13 metal based nps was the anaerobic digester where concentrations ranged from 10 to 39 900 ng l for the different metal based nps size discrimination of nps was also observed along the wastewater treatment process with smaller particles detected in the effluent 20 180 nm than in the influent 20 300 nm for ti fe ce mg zn cu mn al and ni measured np concentrations in wwtp effluent were generally within predicted levels except for lower than predicted concentrations for al and fe and higher than predicted for cu based nps for np of ni cd au co mg and mn this study evidence their presence in wastewater influent and effluent and can be useful for risk assessment although in this work the incidence of nps determination did include natural and engineered np the approach done may provide valuable information regarding concentration and size distribution of nps from 13 elements that arrives to the environment via effluent and the sludge disposal declaration of competing

17341,with the fast development of peroxymonosulfate pms dominating processes in drinking water and wastewater treatment residual pms is easy to come across chlorine as these processes are usually followed by secondary chlorine disinfection the synergistic effect of pms and chlorine on the degradation of micro organic pollutants is investigated by selecting acetaminophen act as a reference compound for the first time in this study unlike conventional pms or chlorine activation which generates reactive species such as hydroxyl radical h o sulfate radical so 4 chlorine radical c l and singlet oxygen 1o2 the efficient act removal is attributed to the direct catalytic chlorination by pms due to the significantly enhanced consumption of chlorine along with negligible change of pms concentration at neutral condition and the same reaction pathways in both pms chlorine and chlorine processes the kinetic study demonstrates that act oxidation by pms chlorine follows second order reaction and the degradation efficiency can be promoted at alkaline conditions with peak rate constants at ph 9 0 10 0 the presence of chloride can enhance the removal of act while ammonium and humic acid significantly retard act degradation higher formation of selected disinfection by products dbps is observed in the pms chlorine process than in the sole chlorination this study highlights the important role of pms in organic pollutants degradation and dbps formation during the chlorination process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate chlorine acetaminophen disinfection by products 1 introduction in recent years the application of peroxides including peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in environmental pollution control has received considerable interest anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 li et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 advanced oxidation processes aops based on the activation of these oxidants show promising success in the elimination of refractory organic contaminants due to the production of high standard redox potentials of sulfate radical so 4 2 5 3 1v and hydroxyl radical h o 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 lee et al 2020 neta et al 1988 various strategies such as heat ultraviolet ultrasound transition metals or their combination are commonly used to generate these radicals by activating h2o2 pms and pds and the related activation mechanisms have been comprehensively studied ghanbari and moradi 2017 guan et al 2011 miller et al 2012 besides these catalytic methods the combination of strong oxidants has also been reported to generate reactive radicals for instance ozone o3 h2o2 combination was extensively used in drinking water treatment because the addition of h2o2 could promote the decay of o3 into h o merényi et al 2010 rosenfeldt et al 2006 a recent study reported that ozonation on para chlorobenzoic acid degradation could also be markedly enhanced in the presence of pms cong et al 2015 and the simultaneous generation of h o and so 4 during the reaction between o3 and pms was further confirmed yang et al 2015 these findings indicate that pms is much like h2o2 in its ability to accelerate the generation of radicals by decomposing o3 as another chemical oxidant with low cost and good disinfection ability chlorine is widely used to disinfect bacteria and prevent the growth of microorganisms in drinking water and municipal wastewater treatment deborde and von gunten 2008 pinkston and sedlak 2004 when radical or non radical oxidation processes based on h2o2 or pms are applied for water purification they are usually followed by secondary disinfection with the addition of chlorine indicating that there would be a huge possibility for the meet of residual h2o2 or pms with chlorine it has been proven that h2o2 could be oxidized by chlorine with the apparent rate constant of 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 resulting in the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 to some extent and the change of chlorination process held et al 1978 wang et al 2019 however little information is currently available on the effect of pms on the degradation of contaminants during the chlorination process recently a study has identified 1o2 when using pms chloridion process to treat the membrane filtration concentrate of coking wastewater wang and wang 2020 the authors speculated a pathway of 1o2 formation via the reaction between pms and hypochlorous acid hclo which still lacks solid evidence and needs to be further studied additionally chlorine can react with organic matters in water to produce lots of disinfection by products dbps which are potentially harmful to human beings and the environment ding et al 2020 gallard and von gunten 2002 previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of h2o2 can significantly change the production of dbps during the chlorination process albertin et al 1992 batterman et al 2000 therefore the introduction of pms into the chlorination process might also affect the generation of dbps which needs to be further disclosed based on the discussion above a research topic is proposed to make clear the role of pms in the degradation of micro organic pollutants and the formation of dbps during the chlorination process acetaminophen act a frequently detected pharmaceutical in aquatic environment was selected as the model contaminant in this study the potential oxidizing species generated in this process were studied by quenching tests and trapping methods and the underlying mechanism was tentatively proposed the degradation performance of act under various experimental conditions including ph temperature some water matrix bicarbonate nitrate chloride ammonium and humic acid was comprehensively studied moreover the kinetic model and the generation of dbps in the reaction process were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade at least without further purification

phosphate buffer for ph 6 8 and borate buffer for ph 9 10 the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 1 c by a water bath the target contaminants and pms at desired concentrations were introduced into the reaction solution and stirred continuously the reaction was then initialized by the addition of chlorine the solution ph was slightly adjusted by diluted sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide before the start of the reaction which was monitored and remained within 0 1 unit of the predetermined ph over the experiments at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate then the mixed samples were filtrated by 0 22 μm acetate fiber membranes and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the generation of common dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa trichloronitromethane tcnm and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone tcp in both chlorination and pms chlorine

bottles capped with teflon faced septa after incubated in the dark at 25 1 c for 4 hours samples were withdrawn and then quenched by excess ascorbic acid for dbps analysis all the experiments were

operational conditions are shown in text s2 solution ph was measured by a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa the concentrations of free chlorine and pms stock solutions were determined by the dpd fas titration method and a dpd colorimetric method respectively apha awwa wef 1998 gokulakrishnan et al 2016 the residual pms and chlorine during the reaction were analyzed by a spectrophotometer and the measurement details could be found in text s3 and fig s1 the possible intermediate products during the treatment of act were analyzed by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms detailed instrument information and operational parameters were summarized in text s4 the generation of reactive species in the reaction was verified through quenching experiments with the addition of methanol meoh and tertiary butanol tba and tests by applying benzoic acid ba and furfuryl alcohol ffa as chemical probes furthermore electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometry was used to record the signals of so 4 h o and 1o2 see text s5 for operational details dbps generation during the degradation of act by pms chlorine was analyzed by a gas chromatography gc 2014c shimadzu japan coupled with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm based on usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 domino et al 2003 munch and hautman 1995 the detailed procedures of the gc temperature program and the method detection limit can be found in our previous study ding et al 2020 a student s t test was used to evaluate the significance of observed difference between the dbps concentrations generated in pms chlorine and chlorine alone processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated degradation of act by pms chlorine the degradation efficiencies of act by pms alone chlorine alone and pms chlorine were comparatively evaluated at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of act by pms alone was less than 2 after 15 min indicating the negligible intrinsic oxidizing power of pms towards act within the predetermined time scale comparatively chlorine alone resulted in 61 6 removal of act which is consistent with a previous study that act could be directly oxidized by chlorine cao et al 2016 interestingly when chlorine and pms were introduced together the degradation of act was appreciably accelerated with the removal efficiency reaching 86 0 the acceleration was influenced by the change of pms concentration fig s2 and the reaction rate constants k obs increased from 0 0714 to 0 2899 min 1 with elevating pms dose from 0 to 1 mm table s1 these results suggest that the addition of pms has a reliable positive role in the removal of act which may be attributed to the activation of pms or other catalytic mechanisms 3 2 identification of reactive species so 4 and o h are usually reported to be the principal radicals in activated pms oxidation processes while o h or chlorine radical c l could be generated in the activated processes containing chlorine such as uv chlorine wacławek et al 2017 li et al 2016 o h so 4 and c l have been identified to be responsible for act oxidation in previous studies due to their high reactivity towards act tan et al 2014 yang et al 2016 meoh is considered to have high reactivity towards so 4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 o h k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and c l k 1 109 m 1 s 1 while tba is an effective scavenger for o h k 6 108 m 1 s 1 and c l k 3 108 m 1 s 1 but not for so 4 k 4 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 2000 buxton et al 1988 kong et al 2016 neta et al 1988 to distinguish the possible presence of these radicals 250 mm meoh and tba were separately introduced into the reaction solutions which theoretically can quench nearly all the target radicals text s6 as shown in fig 2 a meoh exhibited a negligible influence on the degradation of act while tba only partially inhibited act degradation declined by 15 6 compared to the control suggesting that o h so 4 and c l were not the dominant oxidants during this reaction to further confirm this ba was selected as a probe compound due to the quick reaction between ba and these three radicals 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 for o h 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 for so 4 and 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 for c l mártire et al 2001 neta et al 1977 fig s3a shows that the loss of ba was less than 2 after reaction for 15 min providing another evidence to rule out the involvement of these radical species for the accelerated degradation of act as the reaction between tba and chlorine has been reported mintz and walling 2003 the slight inhibition of act degradation by tba might be ascribed to the consumption of chlorine through the direct chlorination of tba which was verified by the continuously decrease of chlorine while tba was introduced into the pms chlorine system fig s3b and the insignificant consumption of chlorine in fig 3c see section 3 3 in addition to the radical induced oxidation the generation of 1o2 in the alternative non radical reaction was also proposed in some other activated pms processes which could selectively oxidize electron rich compounds such as bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and phenols luo et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 additionally a previous study hypothesized that the reaction between pms and chlorine might form 1o2 wang and wang 2020 therefore the formation of 1o2 and its possible role in act degradation by pms chlorine were evaluated ffa and sodium azide nan3 are reported to be classic probes for 1o2 detection because of the high rate constants 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 for ffa and 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 for nan3 respectively gsponer et al 1987 however nan3 can be destroyed quickly by reacting with chlorine via eq 1 betterton et al 2010 although ffa also shows high reactivity towards so 4 and o h zhou et al 2015 the interference by these radicals could be eliminated due to their nonexistence shown in fig 2a therefore ffa is selected as the target compound to identify the generation of 1o2 as shown in fig 2b ffa concentration decreased by 6 when pms and chlorine were separately used in contrast the combination of pms and chlorine remarkably removed ffa with a degradation efficiency of 58 3 the significant acceleration of ffa decomposition seems to support the production of 1o2 in the pms chlorine process 1 hocl 2 n 3 3 n 2 c l o h to further verify the potential generation of these reactive oxidizing species epr measurement was carried out with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol tmp as the spin trapping reagents dmpo is a commonly used probe for so 4 and o h due to the fast formation of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh which own typical peaks in epr spectrum ghanbari and moradi 2017 as a strong electrophile 1o2 could oxidize tmp to 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radical tmpn which can also be sensitively detected by epr li et al 2000 song et al 2006 in this work experiments of fe2 h2o2 and fe2 pms at ph 3 were conducted to generate o h and so 4 as the control samples as shown in fig 2c typical peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 assigned to dmpo oh were observed for both fe2 h2o2 and fe2 pms the signal of dmpo so4 was not found in the fe2 pms process which may be due to the quick hydrolysis and transformation from dmpo so4 to dmpo oh davies et al 1992 neither dmpo so4 nor dmpo oh signals were observed for pms alone and pms chlorine which further confirms the absence of o h and so 4 in the pms chlorine process with respect to the detection of 1o2 by tmp fig 2d no signal was found for chlorine alone in water while a typical three line epr spectrum with equal peak ratios corresponding to tpmn appeared for both pms alone and pms chlorine at comparable intensities indicating the no significant change of the formed 1o2 in these two systems the detection of 1o2 in the pms alone process was also found in previous studies which was attributed to the self decomposition of pms following eq 2 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 as alkaline condition is expected to benefit the formation of 1o2 when chlorine reacts with h2o2 held et al 1978 wang et al 2019 the variations of tmpn intensity in different processes at ph 7 0 and 10 0 were monitored as presented in fig s4a signals of tmpn in the pms chlorine process were significantly intensified with the elevation of ph however there was no obvious difference between the tmpn signals generated in pms alone and pms chlorine processes with reaction time prolonging from 5 to 15 min at ph 10 0 fig s4b this result indicates that the possible formed 1o2 in the pms chlorine process at ph 10 can be ascribed to the base activation of pms rather than the reaction between pms and chlorine these observations strongly suggest that the addition of chlorine to pms solution cannot promote the generation of 1o2 at neutral and alkaline conditions since pms alone cannot effectively degrade act fig 1 1o2 should not be the primary oxidant in the pms chlorine process at neutral condition aforementioned discussion evidenced the negligible role of reactive oxidizing species including so 4 o h c l and 1o2 in the pms chlorine process at neutral condition and there are other mechanisms taking responsibility for the accelerated act degradation 3 3 proposed mechanism for the accelerated degradation of act by pms chlorine another possible mechanism was the activation of pms by the transformation byproducts from the rapid chlorination of act fig 1 previous studies reported that benzoquinone bq was a typical product during the reaction between act and chlorine bedner and maccrehan 2006 xagoraraki et al 2008 additionally bq could also be generated through the oxidation of phenols by pms which is a good catalyst for activating pms to produce 1o2 zhou et al 2017 to explore the role of bq the formation of bq during act degradation by pms chlorine was monitored fig 3 a shows that bq was detected in different ph cases and its evolution showed quite different trends the concentration of bq continuously increased in the pms chlorine process with the reaction time extending at ph 7 when reaction ph was set at 10 bq increased rapidly to a maximum of 2 67 μm at the reaction time of 1 min and then gradually decreased to a very low level in the following time similar phenomenon could also be found during the degradation of phenols by pms at alkaline conditions which was attributed to the consumption of bq by activating pms li et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 fig 3b shows that the degradation of act by bq pms was only 5 at ph 7 even bq concentration was increased to 50 μm which reached 95 at ph 10 with 10 μm bq these results evidence that the activation of pms by bq was insignificant at neutral condition but it would play an important role for accelerated act degradation at alkaline condition the formation of 1o2 in the pms chlorine process containing act at ph 7 was also evaluated by epr as shown in fig s4c a very limited change of tmpn signals could be found in pms and pms chlorine solutions in addition the degradation of ffa was also enhanced by pms chlorine even though ffa doesn t contain phenolic functional groups fig 2b these results suggest that activation of pms by bq was not the main mechanism at ph 7 other transformation products of act in both pms chlorine and chlorine processes at ph 7 were also analyzed by lc ms mono and dichlorinated act dimers of act and act were identified as the main products in these two processes and the ms2 spectra of them were shown in figs s5 s8 these products seem to have no ability to trigger the activation of pms combining with the limited participation of bq the role of transformation byproducts for the accelerated act degradation at ph 7 could be ruled out to further investigate the possible interaction between pms and chlorine the consumptions of chlorine and pms during the reaction were separately determined as shown in fig 3c limited consumptions of pms and chlorine less than 3 in 15 min were observed in the solution without act at ph 7 and 10 suggesting that pms cannot directly react with chlorine at both neutral and alkaline conditions which can rule out the speculation that the possible reaction between pms and chlorine caused the accelerated act degradation in the pms chlorine process fig 3d shows that pms concentration kept stable and chlorine consumption reached 42 2 μm after reaction for 15 min when pms alone and chlorine alone were individually applied to react with act at neutral condition which are in line with the degradation performance of act by pms alone and chlorine alone fig 1 respectively interestingly when pms chlorine and act were mixed together pms concentration was still almost unchanged while chlorine consumption was elevated to 74 2 μm the decay of chlorine in chlorine alone and pms chlorine processes followed pseudo first order reaction in kinetics with the rate constants being 0 0386 and 0 1043 min 1 respectively fig s10 catalyst is defined as any substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without getting consumed in catalytic chemistry ludwig and schindler 2017 figs 1 and 3d point out a result that faster act degradation and chlorine decomposition could be achieved in the presence of pms whose concentration kept relatively stable this shows that pms seems to serve as a homogeneous catalyst in this process which is line with the role of pms reported in some previous studies for the synthesis of organic chemicals hou et al 2018 zhang and du 2009 in addition aforementioned discussion proves that there were no different transformation products from act degradation in both pms chlorine and chlorine alone processes thus it is possible that the degradation of act in these two processes followed the same reaction pathway fig s9 this result suggests that chlorine was the main substance reacting with act in the pms chlorine process and pms catalytic chlorination should be the main mechanism for the acceleration of act degradation at neutral condition 3 4 kinetics for act degradation in the pms chlorine process to further support the pms catalytic chlorination of act the kinetics of act degradation by pms chlorine was studied at ph 7 0 fig 4 a shows good linear relationships between the reaction time and the logarithm of the ratio of act concentration to initial act concentration c c0 under different chlorine dosages 50 200 μm illustrating that the degradation process could be described by pseudo first order kinetics additionally the relationship between k obs and the initial chlorine concentration chlorine 0 was further evaluated and the result indicates that ln k obs was linearly related to ln chlorine 0 r2 0 992 with a slope approximating 1 046 fig 4b shows that the chlorine decay was also positively dependent on the initial act concentration act 0 and the slope of the fitting liner curve ln k obs vs ln act 0 k obs represents the observed chlorine decomposition rate constant was 0 567 as shown in fig 4c elevating initial pms dosages pms 0 significantly improved the decomposition of chlorine and the value of ln k obs was linearly correlated to ln pms 0 with a slope of 0 442 the overall reaction rate v in the ternary system involving chlorine pms and act could be explained by eq 3 where n1 n2 and n3 are reaction orders in the concentrations of chlorine 1 046 pms 0 442 and act 0 567 respectively according to the results shown in fig 4 k is the apparent reaction rate constant whose value was calculated to be 0 5 0 01 10 3 μm 1 min 1 text s7 then the overall reaction in this work can be described as eq 4 with a unit of μm min 1 the sum of these three reaction orders i e n1 n2 n3 is approximate to 2 implying that the overall reaction rate is in seconder order which is consistent with that in the chlorination of act cao et al 2016 the calculation of the kinetics for act degradation further evidences the intrinsic chemical process in the pms chlorine system is the direct chlorination of act with pms acting as a catalyst 3 v d chlorine dt d act dt k chlorine n 1 pms n 2 act n 3 4 v 0 0005 chlorine 1 046 pms 0 442 act 0 567 3 5 influence of solution ph the influence of solution ph on act degradation in the pms chlorine process were evaluated in the selected ph range of 4 0 10 0 as shown in fig 5 act was hardly removed at ph 4 and 5 with the final degradation efficiency being only 7 5 and 13 2 respectively as solution ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the degradation of act significantly raised to 98 2 in only 5 min however further elevation of ph to 10 partly inhibited act degradation which was still much higher than that at acidic and neutral conditions this indicates that higher solution ph could facilitate the oxidation of act in the pms chlorine process which is in line with the result in the sole chlorination of act cao et al 2016 the depletion of pms and chlorine during the reaction was also investigated as shown in fig s11a the consumption of chlorine was significantly enhanced by increasing ph from 7 0 to 9 0 and then slightly suppressed with further elevating ph to 10 0 which is in accordance with the result of act degradation under these conditions different from the stable presence of pms at ph 7 0 alkaline conditions obviously promoted the decay of pms with the final consumption efficiencies being 40 2 at ph 9 and 59 2 at ph 10 respectively fig s11b ph had multiple impacts on the reaction which could be related to the variations of chlorine pms and act species the ionization constant of hclo pk hclo was 7 54 at 25 c deborde and von gunten 2008 indicating that the fraction of cl o will be promoted with the raise of solution ph compared to hclo cl o is more reactive towards act which can result in the increase of act removal at alkaline conditions cao et al 2016 however molecular act could be deprotonated with pk a 9 7 sorasuchart et al 1999 the electrostatic repulsion between cl o and anionic act was enhanced at ph 10 which could hinder the reaction between chlorine and act and then decreased act degradation previous studies reported that pms could be activated by base qi et al 2016 which might play a role in the pms chlorine process to make clear this the pms decomposition and act degradation by pms alone at different ph were explored fig s12 shows that negligible variations of pms and act could be observed at ph 9 0 while a quite small decrease of act 8 and pms 5 occurred at ph 10 0 this result strongly suggests that the base activation of pms was insignificant and had limited influence on the degradation of act in this experiment thus the enhanced consumption of pms at alkaline conditions can be ascribed to the activation by bq which is in line with the results in figs 3a and 3b as pms whose concentration was positively correlated to act degradation in the pms chlorine process has been considered as a catalyst for the chlorination of act the significant decrease of pms concentration at ph 10 0 may also contribute to the inhibition of chlorine consumption and act degradation when ph was elevated from 9 0 to 10 0 therefore the catalytic effect of pms on chlorine and activation of pms by quinone intermediates should co exist in the pms chlorine process at alkaline conditions 3 6 effect of water matrix anions are ubiquitous in surface water and wastewater which usually play important roles in the degradation of organic pollutants in the oxidation process wang and wang 2018 in this study the effects of bicarbonate hco 3 nitrate no 3 and chloride c l on the degradation of act by pms chlorine were investigated as shown in fig 6 a negligible influence could be observed with the addition of hco 3 at different concentrations 0 4 mm which is contrary to its common inhibitory performance in aops by reacting with so 4 h o and c l to generate low reactive co 3 fang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 this further proves the absence of those radicals in this study similar phenomenon can be found by increasing the concentration of no 3 from 0 to 80 mm fig s13a these results also demonstrate that act degradation by pms chlorine was independent from the solution s ionic strength which could eliminate the possibility that the accelerated degradation of act was attributed to the increase of ionic strength with the addition of pms fig 6b provides the degradation efficiency of act in the presence of c l with various concentrations 0 10 mm the result shows that 1 mm c l markedly facilitated the degradation of act from 86 0 to 92 3 and further improvement of the acceleration could be achieved with increasing c l concentration from 1 to 10 mm previous studies demonstrated that c l could be directly oxidized to hclo by pms which enhanced the inactivation of bacteria and removal of some pollutants delcomyn et al 2006 zhou et al 2018 this would be the main reason for the promotional effect of c l in this study which was supported by the increased residual chlorine and enhanced pms consumption with the increase of c l fig s14a furthermore this study suggests that chlorine formed through the reaction between cl and pms may play a stronger role than ever expected in the degradation of some contaminates by pms dominated aops due to the pms catalytic effect on chlorination ammonium nh 4 and ha were also the common influencing factors in the chlorination process as presented in fig s13b the removal efficiency of act decreased from 86 to 7 2 as the concentration of nh 4 raised from 0 to 80 μm at the selected experimental conditions although chlorine owns negligible reactivity with nh 4 species nh 4 can be deprotonated to form n h 3 and then reacts with chlorine to induce the formation of chloramines deborde and von gunten 2008 the conversion from free chlorine to chloramines with lower oxidative properties was enhanced with the increase of nh 4 which was expected to take responsibility for the inhibitory degradation of act fig s13c displays that act degradation had inconspicuous change during the first 3 min but decreased by 4 8 8 17 5 and 34 4 after 15 min while the addition of ha was 10 20 40 and 80 mg l respectively fig s14b shows that the addition of ha accelerated chlorine decomposition but had no influence on pms concentration at the end of the reaction revealing that the activation of pms by quinone like groups in ha was insignificant and the competition of chlorine by ha should be the primary reason for the inhibition of act degradation the influence of reaction temperature on act degradation was also studied the temperature range of 15 35 c was chosen to avoid the thermal activation of pms qi et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 fig s13d shows that k obs of act degradation increased with the promotion of temperature and the relationship between k obs and reaction temperature was fitted well the activation energy of act degradation in the pms chlorine process was calculated to be 37 38 kj mol based on the arrhenius equation which was lower than that obtained in a previous study for the chlorination of act 41 2 kj mol cao et al 2016 this also demonstrates the catalytic performance of pms on chlorine for act degradation additionally when aops based on pms were applied in water purification residual pms can easily encounter chlorine in the disinfection process thus the performance of act degradation was also elucidated by adding 50 μm act in real water samples collected from filter tank effluents in a drinking water treatment plant and secondary sedimentation effluents in a wastewater treatment plant at wuhan china respectively the water quality of these real water samples could be found in table s2 fig s15 displays that the removal of act was inhibited in real water compared to that in ultrapure water which might be ascribed to the co existing organic compounds and other background species nevertheless high act removal can be achieved in these two real water samples 82 2 for real drinking water and 70 4 for real wastewater indicating that act could be effectively degraded by pms chlorine in practical water treatment process 3 7 formation of dbps during the chlorination in the presence of pms the presence of pms accelerated the degradation of act by chlorine which might also vary the formation of dbps therefore the quantities of selected dbps generated during pms chlorine and chlorine processes were compared to monitor the dbps formation in practical process actual waters from secondary sedimentation effluents in a wastewater treatment plant were chosen as background and the result was shown in fig 7 during the chlorination of wastewater samples the presence of pms had no influence on the formation of tcm with p value 0 5 table s3 which resulted in the significant increase of dcaa 35 6 tcaa 28 8 tcnm 64 7 and tcp 34 6 the generation of most dbps except for tcp was enhanced with the addition of act in wastewater samples during the chlorination process which is consistent with the findings in a previous study that act and its transformation products are also the potential precursors of dbps ding et al 2018 when it comes to the chlorination of wastewater samples containing act the concentrations of tcm dcaa tcaa and tcnm increased by 43 7 147 9 45 9 and 181 7 respectively after the addition of pms the chlorine consumption in different processes were also monitored interestingly fig s16 shows that residual chlorine in the pms chlorine process was higher than that in the chlorine alone process no matter act was present or not which is contrary to the enhanced generation of dbps in the pms chlorine process this might be attributed to the reactions of background species in the collected wastewater samples such as c l and ha with pms and chlorine combined with the fact that most p values were less than 0 05 table s3 it is concluded that the addition of pms promoted the formation of these selected dbps in real water samples which is possibly resulted by the rising reactivity of chlorine towards pollutants in the presence pms and other complex contribution from the substances in real wastewater 4 conclusions the accelerated degradation of micro organic pollutants by pms chlorine at neutral condition was firstly reported in this study with selecting act as a reference compound the intrinsic mechanism was proven to be pms catalytic chlorination rather than the generation of reactive radicals a second order kinetic model was established to describe the degradation of act in the pms chlorine process the degradation efficiency presented a significant increase in the ph range of 4 0 9 0 and then a decrease with further increasing solution ph to 10 0 both nh 4 and ha inhibited act degradation while c l markedly promoted the removal of act furthermore the presence of pms during the chlorination of real water facilitated the generation of most selected dbps this work provides a novel view to the important role of pms during the chlorination process which should be taken into consideration in practical water and wastewater

17341,with the fast development of peroxymonosulfate pms dominating processes in drinking water and wastewater treatment residual pms is easy to come across chlorine as these processes are usually followed by secondary chlorine disinfection the synergistic effect of pms and chlorine on the degradation of micro organic pollutants is investigated by selecting acetaminophen act as a reference compound for the first time in this study unlike conventional pms or chlorine activation which generates reactive species such as hydroxyl radical h o sulfate radical so 4 chlorine radical c l and singlet oxygen 1o2 the efficient act removal is attributed to the direct catalytic chlorination by pms due to the significantly enhanced consumption of chlorine along with negligible change of pms concentration at neutral condition and the same reaction pathways in both pms chlorine and chlorine processes the kinetic study demonstrates that act oxidation by pms chlorine follows second order reaction and the degradation efficiency can be promoted at alkaline conditions with peak rate constants at ph 9 0 10 0 the presence of chloride can enhance the removal of act while ammonium and humic acid significantly retard act degradation higher formation of selected disinfection by products dbps is observed in the pms chlorine process than in the sole chlorination this study highlights the important role of pms in organic pollutants degradation and dbps formation during the chlorination process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords peroxymonosulfate chlorine acetaminophen disinfection by products 1 introduction in recent years the application of peroxides including peroxymonosulfate pms peroxydisulfate pds hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in environmental pollution control has received considerable interest anipsitakis and dionysiou 2003 li et al 2018 wang and wang 2018 advanced oxidation processes aops based on the activation of these oxidants show promising success in the elimination of refractory organic contaminants due to the production of high standard redox potentials of sulfate radical so 4 2 5 3 1v and hydroxyl radical h o 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 lee et al 2020 neta et al 1988 various strategies such as heat ultraviolet ultrasound transition metals or their combination are commonly used to generate these radicals by activating h2o2 pms and pds and the related activation mechanisms have been comprehensively studied ghanbari and moradi 2017 guan et al 2011 miller et al 2012 besides these catalytic methods the combination of strong oxidants has also been reported to generate reactive radicals for instance ozone o3 h2o2 combination was extensively used in drinking water treatment because the addition of h2o2 could promote the decay of o3 into h o merényi et al 2010 rosenfeldt et al 2006 a recent study reported that ozonation on para chlorobenzoic acid degradation could also be markedly enhanced in the presence of pms cong et al 2015 and the simultaneous generation of h o and so 4 during the reaction between o3 and pms was further confirmed yang et al 2015 these findings indicate that pms is much like h2o2 in its ability to accelerate the generation of radicals by decomposing o3 as another chemical oxidant with low cost and good disinfection ability chlorine is widely used to disinfect bacteria and prevent the growth of microorganisms in drinking water and municipal wastewater treatment deborde and von gunten 2008 pinkston and sedlak 2004 when radical or non radical oxidation processes based on h2o2 or pms are applied for water purification they are usually followed by secondary disinfection with the addition of chlorine indicating that there would be a huge possibility for the meet of residual h2o2 or pms with chlorine it has been proven that h2o2 could be oxidized by chlorine with the apparent rate constant of 3 0 103 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 5 resulting in the production of singlet oxygen 1o2 to some extent and the change of chlorination process held et al 1978 wang et al 2019 however little information is currently available on the effect of pms on the degradation of contaminants during the chlorination process recently a study has identified 1o2 when using pms chloridion process to treat the membrane filtration concentrate of coking wastewater wang and wang 2020 the authors speculated a pathway of 1o2 formation via the reaction between pms and hypochlorous acid hclo which still lacks solid evidence and needs to be further studied additionally chlorine can react with organic matters in water to produce lots of disinfection by products dbps which are potentially harmful to human beings and the environment ding et al 2020 gallard and von gunten 2002 previous studies have demonstrated that the addition of h2o2 can significantly change the production of dbps during the chlorination process albertin et al 1992 batterman et al 2000 therefore the introduction of pms into the chlorination process might also affect the generation of dbps which needs to be further disclosed based on the discussion above a research topic is proposed to make clear the role of pms in the degradation of micro organic pollutants and the formation of dbps during the chlorination process acetaminophen act a frequently detected pharmaceutical in aquatic environment was selected as the model contaminant in this study the potential oxidizing species generated in this process were studied by quenching tests and trapping methods and the underlying mechanism was tentatively proposed the degradation performance of act under various experimental conditions including ph temperature some water matrix bicarbonate nitrate chloride ammonium and humic acid was comprehensively studied moreover the kinetic model and the generation of dbps in the reaction process were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade at least without further purification and the information of them is described in text s1 all the chemical solutions were prepared by dissolving powder or liquid in ultrapure water produced by a water purified system micropure uv thermo fisher scientific usa humic acid ha stock solution 1 g l was prepared by dissolving 0 5 g of powder ha in 400 ml naoh 0 01 mol l and stirring for 24 h followed by adjusting ph to 7 0 and being diluted to 500 ml cheng et al 2016 2 2 experimental procedures the experiments were carried out in a conical flask filled with 100 ml reaction solution containing 5 mm buffer acetate buffer for ph 4 5 phosphate buffer for ph 6 8 and borate buffer for ph 9 10 the reaction temperature was maintained at 25 1 c by a water bath the target contaminants and pms at desired concentrations were introduced into the reaction solution and stirred continuously the reaction was then initialized by the addition of chlorine the solution ph was slightly adjusted by diluted sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide before the start of the reaction which was monitored and remained within 0 1 unit of the predetermined ph over the experiments at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn from the reaction solution and quenched with excess sodium thiosulfate then the mixed samples were filtrated by 0 22 μm acetate fiber membranes and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the generation of common dbps including trichloromethane tcm dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa trichloronitromethane tcnm and 1 1 1 trichloro 2 propanone tcp in both chlorination and pms chlorine processes were evaluated through the following procedures mixed solutions containing chlorine 0 5 mm act 0 50 µm pms 0 2 5 mm and phosphate buffer 20 mm ph 7 0 were introduced into 100 ml amber glass bottles capped with teflon faced septa after incubated in the dark at 25 1 c for 4 hours samples were withdrawn and then quenched by excess ascorbic acid for dbps analysis all the experiments were conducted at least two times and the error bars shown in the figures represent the mean deviations of the replicated experimental data 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of target compounds were analyzed by a hplc lc 16 shimadzu japan coupled with a reverse phased xdb c18 column 5 μm particle size 4 6 mm 150 mm waters usa and a uv detector spd 16 shimadzu japan the details of the operational conditions are shown in text s2 solution ph was measured by a ph meter starter 3100 ohaus usa the concentrations of free chlorine and pms stock solutions were determined by the dpd fas titration method and a dpd colorimetric method respectively apha awwa wef 1998 gokulakrishnan et al 2016 the residual pms and chlorine during the reaction were analyzed by a spectrophotometer and the measurement details could be found in text s3 and fig s1 the possible intermediate products during the treatment of act were analyzed by a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms detailed instrument information and operational parameters were summarized in text s4 the generation of reactive species in the reaction was verified through quenching experiments with the addition of methanol meoh and tertiary butanol tba and tests by applying benzoic acid ba and furfuryl alcohol ffa as chemical probes furthermore electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectrometry was used to record the signals of so 4 h o and 1o2 see text s5 for operational details dbps generation during the degradation of act by pms chlorine was analyzed by a gas chromatography gc 2014c shimadzu japan coupled with an electron capture detector ecd and a hp 5 fused silica capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm id 0 25 μm based on usepa methods 551 1 and 552 3 domino et al 2003 munch and hautman 1995 the detailed procedures of the gc temperature program and the method detection limit can be found in our previous study ding et al 2020 a student s t test was used to evaluate the significance of observed difference between the dbps concentrations generated in pms chlorine and chlorine alone processes 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated degradation of act by pms chlorine the degradation efficiencies of act by pms alone chlorine alone and pms chlorine were comparatively evaluated at ph 7 0 as shown in fig 1 the degradation of act by pms alone was less than 2 after 15 min indicating the negligible intrinsic oxidizing power of pms towards act within the predetermined time scale comparatively chlorine alone resulted in 61 6 removal of act which is consistent with a previous study that act could be directly oxidized by chlorine cao et al 2016 interestingly when chlorine and pms were introduced together the degradation of act was appreciably accelerated with the removal efficiency reaching 86 0 the acceleration was influenced by the change of pms concentration fig s2 and the reaction rate constants k obs increased from 0 0714 to 0 2899 min 1 with elevating pms dose from 0 to 1 mm table s1 these results suggest that the addition of pms has a reliable positive role in the removal of act which may be attributed to the activation of pms or other catalytic mechanisms 3 2 identification of reactive species so 4 and o h are usually reported to be the principal radicals in activated pms oxidation processes while o h or chlorine radical c l could be generated in the activated processes containing chlorine such as uv chlorine wacławek et al 2017 li et al 2016 o h so 4 and c l have been identified to be responsible for act oxidation in previous studies due to their high reactivity towards act tan et al 2014 yang et al 2016 meoh is considered to have high reactivity towards so 4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 o h k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and c l k 1 109 m 1 s 1 while tba is an effective scavenger for o h k 6 108 m 1 s 1 and c l k 3 108 m 1 s 1 but not for so 4 k 4 105 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 2000 buxton et al 1988 kong et al 2016 neta et al 1988 to distinguish the possible presence of these radicals 250 mm meoh and tba were separately introduced into the reaction solutions which theoretically can quench nearly all the target radicals text s6 as shown in fig 2 a meoh exhibited a negligible influence on the degradation of act while tba only partially inhibited act degradation declined by 15 6 compared to the control suggesting that o h so 4 and c l were not the dominant oxidants during this reaction to further confirm this ba was selected as a probe compound due to the quick reaction between ba and these three radicals 4 2 109 m 1 s 1 for o h 1 2 109 m 1 s 1 for so 4 and 1 8 1010 m 1 s 1 for c l mártire et al 2001 neta et al 1977 fig s3a shows that the loss of ba was less than 2 after reaction for 15 min providing another evidence to rule out the involvement of these radical species for the accelerated degradation of act as the reaction between tba and chlorine has been reported mintz and walling 2003 the slight inhibition of act degradation by tba might be ascribed to the consumption of chlorine through the direct chlorination of tba which was verified by the continuously decrease of chlorine while tba was introduced into the pms chlorine system fig s3b and the insignificant consumption of chlorine in fig 3c see section 3 3 in addition to the radical induced oxidation the generation of 1o2 in the alternative non radical reaction was also proposed in some other activated pms processes which could selectively oxidize electron rich compounds such as bisphenol a sulfamethoxazole and phenols luo et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2017 additionally a previous study hypothesized that the reaction between pms and chlorine might form 1o2 wang and wang 2020 therefore the formation of 1o2 and its possible role in act degradation by pms chlorine were evaluated ffa and sodium azide nan3 are reported to be classic probes for 1o2 detection because of the high rate constants 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 for ffa and 1 0 109 m 1 s 1 for nan3 respectively gsponer et al 1987 however nan3 can be destroyed quickly by reacting with chlorine via eq 1 betterton et al 2010 although ffa also shows high reactivity towards so 4 and o h zhou et al 2015 the interference by these radicals could be eliminated due to their nonexistence shown in fig 2a therefore ffa is selected as the target compound to identify the generation of 1o2 as shown in fig 2b ffa concentration decreased by 6 when pms and chlorine were separately used in contrast the combination of pms and chlorine remarkably removed ffa with a degradation efficiency of 58 3 the significant acceleration of ffa decomposition seems to support the production of 1o2 in the pms chlorine process 1 hocl 2 n 3 3 n 2 c l o h to further verify the potential generation of these reactive oxidizing species epr measurement was carried out with 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo and 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol tmp as the spin trapping reagents dmpo is a commonly used probe for so 4 and o h due to the fast formation of dmpo so4 and dmpo oh which own typical peaks in epr spectrum ghanbari and moradi 2017 as a strong electrophile 1o2 could oxidize tmp to 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol n oxyl radical tmpn which can also be sensitively detected by epr li et al 2000 song et al 2006 in this work experiments of fe2 h2o2 and fe2 pms at ph 3 were conducted to generate o h and so 4 as the control samples as shown in fig 2c typical peaks with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 assigned to dmpo oh were observed for both fe2 h2o2 and fe2 pms the signal of dmpo so4 was not found in the fe2 pms process which may be due to the quick hydrolysis and transformation from dmpo so4 to dmpo oh davies et al 1992 neither dmpo so4 nor dmpo oh signals were observed for pms alone and pms chlorine which further confirms the absence of o h and so 4 in the pms chlorine process with respect to the detection of 1o2 by tmp fig 2d no signal was found for chlorine alone in water while a typical three line epr spectrum with equal peak ratios corresponding to tpmn appeared for both pms alone and pms chlorine at comparable intensities indicating the no significant change of the formed 1o2 in these two systems the detection of 1o2 in the pms alone process was also found in previous studies which was attributed to the self decomposition of pms following eq 2 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2018 2 hso 5 so 5 2 hso 4 so 4 2 1 o 2 as alkaline condition is expected to benefit the formation of 1o2 when chlorine reacts with h2o2 held et al 1978 wang et al 2019 the variations of tmpn intensity in different processes at ph 7 0 and 10 0 were monitored as presented in fig s4a signals of tmpn in the pms chlorine process were significantly intensified with the elevation of ph however there was no obvious difference between the tmpn signals generated in pms alone and pms chlorine processes with reaction time prolonging from 5 to 15 min at ph 10 0 fig s4b this result indicates that the possible formed 1o2 in the pms chlorine process at ph 10 can be ascribed to the base activation of pms rather than the reaction between pms and chlorine these observations strongly suggest that the addition of chlorine to pms solution cannot promote the generation of 1o2 at neutral and alkaline conditions since pms alone cannot effectively degrade act fig 1 1o2 should not be the primary oxidant in the pms chlorine process at neutral condition aforementioned discussion evidenced the negligible role of reactive oxidizing species including so 4 o h c l and 1o2 in the pms chlorine process at neutral condition and there are other mechanisms taking responsibility for the accelerated act degradation 3 3 proposed mechanism for the accelerated degradation of act by pms chlorine another possible mechanism was the activation of pms by the transformation byproducts from the rapid chlorination of act fig 1 previous studies reported that benzoquinone bq was a typical product during the reaction between act and chlorine bedner and maccrehan 2006 xagoraraki et al 2008 additionally bq could also be generated through the oxidation of phenols by pms which is a good catalyst for activating pms to produce 1o2 zhou et al 2017 to explore the role of bq the formation of bq during act degradation by pms chlorine was monitored fig 3 a shows that bq was detected in different ph cases and its evolution showed quite different trends the concentration of bq continuously increased in the pms chlorine process with the reaction time extending at ph 7 when reaction ph was set at 10 bq increased rapidly to a maximum of 2 67 μm at the reaction time of 1 min and then gradually decreased to a very low level in the following time similar phenomenon could also be found during the degradation of phenols by pms at alkaline conditions which was attributed to the consumption of bq by activating pms li et al 2019 zhou et al 2017 fig 3b shows that the degradation of act by bq pms was only 5 at ph 7 even bq concentration was increased to 50 μm which reached 95 at ph 10 with 10 μm bq these results evidence that the activation of pms by bq was insignificant at neutral condition but it would play an important role for accelerated act degradation at alkaline condition the formation of 1o2 in the pms chlorine process containing act at ph 7 was also evaluated by epr as shown in fig s4c a very limited change of tmpn signals could be found in pms and pms chlorine solutions in addition the degradation of ffa was also enhanced by pms chlorine even though ffa doesn t contain phenolic functional groups fig 2b these results suggest that activation of pms by bq was not the main mechanism at ph 7 other transformation products of act in both pms chlorine and chlorine processes at ph 7 were also analyzed by lc ms mono and dichlorinated act dimers of act and act were identified as the main products in these two processes and the ms2 spectra of them were shown in figs s5 s8 these products seem to have no ability to trigger the activation of pms combining with the limited participation of bq the role of transformation byproducts for the accelerated act degradation at ph 7 could be ruled out to further investigate the possible interaction between pms and chlorine the consumptions of chlorine and pms during the reaction were separately determined as shown in fig 3c limited consumptions of pms and chlorine less than 3 in 15 min were observed in the solution without act at ph 7 and 10 suggesting that pms cannot directly react with chlorine at both neutral and alkaline conditions which can rule out the speculation that the possible reaction between pms and chlorine caused the accelerated act degradation in the pms chlorine process fig 3d shows that pms concentration kept stable and chlorine consumption reached 42 2 μm after reaction for 15 min when pms alone and chlorine alone were individually applied to react with act at neutral condition which are in line with the degradation performance of act by pms alone and chlorine alone fig 1 respectively interestingly when pms chlorine and act were mixed together pms concentration was still almost unchanged while chlorine consumption was elevated to 74 2 μm the decay of chlorine in chlorine alone and pms chlorine processes followed pseudo first order reaction in kinetics with the rate constants being 0 0386 and 0 1043 min 1 respectively fig s10 catalyst is defined as any substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without getting consumed in catalytic chemistry ludwig and schindler 2017 figs 1 and 3d point out a result that faster act degradation and chlorine decomposition could be achieved in the presence of pms whose concentration kept relatively stable this shows that pms seems to serve as a homogeneous catalyst in this process which is line with the role of pms reported in some previous studies for the synthesis of organic chemicals hou et al 2018 zhang and du 2009 in addition aforementioned discussion proves that there were no different transformation products from act degradation in both pms chlorine and chlorine alone processes thus it is possible that the degradation of act in these two processes followed the same reaction pathway fig s9 this result suggests that chlorine was the main substance reacting with act in the pms chlorine process and pms catalytic chlorination should be the main mechanism for the acceleration of act degradation at neutral condition 3 4 kinetics for act degradation in the pms chlorine process to further support the pms catalytic chlorination of act the kinetics of act degradation by pms chlorine was studied at ph 7 0 fig 4 a shows good linear relationships between the reaction time and the logarithm of the ratio of act concentration to initial act concentration c c0 under different chlorine dosages 50 200 μm illustrating that the degradation process could be described by pseudo first order kinetics additionally the relationship between k obs and the initial chlorine concentration chlorine 0 was further evaluated and the result indicates that ln k obs was linearly related to ln chlorine 0 r2 0 992 with a slope approximating 1 046 fig 4b shows that the chlorine decay was also positively dependent on the initial act concentration act 0 and the slope of the fitting liner curve ln k obs vs ln act 0 k obs represents the observed chlorine decomposition rate constant was 0 567 as shown in fig 4c elevating initial pms dosages pms 0 significantly improved the decomposition of chlorine and the value of ln k obs was linearly correlated to ln pms 0 with a slope of 0 442 the overall reaction rate v in the ternary system involving chlorine pms and act could be explained by eq 3 where n1 n2 and n3 are reaction orders in the concentrations of chlorine 1 046 pms 0 442 and act 0 567 respectively according to the results shown in fig 4 k is the apparent reaction rate constant whose value was calculated to be 0 5 0 01 10 3 μm 1 min 1 text s7 then the overall reaction in this work can be described as eq 4 with a unit of μm min 1 the sum of these three reaction orders i e n1 n2 n3 is approximate to 2 implying that the overall reaction rate is in seconder order which is consistent with that in the chlorination of act cao et al 2016 the calculation of the kinetics for act degradation further evidences the intrinsic chemical process in the pms chlorine system is the direct chlorination of act with pms acting as a catalyst 3 v d chlorine dt d act dt k chlorine n 1 pms n 2 act n 3 4 v 0 0005 chlorine 1 046 pms 0 442 act 0 567 3 5 influence of solution ph the influence of solution ph on act degradation in the pms chlorine process were evaluated in the selected ph range of 4 0 10 0 as shown in fig 5 act was hardly removed at ph 4 and 5 with the final degradation efficiency being only 7 5 and 13 2 respectively as solution ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the degradation of act significantly raised to 98 2 in only 5 min however further elevation of ph to 10 partly inhibited act degradation which was still much higher than that at acidic and neutral conditions this indicates that higher solution ph could facilitate the oxidation of act in the pms chlorine process which is in line with the result in the sole chlorination of act cao et al 2016 the depletion of pms and chlorine during the reaction was also investigated as shown in fig s11a the consumption of chlorine was significantly enhanced by increasing ph from 7 0 to 9 0 and then slightly suppressed with further elevating ph to 10 0 which is in accordance with the result of act degradation under these conditions different from the stable presence of pms at ph 7 0 alkaline conditions obviously promoted the decay of pms with the final consumption efficiencies being 40 2 at ph 9 and 59 2 at ph 10 respectively fig s11b ph had multiple impacts on the reaction which could be related to the variations of chlorine pms and act species the ionization constant of hclo pk hclo was 7 54 at 25 c deborde and von gunten 2008 indicating that the fraction of cl o will be promoted with the raise of solution ph compared to hclo cl o is more reactive towards act which can result in the increase of act removal at alkaline conditions cao et al 2016 however molecular act could be deprotonated with pk a 9 7 sorasuchart et al 1999 the electrostatic repulsion between cl o and anionic act was enhanced at ph 10 which could hinder the reaction between chlorine and act and then decreased act degradation previous studies reported that pms could be activated by base qi et al 2016 which might play a role in the pms chlorine process to make clear this the pms decomposition and act degradation by pms alone at different ph were explored fig s12 shows that negligible variations of pms and act could be observed at ph 9 0 while a quite small decrease of act 8 and pms 5 occurred at ph 10 0 this result strongly suggests that the base activation of pms was insignificant and had limited influence on the degradation of act in this experiment thus the enhanced consumption of pms at alkaline conditions can be ascribed to the activation by bq which is in line with the results in figs 3a and 3b as pms whose concentration was positively correlated to act degradation in the pms chlorine process has been considered as a catalyst for the chlorination of act the significant decrease of pms concentration at ph 10 0 may also contribute to the inhibition of chlorine consumption and act degradation when ph was elevated from 9 0 to 10 0 therefore the catalytic effect of pms on chlorine and activation of pms by quinone intermediates should co exist in the pms chlorine process at alkaline conditions 3 6 effect of water matrix anions are ubiquitous in surface water and wastewater which usually play important roles in the degradation of organic pollutants in the oxidation process wang and wang 2018 in this study the effects of bicarbonate hco 3 nitrate no 3 and chloride c l on the degradation of act by pms chlorine were investigated as shown in fig 6 a negligible influence could be observed with the addition of hco 3 at different concentrations 0 4 mm which is contrary to its common inhibitory performance in aops by reacting with so 4 h o and c l to generate low reactive co 3 fang et al 2014 ji et al 2015 this further proves the absence of those radicals in this study similar phenomenon can be found by increasing the concentration of no 3 from 0 to 80 mm fig s13a these results also demonstrate that act degradation by pms chlorine was independent from the solution s ionic strength which could eliminate the possibility that the accelerated degradation of act was attributed to the increase of ionic strength with the addition of pms fig 6b provides the degradation efficiency of act in the presence of c l with various concentrations 0 10 mm the result shows that 1 mm c l markedly facilitated the degradation of act from 86 0 to 92 3 and further improvement of the acceleration could be achieved with increasing c l concentration from 1 to 10 mm previous studies demonstrated that c l could be directly oxidized to hclo by pms which enhanced the inactivation of bacteria and removal of some pollutants delcomyn et al 2006 zhou et al 2018 this would be the main reason for the promotional effect of c l in this study which was supported by the increased residual chlorine and enhanced pms consumption with the increase of c l fig s14a furthermore this study suggests that chlorine formed through the reaction between cl and pms may play a stronger role than ever expected in the degradation of some contaminates by pms dominated aops due to the pms catalytic effect on chlorination ammonium nh 4 and ha were also the common influencing factors in the chlorination process as presented in fig s13b the removal efficiency of act decreased from 86 to 7 2 as the concentration of nh 4 raised from 0 to 80 μm at the selected experimental conditions although chlorine owns negligible reactivity with nh 4 species nh 4 can be deprotonated to form n h 3 and then reacts with chlorine to induce the formation of chloramines deborde and von gunten 2008 the conversion from free chlorine to chloramines with lower oxidative properties was enhanced with the increase of nh 4 which was expected to take responsibility for the inhibitory degradation of act fig s13c displays that act degradation had inconspicuous change during the first 3 min but decreased by 4 8 8 17 5 and 34 4 after 15 min while the addition of ha was 10 20 40 and 80 mg l respectively fig s14b shows that the addition of ha accelerated chlorine decomposition but had no influence on pms concentration at the end of the reaction revealing that the activation of pms by quinone like groups in ha was insignificant and the competition of chlorine by ha should be the primary reason for the inhibition of act degradation the influence of reaction temperature on act degradation was also studied the temperature range of 15 35 c was chosen to avoid the thermal activation of pms qi et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 fig s13d shows that k obs of act degradation increased with the promotion of temperature and the relationship between k obs and reaction temperature was fitted well the activation energy of act degradation in the pms chlorine process was calculated to be 37 38 kj mol based on the arrhenius equation which was lower than that obtained in a previous study for the chlorination of act 41 2 kj mol cao et al 2016 this also demonstrates the catalytic performance of pms on chlorine for act degradation additionally when aops based on pms were applied in water purification residual pms can easily encounter chlorine in the disinfection process thus the performance of act degradation was also elucidated by adding 50 μm act in real water samples collected from filter tank effluents in a drinking water treatment plant and secondary sedimentation effluents in a wastewater treatment plant at wuhan china respectively the water quality of these real water samples could be found in table s2 fig s15 displays that the removal of act was inhibited in real water compared to that in ultrapure water which might be ascribed to the co existing organic compounds and other background species nevertheless high act removal can be achieved in these two real water samples 82 2 for real drinking water and 70 4 for real wastewater indicating that act could be effectively degraded by pms chlorine in practical water treatment process 3 7 formation of dbps during the chlorination in the presence of pms the presence of pms accelerated the degradation of act by chlorine which might also vary the formation of dbps therefore the quantities of selected dbps generated during pms chlorine and chlorine processes were compared to monitor the dbps formation in practical process actual waters from secondary sedimentation effluents in a wastewater treatment plant were chosen as background and the result was shown in fig 7 during the chlorination of wastewater samples the presence of pms had no influence on the formation of tcm with p value 0 5 table s3 which resulted in the significant increase of dcaa 35 6 tcaa 28 8 tcnm 64 7 and tcp 34 6 the generation of most dbps except for tcp was enhanced with the addition of act in wastewater samples during the chlorination process which is consistent with the findings in a previous study that act and its transformation products are also the potential precursors of dbps ding et al 2018 when it comes to the chlorination of wastewater samples containing act the concentrations of tcm dcaa tcaa and tcnm increased by 43 7 147 9 45 9 and 181 7 respectively after the addition of pms the chlorine consumption in different processes were also monitored interestingly fig s16 shows that residual chlorine in the pms chlorine process was higher than that in the chlorine alone process no matter act was present or not which is contrary to the enhanced generation of dbps in the pms chlorine process this might be attributed to the reactions of background species in the collected wastewater samples such as c l and ha with pms and chlorine combined with the fact that most p values were less than 0 05 table s3 it is concluded that the addition of pms promoted the formation of these selected dbps in real water samples which is possibly resulted by the rising reactivity of chlorine towards pollutants in the presence pms and other complex contribution from the substances in real wastewater 4 conclusions the accelerated degradation of micro organic pollutants by pms chlorine at neutral condition was firstly reported in this study with selecting act as a reference compound the intrinsic mechanism was proven to be pms catalytic chlorination rather than the generation of reactive radicals a second order kinetic model was established to describe the degradation of act in the pms chlorine process the degradation efficiency presented a significant increase in the ph range of 4 0 9 0 and then a decrease with further increasing solution ph to 10 0 both nh 4 and ha inhibited act degradation while c l markedly promoted the removal of act furthermore the presence of pms during the chlorination of real water facilitated the generation of most selected dbps this work provides a novel view to the important role of pms during the chlorination process which should be taken into consideration in practical water and wastewater

17342,photo activated sludge pas systems are an emerging wastewater treatment technology where microalgae provide oxygen to bacteria without the need for external aeration there is limited knowledge on the optimal conditions for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in systems containing a mixture of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and microalgae this research aimed to study the effects of substrate composition and light intensity on the performance of a laboratory scale ebpr pas system initially a model based design was developed to study the effect of organic carbon cod inorganic carbon hco3 and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in nitrification deprived conditions on phosphorus p removal based on the mathematical model two different synthetic wastewater compositions cod hco3 nh4 n 10 20 1 and 10 10 4 were examined at a light intensity of 350 µmol m 2 sec 1 add to this the performance of the system was also investigated at light intensities 87 5 175 and 262 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 for short terms results showed that wastewater having a high level of hco3 and low level of nh4 n ratio of 10 20 1 favored only microalgal growth and had poor p removal due to a shortage of nh4 n for paos growth however lowering the hco3 level and increasing the nh4 n level ratio of 10 10 4 balanced paos and microalgae symbiosis and had a positive influence on p removal under this mode of operation the system was able to operate without external aeration and achieved a net p removal of 10 33 1 45 mg l 1 at an influent cod of 100 mg l 1 no significant variation was observed in the

ebpr process mixed liquor is recirculated through alternating anaerobic aerobic stages to promote the growth of poly phosphate accumulating organisms paos in the anaerobic stage paos take up volatile

obtaining energy for replenishing glycogen for growth and po4 p uptake wentzel et al 2008 in sum the oxygen o2 required by the ebpr process is usually supplied by mechanical aeration which may increase the operational costs of aeration and contribute up to 45 75 of the total energy costs of activated sludge systems rosso et al 2008 in this context photosynthetic oxygen generation by microalgae has been utilized for wastewater treatment in the presence of natural or artificial lighting e g wastewater stabilization ponds wsp and high rate algal ponds hrap craggs et al 2014 however

knowledge gaps regarding the effect of substrate composition and light intensity on ebpr in systems containing a mixture of paos and microalgae wastewater composition and solar radiation can demonstrate substantial variability both temporally and spatially henze and comeau 2008 eumetsat 2020 therefore a better understanding of the influence of these parameters is important for the further development of ebpr pas systems thus to address this knowledge gap a stoichiometric ebpr pas model based design was first investigated to understand the impact of carbon c and n on p removal following the model development two different synthetic wastewater compositions of cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 20 1 and 10 10 4 were examined in controlled laboratory reactor experiments to evaluate p removal in addition the short term effects of four incident light intensities 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 were also investigated to evaluate the stability of symbiotic paos microalgal capacity for p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 model based design prior to the start up a model based design approach was used to identify the theoretically optimal operating conditions including synthetic wastewater composition light intensity and operational and environmental conditions the model tables a 1 to a 3 appendix a of the supplementary information was developed in ms excel using the ebpr stoichiometric based steady state design model developed by comeau et al 1986 wentzel et al 1990 and smolders et al 1994a b this model was modified and extended by coupling the oxygen requirements of the aerobic ebpr activity to the oxygen generation by microalgae mara 2004 to develop the model the following assumptions were made a operation of an ebpr pas system in a completely mixed sequencing batch reactor sbr wilderer et al 2001 under alternating anaerobic aerobic ebpr conditions with dark conditions during the anaerobic stage and illuminated conditions during the aerobic stage b

the tss concentration using the lambert beer equation swinehart 1962 appendix b fig 1 shows the summary results of the model for balanced paos microalgae symbiosis the model suggested the composition of the synthetic wastewater should contain 100 mg l 1 of cod 12 mg l 1 of po4 p 88 mg l 1 of hco3 and 10 mg l 1 of nh4 n fig 1 a b under these conditions the overall vss and tss concentrations were estimated at 1 08 g l 1 and 1 6 g l 1 fig 1 c respectively which were within the limits specified in the assumptions moreover the oxygen produced by microalgae would be double the paos requirements fig 1 b based on the prediction of the model these concentrations were applied to the start up phase with only minor modifications the inorganic carbon was 200 mg hco3 l 1 instead of 88 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b which supplied the total inorganic carbon required not assuming that paos would retrieve the theoretically calculated 112 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b as co2 anaerobically and aerobically according to smolders et al 1994a b the model estimated an incident light intensity of 145 µmol m 2 sec 1 table a 3 appendix a for the photosynthesis process however a light intensity of 350 µmol m 2 sec 1 was used in the start up phase to avoid light limitation for microalgal growth 2 2 reactor configuration and enrichment of the ebpr pas system two cylindrical double jacketed glass reactors each with an internal diameter of 12 5 cm and an active volume of 2 5 l were used in the study reactor one r1 fig 2 was the main reactor and used for the enrichment and development of the paos microalgae consortia to test the synergetic effect of microalgae and paos to perform ebpr referred to as an ebpr pas system reactor two r2 the study control was operated as a conventional ebpr without microalgae and light referred to as an ebpr system r1 was inoculated with 600 ml of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder den horn the netherlands with a tss concentration of 6 g l 1 the activated sludge was mixed with 600 ml of five species of microalgae cyanobacteria 120 ml each scenedesmus quadricauda anabaena variabilis chlorella sp chlorococcus sp spirulina sp with an average concentration of 1 g tss l 1 similar to those used by van der steen et al 2015 this led to a total initial tss concentration of 1 75 g l 1 in r1 r2 was inoculated with an enriched culture of paos from an ebpr reactor welles et al 2017 due to operational challenges with r1 which showed poor ebpr activities in the start up phase 25 to 30 ml of enhanced paos culture from r2 was seeded on daily basis to the microalgae biomass in r1 from day 25 to 36 and day 41 the ebpr pas system r1 was operated under alternating anaerobic aerobic ebpr conditions with dark conditions during the anaerobic stage and illuminated conditions during the aerobic stage to enhance the growth of microalgae to achieve this r1 was run as an sbr with four cycles of 6 h per day comprising a 2 h dark anaerobic stage a 3 h illuminated aerobic stage a 0 5 h settling stage and a 0 5 h effluent withdrawal stage fig 2 an adi controller and bioxpert software applikon delft the netherlands were used to operate the sbr and for data acquisition mixing took place in the dark anaerobic and illuminated aerobic stages at 500 rpm van loosdrecht et al 2016 the temperature was maintained at 20 1 c throughout all stages by a lauda system lauda königshofen germany the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 1 to favor paos over glycogen accumulating organisms gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 through the automatic dosing of either 0 4 m hcl or 0 4 m naoh for illumination eight light emitting diode led lamps 40w phillips the netherlands were used with four of each located at opposite sides of the reactor during each cycle from min 5 to min 10 of the anaerobic stage synthetic wastewater was pumped from the influent feeding tank to r1 using a peristaltic pump while a second peristaltic pump positioned in r1 served two purposes to withdraw 105 ml of the mixed liquor for the last 5 mins of the aerobic stage thereby controlling the srt to 6 days and to discharge the effluent during the withdrawal stage fig 2 during the effluent withdrawal stage half of the working volume was removed so as to attain an hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h during the start up phase p1 an air compressor controlled by an on off valve supplied the oxygen to the reactor during the aerobic period at a point not exceeding 20 of saturation around 1 8 mg l 1 the air compressor was not used when the system was solely dependent on the microalgae oxygen in the phases following the start up phase nitrogen gas n2 was sparged into the reactor during the first 25 mins of the anaerobic stage to generate anaerobic conditions r2 contained the same medium and had the same operational conditions as in r1 srt 6 days hrt 12 h however oxygen was supplied to r2 during all the cycles of the aerobic stages whereas in r1 because of the reliance on microalgae to provide oxygen external aeration was supplied only in the start up phase p1 when the dissolved oxygen do saturation dropped below 20 in addition r2 was not exposed to alternating dark and illumination conditions as was the case with r1 2 3 experimental phases and synthetic medium table 1 shows the operating conditions for the ebpr pas system which were determined based on the outcomes of the model based design it comprised three experimental phases with a total duration of 100 days in phase 1 p1 the ebpr pas system was loaded with synthetic wastewater cod 100 mg l 1 p 12 mg l 1 cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 20 1 mg mg mg after ensuring that the microalgae were growing well enough to produce sufficient oxygen do saturation level 20 the external aeration supply was gradually reduced over 11 days until the ebpr pas system operated without external aeration in phase 2 p2 in order to optimize the nutrients and avoid limiting growth conditions for both organisms the nh4 n concentration was increased by a factor of four and the inorganic carbon reduced by half cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 10 4 mg mg mg and the system was allowed to stabilize when no significant changes in the effluent parameters were observed for at least 3 srt 18 days the system was assumed to have reached pseudo steady state conditions in phase 3 p3 the short term effects of different incident light intensities 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 each lasting three days were investigated on the last day for each light intensity these intensities were within the range reported by eumetsat 2020 in northern european conditions this phase aimed to study the effect of light intensity on do generation and evaluate the culture response to light fluctuations and therefore the performance of the ebpr pas system the influent wastewater comprised a carbon source a mineral medium and deionized water each contained in separate containers fig 2 the carbon source consisted of 3 1 acetate propionate this cod ratio

where n is the number of samples 3 results and discussion 3 1 first experimental phase cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 20 1 phase 1 p1 was the starting point of the ebpr pas cultivation system based on the steady state model prediction cod hco3 nh4 n 10 20 1 the ebpr pas system r1 displayed excellent algal photosynthesis activities as measured by the utilization of inorganic carbon and the production of oxygen which occasionally exceeded 300 of the saturated do however r1 demonstrated poor p release and uptake fig 3 the p release and total p uptake for r1 in p1 were 7 3 0 48 mg l 1 se 0 24 n 4 and 7 2 2 8 mg l 1 se 1 05 n 7 fig 3 respectively overall r1 had a final effluent p concentration of 9 45 1 05 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 9 with a net p removal of only 2 75 1 05 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 9 fig 3 in contrast the conventional ebpr system r2 control demonstrated good p release and p uptake fig 3 the p release rate during the anaerobic stage for r2 23 mg l 1 h 1 was four times higher than r1 5 7 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 the maximum p uptake rate during the aerobic period for r2 16 87 mg l 1 h 1 was almost six times higher than in r1 2 76 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 moreover the anaerobic consumption rate of vfa by paos for r2 40 2 mg l 1 h 1 was 2 5 times higher than r1 16 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 overall the average p release and total p uptake for r2 were 17 1 1 3 mg l 1 and 24 2 5 mg l 1 se 1 04 n 6 fig 3 respectively this make r2 had an effluent p concentration of 4 0 1 4 mg l 1 se 0 41 n 12 with a net p removal of 8 01 1 38 mg l 1 se 0 4 n 12 fig 3 to improve r1 performance 25 to 30 ml of enhanced paos culture vss 0 4 0 03 g l 1 tss 0 7 0 06 g l 1 from r2 was seeded regularly to the microalgae biomass in r1 from day 25 to 36 despite this addition r1 did not demonstrate any capacity for p removal during p1 although both r1 r2 were supplied with the same medium and operated under the same conditions the poor growth of paos culture in r2 may have been due to different stresses in the cultivation system e g o2 saturation nutrient stress competition for nh4 n micro algal concentration sludge age therefore the interplay between paos and microalgae was not balanced with microalgae dominating p1 to investigate the cause of the poor p removal in r1 kinetic studies were performed for r1 on day 24 and r2 on day 33 and compared to each other fig 4 a c the results showed that only 20 mg l 1 of cod was consumed during the anaerobic stage and more than half the influent cod 30 mg l 1 fig 4a escaped into the aerobic stage for r1 on the other hand the influent cod was fully consumed and stored by paos in the anaerobic stage for r2 fig 4a which was an indication of good ebpr activity the p profile in fig 4b shows both p release and p uptake were very low in r1 compared to r2 the maximum p release rate during the anaerobic stage for r2 23 mg l 1 h 1 was eight times higher than r1 3 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b the maximum p uptake rate during the aerobic period for r2 16 87 mg l 1 h 1 was almost six times higher than in r1 2 72 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b the nh4 n profile in fig 4c shows that nh4 n uptake in r1 started from the beginning of the aerobic stage with a rate of 3 37 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 and was almost fully consumed within the first 45 mins in r2 there was a 30 minute lag in the aerobic stage before paos started to uptake nh4 and then uptake occurred at 0 44 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 a lower rate than observed in r1 fig 4c as a result of the higher nh4 n uptake in r1 paos growth in this system was likely inhibited by a shortage of n although the total demand of nh4 n by paos was very low according to r2 as shown in fig 4c thus ammonium was likely taken up by microalgae and potentially by other organisms rather than paos in r1 moreover the loss of nh4 by nitrification was not expected due to the addition of the nitrification inhibitor atu therefore the nh4 n concentration in the influent of r1 was increased from 10 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 to meet paos requirements also the inorganic carbon concentration in the influent was decreased from 200 mg hco3 l 1 to 100 mg hco3 l 1 to limit the excess nh4 n uptake by microalgae despite this the new value of the inorganic carbon met the model requirement 88 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b because the initial concentration of inorganic carbon that had been added in p1 did not consider the inorganic carbon produced by paos section 2 1 3 2 second experimental phase cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 10 4 effective conditions were established by adjusting the nutrient composition cod hco3 and nh4 n to a ratio of 10 10 4 according to the results of the kinetic studies in p1 both p release and p uptake within r1 improved significantly p 0 0001 during p2 and the results were comparable to the control reactor r2 fig 3 the average p release and total p uptake by r1 were 20 1 43 mg l 1 mg l 1 se 0 5 n 8 and 27 8 1 8 mg l 1 se 0 48 n 14 fig 3 respectively the average p concentration in the final effluent for r2 was 1 87 1 45 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 34 with a net removal of 10 33 1 45 mg p l 1 se 0 25 n 34 fig 3 the total cod was fully consumed during the first hour of the anaerobic stage at a rate of 40 mg l 1 h 1 fig 5 a a rate that was similar to previous measurements for r2 fig 4a and almost three times higher than that achieved in p1 for r1 fig 4a fig 5a correspondingly the p release rate for r1 increased three fold from 8 4 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to 28 2 mg l 1 h 1 in p2 fig 5b and p uptake rate for r1 increased six fold from 2 82 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to 16 8 mg l 1 h 1 in p2 fig 5b which was similar to r2 fig 4b fig 5c shows there was a lot of ammonium left in the effluent in p2 and the uptake rate was reduced from 3 84 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to nearly half in p2 2 3 mg l 1 h 1 fig 5c this decrease was possibly due to the reduction in microalgal biomass as a result of reducing influent inorganic carbon however the nh4 n uptake rate of r1 in p2 was still higher than r2 fig 4c because microalgae and paos will co contribute to the uptake rate of nh4 n in r1 the total nh4 n uptake in p2 was 4 9 mg l 1 fig 5c 9 8 mg l 1 as an influent concentration before dilution this concentration was similar to the nh4 n supplied in p1 therefore inorganic carbon reduction was a key adjustment to limit microalgal growth and cultivate a successful symbiotic relationship between microalgae and paos in p2 there was a reduction in the do concentration in the middle of the aerobic stage which coincided with the depletion of inorganic carbon fig 6 as microalgae were no longer able to perform photosynthesis in the absence of inorganic carbon this indicates that limiting the microalgae growth by controlling the inorganic carbon was a successful measure the medium cod hco3 nh4 n in p2 was supplied at a ratio of 10 10 4 but the actual consumption ratio was 10 10 1 which was similar to that predicted by the model when considering that paos contributed part of hco3 as co2 ratio of 100 88 10 fig 1 a b paos managed to contribute 8 03 mg co2 l 1 11 13 mg l 1 as hco3 anaerobically fig 6 which was almost similar to the model estimation of 11 mg co2 l 1 table a3 appendix a the initial approach adopted in p1 was to avoid limiting conditions for microalgae growth and therefore inorganic carbon was supplied in abundance in p1 not considering the share provided by paos this measure potentially generated excess microalgal biomass in p1 which outcompeted paos for nh4 n 3 3 ebpr pas system performance and characteristics at steady state an enmeshed mixed culture of paos and microalgae was obtained from r1 in p2 appendix c the average tss concentration was 1108 06 154 9 mg l 1 se 41 4 n 17 with an average vss of 839 18 137 mg l 1 se 33 24 n 17 and a vss tss ratio of 0 75 0 027 se 0 007 n 17 fig 7 which was close to the model predictions fig 1 c the lower vss tss ratio in p2 0 75 than in p1 0 99 fig 7 was an indicator of improving ebpr activities in r1 during p2 paos generate inactive biomass inert suspended solids iss from the stored poly p and associated counter ions mg 2 k 1 and ca 2 and therefore have a low vss tss ratio ekama and wentzel 2004 while microalgae generate less iss consequently the vss tss ratio is lower for a conventional ebpr system r2 than an ebpr pas system r1 this was apparent in the current study and that of carvalho et al 2018 as respective vss tss ratios of 0 75 fig 7 and 0 68 0 8 were recorded for ebpr pas systems a vss tss ratio of 0 58 was achieved in r2 of the current study fig 7 and by welles et al 2015 for a conventional ebpr system phosphorus release vfa consumed was 0 58 0 04 p mmol c mmol during p2 which was similar to r2 fig 7 this was also an indication of good ebpr activity according to the results of welles et al 2017 and saad et al 2016 who reported values of between 0 4 and 0 8 p mmol c mmol for paos in conventional ebpr systems the total nh4 n consumption by biomass microalgae paos was 9 3 0 74 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 11 fig 7 during p2 this value was approximately equal to that predicted by the model 10 mg l 1 in which paos and microalgae account for nh4 n uptake of 3 04 and 6 96 mg l 1 respectively fig 1 a during p2 cod consumed average p net removal for r1 100 10 4 was lower than r2 100 8 this indicates that the ebpr pas system required less organic carbon than the conventional ebpr system on days 62 63 64 68 69 and 76 the system was capable of complete po4 removal without the supply of any external aeration appendix d fig d 1 fig d 2 and with a low cod p net removal ratio of 100 12 in which paos and microalgae account for p removal of 11 and 1 mg l 1 respectively according to the model fig 1 a the cod p net removal of 100 12 was lower than that achieved in the literature for best performing conventional ebpr systems for example carvalheira et al 2014a achieved a cod consumed p net removal of 200 20 with an influent p concentration of 20 mg l 1 for conventional ebpr reactor carvalho et al 2018 also reported very low cod consumed p net removal 200 34 for an ebpr pas system with an influent p concentration of 60 mg l 1 the main reason for this low cod p net removal for an ebpr pas system was that microalgae participated in p removal 1 3 of microalgae biomass without requiring cod with inorganic carbon as the carbon source in contrast the ebpr pas system of the current study r1 and carvalho et al 2018 had a lower capacity to remove phosphate per g biomass p vss than the conventional ebpr system r2 this because paos can uptake p to a maximum of 38 of their biomass wentzel et al 1990 while microalgae typically can only uptake p to 1 3 of their biomass mara 2004 however there are some types of microalgae cyanobacteria capable of acting as paos that can significantly contribute to poly p storage for example ji et al 2020b found that the cyanobacteria pantanalinema spp were the major phosphorus accumulating organisms in microalgal bacterial granular sludge although the p content of this cyanobacteria was far less than 38 of vss therefore for similar amounts of phosphate removal an ebpr pas system requires less organic carbon and generates higher biomass than a conventional ebpr system 3 4 third experimental phase light assessment and optimization the reactor performance for different light intensities is shown in fig 8 three of the four light intensities tested were higher than the model estimated light requirement for photosynthesis 145 µmol m 2 sec 1 the oxygen production rate by microalgae decreased when the light intensity reduced 3 5 2 7 2 1 and 0 89 saturated do min 1 for light intensities of 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 respectively linear correlation r 0 99 fig 8 yet the overall performance between light intensities was not significant p 0 05 no significant variation was observed in the reactor performance regarding p release and p uptake fig 8 suggesting that the culture selected in p2 conditions was resilient to inhibition by lower light intensities reducing the light in p1 e g from 350 to 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 may limit the microalgae growth without the need to reduce the inorganic carbon as implemented in p2 this measure would possibly reduce the uptake rate of nh4 n by microalgae and therefore delay the early consumption of nh4 n that occurred in p1 as the light intensity was decreased the p concentration in the effluent improved slightly fig 8 carvalheira et al 2014b observed that paos in an ebpr system prefer to grow in low do concentration and outnumber gaos therefore too much light may not be beneficial for paos conversely too little light may also not be favourable for paos as the total oxygen produced by microalgae may not meet the metabolic and anabolic requirement of paos as explained by the model of smolders et al 1994b 3 5 limitations and implications of the study an ebpr pas system exploits the synergistic relationship between microalgae and paos uncoupling hrt from srt facilitates the use of a smaller sized system hrt 12 h than other microalgal bacterial systems commonly 2 6 days for municipal wastewater muñoz and guieysse 2006 anbalagan et al 2016 also the ebpr pas system requires no external aeration has a high capacity to remove p at low influent cod concentrations and significantly reduces co2 footprint however the current study showed that the system is not always successful and its performance depends on the composition of the influent wastewater this may have practical implications that are difficult to discern at full scale with real wastewater applications for example municipal wastewater will demonstrate an intrinsic temporal variability metcalf and eddy 2003 while the system described in our study treated wastewater at a steady cod hco3 nh4 n ratio of 10 10 4 the current study was operated without nitrification introducing nitrifiers in the ebpr pas system has different implications the system will require more o2 as nitrification usually demands intensive aeration 4 57 mg o2 mg 1 nh4 n nitrified wiesmann 1994 in addition the nitrification process consumes a considerable amount of alkalinity 8 71 mg hco3 mg 1 nh4 n nitrified wiesmann 1994 therefore the system will require more hco3 to produce more o2 and to meet this demand however denitrification can recover half the o2 and alkalinity lost in nitrification 2 86 mg o2 mg 1 no3 n de nitrified 4 36 mg hco3 mg 1 no3 n de nitrified wiesmann 1994 some paos are assumed to use nitrate as an external electron acceptor allowing efficient integration of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal with minimal organic carbon cod requirements sorm et al 1996 saad et al 2016 overall less organic carbon more nitrogen and more inorganic carbon are expected for paos microalgae nitrifier symbiosis than paos microalgae symbiosis the ebpr pas system in this study favored p removal even at low light intensities which is an indication that the system can be operated at low power consumption if artificial lighting is used however when nitrification is incorporated in the ebpr pas system more light is expected to be required by microalgae to meet the high do demand by nitrifiers in addition further light is required as a result of increased tss concentration caused by the additional biomass of nitrifiers although the additional biomass will be minimal as nitrifiers have a very small yield 0 1 mg vss mg 1 nh4 n ekama and wentzel 2008 the light path and culture density as controlled by srt are potential controls to manipulate the photo oxygenation rate arashiro et al 2017 rada ariza et al 2019 for example decreasing the light path and reducing srt can maximize the do concentration in the system 4 conclusion this study showed that careful control of nh4 n and hco3 is critical to balancing paos and microalgae populations in the ebpr pas system at a cod hco3 nh4 n ratio of 10 20 1 the ebpr pas system favored nitrogen removal and microalgal growth and exhibited poor ebpr activities at this ratio the growth of paos was likely inhibited because microalgae consume ammonium earlier than paos during the illuminated stage of operation however once the cod hco3 nh4 n ratio was changed to 10 10 4 the paos and microalgae populations were balanced and the system performance improved significantly to remove p the study also revealed that there were no significant differences in the system performance for different light intensities suggesting that the mixed culture was robust against light fluctuations future studies should focus on testing the ebpr pas system on real municipal wastewater in large volumes to demonstrate applicability of this system to full scale operations in addition the incorporation of nitrification and the influence of nitrate on paos microalgae interplay should be investigated further finally the long term effect of light intensity should be studied to investigate the system performance for stable reactor operation declaration of

17342,photo activated sludge pas systems are an emerging wastewater treatment technology where microalgae provide oxygen to bacteria without the need for external aeration there is limited knowledge on the optimal conditions for enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in systems containing a mixture of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and microalgae this research aimed to study the effects of substrate composition and light intensity on the performance of a laboratory scale ebpr pas system initially a model based design was developed to study the effect of organic carbon cod inorganic carbon hco3 and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n in nitrification deprived conditions on phosphorus p removal based on the mathematical model two different synthetic wastewater compositions cod hco3 nh4 n 10 20 1 and 10 10 4 were examined at a light intensity of 350 µmol m 2 sec 1 add to this the performance of the system was also investigated at light intensities 87 5 175 and 262 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 for short terms results showed that wastewater having a high level of hco3 and low level of nh4 n ratio of 10 20 1 favored only microalgal growth and had poor p removal due to a shortage of nh4 n for paos growth however lowering the hco3 level and increasing the nh4 n level ratio of 10 10 4 balanced paos and microalgae symbiosis and had a positive influence on p removal under this mode of operation the system was able to operate without external aeration and achieved a net p removal of 10 33 1 45 mg l 1 at an influent cod of 100 mg l 1 no significant variation was observed in the reactor performance for different light intensities indicating the ebpr pas system can be operated at low light intensities with a positive influence on p removal graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords enhanced biological phosphorus removal poly phosphate accumulating organisms photo activated sludge microalgae paos microalgae symbiosis 1 introduction removal of phosphorus p from wastewaters before discharge is essential to mitigate negative environmental impacts this can be achieved either chemically or biologically although biological removal via enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in activated sludge systems is effective in achieving higher p removal efficiencies at lower operational costs than chemical alternatives bashar et al 2018 in the conventional ebpr process mixed liquor is recirculated through alternating anaerobic aerobic stages to promote the growth of poly phosphate accumulating organisms paos in the anaerobic stage paos take up volatile fatty acids vfas present in the influent and store them as poly β hydroxyalkanoates pha using glycogen as a reducing agent and obtain the required energy through the hydrolysis of intracellularly stored poly phosphates poly p wentzel et al 2008 the hydrolysis of poly p results in the anaerobic release of ortho phosphate po4 p into the bulk liquid in the aerobic stage paos oxidize the pha obtaining energy for replenishing glycogen for growth and po4 p uptake wentzel et al 2008 in sum the oxygen o2 required by the ebpr process is usually supplied by mechanical aeration which may increase the operational costs of aeration and contribute up to 45 75 of the total energy costs of activated sludge systems rosso et al 2008 in this context photosynthetic oxygen generation by microalgae has been utilized for wastewater treatment in the presence of natural or artificial lighting e g wastewater stabilization ponds wsp and high rate algal ponds hrap craggs et al 2014 however these systems require a large surface area and may have poor a nutrient removal capacity when compared to conventional activated sludge systems craggs et al 2003 mara 2004 sutherland et al 2014 the recent development of photo activated sludge pas systems at laboratory scale aims to exploit the synergetic benefits of microalgae and activated sludge systems abouhend et al 2018 ahmad et al 2017 in this process microalgae and bacteria co exist in flocs or granules in a symbiotic relationship that allows for exchange of carbon dioxide co2 and o2 in addition to oxidation of organic matter om and nitrification microalgal bacterial flocs can also assimilate nitrogen n p and om in large quantities for growth manser et al 2016 rada ariza et al 2017 ji et al 2020a furthermore pas systems at the laboratory scale have been shown to improve biomass settleability of microalgae enhance solid liquid separation ji et al 2020a and reduce the system s co2 footprint anbalagan et al 2017 the development of paos in pas systems may also improve biological p removal carvalho et al 2018 furthermore the intracellular poly p stored by paos may increase the density and settleability of the microalgae bacteria flocs schuler et al 2001 carvalho et al 2018 developed a laboratory scale ebpr pas system and attained higher p removal efficiency 79 8 without external aeration at a low influent chemical oxygen demand cod p ratio however from the perspective of design parameters the interaction between paos and microalgae is not fully understood carvalho et al 2018 there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the effect of substrate composition and light intensity on ebpr in systems containing a mixture of paos and microalgae wastewater composition and solar radiation can demonstrate substantial variability both temporally and spatially henze and comeau 2008 eumetsat 2020 therefore a better understanding of the influence of these parameters is important for the further development of ebpr pas systems thus to address this knowledge gap a stoichiometric ebpr pas model based design was first investigated to understand the impact of carbon c and n on p removal following the model development two different synthetic wastewater compositions of cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 20 1 and 10 10 4 were examined in controlled laboratory reactor experiments to evaluate p removal in addition the short term effects of four incident light intensities 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 were also investigated to evaluate the stability of symbiotic paos microalgal capacity for p removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 model based design prior to the start up a model based design approach was used to identify the theoretically optimal operating conditions including synthetic wastewater composition light intensity and operational and environmental conditions the model tables a 1 to a 3 appendix a of the supplementary information was developed in ms excel using the ebpr stoichiometric based steady state design model developed by comeau et al 1986 wentzel et al 1990 and smolders et al 1994a b this model was modified and extended by coupling the oxygen requirements of the aerobic ebpr activity to the oxygen generation by microalgae mara 2004 to develop the model the following assumptions were made a operation of an ebpr pas system in a completely mixed sequencing

the tss concentration using the lambert beer equation swinehart 1962 appendix b fig 1 shows the summary results of the model for balanced paos microalgae symbiosis the model suggested the composition of the synthetic wastewater should contain 100 mg l 1 of cod 12 mg l 1 of po4 p 88 mg l 1 of hco3 and 10 mg l 1 of nh4 n fig 1 a b under these conditions the overall vss and tss concentrations were estimated at 1 08 g l 1 and 1 6 g l 1 fig 1 c respectively which were within the limits specified in the assumptions moreover the oxygen produced by microalgae would be double the paos requirements fig 1 b based on the prediction of the model these concentrations were applied to the start up phase with only minor modifications the inorganic carbon was 200 mg hco3 l 1 instead of 88 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b which supplied the total inorganic carbon required not assuming that paos would retrieve the theoretically calculated 112 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b as co2 anaerobically and aerobically according to smolders et al 1994a b the model estimated an incident light intensity of 145 µmol m 2 sec 1 table a 3 appendix a for the photosynthesis process however a light intensity of 350 µmol m 2 sec 1 was used in the start up phase to avoid light limitation for microalgal growth 2 2 reactor configuration and enrichment of the ebpr pas system two cylindrical double jacketed glass reactors each with an internal diameter of 12 5 cm and an active volume of 2 5 l were used in the study reactor one r1 fig 2 was the main reactor and used for the enrichment and development of the paos microalgae consortia to test the synergetic effect of microalgae and paos to perform ebpr referred to as an ebpr pas system reactor two r2 the study control was operated as a conventional ebpr without microalgae and light referred to as an ebpr system r1 was inoculated with 600 ml of activated sludge from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp harnaschpolder den horn the netherlands with a tss concentration of 6 g l 1 the activated sludge was mixed with 600 ml of five species of microalgae cyanobacteria 120 ml each scenedesmus quadricauda anabaena variabilis chlorella sp chlorococcus sp spirulina sp with an average concentration of 1 g tss l 1 similar to those used by van der steen et al 2015 this led to a total initial tss concentration of 1 75 g l 1 in r1 r2 was inoculated with an enriched culture of paos from an ebpr reactor welles et al 2017 due to operational challenges with r1 which showed poor ebpr activities in the start up phase 25 to 30 ml of enhanced paos culture from r2 was seeded on daily basis to the microalgae biomass in r1 from day 25 to 36 and day 41 the ebpr pas system r1 was operated under alternating anaerobic aerobic ebpr conditions with dark conditions during the anaerobic stage and illuminated conditions during the aerobic stage to enhance the growth of microalgae to achieve this r1 was run as an sbr with four cycles of 6 h per day comprising a 2 h dark anaerobic stage a 3 h illuminated aerobic stage a 0 5 h settling stage and a 0 5 h effluent withdrawal stage fig 2 an adi controller and bioxpert software applikon delft the netherlands were used to operate the sbr and for data acquisition mixing took place in the dark anaerobic and illuminated aerobic stages at 500 rpm van loosdrecht et al 2016 the temperature was maintained at 20 1 c throughout all stages by a lauda system lauda königshofen germany the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 1 to favor paos over glycogen accumulating organisms gao lopez vazquez et al 2009 through the automatic dosing of either 0 4 m hcl or 0 4 m naoh for illumination eight light emitting diode led lamps 40w phillips the netherlands were used with four of each located at opposite sides of the reactor during each cycle from min 5 to min 10 of the anaerobic stage synthetic wastewater was pumped from the influent feeding tank to r1 using a peristaltic pump while a second peristaltic pump positioned in r1 served two purposes to withdraw 105 ml of the mixed liquor for the last 5 mins of the aerobic stage thereby controlling the srt to 6 days and to discharge the effluent during the withdrawal stage fig 2 during the effluent withdrawal stage half of the working volume was removed so as to attain an hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 h during the start up phase p1 an air compressor controlled by an on off valve supplied the oxygen to the reactor during the aerobic period at a point not exceeding 20 of saturation around 1 8 mg l 1 the air compressor was not used when the system was solely dependent on the microalgae oxygen in the phases following the start up phase nitrogen gas n2 was sparged into the reactor during the first 25 mins of the anaerobic stage to generate anaerobic conditions r2 contained the same medium and had the same operational conditions as in r1 srt 6 days hrt 12 h however oxygen was supplied to r2 during all the cycles of the aerobic stages whereas in r1 because of the reliance on microalgae to provide oxygen external aeration was supplied only in the start up phase p1 when the dissolved oxygen do saturation dropped below 20 in addition r2 was not exposed to alternating dark and illumination conditions as was the case with r1 2 3 experimental phases and synthetic medium table 1 shows the operating conditions for the ebpr pas system which were determined based on the outcomes of the model based design it comprised three experimental phases with a total duration of 100 days in phase 1 p1 the ebpr pas system was loaded with synthetic wastewater cod 100 mg l 1 p 12 mg l 1 cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 20 1 mg mg mg after ensuring that the microalgae were growing well enough to produce sufficient oxygen do saturation level 20 the external aeration supply was gradually reduced over 11 days until the ebpr pas system operated without external aeration in phase 2 p2 in order to optimize the nutrients and avoid limiting growth conditions for both organisms the nh4 n concentration was increased by a factor of four and the inorganic carbon reduced by half cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 10 4 mg mg mg and the system was allowed to stabilize when no significant changes in the effluent parameters were observed for at least 3 srt 18 days the system was assumed to have reached pseudo steady state conditions in phase 3 p3 the short term effects of different incident light intensities 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 each lasting three days were investigated on the last day for each light intensity these intensities were within the range reported by eumetsat 2020 in northern european conditions this phase aimed to study the effect of light intensity on do generation and evaluate the culture response to light fluctuations and therefore the performance of the ebpr pas system the

steady state model prediction cod hco3 nh4 n 10 20 1 the ebpr pas system r1 displayed excellent algal photosynthesis activities as measured by the utilization of inorganic carbon and the production of oxygen which occasionally exceeded 300 of the saturated do however r1 demonstrated poor p release and uptake fig 3 the p release and total p uptake for r1 in p1 were 7 3 0 48 mg l 1 se 0 24 n 4 and 7 2 2 8 mg l 1 se 1 05 n 7 fig 3 respectively overall r1 had a final effluent p concentration of 9 45 1 05 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 9 with a net p removal of only 2 75 1 05 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 9 fig 3 in contrast the conventional ebpr system r2 control demonstrated good p release and p uptake fig 3 the p release rate during the anaerobic stage for r2 23 mg l 1 h 1 was four times higher than r1 5 7 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 the maximum p uptake rate during the aerobic period for r2 16 87 mg l 1 h 1 was almost six times higher than in r1 2 76 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 moreover the anaerobic consumption rate of vfa by paos for r2 40 2 mg l 1 h 1 was 2 5 times higher than r1 16 mg l 1 h 1 fig 3 overall the average p release and total p uptake for r2 were 17 1 1 3 mg l 1 and 24 2 5 mg l 1 se 1 04 n 6 fig 3 respectively this make r2 had an effluent p concentration of 4 0 1 4 mg l 1 se 0 41 n 12 with a net p removal of 8 01 1 38 mg l 1 se 0 4 n 12 fig 3 to improve r1 performance 25 to 30 ml of enhanced paos culture vss 0 4 0 03 g l 1 tss 0 7 0 06 g l 1 from r2 was seeded regularly to the microalgae biomass in r1 from day 25 to 36 despite this addition r1 did not demonstrate any capacity for p removal during p1 although both r1 r2 were supplied with the same medium and operated under the same conditions the poor growth of paos culture in r2 may have been due to different stresses in the cultivation system e g o2 saturation nutrient stress competition for nh4 n micro algal concentration sludge age therefore the interplay between paos and microalgae was not balanced with microalgae dominating p1 to investigate the cause of the poor p removal in r1 kinetic studies were performed for r1 on day 24 and r2 on day 33 and compared to each other fig 4 a c the results showed that only 20 mg l 1 of cod was consumed during the anaerobic stage and more than half the influent cod 30 mg l 1 fig 4a escaped into the aerobic stage for r1 on the other hand the influent cod was fully consumed and stored by paos in the anaerobic stage for r2 fig 4a which was an indication of good ebpr activity the p profile in fig 4b shows both p release and p uptake were very low in r1 compared to r2 the maximum p release rate during the anaerobic stage for r2 23 mg l 1 h 1 was eight times higher than r1 3 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b the maximum p uptake rate during the aerobic period for r2 16 87 mg l 1 h 1 was almost six times higher than in r1 2 72 mg l 1 h 1 fig 4b the nh4 n profile in fig 4c shows that nh4 n uptake in r1 started from the beginning of the aerobic stage with a rate of 3 37 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 and was almost fully consumed within the first 45 mins in r2 there was a 30 minute lag in the aerobic stage before paos started to uptake nh4 and then uptake occurred at 0 44 mg nh4 n l 1 h 1 a lower rate than observed in r1 fig 4c as a result of the higher nh4 n uptake in r1 paos growth in this system was likely inhibited by a shortage of n although the total demand of nh4 n by paos was very low according to r2 as shown in fig 4c thus ammonium was likely taken up by microalgae and potentially by other organisms rather than paos in r1 moreover the loss of nh4 by nitrification was not expected due to the addition of the nitrification inhibitor atu therefore the nh4 n concentration in the influent of r1 was increased from 10 mg l 1 to 40 mg l 1 to meet paos requirements also the inorganic carbon concentration in the influent was decreased from 200 mg hco3 l 1 to 100 mg hco3 l 1 to limit the excess nh4 n uptake by microalgae despite this the new value of the inorganic carbon met the model requirement 88 mg hco3 l 1 fig 1 b because the initial concentration of inorganic carbon that had been added in p1 did not consider the inorganic carbon produced by paos section 2 1 3 2 second experimental phase cod hco3 nh4 n of 10 10 4 effective conditions were established by adjusting the nutrient composition cod hco3 and nh4 n to a ratio of 10 10 4 according to the results of the kinetic studies in p1 both p release and p uptake within r1 improved significantly p 0 0001 during p2 and the results were comparable to the control reactor r2 fig 3 the average p release and total p uptake by r1 were 20 1 43 mg l 1 mg l 1 se 0 5 n 8 and 27 8 1 8 mg l 1 se 0 48 n 14 fig 3 respectively the average p concentration in the final effluent for r2 was 1 87 1 45 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 34 with a net removal of 10 33 1 45 mg p l 1 se 0 25 n 34 fig 3 the total cod was fully consumed during the first hour of the anaerobic stage at a rate of 40 mg l 1 h 1 fig 5 a a rate that was similar to previous measurements for r2 fig 4a and almost three times higher than that achieved in p1 for r1 fig 4a fig 5a correspondingly the p release rate for r1 increased three fold from 8 4 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to 28 2 mg l 1 h 1 in p2 fig 5b and p uptake rate for r1 increased six fold from 2 82 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to 16 8 mg l 1 h 1 in p2 fig 5b which was similar to r2 fig 4b fig 5c shows there was a lot of ammonium left in the effluent in p2 and the uptake rate was reduced from 3 84 mg l 1 h 1 in p1 to nearly half in p2 2 3 mg l 1 h 1 fig 5c this decrease was possibly due to the reduction in microalgal biomass as a result of reducing influent inorganic carbon however the nh4 n uptake rate of r1 in p2 was still higher than r2 fig 4c because microalgae and paos will co contribute to the uptake rate of nh4 n in r1 the total nh4 n uptake in p2 was 4 9 mg l 1 fig 5c 9 8 mg l 1 as an influent concentration before dilution this concentration was similar to the nh4 n supplied in p1 therefore inorganic carbon reduction was a key adjustment to limit microalgal growth and cultivate a successful symbiotic relationship between microalgae and paos in p2 there was a reduction in the do concentration in the middle of the aerobic stage which coincided with the depletion of inorganic carbon fig 6 as microalgae were no longer able to perform photosynthesis in the absence of inorganic carbon this indicates that limiting the microalgae growth by controlling the inorganic carbon was a successful measure the medium cod hco3 nh4 n in p2 was supplied at a ratio of 10 10 4 but the actual consumption ratio was 10 10 1 which was similar to that predicted by the model when considering that paos contributed part of hco3 as co2 ratio of 100 88 10 fig 1 a b paos managed to contribute 8 03 mg co2 l 1 11 13 mg l 1 as hco3 anaerobically fig 6 which was almost similar to the model estimation of 11 mg co2 l 1 table a3 appendix a the initial approach adopted in p1 was to avoid limiting conditions for microalgae growth and therefore inorganic carbon was supplied in abundance in p1 not considering the share provided by paos this measure potentially generated excess microalgal biomass in p1 which outcompeted paos for nh4 n 3 3 ebpr pas system performance and characteristics at steady state an enmeshed mixed culture of paos and microalgae was obtained from r1 in p2 appendix c the average tss concentration was 1108 06 154 9 mg l 1 se 41 4 n 17 with an average vss of 839 18 137 mg l 1 se 33 24 n 17 and a vss tss ratio of 0 75 0 027 se 0 007 n 17 fig 7 which was close to the model predictions fig 1 c the lower vss tss ratio in p2 0 75 than in p1 0 99 fig 7 was an indicator of improving ebpr activities in r1 during p2 paos generate inactive biomass inert suspended solids iss from the stored poly p and associated counter ions mg 2 k 1 and ca 2 and therefore have a low vss tss ratio ekama and wentzel 2004 while microalgae generate less iss consequently the vss tss ratio is lower for a conventional ebpr system r2 than an ebpr pas system r1 this was apparent in the current study and that of carvalho et al 2018 as respective vss tss ratios of 0 75 fig 7 and 0 68 0 8 were recorded for ebpr pas systems a vss tss ratio of 0 58 was achieved in r2 of the current study fig 7 and by welles et al 2015 for a conventional ebpr system phosphorus release vfa consumed was 0 58 0 04 p mmol c mmol during p2 which was similar to r2 fig 7 this was also an indication of good ebpr activity according to the results of welles et al 2017 and saad et al 2016 who reported values of between 0 4 and 0 8 p mmol c mmol for paos in conventional ebpr systems the total nh4 n consumption by biomass microalgae paos was 9 3 0 74 mg l 1 se 0 25 n 11 fig 7 during p2 this value was approximately equal to that predicted by the model 10 mg l 1 in which paos and microalgae account for nh4 n uptake of 3 04 and 6 96 mg l 1 respectively fig 1 a during p2 cod consumed average p net removal for r1 100 10 4 was lower than r2 100 8 this indicates that the ebpr pas system required less organic carbon than the conventional ebpr system on days 62 63 64 68 69 and 76 the system was capable of complete po4 removal without the supply of any external aeration appendix d fig d 1 fig d 2 and with a low cod p net removal ratio of 100 12 in which paos and microalgae account for p removal of 11 and 1 mg l 1 respectively according to the model fig 1 a the cod p net removal of 100 12 was lower than that achieved in the literature for best performing conventional ebpr systems for example carvalheira et al 2014a achieved a cod consumed p net removal of 200 20 with an influent p concentration of 20 mg l 1 for conventional ebpr reactor carvalho et al 2018 also reported very low cod consumed p net removal 200 34 for an ebpr pas system with an influent p concentration of 60 mg l 1 the main reason for this low cod p net removal for an ebpr pas system was that microalgae participated in p removal 1 3 of microalgae biomass without requiring cod with inorganic carbon as the carbon source in contrast the ebpr pas system of the current study r1 and carvalho et al 2018 had a lower capacity to remove phosphate per g biomass p vss than the conventional ebpr system r2 this because paos can uptake p to a maximum of 38 of their biomass wentzel et al 1990 while microalgae typically can only uptake p to 1 3 of their biomass mara 2004 however there are some types of microalgae cyanobacteria capable of acting as paos that can significantly contribute to poly p storage for example ji et al 2020b found that the cyanobacteria pantanalinema spp were the major phosphorus accumulating organisms in microalgal bacterial granular sludge although the p content of this cyanobacteria was far less than 38 of vss therefore for similar amounts of phosphate removal an ebpr pas system requires less organic carbon and generates higher biomass than a conventional ebpr system 3 4 third experimental phase light assessment and optimization the reactor performance for different light intensities is shown in fig 8 three of the four light intensities tested were higher than the model estimated light requirement for photosynthesis 145 µmol m 2 sec 1 the oxygen production rate by microalgae decreased when the light intensity reduced 3 5 2 7 2 1 and 0 89 saturated do min 1 for light intensities of 350 262 5 175 and 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 respectively linear correlation r 0 99 fig 8 yet the overall performance between light intensities was not significant p 0 05 no significant variation was observed in the reactor performance regarding p release and p uptake fig 8 suggesting that the culture selected in p2 conditions was resilient to inhibition by lower light intensities reducing the light in p1 e g from 350 to 87 5 µmol m 2 sec 1 may limit the microalgae growth without the need to reduce the inorganic carbon as implemented in p2 this measure would possibly reduce the uptake rate of nh4 n by microalgae and therefore delay the early consumption of nh4 n that occurred in p1 as the light intensity was decreased the p concentration in the effluent improved slightly fig 8 carvalheira et al 2014b observed that paos in an ebpr system prefer to grow in low do concentration and outnumber gaos therefore too much light may not be beneficial for paos conversely too little light may also not be favourable for paos as the total oxygen produced by microalgae may not meet the metabolic and anabolic requirement of paos as explained by the model of smolders et al 1994b 3 5 limitations and implications of the study an ebpr pas system exploits the synergistic relationship between microalgae and paos uncoupling hrt from srt facilitates the use of a smaller sized system hrt 12 h than other microalgal bacterial systems commonly 2 6 days for municipal wastewater muñoz and guieysse 2006 anbalagan et al 2016 also the ebpr pas system requires no external aeration has a high capacity to remove p at low influent cod concentrations and significantly reduces co2 footprint however the current study showed that the system is not always successful and its performance depends on the composition of the influent wastewater this may have practical implications that are difficult to discern at full scale with real wastewater applications for example municipal wastewater will demonstrate an intrinsic temporal variability metcalf and eddy 2003 while the system described in our study treated wastewater at a steady cod hco3 nh4 n ratio of 10 10 4 the current study was operated without nitrification introducing nitrifiers in the ebpr pas system has different implications the system will require more o2 as nitrification usually demands intensive aeration 4 57 mg o2 mg 1 nh4 n nitrified wiesmann 1994 in addition the nitrification process consumes a considerable amount of alkalinity 8 71 mg hco3 mg 1 nh4 n nitrified wiesmann 1994 therefore the system will require more hco3 to produce more o2 and to meet this demand however denitrification can recover half the o2 and alkalinity lost in nitrification 2 86 mg o2 mg 1 no3 n de nitrified 4 36 mg hco3 mg 1 no3 n de nitrified wiesmann 1994 some paos are assumed to use nitrate as an external electron acceptor allowing efficient integration of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphate removal with minimal organic carbon cod requirements sorm et al 1996 saad et al 2016 overall less organic carbon more nitrogen and more inorganic carbon are expected for paos microalgae nitrifier symbiosis than paos microalgae symbiosis the ebpr pas system in this study favored p removal even at low light intensities which is an indication that the system can be operated at low power consumption if artificial lighting is used however when nitrification is incorporated in the ebpr pas system more light is expected to be required by microalgae to meet the high do demand by nitrifiers in addition further light is required as a result of increased tss concentration caused by the additional biomass of nitrifiers although the additional biomass will be minimal as nitrifiers have a very small yield 0 1 mg vss mg 1 nh4 n ekama and wentzel 2008 the light path and culture density as controlled by srt are potential controls to manipulate the photo oxygenation rate arashiro et al 2017 rada ariza et al 2019 for example decreasing the light path and reducing srt can maximize the do concentration in the system 4 conclusion this study showed that careful control of nh4 n and hco3 is critical to balancing paos and microalgae populations in the ebpr pas system at a cod hco3 nh4 n ratio of 10 20 1 the ebpr pas system favored nitrogen removal and microalgal growth and exhibited poor ebpr activities at this ratio the growth of paos was likely inhibited because microalgae consume ammonium earlier than paos during the illuminated stage of operation however once the cod hco3 nh4 n ratio was changed to 10 10 4 the paos and microalgae populations were balanced and the system performance improved significantly to remove p the study also revealed that there were no significant differences in the system performance for different light intensities suggesting that the mixed culture was robust against light fluctuations future studies should focus on testing the ebpr pas system on real municipal wastewater in large volumes to demonstrate applicability of this system to full scale operations in addition the incorporation of nitrification and the influence of nitrate on paos microalgae interplay should be investigated further finally the long term effect of light intensity should be studied to investigate the system performance for stable reactor operation declaration of

17343,an energy cost efficient and environment friendly in situ sludge reduction process called the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa was developed recently however the underpinning mechanism of sludge reduction by the sosa process remains elusive this paper investigated the possible mechanisms of sludge reduction through biomass cultivation in three lab scale experimental systems one anoxic oxic cas process with a long sludge retention time srt and extended aeration eao process and two eao based in situ sludge reduction processes i e the conventional oxic settling anaerobic cosa process and the new sosa process these three comparative biosystems were operated with identical influent and reactor configurations as well as the same biomass concentrations and srts approximately 5 g l and 46 days respectively and the sludge interchange ratios between the cas and side stream reactors in cosa and sosa were both 10 per day three systems all achieved high organic 93 and total nitrogen tn 74 removal efficiencies sosa produced 29 and 20 less sludge than eao and cosa respectively simultaneously consumed 14 and 8 more oxygen than eao and cosa indicating that the sludge reduction in sosa was not only caused by eao based aerobic digestion in the mainstream and conventional anaerobic reactions in the side stream but more importantly due to the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis the roles of sulfidogenesis were further studied in batch tests and the key findings were as follows i the sosa biomass had a faster endogenous decay rate 0 097 d 1 than that of the cosa biomass 0 045 d 1 and ii sulfidogenesis accelerated anaerobic solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 2 3 3 1 times 6 22 22 60 and 6 22 respectively overall the mechanisms of sludge reduction in sosa were unraveled in this study which will help promote its full scale application in future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords in situ sludge reduction sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa sulfidogenesis intensified sludge decay extended aeration 1 introduction waste activated sludge was as an undesired but inevitable byproduct of the conventional activated sludge cas process always needs to be treated but the sludge treatment processes including sludge thickening digestion dewatering and final disposal are complex and expensive the cost of handling was is about 30 50 of the total operational expense of wastewater treatment plants wwtps ferrentino et al 2016 to reduce this cost and any potential secondary pollution from was an alternative economical biological approach the oxic settling anaerobic osa process which can be achieved by inserting an anaerobic side stream reactor ssr in the sludge return loop reducing sludge by 30 60 has been developed to minimize the was production within the cas process saby et al 2003 chen et al 2003 chon et al 2011 generally the sludge reduction in the conventional osa cosa process consists of two steps 1 hydrolysis of particulate organic matter pom together with lysis of bacterial cell materials to dissolved organic matter dom and 2 cryptic growth of biomass by using dom as a substrate in anaerobic and or aerobic conditions the abovementioned steps are also collectively known as the hydro lysis regeneration process guo et al 2020 among which the hydrolysis lysis step is considered rate limiting khursheed and kazmi 2011 to accelerate hydro lysis several techniques have been attempted such as ultrasonically assisted sludge decomposition zheng et al 2019 or the dosing of strong oxidative chemicals e g ozone salehiziri et al 2019 however the extra costs for energy and chemicals are rather high at the range of 8 75 10 3 22 58 10 3 us m3 wastewater romero et al 2015 yang et al 2015 hence the cost effective and environment friendly in situ sludge reduction process is urgently needed recently a new strategy applying the inhibitory chemicals free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa for in situ sludge reduction was proposed and found to effectively reduce sludge by 20 28 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 another new sludge minimizing biological process was developed named the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process in which a small amount of sulfate 10 mg s lwastewater is added to the cosa process according to the first report by huang et al 2019 sosa can successfully recruit the sulfidogenesis process into the anaerobic ssr as a result achieving 30 higher sludge reduction than that of cosa and maintaining a good mainstream operational performance sosa not only takes advantages of the inhibitory effects of sulfide but also transforms the wastewater treatment bacteria from conventional heterotrophs to slow growth yield bacteria such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob and other facultative bacteria however the mechanisms underpinning in situ sludge reduction in sosa are unclear the mechanisms of sludge reduction for cosa type systems have been extensively investigated one comprehensive study by chon et al 2011 demonstrated that about 50 of sludge reduction took place in the mainstream extended aeration eao reactor due to the long sludge retention time srt of 63 days while the other half was achieved in the anaerobic ssr it should also be noted that the method of eao has been applied for in situ sludge reduction in cas systems sharafi et al 2015 in eao cas the system is purposely operated with a longer srt 20 40 days than of the more typical 5 10 days enabling approximately 30 56 of the was to be aerobically digested mahmood and elliott 2006 hence mainstream eao serves as one of the sludge reduction mechanisms in sosa however the size of its contribution is unknown in the side stream pom is anaerobically hydrolyzed into dom mainly proteins and then the proteins are rapidly degraded in the aerobic conditions when the anaerobic sludge is recycled back to the mainstream novak et al 2007 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis to the cosa process is expected to play important roles in sludge reduction for a number of reasons i the sulfidogenic ssr intensifies the sludge destruction and cell lysis through enhancing the endogenous decay rates nielsen and keiding 1998 ii the additional small molecular sulfate which initiates sulfidogenesis can potentially change the thermodynamic conditions during the anaerobic degradation bioprocesses including solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis zan and hao 2020 iii the sulfide compounds can enter into the bacterial cell membrane resulting in cell inactivation by protein denaturation postgate 1984 speece 1983 and interfering with the metabolic coenzymes by forming sulfide bonds parkin and owen 1986 however it is still unclear to what extent sulfidogenesis contributes to the aforementioned sludge disintegration and degradation and it is still uncertain whether the enhanced sludge reduction in sosa is due to the extremely long srt exceeding 300 days for sludge decay rather than the expected sulfidogenesis intensified effects as the previous study was conducted under this extremely long srt operational conditions huang et al 2019 hence comprehensive and comparative research is needed to unravel the underpinning mechanisms of in situ sludge reduction in the sosa process and confirm the hypothetical roles of sulfate reduction and sulfide chemical in this work three representative systems were operated in parallel including i an eao anoxic aerobic activated sludge system in a sequential batch reactor sbreao and ii and iii a cosa system and a sosa system consisting of identical mainstream anoxic aerobic sbr reactors sbrcosa and sbrsosa and ssrs ssrcosa and ssrsosa to investigate the effects of mainstream eao and side stream sulfidogenesis on the sludge reduction mechanisms the operational performance and sludge reduction of these three systems were routinely monitored over 200 days the key factors of theoretical oxygen demand thod balance i e system electron balance endogenous decay rates and active biomass fractions for in depth analysis were investigated in batch tests for each system moreover the effects of sulfate reduction and various sulfide concentrations on sludge destruction and the anaerobic microbial activities solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis were studied in batch experimental conditions 2 materials and methods three parallel systems eao cosa and sosa which were installed in our previous study huang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 and inoculated with the activated sludge from a local wwtp shatin wwtp hong kong were continuously operated for over 200 days from day 205 to day 410 the characteristics of the inoculated activated sludge

wastewater each sbr s operating cycle lasted for 4 h which consisted of i a 1 h anoxic phase including feeding 1 25 l of synthetic sewage to the reactor for 8 min and ii a 2 h aerobic phase and iii a phase including settling 0 75 h decanting 8 min and idling 7 min the hydraulic retention time was 0 67 d a 70 mm disc diffuser was installed at the bottom of each sbr to provide air during the aerobic phase to maintain the dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 3 mg o2 l a mechanical mixer provided effective mixing 150 rpm during both anoxic and aerobic phases the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to huang et al 2019 having 260 mg cod l 30 mg nh3 n l and 5 mg po4 3 p l for the ssrs sbrcosa and sbrsosa in the cosa and sosa systems were each connected to an ssr with a working volume of 1 l anaerobic ssr ssrcosa and sulfidogenic ssr ssrsosa a magnetic stirrer 300 rpm was applied to ensure sufficient mixing in each ssr ssrcosa and ssrsosa treated 10 of activated sludge from sbrcosa and sbrsosa every day respectively the feeding pattern was 6 times per day after the same volume of mixed sludge liquor was recycled back to the sbrs from the ssrs at the beginning of the anoxic phase the sulfate concentration in the sludge inflow of ssrsosa was maintained at 300 mg so4 s l by dosing sodium sulfate no intentional sludge wastage was allowed from the three systems during the first 40 d of operation day 205 day 245 as a result the sludge accumulated and the respective sludge accumulation rates were calculated after 40 d the mlss concentrations in the three sbrs were controlled at the same level about 5 g l by allowing sludge wastage from the sbrs based on their respectively calculated sludge accumulation rates it should also be noted that the three systems srts were all purposely constrained to about 40 days reflecting the real world practice of the eao cas process by routine discharge of was at the rates of 329 400 317 358 and 252 273 mgvss d respectively where vss represents volatile suspended solids 2 2 analysis of theoretical oxygen demand thod and sludge decay rate 2 2 1 thod balance analysis based on the system monitoring results the electron balance was evaluated through thod analysis thod is the electron donating capacity in terms of oxygen of compounds that can donate electrons in reference to the assigned values for co2 h2o and no3 ekama et al 2009 thod balance uses both cod and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations by converting the tkn component to the equivalent cod concentration thod cod 4 57 tkn by tracking the fluxes of cod and tkn through each system the thod introduced into the activated sludge system should be equal to the thod departing from the system as shown in fig 1d henze et al 2008 i e 1 tho d in tho d

including oxygen demand for organic cod removal and nitrification mg o2 d the sub components in eqs 2 and 3 can be calculated according to the equations described in si 2 then the thod balance can be calculated by eq 4 4 thod balance tho d in tho d out 100 tho d influent tho d effluent tho d was tho d n 2 tho d oxygen consumption 100 2 2 2 sludge decay rate the mlvss xv in activated sludge consist of three components 1 active biomass which is divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic groups xh and xaut 2 endogenous residue and 3 unbiodegradable inert solids from the influent according to activated sludge modeling henze et al 2000 the endogenous residue is unbiodegradable and incorporated into the inert organic solids xiv and the amount of xaut is considerably lower than the xh in activated sludge systems therefore the autotrophic biomass can be neglected the synthetic wastewater in this study did not include inert solids thus 5 x v f cv mlvss x h x iv the sludge reduction in the activated sludge process is mainly accomplished by decreasing mlvss through x h decay namely 6 d x v dt k d x v 1 f b h x h where x v x h and x iv are the concentrations of mlvss active heterotrophic biomass and inert vss in terms of cod g cod l f cv is the cod equivalence of vss equals to 1 42 g cod g vss wrc 1984 b h is the decay rate for active heterotrophic biomass d 1 f is the inert endogenous residue fraction with a default value of 0 20 henze et al 2000 k d is the decay coefficient of mlvss d 1 the endogenous mass loss of active heterotrophic biomass can be expressed as 7 d x h dt b h x h the value of bh can be determined by measuring the endogenous our ou r en do dt which depends on the endogenous mass loss of xh under the given conditions aerobic or anaerobic without external substrates marais and ekama 1976 then 8 ou r en 1 f b h x h combining eqs 7 and 8 under a given initial condition of t 0 and x h x h i taking the logarithmic transformation gives eq 9 from which eq 10 can be further derived 9 ln ou r en ln 1 f b h x h i b h t 10 ou r en 1 f b h x h i e b h t a e b h t where x h i is the initial heterotrophic biomass concentration in the batch test g cod

ou r en 1 f b h x h i a having determined b h and a from the fitting curve x h i can be solved as a 1 f b h the experimental details for the determination of b h and x h i are described under batch test b 2 3 determination of the kinetic parameters 2 3 1 batch test a determination of oxygen consumption in an activated sludge process the thodoxygen consumption is the mass of oxygen required for the process given as the sum of the oxygen required for the oxidation of organics cod and the oxygen required for nitrification the mass of oxygen reduced by denitrification is subtracted from the quantity of thodnitrification as equivalent oxygen shown in eq s6 therefore thodoxygen consumption can be determined through monitoring the total our ourt in situ of the sbr operation during the aerobic phase 2 h van haandel and van der lubbe 2007 the procedures of these our based experiments are described in si 3 a typical ourt profile at the aerobic phase of sbreao as shown in fig s4 can be divided into two stages stage i includes both oxidation of substrates from wastewater designated as exogenous our ourex and endogenous respiration designated as ouren and stage ii only includes ouren in consequence the thodoxygen consumption can be calculated from the area between the ourt curve and the base ouren line expressed by eq 11 11 tho d oxygen consum t initial t final r o 2 t t dt t

in the eao cosa and sosa systems mixed sludge liquor collected from sbreao sbrcosa sbrsosa ssrcosa and ssrsosa on day 375 was fed into five batch reactors 2 l for endogenous decay batch tests as shown in fig s5 the batch test b1 b2 and b3 tested the aerobic endogenous decay in sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa bh oxic batch tests b4 and b5 tested the anaerobic endogenous decay in ssrcosa and ssrsosa bh an by plotting the ouren profiles versus time and simulating the nonlinear regression curves according to eq 10 the values of bh oxic and bh an and xh i were calculated the detailed experimental procedures of batch tests b1 b5 are described in si 3 2 4 testing the effects of sulfidogenesis and sulfide concentration 2 4 1 batch test c effect of sulfidogenic condition on anaerobic reactions the effect of sulfidogenesis on the anaerobic reactions including i sludge solubilization measured as the release of scod ii hydrolysis iii acidification and iv acetogenesis were studied using four model sludge samples compounds as substrates duan et al 2016 the methods are described in detail in si 4 and summarized briefly as follow sludge solubilization 20 ml of thickened was 10 g vss l taken from sbreao was mixed with 40 ml of inoculum sludge 10 g vss l from ssrcosa or ssrsosa in 120 ml serum bottles achieving a was to inoculum ratio of 1 2 based on the vss the sulfate concentration in the ssrsosa series was adjusted to 300 mg s l the same level as in the sosa long term experiments by dosing sodium sulfate the released scod concentrations including carbonaceous and sulfide types were determined daily hydrolysis bsa a model protein and dextran a model polysaccharide were used to prepare synthetic wastewater by dissolving the masses of 0 37 g and 0 08 g respectively into 60 ml ultrapure water and then adding 10 ml of inoculum from the ssrs with a final sludge concentration of about 1500 mg l the sulfate concentration in the bottle of the ssrsosa group was maintained at 300 mg s l by dosing sodium sulfate the concentrations of bsa and dextran were tested daily the effect of sulfidogenesis on the acidification and acetogenesis of the hydrolyzed products was investigated under the same conditions as those during the hydrolysis process except that the substrates were replaced by a mixture of 0 37 g l alanine and 0 08 g glucose and 0 21 g sodium propionate respectively 2 4 2 batch test d effect of sulfide concentration contact batch tests were performed to assess the effects of sulfide concentration on activated sludge solubilization and microbial activities the thickened sludge taken from sbrsosa which had already acclimated to the impact of sulfide was exposed to the designated sulfide concentrations 0 50 100 and 150 mg s l over 24 h then the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers were determined after sulfide was removed through washing according to wang et al 2013 additionally the effects of the initial sulfide concentration on the rates of anaerobic degradation processes including hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis were investigated the details of the above experiments are described in si 4 2 5 chemical analysis the wastewater characteristics of the influent and effluent of the bioreactors as well as the batch test samples including total suspended solids tss vss cod tn nh3 n no2 n no3 n and so4 2 s were tested routinely or according to the designated batch tests soluble constituents were analyzed after filtration using 0 45 µm membrane filters the carbonaceous scod was analyzed using hach tubes with the exclusion of sulfide interference according to lu et al 2012 no2 n no3 n po4 3 p and so4 2 s were detected using an ion chromatography system dionex aquion ic system thermo fisher tss vss and nh3 n were tested according to the standard method apha 2005 total dissolved sulfide was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 proteins and polysaccharides were measured by lowry folin method and phenol sulfuric method respectively lowry et al 1951 dubois et al 1956 the determination of l alanine was according to bergmeyer and horder 1980 do and ph were measured with multimeters wtw multi 3420 the observed sludge yield and srt were determined according to huang et al 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 long term operation the variations of pollutant concentrations in the influent and effluent of the three mainstream sbrs are shown in table 1 and fig s1 the results showed that sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa could remove scod effectively with effluent scod concentrations of 18 00 2 67 10 35 3 80 and 8 58 3 47 mg l respectively the effluent scod of the mainstream reactor without an ssr sbreao was higher than those of the mainstream reactors with an ssr sbrcosa and sbrsosa this might be due to the extension of the srt to 46 days increasing the extent of exposure of the activated sludge to aerobic conditions aerobic digestion extending the srt of cas has been found to induce the accumulation of soluble microbial products mainly biomass associated products if the srt is longer than 15 days xie et al 2012 sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa all achieved remarkable ammonia oxidation with average nh3 n concentrations in the effluent of 0 73 0 14 0 68 0 14 and 0 66 0 12 mg l respectively and nitrification efficiencies all higher than 98 notably the cosa and sosa systems effectively achieved ammonia oxidation even despite the decay of active biomass in the ssrs ssrcosa and ssrsosa resulting in the release of scod and ammonia fig s2 implying that the nitrification bioprocess was not impaired when the sludge was recycled between mainstream and side stream reactors this demonstrates that the decay of nitrifying bacteria was not severe under anaerobic conditions moreover the srts of the three sbrs were prolonged enough to maintain a sufficient amount of nitrifiers and ensure effective nitrification which are prerequisites for denitrification li and wu 2014 the denitrification performances of the three systems were good with the influent tn of 35 61 1 8 mg n l the nitrogen removal efficiencies of sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa were all around 74 0 5 the potential effects of exposing nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to sulfide were also examined via batch experiments the major findings are discussed in section 3 3 the tss concentrations in the effluent were also measured and were found to be stable at 10 33 1 18 11 87 1 66 and 9 63 1 26 mg l in eao cosa and sosa respectively in addition considering the dosage of sulfate in ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentrations in the influent and effluent were analyzed with influent so4 2 s concentrations of 4 52 0 30 mg l eao and cosa showed stable effluent so4 2 s concentrations of 4 57 0 32 and 4 55 0 31 mg l respectively the so4 2 s concentration in the sosa effluent increased to 11 64 0 36 mg l due to the sulfate dosage in ssrsosa 3 1 2 sludge reduction the observed sludge yield coefficients yobs were determined by plotting the cumulative generated sludge g ss against the cumulative consumed substrate g cod and then carrying out linear regression analysis on the obtained curves fig 2 the results showed that the yobs of the eao system with the srt maintained at about 46 d was 0 304 g ss g cod this value was lower than that reported in our previous study for an ao system with a short srt of 10 d 0 473 g ss g cod huang et al 2019 this result indicates the occurrence of sludge reduction in the eao system made possible by the long srt which increased the bacterial energy expenditure for cell maintenance and decay and left less metabolic energy for cell synthesis khursheed and kazmi 2011 this sludge reduction mechanism referred to as mainstream eao has actually been widely applied in full scale activated sludge processes where a dedicated sludge reduction facility is not available but sludge reduction is occasionally required to reduce the disposal of was özdemir et al 2014 compared with eao the yobs of cosa and sosa were lower at 0 270 and 0 216 g ss g cod respectively implying that the sludge production was further reduced by 11 and 29 the greater sludge reduction in the cosa and sosa systems indicated the existence of multiple mechanisms of sludge reduction in addition to the endogenous decay taking place in the eao system the ssr creates anaerobic conditions in osa type systems in which sludge destruction and cell lysis occur and convert pom into dom chon et al 2011 the dom released in the ssr is utilized as a substrate in the mainstream sbrs but only for cryptic growth catabolism and not to synthesize new biomass anabolism as reported in huang et al 2014 in summary the combination of eao occurring in the mainstream and anaerobic reactions occurring in the side stream contributed to the higher sludge reduction in the osa type system two points still need to be further verified i whether the degradation of dom in the mainstream required a greater oxygen demand and if so by how much and ii whether endogenous decay occurred under aerobic anaerobic and sulfidogenic conditions and if so how much they contributed to sludge reduction to answer these questions additional batch experiments were conducted and are described in sections 3 1 3 and 3 2 3 1 3 thod electron balance to verify the accuracy of the measures of reactor performance and sludge reduction electron balance analysis was conducted for all three systems the thod flux was evaluated to determine the mass balance equation based on the measured values of the influent and effluent scod ammonia nitrate and suspended solids concentrations as introduced in the above section as well as the oxygen demand in the three systems determined in the in situ batch tests batch test a the total ours were measured in three consecutive operating cycles in aerobic phases in situ and the obtained our profiles are shown in fig 3 by integrating the area of the exogenous our curves the oxygen demands of the eao cosa and sosa systems were calculated as 1747 40 1877 44 and 2033 62 mg o2 d respectively interestingly the results showed that sosa had both the lowest sludge production and highest oxygen demand the measured results were used for thod balance analysis as shown in table s1 it can be seen that the thod was balanced in all three systems with a low error of 0 6 1 5 which validated the ability of the osa type process to reduce sludge within the cas system but at the cost of higher oxygen demand the thod flux details are further presented in fig 3d to illustrate the sludge reduction mechanism the proportion of thod reserved in the was showed a similar trend to that of the sludge yield decreasing in the order of 21 8 19 9 and 15 4 for eao cosa and sosa respectively in consequence more organic content in the influent was converted to co2 resulting in a higher oxygen demand for organic removal in cosa 1360 65 mg o2 d and sosa 1474 66 mg o2 d than in eao 1243 69 mg o2 d it should be noted that biogenic co2 is not counted as a greenhouse gas emission ipcc 2006 for osa type systems the minimization of excess sludge generation generally involves two major processes 1 enhanced sludge decay and anaerobically driven pom degradation and 2 effective utilization of the secondary substrates in the mainstream reactors for organic oxidation and or denitrification guo et al 2020 foladori et al 2015 biomass growth via the utilization of the secondary substrates released from decayed microorganisms is called cryptic growth mason and hamer 1987 and can reduce the sludge yield consequently cell lysis cryptic growth in osa type systems is considered the main mechanism for sludge reduction guo et al 2020 the additional side stream augmentation in cosa and sosa also induces biomass decay and drives the conversion of carbonaceous organics to co2 in mainstream reactors with cryptic growth the higher degree of decay in the side stream might be the reason for the lower sludge yield and higher oxygen demand in sosa thus the roles of sulfidogenesis in enhancing sludge reduction are worthy of in depth investigation 3 2 effects of sludge decay the sludge reduction in the activated sludge process is attributed to the diminished mass of active biomass in particular through lysis of heterotrophic biomass x h in this study the existence of endogenous decay was revealed by endogenous respiration tests the profiles of endogenous our versus time in batch test b and the fitting results are shown in fig 4 and table 2 from these results the aerobic endogenous decay rates b h oxic in the mainstream reactors were determined as 0 114 0 136 and 0 142 d 1 in sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa respectively all of these values fell in the range of the endogenous decay rates of active biomass x h between 0 059 and 0 500 d 1 as reported in friedrich and takács 2013 confirming the plausibility of the measured results notably the mainstream endogenous decay rates were increased in the cosa and sosa systems corresponding to the greater sludge reduction by 11 29 regarding the anaerobic endogenous sludge decay rates in the ssrs the b h an values of ssrcosa and ssrsosa were measured as 0 045 and 0 097 d 1 respectively the values measured in this study fell in the range of 0 033 0 1 d 1 as reported in previous research manser et al 2006 siegrist et al 1999 the decay rates in the ssrs were lower than that in their respective mainstream sbrs this is not surprising as habermacher et al 2015 confirmed that the specific sludge degradation rates in ssr with aerobic conditions were 2 7 4 1 times higher than those in anoxic and anaerobic conditions however the aerobic ssr is not recommended due to it is energy intensive process and might negatively affect the effluent quality chon et al 2011 although the b h an of ssrcosa was relatively low the total amount of sludge in the ssr was as high as 6 60 8 00 g vss l meaning that a remarkably high level of sludge reduction in the side stream had still been achieved 11 sludge reduction moreover the b h an of ssrsosa was almost double that of ssrcosa meaning a 20 greater sludge reduction in sosa than in cosa the active biomass x h and the fraction of x h expressed as fav x h x v were evaluated and are summarized in table 2 the x h content in sbreao was 31 27 and further reduced to 25 99 and 25 11 in sbrcosa and sbrsosa respectively the f av value was slightly decreased to 25 73 in ssrcosa and further decreased to 22 46 in ssrsosa the theoretical true yield should be 0 930 g vssproduced d for all three systems but due to the effect of endogenous sludge decay the actual sludge production rate was reduced under all three schemes the contributions of endogenous sludge decay in the different reactors were further estimated and are shown in fig 4c the sludge reduction attributed to endogenous respiration in sbreao was 0 570 g vssreduced d however greater extents of endogenous sludge decay occurred in cosa 0 620 g vssreduced d and sosa 0 675 g vssreduced d including endogenous removal of sludge mass in both the mainstream reactors and ssrs the endogenous decay rates in sbrcosa and sbrsosa were comparable at about 0 550 0 552 g vssreduced d the additional endogenous sludge decay in cosa and sosa was contributed by the augmentation of ssrcosa 0 068 g vssreduced d and ssrsosa 0 125 g vssreduced d considering the overall impacts the net sludge yields of cosa 0 310 g vssproduced d and sosa 0 255 g vssproduced d were reduced by 13 8 and 29 3 compared with eao 0 360 g vssproduced d in summary the combined effects of extended aerobic digestion and strengthened side stream decay by sulfidogenesis enhanced the sludge reduction compared with eao and cosa systems and the accumulation of inert solids in the system furthermore the hydrolysis of pom and the cell lysis in anaerobic sulfidogenic conditions induce the release of dom which can serve as the secondary substrate for bacterial metabolism in mainstream sbrs chen et al 2003 the performances of ssrcosa and ssrsosa are illustrated in table 3 and fig s2 low influent scod concentrations were observed in both ssrs 20 mg l the carbonaceous scod concentration of ssrsosa was 52 13 5 56 mg l while that of ssrcosa had a lower value of 32 85 6 18 mg l showing that the sulfidogenic conditions in ssrsosa enhanced the release of dom hence in sosa more catabolic cod oxidation occurred than anabolic cell growth 3 3 effects of sulfidogenesis the so4 2 s and total dissolved sulfide concentrations were evaluated in the ssrs table 3 and fig s2c d in ssrcosa the so4 2 s concentration in the influent was 4 55 0 31 mg l and dropped to 0 50 0 24 mg l in the effluent however none of sulfide in ssrcosa was detectable in ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentrations in the influent and effluent were 295 5 9 0 and 230 8 17 2 mg l respectively generating 77 8 4 2 mg s l of dissolved sulfide the superior performance of sulfate reduction in ssrsosa is due to a higher degree of sludge destruction the potential effects of sulfidogenesis and sulfide compounds on anaerobic bioprocesses and sludge solubilization as well as the activities of the functional bacteria in mainstream were further investigated and are discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 3 3 1 acceleration of anaerobic bioprocesses the successful establishment of anaerobic conditions in the ssr is important for osa type processes in which anaerobic microorganisms enrich and utilize the was as a substrate chen et al 2003 ferrentino et al 2016 anaerobic fermentation involves four steps solubilization hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis chen et al 2007 luo et al 2015 solubilization and hydrolysis are considered as the rate limiting steps zhao et al 2015 at the solubilization stage the pom in was mainly including proteins and polysaccharides needs to be converted into soluble forms for further utilization by hydrolytic bacteria acidogens and acetogens in batch test c the anaerobic reactions in ssrs and the potential effects of sulfidogenesis on the aforementioned four steps that occur during fermentation were investigated as shown in fig 5 a the sludge solubilization process in terms of scod concentrations comprising carbonaceous and sulfide scod under the sulfidogenic conditions in ssrsosa 826 0 42 4 mg cod l increased much faster than under the anaerobic conditions in ssrcosa 310 5 36 1 mg cod l in the first five days furthermore the effects of sulfidogenesis on the hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis processes were studied with three synthetic wastewaters containing model compounds i e bsa and dextran for hydrolysis l alanine and glucose for acidification and propionic acid for acetogenesis the model compounds degradation profiles are plotted in fig s7a c and their degradation rates are summarized in fig 5b d the hydrolytic degradation rates of bsa and dextran by ssrcosa were 560 70 36 51 mg cod g vss d and 92 75 9 77 mg cod g vss d respectively the corresponding rates slightly increased to 593 29 18 03 mg cod g vss d and 113 12 16 02 mg cod g vss d in ssrsosa respectively these results demonstrated that the acidification and acetogenesis processes were markedly stimulated by sulfidogenesis as the respective rates increased by 18 34 l alanine 37 68 glucose and 18 29 propionate such bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis has been previously reported to accelerate the hydrolysis of biodegradable substrates in anaerobic digestion by 41 to 82 zan and hao 2020 it is believed that srb which can degrade various organics through thermodynamically favorable processes can cooperate with anaerobic bacteria by reducing the energy barrier to the formation of intermediates li et al 2015 which leads to a robust anaerobic microbial community and thus enhance the degradation rates involved in anaerobic digestion 3 3 2 effects of the exposure of sulfide the sulfide generated by srb can trigger sludge disintegration and cell lysis nielsen and keiding 1998 thus the potential effects of sulfide concentration on sludge solubilization microbial activities and anaerobic bioprocesses needed further investigation as shown in fig 6 a bringing was into contact with sulfide caused the release of dom the rate of which was positively related to the sulfide concentration with the highest value of 201 15 7 07 mg cod g vss occurring at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l this might be attributed to the degradation of fe bonded extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell lysis caused by sulfide park et al 2006 nielsen and keiding 1998 sulfide can enter into the cell membrane inactivating bacteria by denaturing the bacterial proteins postgate 1984 speece 1983 and inhibit the metabolic coenzymes by forming sulfide bonds parkin and owen 1986 therefore the toxicity of the sulfide produced in sosa to mainstream microorganisms and anaerobic bioprocesses should be examined the effects of sulfide on the activities of mainstream microorganisms were tested in batch test d as shown in fig 6b and c the activities decreased continually as the sulfide concentration increased suggesting that the aob nob and denitrifiers all experienced the inhibitory effects of sulfide the activities of the aob nob and denitrifiers decreased from 6 55 0 35 and 5 96 0 56 and 97 21 4 71 mg n g vss h to 4 54 0 50 and 3 09 0 25 and 67 51 5 14 mg n g vss h at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l respectively in other words sulfide had an inhibitory effect on the aob nob and denitrifiers reducing their activities by 30 48 and 31 respectively in spite of this inhibition the nitrification and denitrification efficiencies in sosa were found to be comparable to those of eao and cosa only 10 of biomass from the mainstream of sbrsosa was treated in ssrsosa daily while the remaining biomass in sbrsosa remained active and recovered its activity after the sulfide was depleted during the anoxic phase of sbrsosa via denitrification the effects of sulfide concentration on the anaerobic reaction rates including those of hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis were also studied shown in fig 6d f the degradation rates of bsa and dextran were slightly increased by 7 8 at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l but were stable at 589 25 606 75 mg cod g vss d of bsa and 113 12 118 63 mg cod g vss d of dextran at initial sulfide concentrations from 0 to 100 mg s l the results showed that sulfide promoted hydrolysis but did not adversely affect the activities of hydrolysis microorganisms it might because that in the first stage of anaerobic digestion hydrolysis comprises of a large number of individual reactions which are carried out by facultative anaerobic microorganisms and various enzymes in this stage the polymeric organics are hydrolysed to their respective monomers lower molecular weight products which is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes jain et al 1992 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis in anaerobic system was found to improve the sludge degradation extent by 20 and enhance the hydrolysis rate by 41 to 82 whittington jones et al 2002 zan and hao 2020 the enhancement of hydrolytic enzyme activity by sulfide and the cooperation between hydrolytic and sulfate reducing microorganisms were considered as the key mechanisms watson et al 2004 chauke 2002 although sulfide is toxic to various bacteria groups in anaerobic digestion the hydrolytic fermentative microorganisms were less affected by sulfide toxicity than the other anaerobic bacteria chen et al 2008 appels et al 2008 the reaction rates of acidification were unaffected by the initial sulfide concentrations indicating that the acidogens in ssrsosa were resistant to the sulfidogenic conditions even at the sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l however the acetogens were more sensitive to the initial sulfide concentrations the activities of acetogens decreased by 6 and 13 at initial sulfide concentrations of 100 and 150 mg s l respectively in general the sulfide compounds produced by sulfate reduction had profound effects on sludge destruction and solubilization however their adverse effects on anaerobic microorganisms should also be borne in mind especially the effects on acetogens 4 conclusion three lab scale experimental systems were operated in parallel to investigate the mechanism of sludge reduction in the sosa process the specific conclusions drawn from this study are as follows i the sosa process obtained a low yobs of 0 216 g ss g cod with efficient pollutant removal achieving 97 98 and 74 removal of scod nh3 n and tn respectively ii the sludge reduction achieved by sosa was 28 9 and 20 0 greater than those of eao and cosa resulting in its having the highest oxygen demand during mainstream operation iii the endogenous decay under sulfidogenic conditions was faster with a constant of 0 097 d 1 than that in anaerobic conditions 0 045 d 1 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis in ssrsosa contributed to its greater sludge removal than that in ssrcosa the enhanced active biomass decay rates in cosa and sosa led to lower x h fractions iv sulfidogenic conditions enhanced the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes the sulfide production in ssrsosa played an important role in sludge destruction and decreased the activities of functional bacteria but had no adverse effects on the system performance therefore the eao process in the mainstream and sludge destruction in the sulfidogenic side stream were identified to have combined effects on sludge reduction in sosa

17343,an energy cost efficient and environment friendly in situ sludge reduction process called the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa was developed recently however the underpinning mechanism of sludge reduction by the sosa process remains elusive this paper investigated the possible mechanisms of sludge reduction through biomass cultivation in three lab scale experimental systems one anoxic oxic cas process with a long sludge retention time srt and extended aeration eao process and two eao based in situ sludge reduction processes i e the conventional oxic settling anaerobic cosa process and the new sosa process these three comparative biosystems were operated with identical influent and reactor configurations as well as the same biomass concentrations and srts approximately 5 g l and 46 days respectively and the sludge interchange ratios between the cas and side stream reactors in cosa and sosa were both 10 per day three systems all achieved high organic 93 and total nitrogen tn 74 removal efficiencies sosa produced 29 and 20 less sludge than eao and cosa respectively simultaneously consumed 14 and 8 more oxygen than eao and cosa indicating that the sludge reduction in sosa was not only caused by eao based aerobic digestion in the mainstream and conventional anaerobic reactions in the side stream but more importantly due to the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis the roles of sulfidogenesis were further studied in batch tests and the key findings were as follows i the sosa biomass had a faster endogenous decay rate 0 097 d 1 than that of the cosa biomass 0 045 d 1 and ii sulfidogenesis accelerated anaerobic solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis by 2 3 3 1 times 6 22 22 60 and 6 22 respectively overall the mechanisms of sludge reduction in sosa were unraveled in this study which will help promote its full scale application in future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords in situ sludge reduction sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa sulfidogenesis intensified sludge decay extended aeration 1 introduction waste activated sludge was as an undesired but inevitable byproduct of the conventional activated sludge cas process always needs to be treated but the sludge treatment processes including sludge thickening digestion dewatering and final disposal are complex and expensive the cost of handling was is about 30 50 of the total operational expense of wastewater treatment plants wwtps ferrentino et al 2016 to reduce this cost and any potential secondary pollution from was an alternative economical biological approach the oxic settling anaerobic osa process which can be achieved by inserting an anaerobic side stream reactor ssr in the sludge return loop reducing sludge by 30 60 has been developed to minimize the was production within the cas process saby et al 2003 chen et al 2003 chon et al 2011 generally the sludge reduction in the conventional osa cosa process consists of two steps 1 hydrolysis of particulate organic matter pom together with lysis of bacterial cell materials to dissolved organic matter dom and 2 cryptic growth of biomass by using dom as a substrate in anaerobic and or aerobic conditions the abovementioned steps are also collectively known as the hydro lysis regeneration process guo et al 2020 among which the hydrolysis lysis step is considered rate limiting khursheed and kazmi 2011 to accelerate hydro lysis several techniques have been attempted such as ultrasonically assisted sludge decomposition zheng et al 2019 or the dosing of strong oxidative chemicals e g ozone salehiziri et al 2019 however the extra costs for energy and chemicals are rather high at the range of 8 75 10 3 22 58 10 3 us m3 wastewater romero et al 2015 yang et al 2015 hence the cost effective and environment friendly in situ sludge reduction process is urgently needed recently a new strategy applying the inhibitory chemicals free nitrous acid fna and free ammonia fa for in situ sludge reduction was proposed and found to effectively reduce sludge by 20 28 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 another new sludge minimizing biological process was developed named the sulfidogenic oxic settling anaerobic sosa process in which a small amount of sulfate 10 mg s lwastewater is added to the cosa process according to the first report by huang et al 2019 sosa can successfully recruit the sulfidogenesis process into the anaerobic ssr as a result achieving 30 higher sludge reduction than that of cosa and maintaining a good mainstream operational performance sosa not only takes advantages of the inhibitory effects of sulfide but also transforms the wastewater treatment bacteria from conventional heterotrophs to slow growth yield bacteria such as sulfate reducing bacteria srb sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob and other facultative bacteria however the mechanisms underpinning in situ sludge reduction in sosa are unclear the mechanisms of sludge reduction for cosa type systems have been extensively investigated one comprehensive study by chon et al 2011 demonstrated that about 50 of sludge reduction took place in the mainstream extended aeration eao reactor due to the long sludge retention time srt of 63 days while the other half was achieved in the anaerobic ssr it should also be noted that the method of eao has been applied for in situ sludge reduction in cas systems sharafi et al 2015 in eao cas the system is purposely operated with a longer srt 20 40 days than of the more typical 5 10 days enabling approximately 30 56 of the was to be aerobically digested mahmood and elliott 2006 hence mainstream eao serves as one of the sludge reduction mechanisms in sosa however the size of its contribution is unknown in the side stream pom is anaerobically hydrolyzed into dom mainly proteins and then the proteins are rapidly degraded in the aerobic conditions when the anaerobic sludge is recycled back to the mainstream novak et al 2007 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis to the cosa process is expected to play important roles in sludge reduction for a number of reasons i the sulfidogenic ssr intensifies the sludge destruction and cell lysis through enhancing the endogenous decay rates nielsen and keiding 1998 ii the additional small molecular sulfate which initiates sulfidogenesis can potentially change the thermodynamic conditions during the anaerobic degradation bioprocesses including solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis zan and hao 2020 iii the sulfide compounds can enter into the bacterial cell membrane resulting in cell inactivation by protein denaturation postgate 1984 speece 1983 and interfering with the metabolic coenzymes by forming sulfide bonds parkin and owen 1986 however it is still unclear to what extent sulfidogenesis contributes to the aforementioned sludge disintegration and degradation and it is still uncertain whether the enhanced sludge reduction in sosa is due to the extremely long srt exceeding 300 days for sludge decay rather than the expected sulfidogenesis intensified effects as the previous study was conducted under this extremely long srt operational conditions huang et al 2019 hence comprehensive and comparative research is needed to unravel the underpinning mechanisms of in situ sludge reduction in the sosa process and confirm the hypothetical roles of sulfate reduction and sulfide chemical in this work three representative systems were operated in parallel including i an eao anoxic aerobic activated sludge system in a sequential batch reactor sbreao and ii and iii a cosa system and a sosa system consisting of identical mainstream anoxic aerobic sbr reactors sbrcosa and sbrsosa and ssrs ssrcosa and ssrsosa to investigate the effects of mainstream eao and side stream sulfidogenesis on the sludge reduction mechanisms the operational performance and sludge reduction of these three systems were routinely monitored over 200 days the key factors of theoretical oxygen demand thod balance i e system electron balance endogenous decay rates and active biomass fractions for in depth analysis were investigated in batch tests for each system moreover the effects of sulfate reduction and various sulfide concentrations on sludge destruction and the anaerobic microbial activities solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis were studied in batch experimental conditions 2 materials and methods three parallel systems eao cosa and sosa which were installed in our previous study huang et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 and inoculated with the activated sludge from a local wwtp shatin wwtp hong kong were continuously operated for over 200 days from day 205 to day 410 the characteristics of the inoculated activated sludge

wastewater each sbr s operating cycle lasted for 4 h which consisted of i a 1 h anoxic phase including feeding 1 25 l of synthetic sewage to the reactor for 8 min and ii a 2 h aerobic phase and iii a phase including settling 0 75 h decanting 8 min and idling 7 min the hydraulic retention time was 0 67 d a 70 mm disc diffuser was installed at the bottom of each sbr to provide air during the aerobic phase to maintain the dissolved oxygen do concentration between 2 and 3 mg o2 l a mechanical mixer provided effective mixing 150 rpm during both anoxic and aerobic phases the synthetic wastewater was prepared according to huang et al 2019 having 260 mg cod l 30 mg nh3 n l and 5 mg po4 3 p l for the ssrs sbrcosa and sbrsosa in the cosa and sosa systems were each connected to an ssr with a working volume of 1 l anaerobic ssr ssrcosa and sulfidogenic ssr ssrsosa a magnetic stirrer 300 rpm was applied to ensure sufficient mixing in each ssr ssrcosa and ssrsosa treated 10 of activated sludge from sbrcosa and sbrsosa every day respectively the feeding pattern was 6 times per day after the same volume of mixed sludge liquor was recycled back to the sbrs from the ssrs at the beginning of the anoxic phase the sulfate concentration in the sludge inflow of ssrsosa was maintained at 300 mg so4 s l by dosing sodium sulfate no intentional sludge wastage was allowed from the three systems during the first 40 d of operation day 205 day 245 as a result the sludge accumulated and the respective sludge accumulation rates were calculated after 40 d the mlss concentrations in the three sbrs were controlled at the same level about 5 g l by allowing sludge wastage from the sbrs based on their respectively calculated sludge accumulation rates it should also be noted that the three systems srts were all purposely constrained to about 40 days reflecting the real world practice of the eao cas process by routine discharge of was at the rates of 329 400 317 358 and 252 273 mgvss d respectively where vss represents volatile suspended solids 2 2 analysis of theoretical oxygen demand thod and sludge decay rate 2 2 1 thod balance analysis based on the system monitoring results the electron balance was evaluated through thod analysis thod is the electron donating capacity in terms of oxygen of compounds that can donate electrons in reference to the assigned values for co2 h2o and no3 ekama et al 2009 thod balance uses both cod and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn concentrations by converting the tkn component to the equivalent cod concentration thod cod 4 57 tkn by tracking the fluxes of cod and tkn through each system the thod introduced into the activated sludge system should be equal to the thod departing from the system as shown in fig 1d henze et al 2008 i e 1 tho d in tho d

including oxygen demand for organic cod removal and nitrification mg o2 d the sub components in eqs 2 and 3 can be calculated according to the equations described in si 2 then the thod balance can be

of three components 1 active biomass which is divided into heterotrophic and autotrophic groups xh and xaut 2 endogenous residue and 3 unbiodegradable inert solids from the influent according to activated sludge modeling henze et al 2000 the endogenous residue is unbiodegradable and incorporated into the inert organic solids xiv and the amount of xaut is considerably lower than the xh in activated sludge systems therefore the autotrophic biomass can be neglected the synthetic wastewater in this study did not include inert solids thus 5 x v f cv mlvss x h x iv the sludge reduction in the activated sludge process is mainly accomplished by decreasing mlvss through x h decay namely 6 d x v dt k d x v 1 f b h x h where x v x h and x iv are the concentrations of mlvss active

inert endogenous residue fraction with a default value of 0 20 henze et al 2000 k d is the decay coefficient of mlvss d 1 the endogenous mass loss of active heterotrophic biomass can be expressed as 7 d x h dt b h x h the value of bh can be determined by measuring the endogenous our ou r en do dt which depends on the endogenous mass loss of xh under the given conditions aerobic or anaerobic without external substrates marais and ekama 1976 then 8 ou r en 1 f b h x h combining eqs 7 and 8 under a given initial condition of t 0 and x h x h i taking the logarithmic transformation gives eq 9 from which eq 10 can be further derived 9 ln ou r en ln 1 f b h x h i b h t 10 ou r en 1 f b h x h i e b h t a e b h t where x h i is the initial heterotrophic biomass concentration in the batch test g cod

ou r en 1 f b h x h i a having determined b h and a from the fitting curve x h i can be solved as a 1 f b h the experimental details for the determination of b h and x h i are described under batch test b 2 3 determination of the kinetic parameters 2 3 1 batch test a determination of oxygen consumption in an activated sludge process the thodoxygen consumption is the mass of oxygen required for the process given as the sum of the oxygen required for the oxidation of organics cod and the oxygen required for nitrification the mass of oxygen reduced by denitrification is subtracted from the quantity of thodnitrification as equivalent oxygen shown in eq s6 therefore thodoxygen consumption can be determined through monitoring the total our ourt in situ of the sbr operation during the aerobic phase 2 h van haandel and van der lubbe 2007 the procedures of these our based experiments are described in si 3 a typical ourt profile at the aerobic phase of sbreao as shown in fig s4 can be divided into two stages stage i includes both oxidation of substrates from wastewater designated as exogenous our ourex and endogenous respiration designated as ouren and stage ii only includes ouren in consequence the thodoxygen consumption can be calculated from the area between the ourt curve and the base ouren line expressed by eq 11 11 tho d oxygen consum t initial t final r o 2 t t dt t

effect of sulfidogenesis on the anaerobic reactions including i sludge solubilization measured as the release of scod ii hydrolysis iii acidification and iv acetogenesis were studied using four model sludge samples compounds as substrates duan et al 2016 the methods are described in detail in si 4 and summarized briefly as follow sludge solubilization 20 ml of thickened was 10 g vss l taken from sbreao was mixed with 40 ml of inoculum sludge 10 g vss l from ssrcosa or ssrsosa in 120 ml serum bottles achieving a was to inoculum ratio of 1 2 based on the vss the sulfate concentration in the ssrsosa series was adjusted to 300 mg s l the same level as in the sosa long term experiments by dosing sodium sulfate the released scod concentrations including carbonaceous and sulfide types were determined daily hydrolysis bsa a model protein and dextran a model polysaccharide were used to prepare synthetic wastewater by dissolving the masses of 0 37 g and 0 08 g respectively into 60 ml ultrapure water and then adding 10 ml of inoculum from the ssrs with a final sludge concentration of about 1500 mg l the sulfate concentration in the bottle of the ssrsosa group was maintained at 300 mg s l by dosing sodium sulfate the concentrations of bsa and dextran were tested daily the effect of sulfidogenesis on the acidification and acetogenesis of the hydrolyzed products was investigated under the same conditions as those during the hydrolysis process except that the substrates were replaced by a mixture of 0 37 g l alanine and 0 08 g glucose and 0 21 g sodium propionate respectively 2 4 2 batch test d effect of sulfide concentration contact batch tests were performed to assess the effects of sulfide concentration on activated sludge solubilization and microbial activities the thickened sludge taken from sbrsosa which had already acclimated to the impact of sulfide was exposed to the designated sulfide concentrations 0 50 100 and 150 mg s l over 24 h then the activities of ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and denitrifiers were determined after sulfide was removed through washing according to wang et al 2013 additionally the effects of the initial sulfide concentration on the rates of anaerobic degradation processes including hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis were investigated the details of the above experiments are described in si 4 2 5 chemical analysis the wastewater characteristics of the influent and effluent of the bioreactors as well as the batch test samples including total suspended solids tss vss cod tn nh3 n no2 n no3 n and so4 2 s were tested routinely or according to the designated batch tests soluble constituents were analyzed after filtration using 0 45 µm membrane filters the carbonaceous scod was analyzed using hach tubes with the exclusion of sulfide interference according to lu et al 2012 no2 n no3 n po4 3 p and so4 2 s were detected using an ion chromatography system dionex aquion ic system thermo fisher tss vss and nh3 n were tested according to the standard method apha 2005 total dissolved sulfide was determined by the methylene blue method apha 2005 proteins and polysaccharides were measured by lowry folin method and phenol sulfuric method respectively lowry et al 1951 dubois et al 1956 the determination of l alanine was according to bergmeyer and horder 1980 do and ph were measured with multimeters wtw multi 3420 the observed sludge yield and srt were determined according to huang et al 2019 3 results and discussions 3 1 system performance 3 1 1 long term operation the variations of pollutant concentrations in the influent and effluent of the three mainstream sbrs are shown in table 1 and fig s1 the results showed that sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa could remove scod effectively with effluent scod concentrations of 18 00 2 67 10 35 3 80 and 8 58 3 47 mg l respectively the effluent scod of the mainstream reactor without an ssr sbreao was higher than those of the mainstream reactors with an ssr sbrcosa and sbrsosa this might be due to the extension of the srt to 46 days increasing the extent of exposure of the activated sludge to aerobic conditions aerobic digestion extending the srt of cas has been found to induce the accumulation of soluble microbial products mainly biomass associated products if the srt is longer than 15 days xie et al 2012 sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa all achieved remarkable ammonia oxidation with average nh3 n concentrations in the effluent of 0 73 0 14 0 68 0 14 and 0 66 0 12 mg l respectively and nitrification efficiencies all higher than 98 notably the cosa and sosa systems effectively achieved ammonia oxidation even despite the decay of active biomass in the ssrs ssrcosa and ssrsosa resulting in the release of scod and ammonia fig s2 implying that the nitrification bioprocess was not impaired when the sludge was recycled between mainstream and side stream reactors this demonstrates that the decay of nitrifying bacteria was not severe under anaerobic conditions moreover the srts of the three sbrs were prolonged enough to maintain a sufficient amount of nitrifiers and ensure effective nitrification which are prerequisites for denitrification li and wu 2014 the denitrification performances of the three systems were good with the influent tn of 35 61 1 8 mg n l the nitrogen removal efficiencies of sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa were all around 74 0 5 the potential effects of exposing nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria to sulfide were also examined via batch experiments the major findings are discussed in section 3 3 the tss concentrations in the effluent were also measured and were found to be stable at 10 33 1 18 11 87 1 66 and 9 63 1 26 mg l in eao cosa and sosa respectively in addition considering the dosage of sulfate in ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentrations in the influent and effluent were analyzed with influent so4 2 s concentrations of 4 52 0 30 mg l eao and cosa showed stable effluent so4 2 s concentrations of 4 57 0 32 and 4 55 0 31 mg l respectively the so4 2 s concentration in the sosa effluent increased to 11 64 0 36 mg l due to the sulfate dosage in ssrsosa 3 1 2 sludge reduction the observed sludge yield coefficients yobs were determined by plotting the cumulative generated sludge g ss against the cumulative consumed substrate g cod and then carrying out linear regression analysis on the obtained curves fig 2 the results showed that the yobs of the eao system with the srt maintained at about 46 d was 0 304 g ss g cod this value was lower than that reported in our previous study for an ao system with a short srt of 10 d 0 473 g ss g cod huang et al 2019 this result indicates the occurrence of sludge reduction in the eao system made possible by the long srt which increased the bacterial energy expenditure for cell maintenance and decay and left less metabolic energy for cell synthesis khursheed and kazmi 2011 this sludge reduction mechanism referred to as mainstream eao has actually been widely applied in full scale activated sludge processes where a dedicated sludge reduction facility is not available but sludge reduction is occasionally required to reduce the disposal of was özdemir et al 2014 compared with eao the yobs of cosa and sosa were lower at 0 270 and 0 216 g ss g cod respectively implying that the sludge production was further reduced by 11 and 29 the greater sludge reduction in the cosa and sosa systems indicated the existence of multiple mechanisms of sludge reduction in addition to the endogenous decay taking place in the eao system the ssr creates anaerobic conditions in osa type systems in which sludge destruction and cell lysis occur and convert pom into dom chon et al 2011 the dom released in the ssr is utilized as a substrate in the mainstream sbrs but only for cryptic growth catabolism and not to synthesize new biomass anabolism as reported in huang et al 2014 in summary the combination of eao occurring in the mainstream and anaerobic reactions occurring in the side stream contributed to the higher sludge reduction in the osa type system two points still need to be further verified i whether the degradation of dom in the mainstream required a greater oxygen demand and if so by how much and ii whether endogenous decay occurred under aerobic anaerobic and sulfidogenic conditions and if so how much they contributed to sludge reduction to answer these questions additional batch experiments were conducted and are described in sections 3 1 3 and 3 2 3 1 3 thod electron balance to verify the accuracy of the measures of reactor performance and sludge reduction electron balance analysis was conducted for all three systems the thod flux was evaluated to determine the mass balance equation based on the measured values of the influent and effluent scod ammonia nitrate and suspended solids concentrations as introduced in the above section as well as the oxygen demand in the three systems determined in the in situ batch tests batch test a the total ours were measured in three consecutive operating cycles in aerobic phases in situ and the obtained our profiles are shown in fig 3 by integrating the area of the exogenous our curves the oxygen demands of the eao cosa and sosa systems were calculated as 1747 40 1877 44 and 2033 62 mg o2 d respectively interestingly the results showed that sosa had both the lowest sludge production and highest oxygen demand the measured results were used for thod balance analysis as shown in table s1 it can be seen that the thod was balanced in all three systems with a low error of 0 6 1 5 which validated the ability of the osa type process to reduce sludge within the cas system but at the cost of higher oxygen demand the thod flux details are further presented in fig 3d to illustrate the sludge reduction mechanism the proportion of thod reserved in the was showed a similar trend to that of the sludge yield decreasing in the order of 21 8 19 9 and 15 4 for eao cosa and sosa respectively in consequence more organic content in the influent was converted to co2 resulting in a higher oxygen demand for organic removal in cosa 1360 65 mg o2 d and sosa 1474 66 mg o2 d than in eao 1243 69 mg o2 d it should be noted that biogenic co2 is not counted as a greenhouse gas emission ipcc 2006 for osa type systems the minimization of excess sludge generation generally involves two major processes 1 enhanced sludge decay and anaerobically driven pom degradation and 2 effective utilization of the secondary substrates in the mainstream reactors for organic oxidation and or denitrification guo et al 2020 foladori et al 2015 biomass growth via the utilization of the secondary substrates released from decayed microorganisms is called cryptic growth mason and hamer 1987 and can reduce the sludge yield consequently cell lysis cryptic growth in osa type systems is considered the main mechanism for sludge reduction guo et al 2020 the additional side stream augmentation in cosa and sosa also induces biomass decay and drives the conversion of carbonaceous organics to co2 in mainstream reactors with cryptic growth the higher degree of decay in the side stream might be the reason for the lower sludge yield and higher oxygen demand in sosa thus the roles of sulfidogenesis in enhancing sludge reduction are worthy of in depth investigation 3 2 effects of sludge decay the sludge reduction in the activated sludge process is attributed to the diminished mass of active biomass in particular through lysis of heterotrophic biomass x h in this study the existence of endogenous decay was revealed by endogenous respiration tests the profiles of endogenous our versus time in batch test b and the fitting results are shown in fig 4 and table 2 from these results the aerobic endogenous decay rates b h oxic in the mainstream reactors were determined as 0 114 0 136 and 0 142 d 1 in sbreao sbrcosa and sbrsosa respectively all of these values fell in the range of the endogenous decay rates of active biomass x h between 0 059 and 0 500 d 1 as reported in friedrich and takács 2013 confirming the plausibility of the measured results notably the mainstream endogenous decay rates were increased in the cosa and sosa systems corresponding to the greater sludge reduction by 11 29 regarding the anaerobic endogenous sludge decay rates in the ssrs the b h an values of ssrcosa and ssrsosa were measured as 0 045 and 0 097 d 1 respectively the values measured in this study fell in the range of 0 033 0 1 d 1 as reported in previous research manser et al 2006 siegrist et al 1999 the decay rates in the ssrs were lower than that in their respective mainstream sbrs this is not surprising as habermacher et al 2015 confirmed that the specific sludge degradation rates in ssr with aerobic conditions were 2 7 4 1 times higher than those in anoxic and anaerobic conditions however the aerobic ssr is not recommended due to it is energy intensive process and might negatively affect the effluent quality chon et al 2011 although the b h an of ssrcosa was relatively low the total amount of sludge in the ssr was as high as 6 60 8 00 g vss l meaning that a remarkably high level of sludge reduction in the side stream had still been achieved 11 sludge reduction moreover the b h an of ssrsosa was almost double that of ssrcosa meaning a 20 greater sludge reduction in sosa than in cosa the active biomass x h and the fraction of x h expressed as fav x h x v were evaluated and are summarized in table 2 the x h content in sbreao was 31 27 and further reduced to 25 99 and 25 11 in sbrcosa and sbrsosa respectively the f av value was slightly decreased to 25 73 in ssrcosa and further decreased to 22 46 in ssrsosa the theoretical true yield should be 0 930 g vssproduced d for all three systems but due to the effect of endogenous sludge decay the actual sludge production rate was reduced under all three schemes the contributions of endogenous sludge decay in the different reactors were further estimated and are shown in fig 4c the sludge reduction attributed to endogenous respiration in sbreao was 0 570 g vssreduced d however greater extents of endogenous sludge decay occurred in cosa 0 620 g vssreduced d and sosa 0 675 g vssreduced d including endogenous removal of sludge mass in both the mainstream reactors and ssrs the endogenous decay rates in sbrcosa and sbrsosa were comparable at about 0 550 0 552 g vssreduced d the additional endogenous sludge decay in cosa and sosa was contributed by the augmentation of ssrcosa 0 068 g vssreduced d and ssrsosa 0 125 g vssreduced d considering the overall impacts the net sludge yields of cosa 0 310 g vssproduced d and sosa 0 255 g vssproduced d were reduced by 13 8 and 29 3 compared with eao 0 360 g vssproduced d in summary the combined effects of extended aerobic digestion and strengthened side stream decay by sulfidogenesis enhanced the sludge reduction compared with eao and cosa systems and the accumulation of inert solids in the system furthermore the hydrolysis of pom and the cell lysis in anaerobic sulfidogenic conditions induce the release of dom which can serve as the secondary substrate for bacterial metabolism in mainstream sbrs chen et al 2003 the performances of ssrcosa and ssrsosa are illustrated in table 3 and fig s2 low influent scod concentrations were observed in both ssrs 20 mg l the carbonaceous scod concentration of ssrsosa was 52 13 5 56 mg l while that of ssrcosa had a lower value of 32 85 6 18 mg l showing that the sulfidogenic conditions in ssrsosa enhanced the release of dom hence in sosa more catabolic cod oxidation occurred than anabolic cell growth 3 3 effects of sulfidogenesis the so4 2 s and total dissolved sulfide concentrations were evaluated in the ssrs table 3 and fig s2c d in ssrcosa the so4 2 s concentration in the influent was 4 55 0 31 mg l and dropped to 0 50 0 24 mg l in the effluent however none of sulfide in ssrcosa was detectable in ssrsosa the so4 2 s concentrations in the influent and effluent were 295 5 9 0 and 230 8 17 2 mg l respectively generating 77 8 4 2 mg s l of dissolved sulfide the superior performance of sulfate reduction in ssrsosa is due to a higher degree of sludge destruction the potential effects of sulfidogenesis and sulfide compounds on anaerobic bioprocesses and sludge solubilization as well as the activities of the functional bacteria in mainstream were further investigated and are discussed in sections 3 3 1 and 3 3 2 3 3 1 acceleration of anaerobic bioprocesses the successful establishment of anaerobic conditions in the ssr is important for osa type processes in which anaerobic microorganisms enrich and utilize the was as a substrate chen et al 2003 ferrentino et al 2016 anaerobic fermentation involves four steps solubilization hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis chen et al 2007 luo et al 2015 solubilization and hydrolysis are considered as the rate limiting steps zhao et al 2015 at the solubilization stage the pom in was mainly including proteins and polysaccharides needs to be converted into soluble forms for further utilization by hydrolytic bacteria acidogens and acetogens in batch test c the anaerobic reactions in ssrs and the potential effects of sulfidogenesis on the aforementioned four steps that occur during fermentation were investigated as shown in fig 5 a the sludge solubilization process in terms of scod concentrations comprising carbonaceous and sulfide scod under the sulfidogenic conditions in ssrsosa 826 0 42 4 mg cod l increased much faster than under the anaerobic conditions in ssrcosa 310 5 36 1 mg cod l in the first five days furthermore the effects of sulfidogenesis on the hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis processes were studied with three synthetic wastewaters containing model compounds i e bsa and dextran for hydrolysis l alanine and glucose for acidification and propionic acid for acetogenesis the model compounds degradation profiles are plotted in fig s7a c and their degradation rates are summarized in fig 5b d the hydrolytic degradation rates of bsa and dextran by ssrcosa were 560 70 36 51 mg cod g vss d and 92 75 9 77 mg cod g vss d respectively the corresponding rates slightly increased to 593 29 18 03 mg cod g vss d and 113 12 16 02 mg cod g vss d in ssrsosa respectively these results demonstrated that the acidification and acetogenesis processes were markedly stimulated by sulfidogenesis as the respective rates increased by 18 34 l alanine 37 68 glucose and 18 29 propionate such bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis has been previously reported to accelerate the hydrolysis of biodegradable substrates in anaerobic digestion by 41 to 82 zan and hao 2020 it is believed that srb which can degrade various organics through thermodynamically favorable processes can cooperate with anaerobic bacteria by reducing the energy barrier to the formation of intermediates li et al 2015 which leads to a robust anaerobic microbial community and thus enhance the degradation rates involved in anaerobic digestion 3 3 2 effects of the exposure of sulfide the sulfide generated by srb can trigger sludge disintegration and cell lysis nielsen and keiding 1998 thus the potential effects of sulfide concentration on sludge solubilization microbial activities and anaerobic bioprocesses needed further investigation as shown in fig 6 a bringing was into contact with sulfide caused the release of dom the rate of which was positively related to the sulfide concentration with the highest value of 201 15 7 07 mg cod g vss occurring at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l this might be attributed to the degradation of fe bonded extracellular polymeric substances eps and cell lysis caused by sulfide park et al 2006 nielsen and keiding 1998 sulfide can enter into the cell membrane inactivating bacteria by denaturing the bacterial proteins postgate 1984 speece 1983 and inhibit the metabolic coenzymes by forming sulfide bonds parkin and owen 1986 therefore the toxicity of the sulfide produced in sosa to mainstream microorganisms and anaerobic bioprocesses should be examined the effects of sulfide on the activities of mainstream microorganisms were tested in batch test d as shown in fig 6b and c the activities decreased continually as the sulfide concentration increased suggesting that the aob nob and denitrifiers all experienced the inhibitory effects of sulfide the activities of the aob nob and denitrifiers decreased from 6 55 0 35 and 5 96 0 56 and 97 21 4 71 mg n g vss h to 4 54 0 50 and 3 09 0 25 and 67 51 5 14 mg n g vss h at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l respectively in other words sulfide had an inhibitory effect on the aob nob and denitrifiers reducing their activities by 30 48 and 31 respectively in spite of this inhibition the nitrification and denitrification efficiencies in sosa were found to be comparable to those of eao and cosa only 10 of biomass from the mainstream of sbrsosa was treated in ssrsosa daily while the remaining biomass in sbrsosa remained active and recovered its activity after the sulfide was depleted during the anoxic phase of sbrsosa via denitrification the effects of sulfide concentration on the anaerobic reaction rates including those of hydrolysis acidification and acetogenesis were also studied shown in fig 6d f the degradation rates of bsa and dextran were slightly increased by 7 8 at a sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l but were stable at 589 25 606 75 mg cod g vss d of bsa and 113 12 118 63 mg cod g vss d of dextran at initial sulfide concentrations from 0 to 100 mg s l the results showed that sulfide promoted hydrolysis but did not adversely affect the activities of hydrolysis microorganisms it might because that in the first stage of anaerobic digestion hydrolysis comprises of a large number of individual reactions which are carried out by facultative anaerobic microorganisms and various enzymes in this stage the polymeric organics are hydrolysed to their respective monomers lower molecular weight products which is catalyzed by extracellular enzymes jain et al 1992 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis in anaerobic system was found to improve the sludge degradation extent by 20 and enhance the hydrolysis rate by 41 to 82 whittington jones et al 2002 zan and hao 2020 the enhancement of hydrolytic enzyme activity by sulfide and the cooperation between hydrolytic and sulfate reducing microorganisms were considered as the key mechanisms watson et al 2004 chauke 2002 although sulfide is toxic to various bacteria groups in anaerobic digestion the hydrolytic fermentative microorganisms were less affected by sulfide toxicity than the other anaerobic bacteria chen et al 2008 appels et al 2008 the reaction rates of acidification were unaffected by the initial sulfide concentrations indicating that the acidogens in ssrsosa were resistant to the sulfidogenic conditions even at the sulfide concentration of 150 mg s l however the acetogens were more sensitive to the initial sulfide concentrations the activities of acetogens decreased by 6 and 13 at initial sulfide concentrations of 100 and 150 mg s l respectively in general the sulfide compounds produced by sulfate reduction had profound effects on sludge destruction and solubilization however their adverse effects on anaerobic microorganisms should also be borne in mind especially the effects on acetogens 4 conclusion three lab scale experimental systems were operated in parallel to investigate the mechanism of sludge reduction in the sosa process the specific conclusions drawn from this study are as follows i the sosa process obtained a low yobs of 0 216 g ss g cod with efficient pollutant removal achieving 97 98 and 74 removal of scod nh3 n and tn respectively ii the sludge reduction achieved by sosa was 28 9 and 20 0 greater than those of eao and cosa resulting in its having the highest oxygen demand during mainstream operation iii the endogenous decay under sulfidogenic conditions was faster with a constant of 0 097 d 1 than that in anaerobic conditions 0 045 d 1 the bioaugmentation of sulfidogenesis in ssrsosa contributed to its greater sludge removal than that in ssrcosa the enhanced active biomass decay rates in cosa and sosa led to lower x h fractions iv sulfidogenic conditions enhanced the solubilization hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis processes the sulfide production in ssrsosa played an important role in sludge destruction and decreased the activities of functional bacteria but had no adverse effects on the system performance therefore the eao process in the mainstream and sludge destruction in the sulfidogenic side stream were identified to have combined effects on sludge reduction in sosa

17344,the slow electron transfer rate is the bottleneck to the biological wastewater treatment process and the nanoparticles nps has been verified as a feasible strategy to improve the biological degradation efficiency by accelerating the electron transfer here we employed the gram positive bacillus megaterium y 4 capable of synthetizing pd 0 to investigate the intra extracellular electron transfer iet eet mechanisms mediated by nps in aerobic denitrification for the first time kinetic and thermodynamic results showed that the bio pd 0 could significantly promote the removal of both nitrate and nitrite by improving affinity and decreasing activation energy the enzymic activity and the respiration chain inhibition experiment indicated that the bio pd 0 could facilitate the nitrate biotic reduction by improving the fe s center activity and serving as parallel h carriers to replace coenzyme q to selectively increase the electron flux toward nitrate in iet while promoting the nitrite reduction by abiotic catalysis most importantly the detection of dpv peak at 226 287 mv proved that the one electron eet via multiheme cytochrome bound flavins also occurred in gram positive bacteria and enhanced in pd loaded cells in addition the remarkable increase of the formal charge in eps indicated that the bio pd 0 could act as an electron shuttle to increase the redox site in eps eventually accelerating the electron hopping in long distance electron transfer overall this study expanded our understanding of the roles of bio pd 0 on the aerobic denitrification process and provided an insight into the iet eet of gram positive strains graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords intracellular electron transfer iet extracellular electron transfer eet bio pd 0 aerobic denitrifiaction promotion mechanism 1 introduction the nitrogen cycle was overstepped due to the excessive application of fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock domestic and industrial sources rockström 2009 aerobic denitrification could directly convert nitrate to n2 under aerobic condition via periplasmic nitrate reductase nap which could be expressed in presence of o2 since aerobic denitrification bacteria could simultaneously utilize both nitrate and o2 as terminal electron acceptors for co respiration their denitrification efficiencies would greatly depend on electron transfer efficiency and selectivity to nitrate yang et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that the introduction of metal nanoparticles nps could enhance the microbial metabolism process via accelerating the microbial electron transfer such as pd 0 cu pd fes ni pd fe2o3 and so on zhang et al 2018 moreover these metal nps could be biosynthized by many bacteria with less energy comsumption and under mild conditions such as bacillus megaterium y 4 chen et al 2019 bacillus wiedmannii msm chen et al 2018 pseudomonas putida niu et al 2018 etc meanwhile the biogenic metal nps had superior biocompatibility and dispersibility and have been widely used in biotechnological and environmental processes via accelerating the microbial electron transfer however most of the researches focused on the effect on the extracellular electorn transfer eet pathways including mediated electron transfer met via redox active electron shuttles and direct electron transfer det by conductive pili or c type cytochromes in the outer membrane om c cyts such as mtr and pcc coursolle et al 2010 kondo et al 2015 in 2011 wu et al first proposed that the bio pd 0 could participate in the eet of d desulfuricans with membrane bound cytochrome c3 as an electron conduit and speculated that nps might participate in microbial metabolism as biologically derived electron carriers wu et al 2011 wu et al 2013 demonstrated that bio aunps with lower loading dosage could repair the damage to the electron transfer chain in the mutant δomca mtrc to a certain extent deng et al 2020 found that fes nps could be biosynthesized intrac extracellularly or on the cell surface and function as an efficient eet conduit in srb d vulgari while you et al 2019 confirmed that the biosynthesis process of palladium nanorods could induce riboflavin synthase and further mediate the eet of enterobacter cloacae sgz 5t our previous experiment also demonstrated that pd nps bio synthesized by citrobacter freundii could trigger the secreting riboflavin and c cyts facilitating the met niu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 all these eet pathways mentioned above were conducted under anaerobic or anoxic conditons and followed a two electron reaction by means of individual redox active compounds quinone c cyts and flavins okamoto et al 2013 2014 found that om c cyts could combine with flavins to form cytochrome bound semiquinone to establish an one electron reaction pathway of which the electorn transfer rate was 103 105 folds rapider than that of two electron reaction via free flavins or c cyts alone moreover these researches were obtained based on the gram negative bacteria such as shewanella spp and geobacter sp as for the eet mechanism of gram positive bacteria wrighton et al 2011 found that gram positive t potens strain jr failed to secrete release soluble redox active components and could only transfer electron to mfc anodes by det in which c cyts played an important role subsequently carlson et al 2012 proved that the cell wall associated cytochromes and multiheme c type cytochromes mhcs involved in the transmembrane electron trasnfer of gram positive bacteria wu et al 2014 and you et al 2018 demonstrated that only free flavins were responsible to mediate the eet process of the gram positive b megaterium strain lld 1 and bacillus sp ws xy1 and the secreted free flavins could act as redox mediators to deliver electrons from cellular metabolic systems to extracellular insoluble substrates via a two electron transfer mechanism moreover xiao et al 2017 revealed eps extracellular polymeric substance could store concentrated flavins and c cyts which would enable eps enveloped cells to transport electrons to extracellular acceptors via long distance electron hopping till now the mechanism of eet of gram positive bacteria remains undetermined and the reports on the roles of nps in the intact electron transfer process of gram positive bacteria including intercellular electron transfer iet and eet were absent in comparison with other high conductivity metals nps such as fe s and carbon dots palladium nanoparticles pd 0 nps possess high catalytic capability better stability superior selectivity as well as distinctive quantum feature owing to their tunable shape and size higher h2 adsorption capacity higher oxidation potential and specific electron configurations 4d10 based on these pd nps have been effectively used for the catalytic degradation transformation of contaminants such as heavy metals azo dyes pesticides and organic halides in groundwater wastewater and sediments moreover due to the scarcity in the natural resources and the increasing market demand for noble metal the green recovery of pd from wastewater via in situ biosynthesis was considered as a promising strategy with a high economic value by comparison although many biogenic metal nps had strong conductivity for et applications bio pd 0 synthesized in situ could simultaneously accomplish the green recovery of noble metal and catalyzing to degrade co existence pollutants which was of greater environmental and economic significance some studies demonstrated that monometallic pd 0 nps were incapable of catalyzing no3 reduction to no2 but could catalyze the subsequent reduction of nitrite to nitrogen or ammonium and its catalytic selectivity depended on many factors chaplin et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 found that microbial denitrification coupled with pd 0 significantly improved the denitrification rate and selectively reduced nitrate towards n2 instead of nh4 n moreover they proposed that oxygen intrusion could further improve this selectivity to n2 nearly 100 without negative effect on nitrate chem reduction but led to the decline of overall nitrate reduction rate due to the partial loss of biological denitrification by disturbing anoxic denitrifying bacteria based on this concept coupling aerobic denitrification with pd nps should be an efficient and eco friendly strategy for nitrate removal in our previous study gram positive bacillus megaterium y 4 isolated from the sludge of electronic waste plant has been proved to be able to transform pb2 to pd 0 nps inter extracellularly and on the surface of cells chen et al 2019 moreover in the preliminary experiment we also found that the bacillus megaterium y 4 was capable of aerobic denitrification thus in this work bacillus megaterium y 4 was employed to investigate the effect of pd 0 nps on the aerobic denitrification process as well as the role of biogenic pd 0 bio pd 0 in the eet iet mechanisms by combining kinetic analysis thermodynamically calculation electrochemical analysis and molecular biology these observations may provide a deep understanding of the microbial electron transport mechanisms involved in a pd 0 mediated nitrogen removal system which is important in environmental and bioenergy fields 2 meterials and methods 2 1

trace element solution was the same as that in our previous report jia et al 2020 the reduction solution of pd ii included 5 mmol l 1 of sodium formate specific sodium tetrachloropalladate and 50 mmol l 1 of pbs buffer solution all chemicals were analytical reagent grade and purchased from guangzhou chemical reagent factory 2 2 bacteria acclimation and growth prior to cultivation b megaterium y 4 was acclimated to remove nitrate under aerobic condition for more than one month the acclimation process was as follows the culture preserved in the refrigerator was inoculated in a flask with 150 ml lb medium and cultivated in an incubator shaker 150 rpm 30 c after 12 h cultivation 10 ml bacteria solution was transferred to another flask with 100 ml dm medium containing 20 mg l 1 no3 n the sample was taken every 12 h when the no3 n was removed completely 10 ml bacteria solution was transferred to a new denitrification medium containing higher no3 n this procedure was repeated five times until the no3 n concentration reached 100 mg l 1 after the acclimation for 10 days b megaterium y 4 was able to remove 100 mg l 1 no3 n within 12 h finally the bacteria in mid exponential growth phase were collected and re suspended in 50 mm sterile pbs and stored in fridge for following experiments 2 3 bio reduction of pd ii the definite cell resuspension solution was inoculated in a shake flask with

resuspended in 50 mmol l 1 sterile pbs 1 0 0 05 109 cfu ml then 1 ml suspension was individually added into three shake flasks with 100 ml pd ii reduction solution these reduction systems were deoxygenated with high purity n2 for 20 min to maintain the anaerobic condition then sealed with sterile sealing membrane and incubated in the shaker 125 rpm 30 c after 2 h all sediments in each shaker were collected by centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 15 min and then washed two times thoroughly with 50 mmol l 1 pbs and the cells in the flasks with initial pd ii of 0 2 and 5 mg l 1 were named as c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively all collected cells were used for the further nitrogen removal test 2 4 nitrogen removal performance nitrogen removal performances were initiated with the addition of cultures c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 in 100 ml dm medium and performed in a shaking incubator with the dissolve oxygen concentration 4 2 mg l 1 125 rpm 30 c the initial concentration of the bacteria was 1 0 0 05 107 cfu ml samples were withdrawn regularly to measure the concentrations of no3 no2 and bio n kinetic experiment fig s2 was performed with various concentrations 0 20 50 70 100 150 mg l of

mmol l 1 cucl2 to explore the impact mechanism of bio pd 0 on the electron transfer in respiratory chain the stock solutions of rotenone capsaicin and bal were prepared with ethanol as the solvent naoh solution 0 5 mmol l 1 was used to prepare the dicumarol stock solution 2 5 thermodynamic analysis in order to further explore the effect of bio pd 0 on the biological nitrogen metabolism the apparent rate constant kobs of nitrate removal with strain b pd 1 and b pd 2 were determined at four different temperatures 296 301 306 and 311 k in fig s3 the activity energy was calculated according

rate of gibbs energy by catabolism 2 6 electrochemical measurement differential pulse voltammetry dpv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed to characterize the electrochemical properties of the cells using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua inc shanghai china with the glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode the platinum wire as counter electrode and the standard calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode the dpv test conditions were as follows scan range of potential 0 8 0 v vs sce amplitude 60 mv pulse width 0 2 s potential increment 6 mv eis was carried out with an amplitude of 5 mv and a frequency from 100 khz to 0 1 hz 2 7 analysis methods hach spectrophotometer dr 5000 was used for the determination of spectrophotometry the ammonium nitrate nitrite and tn concentrations were measured according to the standard methods apha 2012 the sample was first centrifuged under 5000 rpm for 5 min and then filtered by fiberglass 0 22 µm to exclude the influence of cells the measurement microbial biomass nitrogen bio n was shown in supporting materials the pd ii concentration was analyzed by aas perkinelmer pinaacle 900t the activities of nap nir nitrate reductase and ets electron transfer system were detected according to our previous method jia et al 2020 the eps was extracted from cells by heat treatment method wang et al 2020 the bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 6000 rpm for 10 min then washed twice and resuspended in 0 9 nacl w v solution next the washed cell pellets were heated in a water bath at 38 c for 30 min and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation 4 c 6000 rpm 10 min and used for electrochemical measurements as for the qpcr analysis the details for dna extraction were given in our previous publication jia et al 2019 functional genes napa nirk s nosz ccca nifs and luxs were quantified by real time quantitative pcr abi 7500 information of the primers for the genes were listed in supplementary materials table s1 the bio pd 0 was confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance with cukα x ray radiation λ 0 154056 nm at 40 kv and 40 ma the patterns were recorded from 30 to 90 with a step size of 0 02 and compared with jcpds database all data in this experiment were analyzed by one way anova test p 0 05 using spss statistics 17 0 software and figures were made by origin pro 2017 software each experiment had three repetitions and the results are presented as means sd standard deviation of means 3 result 3 1 synthesis and characterization of bio pd 0 the changes of pd ii concentrations over time with sodium formate as carbon source were shown in fig 1 a the concentrations of pd ii declined sharply in the first 15 min due to the biosorption then became slower thereafter meanwhile the color of solution also changed from pale yellow to black when anaerobically cultured in 2 and 5 mg l 1 pd ii solutions for 2 h the removal efficiencies of pd ii reached 67 and 75 respectively correspondingly the native cell and cell loaded with pd cultured in 2 and 5 mg l 1 pd ii were defined as c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively in the control experiment without cells approximately 10 decrease of pd ii concentration was observed due to the abiotic reduction of pd ii with sodium formate xrd was employed to further verify the biosynthesis of pd 0 in b pd as shown in the xrd pattern of the b pd samples four major diffraction peaks appear at 40 0 46 7 68 1 and 81 7 corresponding to the 111 200 220 and 311 planes of pd 0 with the face centered cubic structure jcpds 46 1043 indicated that the biogenic pd 0 nps bio pd 0 was successfully synthetized by b megaterium y 4 meanwhile according to our previous report chen et al 2019 synthetized bio pd 0 by b megaterium y 4 distributed both intercellularly and extracellularly 3 2 denitrification promoting by bio pd 0 the time course of various nitrogen species for native cells c b and pd loaded cells b pd 1 and b pd 2 were shown in fig 2 consistently with our previous report that nanoparticles could delay the exponential phase of cell growth lv et al 2017 the lag phase of b megaterium was prolonged from 3 h to 8 h and 10 h for b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively whereas the introduction of bio pd could significantly improve bacterial growth rate i e the accumulation rate of bio n and the removals of nitrate and nitrite fig 2a c moreover during the whole denitrification process the ammonium was not detected confirming nearly 100 of selectivity toward n2 for native cell the relatively larger value of q max ks and ki in nitrate system indicated that the nitrate had higher affinity and lower suppression to strains i e nitrate denitrification was more favorable than nitrite denitrification compared with native cell the specific activity of nitrate denitrification q ma x no3 increased from 378 to 5453 and 3571 mg n mg 1 cdw h 1 for b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively likewise qmax no2 increased from 14 16 to 502 and 1060 mg mg 1 cdw h 1 noticeably with the introduction of bio pd 0 more remarkable increment of qmax occurred in the nitrite system leading to a significant decline of nitrite accumulation suggesting that bio pd 0 could selectively catalyze the nitrite denitrification as shown in table 1 although the values of ks in all pd 0 loaded systems were higher than those in control regardless of nitrogen substrates the larger values of qmax ks were also observed in pd 0 loaded systems due to larger improvement of qmax moreover the qmax ks of b pd 1 0 0181 was higher than that of b pd 2 0 0138 in nitrate systems which was contrary to the result in nitrite systems that the value of qmax ks increased with the increase of bio pd 0 in addition the values of ki 0 77 mg l 1 in nitrite system were much lower than those in nitrate system and all values of ki in both systems decreased significantly in the presence of bio pd 0 3 3 thermodynamic analysis of denitrification via nitrate and nitrite thermodynamic analysis could provide more information regarding microbial metabolism processes thus δg during the denitrification process was calculated based on the dissipative theory and shown in fig 3 as indicated in fig 3 the negative δg was observed in all systems indicating that the denitrification reactions via nitrate or nitrite were spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable under all test conditions moreover the values of δg for the reductions of nitrite and nitrate were the most negative in b pd 2 58 96 and 96 12 kj mol 1 followed by b pd 1 55 44 and 77 68 kj mol 1 and c b 51 93 and 50 18 kj mol 1 the decreased δg in pd loaded systems together with the larger decrements of δg at high level loading of bio pd in b pd 2 indicated that the augment of pd 0 was thermodynamically beneficial to nitrate and nitrite denitrification fig 4 d liu et al 2020 investigated the effects of redox materials on microbial energy supply distribution and utilization and found that some redox materials with relatively low redox potentials could also alter the gibbs free energy of catabolism reactions the activation energy in the denitrification process was also calculated and the result showed that ea no3 and ea no2 decreased by about 20 7 21 89 from 67 42 to 53 44 and 52 66 kj mol 1 and 37 46 39 80 from 76 75 to 46 20 and 48 10 kj mol 1 with the exposure of bio pd 0 respectively 3 4 ets activity denitrifying enzyme activity and gene abundance functional stability of microbial denitrification mainly depends on the effective electron generation transport and electron consumption wan et al 2019 the nanomaterials of metals with appropriate scale might impact the electron transfer rate during aerobic denitrification process eventually these electrons are consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes encoded as the gene napa nirs k norb and nosz as expected ets activities of b pd 1 and b pd 2 increased from 0 527 0 08 to 0 701 0 12 and 1 352 0 005 g o2 mg 1 min 1 respectively fig 4a our previous study also proved that the incorporation of bio nano pd 0 inside p putida could enhance both the ttc ets and int ets rates of the bacteria niu et al 2018 as for the aerobic denitrification enzymes the encoding gene of nap was successfully amplified fig 4c confirming that b megaterium y 4 has the ability of aerobic denitrification by co respiring nitrate and o2 peculiarly the bio pd 0 could notably improve the nap activity which increased significantly from 0 187 0 074 no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein to 0 782 0 097 and 0 473 0 056 mg no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein for b pd 1 and b pd 2 3 2 fold and 1 7 fold higher than that of native cells respectively while the activities of nir had no significant difference with the introduction of pd 0 and kept at a lower level 0 076 0 091 mg no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein different from the increased activity of nap no significant variation was found in the expression abundances of napa nirs and nosz fig 4c indicating that the responses of denitrifying enzyme activities to bio pd 0 did not match with the corresponding gene abundances these results demonstrated that the improvement of nitrate denitrification might be directly governed by the functional enzymic activity at protein level rather than gene abundance gene level the similar result was also obtained by chen and vymazal 2015 that the n2o released matched with the nos activity rather than the nosz abundance in denitrification process as the regulation of enzymic activity could occur at the transcription post transcription translation and protein levels su et al 2019 the indiscriminate expression of genes in mitochondrial rna indicated that the motivation of bio pd 0 on the nitrate denitrification occurred at post transcription by promoting translation and enhancing the stabilization of protein consistent with the increasing ets activity the significant up regulations of gene ccca and nifs were observed it was reported that the ccca gene product cytochrome c2 played a critical role in diverting electrons from aerobic respiration to denitrification hopper et al 2013 while nifs was responsible for the formation of fe s clusters anwar et al 2014 thus we deduced that the bio pd 0 might promote the formation of fe s clusters and cytochrome c2 accelerating the electron transfer in aerobic denitrification in addition the abundance of gene luxs responsible for regulating quorum sensing remarkably down regulated indicating that the quorum sensing molecular was relevant to the boosted denitrification by bio pd 0 maddela et al 2019 reported that the exogenous addition of ahls acylated homoserine lactones could result in increasing phenol degradation and decreasing denitrification in pseudomonas aeruginosa moreover it was reported the metal based nps could affect the biosynthesis of qs molecule signal perception and signal response gómez gómez et al 2019 3 5 intracellular electron transfer generally the intracellular electron transport system is composed of complex i quinone pool complex iii and cytochrome c further experiments were conducted with capsaicin rotenone dicumarol bal nan3 and cucl2 as the inhibitors of nadh dehydrogenase complex i coenzyme q coq complex iii bc1 complex complex iv and fe s center respectively to test the role of bio pd in the respiratory chain as shown in fig 5 the nitrate removal rate of native cells sharply declined from 0 09274 to 0 03612 0 03063 0 06634 and 0 04577 h 1 with the additions of capsaicin rotenone dicumarol and cucl2 accordingly the inhibition ratios reached 60 92 66 97 28 46 and 50 64 respectively however when supplemented with bio pd the inhibition by rotenone and cucl2 was alleviated and the inhibition ratio reduced by 28 20 and 33 40 respectively interestingly it was found that the presence of bio pd 0 not only eliminated the inhibition of dicumarol but even promoted the nitrate removal resulting in a higher nitrate removal rate 0 1002 h 1 than that of native cells regarding to the systems supplemented by capsaicin bal and nan3 no obvious difference of nitrate removal was observed when cells loaded with pd 0 similar result was reported by liu et al 2017 that complex i and coenzyme q involved in the electron transfer in the process of fe iii reduction by g sulfurreducens 3 6 extracellular electron transfer eis results were shown in fig 6 and significant differences of native and pd loaded cells were observed the solution resistances rs and the anode charge transfer resistance rct decreased significantly with the increase of bio pd 0 compared with the native cells the rs of b pd 1 and b pd 2 decreased from 358 to 76 and 55 ω reducing by 78 77 and 84 63 respectively similarly the corresponding rct decreased from 6170 to 1856 and 1387 ω reducing by 69 92 and 77 52 respectively these results demonstrated that the intercalation of bio pd 0 significantly increased the cell conductivity and these supported pd 0 nps might construct an another electric conductive pathway to the external electron acceptor which could markedly overcome the poor conductivity of proteins in microorganisms to promote the electron transfer hou et al 2016 found that pd 0 nps synthesized by biofilm could self assembly wrap each bacteria cell and finally form a conductive three dimensional porous network resulting in a remarkably decreased resistance and an over 5 fold increase of current dpv with high sensitivity was used to investigate the eet process by bio pd 0 as shown in fig 7 besides the nitrate reduction peak at ep 748 mv consistent with the sole reduction peak of dm without cells in fig s5 three pairs dpv peaks at 192 216 mv 444 464 mv and 544 556 mv anodic cathodic were observed for native cells which were attributed to the cytochrome c c cyts free riboflavin rf and flavin mononucleotide fmn respectively xiao et al 2017 unexpectedly an oxidative peak appeared at 287 mv fig 7b and the insets which is related with the binding of flavins and c cyts on the outer membrane om c cyts regulated eletron exchange between the eet and intracellular metabolic activity okamoto et al 2013 to our best knowledge this was the first report to discover the cytochrome bound flavins participated in eet process of gram positive bacteria the point of concern was that compared with the native cells the oxidation peak current of cytochrome bound flavin increased from 1 139 μa to 1 175 and 2 930 μa in b pd 1 and b pd 2 with the positive shift of peak potential from 287 mv to 284 and 226 mv respectively indicating the promotion of bio pd 0 on the eet pathway via cytochrome bound flavin concomitantly the negative shift and increased current of nitrate reduction peak were also observed in pd loaded cells moreover with the exposure of bio pd 0 the redox couple peaks attributed to the om c cyts shifted from 192 216 mv anodic cathodic to 181 188 mv for b pd 1 and 181 144 mv for b pd 2 and their corresponding peak current increased from 1 132 1 323 μa anodic cathodic to 1 181 2 642 and 2 912 3 238 μa respectively meanwhile the free rf couple peaks shifted towards negative direction to ep 484 496 and 496 504 mv for b pd 1and b pd 2 and their peak currents increased from 1 102 1 345 μa anodic cathodic to 1 173 2 858 b pd 1 and 2 372 3 900 μa b pd 2 respectively analogously the existence of bio pd 0 made fmn redox couple at 544 556 mv shift to ep 588 496 mv the corresponding peak currents increasing from 1 369 1 091 μa anodic cathodic to 3 152 1 137 and 4 827 2 593 μa more importantly the potential discrepancy δep between anodic and cathodic peak of three redox couples remarkably decreased with the increase of bio pd 0 as listed in table s2 these results indicated that bio pd 0 could stimulate to secrete c cyts and flavin and enhance the reversibility of redox reaction to cause a rapid conversion between oxidation and reduction state eps has been proved to possess the excellent redox capability due to the abundant redox compounds hence eps was also extracted and measured with dpv in this work and the formal charge qformal values were calculated according to the following equation the results were shown in fig 8 and table 2 q f o r m a l π v k 0 δ e q d p v where dpv peak charge qdpv is obtained by the peak area δe is dpv potential pulse increment increments 0 006 v k0 s 1 is the standard electrochemical et rate constant 0 026 s 1 obtained by laviron s method and v is the scan rate as shown in fig 8 c cyt and flavins as revealed by two pairs of peaks ep 198 236 mv and 592 602 mv were detected in eps of native cells when loaded with pd 0 they shifted to ep 164 216 mv and 590 596 mv for b pd 1 and ep 194 198 mv and 584 602 mv for b pd 2 respectively especially the peak currents anodic cathodic increased significantly from 0 538 0 596 to 0 668 0 724µa and 0 959 1 074 µa for c cyts and from 0 645 0 530µa to 0 844 0 845µa and 0 914 0 953 µa for flavin respectively correspondingly the qdpv of eps obtained by the peak area increased from 2 9 4 9 10 8 for native cells to the 4 7 8 0 10 8 c for b pd 1 and 0 8 1 3 10 7 c for b pd 2 and the formal charge qformal values increased from 0 588 0 97 10 5 c to 0 94 1 6 10 5 and 0 16 0 26 10 4 c 4 discussion it is highly desirable to improve denitrification from wastewater via accelerating microbial electron transport process by means of the in site synthsized bio pd 0 nps based on the kinetic and thermodynamic results the feasibility of applying in site synthsized bio pd 0 nps by b megaterium y 4 to promote the removal of both nitrate and nitrite was demonstrated in addition the insights into the role of pd 0 in accelerating intercellular extracellular electron transfer were also proposed as follows 4 1 iet acceleration mediated by bio pd 0 aerobic denitrification bacteria could co respire with both nitrate and o2 as terminal electron acceptors of which both electron transfer chains depend on the same core component including the nadh dehydrogenase complex i the quinone pool the bc1 complex complex iii and c cyts chen and strous 2013 briefly the electrons were generated by nadh dehydrogenase and then sequentially delivered to fmn fe s clusters and coq 0 113 v for ubiquinone subsequently one portion of electrons were transferred to nap to reduce nitrate to nitrite while the other portion of electrons were transferred to the complex iii inside the membrane and further to c cyts in the periplasm and eventually consumed by other denitrification enzymes nir nor nos and the oxygen reducing terminal oxidases complex iv in aerobic intracellular respiratory chains the electron from c cyts could also transfer to the outer surface of the cell through extracellular respiratory chains although the removal performances of both nitrate and nitrite were improved in pd loaded cells the enzymic activity analysis indicated that nitrate removal is positively correlated with the increased the nap activity in a dose dependent manner while the insusceptible nir activity was observed during nitrite removal process this difference in enzyme activity might be related with their distinct molecular structure as reported nap contains two redox active centers a mo bis pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide mo bispgd active site and a 4fe 4s cluster while nir contains a homologous dimer protein with two cu binding sites or with heme d 1 and heme c as cofactors yang et al 2020 the up regulated nifs further confirmed that the bio pd 0 could facilitate the assembly of fe s clusters leading to the selective promotion of bio pd 0 on the nap leinartaite et al 2010 also pointed out that the coordinate bond of metal and protein could establish an interaction network to protect the metal center from damage improving the stability and activity of fe s protein leinartaitė et al 2010 the partial recovery of complex i in presence of bio pd 0 as evidenced by the decreased inhibition ratio in pd loaded cells fig 5g suggested a positive effect of bio pd 0 on the electron transfer in complex i a possible reason was that bio pd 0 could tightly attach to complex i due to its higher affinity and occupy the binding site of inhibitor and the bio pd 0 binding with complex i could shorten the distance between the fe s cluster and fmn eventually facilitating electron transfer in complex i tasnim et al 2020 on the other hand based on the complete relief of inhibited coq function by bio pd fig 5c we proposed that the bio pd 0 could act as an alternative free hydrogen carrier for coq to establish a secondary electron transfer path from complex i to complex iii or nap since pd 0 has an exceptional hydrogen capture capability 900 fold its own volume it can absorb a large amount of h atom to form pd h which could act as a hydrogen carrier to transfer electron while releasing hydrogen proton besides we also found that the inhibition of fe s center by cucl2 could also be alleviated in pd 0 loaded cells suggesting the bio pd 0 could improving the activity of fe s center existed in complex i nap and complex iii which was consistent with the above improved nap activity and up regulated nifs gene abundance however nearly same inhibition ratio in nan3 supplemented systems together with the insusceptible nir activity suggested that the increased nitrite removal in pd 0 loaded cells was only attributed to the abiotic nonenzymic catalysis by bio pd 0 rather than the biotic promotion in addition the up regulated ccca gene in pd loaded cells verified that the bio pd 0 could selectively increase electron flow towards no3 instead of o2 under the co respiration of nitrate and o2 which is very crucial for aerobic denitrification in practical application in summary we could deduce that pd 0 could accelerated the reduction of nitrate to nitrite mainly via biotic processes including selectively accelerating the electron transfer from fmn to nap and improving nap activity fig 9 and fig 10 while subsequent nitrite denitrification was only ascribed to the abiotic nonenzymic catalysis by bio pd 0 the different promotion mechanisms provided a reasonable explanation for different changes of nitrate and nitrite removal performance with the increase of bio pd 0 i e with the increase of pd 0 loading the nitrite removal rate keep improving due to the abiotic nonenzymic roles of bio pd 0 but the increment of nap activity decreased due to the toxicity of high level of pd 0 loading resulted in the lower improvement of qmax no3 in b pd 2 figs 3f and 4d 4 2 extracellualr electron transfer process heme based and flavin based met processes are often individually proposed as two common met processes for gram positive strain distinctly with the previous reports in this work both heme based and flavin based eet pathways coexisted in b megaterium y 4 particularly the oxidation peak related to cytochrome bound flavin at ep 226 287 mv was detected in gram positive bacteria for the first time although gram positive bacteria lacked of the outer membrane structure the mhcs localize on cell wall or cell surface could be involved in the electron transfer across the cell envelope carlson et al 2012 therefore in this work a new eet process via mhc bound flavin was also proposed i e the flavin as a redox cofactor could combine with mhcs on cell surface to form the mhc bound flavins and involve in the ees process of gram positive bacteria as indicated by okamoto et al 2014 the electron transfer pathway by mhc bound flavins followed an one electron eet mechanism via semiquinone with a rapider electron transfer rate about 103 105 fold faster than that of the two electron reaciton with free flavins this might explain the significantly higher nitrogen removal rate of negative b megaterium y 4 compared with previous reports as listed in table s3 apparently the discovery of the one electron eet pathway involved in aerobic denitrification was an important supplement to the electron transfer mechanism and provided a new idea to enhance the electron transfer rate and to maximize the denitrification efficiencies more importantly the larger oxidative peak currents 226 287 mv together with the more positive oxidative peak potential of mhc bound flavins in the pd loaded systems suggested that the bio pd 0 could promote the binding of flavin and mhcs to form semiquinone which provided an extra consolidating evidence for bio pd 0 in promoting the interfacial eet process of b megaterium y 4 in addition the larger redox peak currents and the smaller δep table s2 of the redox couple related with c cyts and flavin in pd loaded cells indicated that bio pd 0 could stimulate to secrete electron shuttles such as c cyts and flavin and enhance the reversibility of redox reaction leading to a rapid conversion of redox mediators between oxidation state and reduction state every microbial cell is surrounded by eps and the roles of eps in eet has been proved by xiao et al 2017 they confirmed that the dense redox mediators in eps could transfer electron to electron acceptor by elelctron hopping with the increase of bio pd 0 the formal charge qformal values and the corresponding number of redox sites in the eps increased to 10 20 times higher than the result of xiao et al 2017 as a result bio pd 0 could be embed in eps and act as electron shuttles which markedly accelerated the electron hopping by shortening the average distance between the molecular redox sites in eps of pd loaded b megaterium y 4 consequently besides the superior conductivity of pd loaded cells the exposure of bio pd 0 promoted the one electron electron transfer process via inducing the formation of flavins bound substances and two electron electron transfer process via free flavins and c cyts moreover as a major long distance electron transfer pathway in eps the electron hopping rate was also accelerated due to the involvement of bio pd 0 fig 10 4 3 environmental implication aerobic denitrification is an emerging strategy to alleviate the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen pollution due to its environmental and economic benefits however the nitrite accumulation and the competition of electron transfer in co respiration with oxygen would result in incomplete denitrification and thriftless carbon sources in this work the incorporation of bio pd 0 could improve the nap activity and selectively increase the electron flux to nitrate rather than o2 which was crucial for aerobic denitrification simultaneously the nitrite accumulation decreased due to the abiotic catalysis while the emission of n2o with stronger greenhouse effect 300 folds co2 was closely related to the accumulated nitrite and the relief of nitrite accumulation could reduce the discharge of n2o to environmental meeting the appeal of global climate action summit compared with the complicate synthesis process in chem nps in situ bio nps could be synthesized more simply and economically under room temperature 20 30 c and mild ph condition normally 6 8 5 the high biocompatible and selective denitrification offer unique advantage over convention aerobic denitrification which is particularly important for the potential application of sustainable and economic to treat nitrate contaminated wastewater 5 conclusion in this work coupling aerobic denitrification with in situ bio pd 0 could not only improve the biotic nitrate reduction by improving nap activity and amplify the electron transfer flux to nitrate but also relieve the nitrite accumulation by abiotic catalysis notably a novel one electron eet pathway via mhc bound flavins was proposed in gram positive b megaterium y 4 and enhanced in pd loaded cells meanwhile the accelerated long distance electron hopping in eps was also confirmed under bio pd 0 mediated condition moreover all these electron transfer processes were regulated by the qs system however their exact role of qs in regulating electron transfer mediated by pd 0 is not fully illustrated and requires further exploration declaration of competing interest

17344,the slow electron transfer rate is the bottleneck to the biological wastewater treatment process and the nanoparticles nps has been verified as a feasible strategy to improve the biological degradation efficiency by accelerating the electron transfer here we employed the gram positive bacillus megaterium y 4 capable of synthetizing pd 0 to investigate the intra extracellular electron transfer iet eet mechanisms mediated by nps in aerobic denitrification for the first time kinetic and thermodynamic results showed that the bio pd 0 could significantly promote the removal of both nitrate and nitrite by improving affinity and decreasing activation energy the enzymic activity and the respiration chain inhibition experiment indicated that the bio pd 0 could facilitate the nitrate biotic reduction by improving the fe s center activity and serving as parallel h carriers to replace coenzyme q to selectively increase the electron flux toward nitrate in iet while promoting the nitrite reduction by abiotic catalysis most importantly the detection of dpv peak at 226 287 mv proved that the one electron eet via multiheme cytochrome bound flavins also occurred in gram positive bacteria and enhanced in pd loaded cells in addition the remarkable increase of the formal charge in eps indicated that the bio pd 0 could act as an electron shuttle to increase the redox site in eps eventually accelerating the electron hopping in long distance electron transfer overall this study expanded our understanding of the roles of bio pd 0 on the aerobic denitrification process and provided an insight into the iet eet of gram positive strains graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords intracellular electron transfer iet extracellular electron transfer eet bio pd 0 aerobic denitrifiaction promotion mechanism 1 introduction the nitrogen cycle was overstepped due to the excessive application of fertilizers and increased nitrogen discharge from livestock domestic and industrial sources rockström 2009 aerobic denitrification could directly convert nitrate to n2 under aerobic condition via periplasmic nitrate reductase nap which could be expressed in presence of o2 since aerobic denitrification bacteria could simultaneously utilize both nitrate and o2 as terminal electron acceptors for co respiration their denitrification efficiencies would greatly depend on electron transfer efficiency and selectivity to nitrate yang et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that the introduction of metal nanoparticles nps could enhance the microbial metabolism process via accelerating the microbial electron transfer such as pd 0 cu pd fes ni pd fe2o3 and so on zhang et al 2018 moreover these metal nps could be biosynthized by many bacteria with less energy comsumption and under mild conditions such as bacillus megaterium y 4 chen et al 2019 bacillus wiedmannii msm chen et al 2018 pseudomonas putida niu et al 2018 etc meanwhile the biogenic metal nps had superior biocompatibility and dispersibility and have been widely used in biotechnological and environmental processes via accelerating the microbial electron transfer however most of the researches focused on the effect on the extracellular electorn transfer eet pathways including mediated electron transfer met via redox active electron shuttles and direct electron transfer det by conductive pili or c type cytochromes in the outer membrane om c cyts such as mtr and pcc coursolle et al 2010 kondo et al 2015 in 2011 wu et al first proposed that the bio pd 0 could participate in the eet of d desulfuricans with membrane bound cytochrome c3 as an electron conduit and speculated that nps might participate in microbial metabolism as biologically derived electron carriers wu et al 2011 wu et al 2013 demonstrated that bio aunps with lower loading dosage could repair the damage to the electron transfer chain in the mutant δomca mtrc to a certain extent deng et al 2020 found that fes nps could be biosynthesized intrac extracellularly or on the cell surface and function as an efficient eet conduit in srb d vulgari while you et al 2019 confirmed that the biosynthesis process of palladium nanorods could induce riboflavin synthase and further mediate the eet of enterobacter cloacae sgz 5t our previous experiment also demonstrated that pd nps bio synthesized by citrobacter freundii could trigger the secreting riboflavin and c cyts facilitating the met niu et al 2018 wang et al 2020 all these eet pathways mentioned above were conducted under anaerobic or anoxic conditons and followed a two electron reaction by means of individual redox active compounds quinone c cyts and flavins okamoto et al 2013 2014 found that om c cyts could combine with flavins to form cytochrome bound semiquinone to establish an one electron reaction pathway of which the electorn transfer rate was 103 105 folds rapider than that of two electron reaction via free flavins or c cyts alone moreover these researches were obtained based on the gram negative bacteria such as shewanella spp and geobacter sp as for the eet mechanism of gram positive bacteria wrighton et al 2011 found that gram positive t potens strain jr failed to secrete release soluble redox active components and could only transfer electron to mfc anodes by det in which c cyts played an important role subsequently carlson et al 2012 proved that the cell wall associated cytochromes and multiheme c type cytochromes mhcs involved in the transmembrane electron trasnfer of gram positive bacteria wu et al 2014 and you et al 2018 demonstrated that only free flavins were responsible to mediate the eet process of the gram positive b megaterium strain lld 1 and bacillus sp ws xy1 and the secreted free flavins could act as redox mediators to deliver electrons from cellular metabolic systems to extracellular insoluble substrates via a two electron transfer mechanism moreover xiao et al 2017 revealed eps extracellular polymeric substance could store concentrated flavins and c cyts which would enable eps enveloped cells to transport electrons to extracellular acceptors via long distance electron hopping till now the mechanism of eet of gram positive bacteria remains undetermined and the reports on the roles of nps in the intact electron transfer process of gram positive bacteria including intercellular electron transfer iet and eet were absent in comparison with other high conductivity metals nps such as fe s and carbon dots palladium nanoparticles pd 0 nps possess high catalytic capability better stability superior selectivity as well as distinctive quantum feature owing to their tunable shape and size higher h2 adsorption capacity higher oxidation potential and specific electron configurations 4d10 based on these pd nps have been effectively used for the catalytic degradation transformation of contaminants such as heavy metals azo dyes pesticides and organic halides in groundwater wastewater and sediments moreover due to the scarcity in the natural resources and the increasing market demand for noble metal the green recovery of pd from wastewater via in situ biosynthesis was considered as a promising strategy with a high economic value by comparison although many biogenic metal nps had strong conductivity for et applications bio pd 0 synthesized in situ could simultaneously accomplish the green recovery of noble metal and catalyzing to degrade co existence pollutants which was of greater environmental and economic significance some studies demonstrated that monometallic pd 0 nps were incapable of catalyzing no3 reduction to no2 but could catalyze the subsequent reduction of nitrite to nitrogen or ammonium and its catalytic selectivity depended on many factors chaplin et al 2007 zhou et al 2017 found that microbial denitrification coupled with pd 0 significantly improved the denitrification rate and selectively reduced nitrate towards n2 instead of nh4 n moreover they proposed that oxygen intrusion could further improve this selectivity to n2 nearly 100 without negative effect on nitrate chem reduction but led to the decline of overall nitrate reduction rate due to the partial loss of biological denitrification by disturbing anoxic denitrifying bacteria based on this concept coupling aerobic denitrification with pd nps should be an efficient and eco friendly strategy for nitrate removal in our previous study gram positive bacillus megaterium y 4 isolated from the sludge of electronic waste plant has been proved to be able to transform pb2 to pd 0 nps inter extracellularly and on the surface of cells chen et al 2019 moreover in the preliminary experiment we also found that the bacillus megaterium y 4 was capable of aerobic denitrification thus in this work bacillus megaterium y 4 was employed to investigate the effect of pd 0 nps on the aerobic denitrification process as well as the role of biogenic pd 0 bio pd 0 in the eet iet mechanisms by combining kinetic analysis thermodynamically calculation electrochemical analysis and molecular biology these observations may provide a deep understanding of the microbial electron transport mechanisms involved in a pd 0 mediated nitrogen removal system which is important in environmental and bioenergy fields 2 meterials and methods 2 1

was taken every 12 h when the no3 n was removed completely 10 ml bacteria solution was transferred to a new denitrification medium containing higher no3 n this procedure was repeated five times until the no3 n concentration reached 100 mg l 1 after the acclimation for 10 days b megaterium y 4 was able to remove 100 mg l 1 no3 n within 12 h finally the bacteria in mid exponential growth phase were

shaker were collected by centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 15 min and then washed two times thoroughly with 50 mmol l 1 pbs and the cells in the flasks with initial pd ii of 0 2 and 5 mg l 1 were named as c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively all collected cells were used for the further nitrogen removal test 2 4 nitrogen removal performance nitrogen removal performances were initiated with the addition of cultures c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 in 100 ml dm medium and performed in a shaking incubator with the dissolve oxygen concentration 4 2 mg l 1 125 rpm 30 c the initial concentration of the bacteria was 1 0 0 05 107 cfu ml samples were withdrawn regularly to measure the concentrations of no3 no2 and bio n kinetic experiment fig s2 was performed with various concentrations 0 20 50 70 100 150 mg l of nitrate or nitrite and fitted by haldane model as follows eqs 1 and 2 1 q q m a x s k s s s 2 k i where q is the specific activity h 1 for each initial concentration of substrate s qmax is the maximum

mmol l 1 cucl2 to explore the impact mechanism of bio pd 0 on the electron transfer in respiratory chain the stock solutions of rotenone capsaicin and bal were prepared with ethanol as the solvent naoh solution 0 5 mmol l 1 was used to prepare the dicumarol stock solution 2 5 thermodynamic analysis in order to further explore the effect of bio pd 0 on the biological nitrogen metabolism the apparent rate constant kobs of nitrate removal with strain b pd 1 and b pd 2 were determined at four different temperatures 296 301 306 and 311 k in fig s3 the activity energy was calculated according to the arrhenius formula eq 3 3 k o b s a e e a r t where kobs is the rate constant r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 t is the thermodynamic temperature k ea is the apparent activation

rate of gibbs energy by catabolism 2 6 electrochemical measurement differential pulse voltammetry dpv and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were performed to characterize the electrochemical properties of the cells using an electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua inc shanghai china with the glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode the platinum wire as counter electrode and the standard calomel electrode sce as the reference electrode the dpv test conditions were as follows scan range of potential 0 8 0 v vs sce amplitude 60 mv pulse width 0 2 s potential increment 6 mv eis was carried out with an amplitude of 5 mv and a frequency from 100 khz to 0 1 hz 2 7 analysis methods hach spectrophotometer dr 5000 was used for the determination of spectrophotometry the ammonium nitrate nitrite and tn concentrations were measured according to the standard methods apha 2012 the sample was first centrifuged under 5000 rpm for 5 min and then filtered by fiberglass 0 22 µm to exclude the influence of cells the measurement microbial biomass nitrogen bio n was shown in supporting materials the pd ii concentration was analyzed by aas perkinelmer pinaacle 900t the activities of nap nir nitrate reductase and ets electron transfer system were detected according to our previous method jia et al 2020 the eps was extracted from cells by heat treatment method wang et al 2020 the bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 4 c and 6000 rpm for 10 min then washed twice and resuspended in 0 9 nacl w v solution next the washed cell pellets were heated in a water bath at 38 c for 30 min and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation 4 c 6000 rpm 10 min and used for electrochemical measurements as for the qpcr analysis the details for dna extraction were given in our previous publication jia et al 2019 functional genes napa nirk s nosz ccca nifs and luxs were quantified by real time quantitative pcr abi 7500 information of the primers for the genes were listed in supplementary materials table s1 the bio pd 0 was confirmed by x ray diffraction xrd bruker d8 advance with cukα x ray radiation λ 0 154056 nm at 40 kv and 40 ma the patterns were recorded from 30 to 90 with a step size of 0 02 and compared with jcpds database all data in this experiment were analyzed by one way anova test p 0 05 using spss statistics 17 0 software and figures were made by origin pro 2017 software each experiment had three repetitions and the results are presented as means sd standard deviation of means 3 result 3 1 synthesis and characterization of bio pd 0 the changes of pd ii concentrations over time with sodium formate as carbon source were shown in fig 1 a the concentrations of pd ii declined sharply in the first 15 min due to the biosorption then became slower thereafter meanwhile the color of solution also changed from pale yellow to black when anaerobically cultured in 2 and 5 mg l 1 pd ii solutions for 2 h the removal efficiencies of pd ii reached 67 and 75 respectively correspondingly the native cell and cell loaded with pd cultured in 2 and 5 mg l 1 pd ii were defined as c b b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively in the control experiment without cells approximately 10 decrease of pd ii concentration was observed due to the abiotic reduction of pd ii with sodium formate xrd was employed to further verify the biosynthesis of pd 0 in b pd as shown in the xrd pattern of the b pd samples four major diffraction peaks appear at 40 0 46 7 68 1 and 81 7 corresponding to the 111 200 220 and 311 planes of pd 0 with the face centered cubic structure jcpds 46 1043 indicated that the biogenic pd 0 nps bio pd 0 was successfully synthetized by b megaterium y 4 meanwhile according to our previous report chen et al 2019 synthetized bio pd 0 by b megaterium y 4 distributed both intercellularly and extracellularly 3 2 denitrification promoting by bio pd 0 the time course of various nitrogen species for native cells c b and pd loaded cells b pd 1 and b pd 2 were shown in fig 2 consistently with our previous report that nanoparticles could delay the exponential phase of cell growth lv et al 2017 the lag phase of b megaterium was prolonged from 3 h to 8 h and 10 h for b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively whereas the introduction of bio pd could significantly improve bacterial growth rate i e the accumulation rate of bio n and the removals of nitrate and nitrite fig 2a c moreover during the whole denitrification process the ammonium was not detected confirming nearly 100 of selectivity toward n2 for native cell the relatively larger value of q max ks and ki in nitrate system indicated that the nitrate had higher affinity and lower suppression to strains i e nitrate denitrification was more favorable than nitrite denitrification compared with native cell the specific activity of nitrate denitrification q ma x no3 increased from 378 to 5453 and 3571 mg n mg 1 cdw h 1 for b pd 1 and b pd 2 respectively likewise qmax no2 increased from 14 16 to 502 and 1060 mg mg 1 cdw h 1 noticeably with the introduction of bio pd 0 more remarkable increment of qmax occurred in the nitrite system leading to a significant decline of nitrite accumulation suggesting that bio pd 0 could selectively catalyze the nitrite denitrification as shown in table 1 although the values of ks in all pd 0 loaded systems were higher than those in control regardless of nitrogen substrates the larger values of qmax ks were also observed in pd 0 loaded systems due to larger improvement of qmax moreover the qmax ks of b pd 1 0 0181 was higher than that of b pd 2 0 0138 in nitrate systems which was contrary to the result in nitrite systems that the value of qmax ks increased with the increase of bio pd 0 in addition the values of ki 0 77 mg l 1 in nitrite system were much lower than those in nitrate system and all values of ki in both systems decreased significantly in the presence of bio pd 0 3 3 thermodynamic analysis of denitrification via nitrate and nitrite thermodynamic analysis could provide more information regarding microbial metabolism processes thus δg during the denitrification process was calculated based on the dissipative theory and shown in fig 3 as indicated in fig 3 the negative δg was observed in all systems indicating that the denitrification reactions via nitrate or nitrite were spontaneous and thermodynamically favorable under all test conditions moreover the values of δg for the reductions of nitrite and nitrate were the most negative in b pd 2 58 96 and 96 12 kj mol 1 followed by b pd 1 55 44 and 77 68 kj mol 1 and c b 51 93 and 50 18 kj mol 1 the decreased δg in pd loaded systems together with the larger decrements of δg at high level loading of bio pd in b pd 2 indicated that the augment of pd 0 was thermodynamically beneficial to nitrate and nitrite denitrification fig 4 d liu et al 2020 investigated the effects of redox materials on microbial energy supply distribution and utilization and found that some redox materials with relatively low redox potentials could also alter the gibbs free energy of catabolism reactions the activation energy in the denitrification process was also calculated and the result showed that ea no3 and ea no2 decreased by about 20 7 21 89 from 67 42 to 53 44 and 52 66 kj mol 1 and 37 46 39 80 from 76 75 to 46 20 and 48 10 kj mol 1 with the exposure of bio pd 0 respectively 3 4 ets activity denitrifying enzyme activity and gene abundance functional stability of microbial denitrification mainly depends on the effective electron generation transport and electron consumption wan et al 2019 the nanomaterials of metals with appropriate scale might impact the electron transfer rate during aerobic denitrification process eventually these electrons are consumed by four key denitrifying enzymes encoded as the gene napa nirs k norb and nosz as expected ets activities of b pd 1 and b pd 2 increased from 0 527 0 08 to 0 701 0 12 and 1 352 0 005 g o2 mg 1 min 1 respectively fig 4a our previous study also proved that the incorporation of bio nano pd 0 inside p putida could enhance both the ttc ets and int ets rates of the bacteria niu et al 2018 as for the aerobic denitrification enzymes the encoding gene of nap was successfully amplified fig 4c confirming that b megaterium y 4 has the ability of aerobic denitrification by co respiring nitrate and o2 peculiarly the bio pd 0 could notably improve the nap activity which increased significantly from 0 187 0 074 no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein to 0 782 0 097 and 0 473 0 056 mg no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein for b pd 1 and b pd 2 3 2 fold and 1 7 fold higher than that of native cells respectively while the activities of nir had no significant difference with the introduction of pd 0 and kept at a lower level 0 076 0 091 mg no2 n min 1 mg 1 protein different from the increased activity of nap no significant variation was found in the expression abundances of napa nirs and nosz fig 4c indicating that the responses of denitrifying enzyme activities to bio pd 0 did not match with the corresponding gene abundances these results demonstrated that the improvement of nitrate denitrification might be directly governed by the functional enzymic activity at protein level rather than gene abundance gene level the similar result was also obtained by chen and vymazal 2015 that the n2o released matched with the nos activity rather than the nosz abundance in denitrification process as the regulation of enzymic activity could occur at the transcription post transcription translation and protein levels su et al 2019 the indiscriminate expression of genes in mitochondrial rna indicated that the motivation of bio pd 0 on the nitrate denitrification occurred at post transcription by promoting translation and enhancing the stabilization of protein consistent with the increasing ets activity the significant up regulations of gene ccca and nifs were observed it was reported that the ccca gene product cytochrome c2 played a critical role in diverting electrons from aerobic respiration to denitrification hopper et al 2013 while nifs was responsible for the formation of fe s clusters anwar et al 2014 thus we deduced that the bio pd 0 might promote the formation of fe s clusters and cytochrome c2 accelerating the electron transfer in aerobic denitrification in addition the abundance of gene luxs responsible for regulating quorum sensing remarkably down regulated indicating that the quorum sensing molecular was relevant to the boosted denitrification by bio pd 0 maddela et al 2019 reported that the exogenous addition of ahls acylated homoserine lactones could result in increasing phenol degradation and decreasing denitrification in pseudomonas aeruginosa moreover it was reported the metal based nps could affect the biosynthesis of qs molecule signal perception and signal response gómez gómez et al 2019 3 5 intracellular electron transfer generally the intracellular electron transport system is composed of complex i quinone pool complex iii and cytochrome c further experiments were conducted with capsaicin rotenone dicumarol bal nan3 and cucl2 as the inhibitors of nadh dehydrogenase complex i coenzyme q coq complex iii bc1 complex complex iv and fe s center respectively to test the role of bio pd in the respiratory chain as shown in fig 5 the nitrate removal rate of native cells sharply declined from 0 09274 to 0 03612 0 03063 0 06634 and 0 04577 h 1 with the additions of capsaicin rotenone dicumarol and cucl2 accordingly the inhibition ratios reached 60 92 66 97 28 46 and 50 64 respectively however when supplemented with bio pd the inhibition by rotenone and cucl2 was alleviated and the inhibition ratio reduced by 28 20 and 33 40 respectively interestingly it was found that the presence of bio pd 0 not only eliminated the inhibition of dicumarol but even promoted the nitrate removal resulting in a higher nitrate removal rate 0 1002 h 1 than that of native cells regarding to the systems supplemented by capsaicin bal and nan3 no obvious difference of nitrate removal was observed when cells loaded with pd 0 similar result was reported by liu et al 2017 that complex i and coenzyme q involved in the electron transfer in the process of fe iii reduction by g sulfurreducens 3 6 extracellular electron transfer eis results were shown in fig 6 and significant differences of native and pd loaded cells were observed the solution resistances rs and the anode charge transfer resistance rct decreased significantly with the increase of bio pd 0 compared with the native cells the rs of b pd 1 and b pd 2 decreased from 358 to 76 and 55 ω reducing by 78 77 and 84 63 respectively similarly the corresponding rct decreased from 6170 to 1856 and 1387 ω reducing by 69 92 and 77 52 respectively these results demonstrated that the intercalation of bio pd 0 significantly increased the cell conductivity and these supported pd 0 nps might construct an another electric conductive pathway to the external electron acceptor which could markedly overcome the poor conductivity of proteins in microorganisms to promote the electron transfer hou et al 2016 found that pd 0 nps synthesized by biofilm could self assembly wrap each bacteria cell and finally form a conductive three dimensional porous network resulting in a remarkably decreased resistance and an over 5 fold increase of current dpv with high sensitivity was used to investigate the eet process by bio pd 0 as shown in fig 7 besides the nitrate reduction peak at ep 748 mv consistent with the sole reduction peak of dm without cells in fig s5 three pairs dpv peaks at 192 216 mv 444 464 mv and 544 556 mv anodic cathodic were observed for native cells which were attributed to the cytochrome c c cyts free riboflavin rf and flavin mononucleotide fmn respectively xiao et al 2017 unexpectedly an oxidative peak appeared at 287 mv fig 7b and the insets which is related with the binding of flavins and c cyts on the outer membrane om c cyts regulated eletron exchange between the eet and intracellular metabolic activity okamoto et al 2013 to our best knowledge this was the first report to discover the cytochrome bound flavins participated in eet process of gram positive bacteria the point of concern was that compared with the native cells the oxidation peak current of cytochrome bound flavin increased from 1 139 μa to 1 175 and 2 930 μa in b pd 1 and b pd 2 with the positive shift of peak potential from 287 mv to 284 and 226 mv respectively indicating the promotion of bio pd 0 on the eet pathway via cytochrome bound flavin concomitantly the negative shift and increased current of nitrate reduction peak were also observed in pd loaded cells moreover with the exposure of bio pd 0 the redox couple peaks attributed to the om c cyts shifted from 192 216 mv anodic cathodic to 181 188 mv for b pd 1 and 181 144 mv for b pd 2 and their corresponding peak current increased from 1 132 1 323 μa anodic cathodic to 1 181 2 642 and 2 912 3 238 μa respectively meanwhile the free rf couple peaks shifted towards negative direction to ep 484 496 and 496 504 mv for b pd 1and b pd 2 and their peak currents increased from 1 102 1 345 μa anodic cathodic to 1 173 2 858 b pd 1 and 2 372 3 900 μa b pd 2 respectively analogously the existence of bio pd 0 made fmn redox couple at 544 556 mv shift to ep 588 496 mv the corresponding peak currents increasing from 1 369 1 091 μa anodic cathodic to 3 152 1 137 and 4 827 2 593 μa more importantly the potential discrepancy δep between anodic and cathodic peak of three redox couples remarkably decreased with the increase of bio pd 0 as listed in table s2 these results indicated that bio pd 0 could stimulate to secrete c cyts and flavin and enhance the reversibility of redox reaction to cause a rapid conversion between oxidation and reduction state eps has been proved to possess the excellent redox capability due to the abundant redox compounds hence eps was also extracted and measured with dpv in this work and the formal charge qformal values were calculated according to the following equation the results were shown in fig 8 and table 2 q f o r m a l π v k 0 δ e q d p v where dpv peak charge qdpv is obtained by the peak area δe is dpv potential pulse increment increments 0 006 v k0 s 1 is the standard electrochemical et rate constant 0 026 s 1 obtained by laviron s method and v is the scan rate as shown in fig 8 c cyt and flavins as revealed by two pairs of peaks ep 198 236 mv and 592 602 mv were detected in eps of native cells when loaded with pd 0 they shifted to ep 164 216 mv and 590 596 mv for b pd 1 and ep 194 198 mv and 584 602 mv for b pd 2 respectively especially the peak currents anodic cathodic increased significantly from 0 538 0 596 to 0 668 0 724µa and 0 959 1 074 µa for c cyts and from 0 645 0 530µa to 0 844 0 845µa and 0 914 0 953 µa for flavin respectively correspondingly the qdpv of eps obtained by the peak area increased from 2 9 4 9 10 8 for native cells to the 4 7 8 0 10 8 c for b pd 1 and 0 8 1 3 10 7 c for b pd 2 and the formal charge qformal values increased from 0 588 0 97 10 5 c to 0 94 1 6 10 5 and 0 16 0 26 10 4 c 4 discussion it is highly desirable to improve denitrification from wastewater via accelerating microbial electron transport process by means of the in site synthsized bio pd 0 nps based on the kinetic and thermodynamic results the feasibility of applying in site synthsized bio pd 0 nps by b megaterium y 4 to promote the removal of both nitrate and nitrite was demonstrated in addition the insights into the role of pd 0 in accelerating intercellular extracellular electron transfer were also proposed as follows 4 1 iet acceleration mediated by bio pd 0 aerobic denitrification bacteria could co respire with both nitrate and o2 as terminal electron acceptors of which both electron transfer chains depend on the same core component including the nadh dehydrogenase complex i the quinone pool the bc1 complex complex iii and c cyts chen and strous 2013 briefly the electrons were generated by nadh dehydrogenase and then sequentially delivered to fmn fe s clusters and coq 0 113 v for ubiquinone subsequently one portion of electrons were transferred to nap to reduce nitrate to nitrite while the other portion of electrons were transferred to the complex iii inside the membrane and further to c cyts in the periplasm and eventually consumed by other denitrification enzymes nir nor nos and the oxygen reducing terminal oxidases complex iv in aerobic intracellular respiratory chains the electron from c cyts could also transfer to the outer surface of the cell through extracellular respiratory chains although the removal performances of both nitrate and nitrite were improved in pd loaded cells the enzymic activity analysis indicated that nitrate removal is positively correlated with the increased the nap activity in a dose dependent manner while the insusceptible nir activity was observed during nitrite removal process this difference in enzyme activity might be related with their distinct molecular structure as reported nap contains two redox active centers a mo bis pyranopterin guanine dinucleotide mo bispgd active site and a 4fe 4s cluster while nir contains a homologous dimer protein with two cu binding sites or with heme d 1 and heme c as cofactors yang et al 2020 the up regulated nifs further confirmed that the bio pd 0 could facilitate the assembly of fe s clusters leading to the selective promotion of bio pd 0 on the nap leinartaite et al 2010 also pointed out that the coordinate bond of metal and protein could establish an interaction network to protect the metal center from damage improving the stability and activity of fe s protein leinartaitė et al 2010 the partial recovery of complex i in presence of bio pd 0 as evidenced by the decreased inhibition ratio in pd loaded cells fig 5g suggested a positive effect of bio pd 0 on the electron transfer in complex i a possible reason was that bio pd 0 could tightly attach to complex i due to its higher affinity and occupy the binding site of inhibitor and the bio pd 0 binding with complex i could shorten the distance between the fe s cluster and fmn eventually facilitating electron transfer in complex i tasnim et al 2020 on the other hand based on the complete relief of inhibited coq function by bio pd fig 5c we proposed that the bio pd 0 could act as an alternative free hydrogen carrier for coq to establish a secondary electron transfer path from complex i to complex iii or nap since pd 0 has an exceptional hydrogen capture capability 900 fold its own volume it can absorb a large amount of h atom to form pd h which could act as a hydrogen carrier to transfer electron while releasing hydrogen proton besides we also found that the inhibition of fe s center by cucl2 could also be alleviated in pd 0 loaded cells suggesting the bio pd 0 could improving the activity of fe s center existed in complex i nap and complex iii which was consistent with the above improved nap activity and up regulated nifs gene abundance however nearly same inhibition ratio in nan3 supplemented systems together with the insusceptible nir activity suggested that the increased nitrite removal in pd 0 loaded cells was only attributed to the abiotic nonenzymic catalysis by bio pd 0 rather than the biotic promotion in addition the up regulated ccca gene in pd loaded cells verified that the bio pd 0 could selectively increase electron flow towards no3 instead of o2 under the co respiration of nitrate and o2 which is very crucial for aerobic denitrification in practical application in summary we could deduce that pd 0 could accelerated the reduction of nitrate to nitrite mainly via biotic processes including selectively accelerating the electron transfer from fmn to nap and improving nap activity fig 9 and fig 10 while subsequent nitrite denitrification was only ascribed to the abiotic nonenzymic catalysis by bio pd 0 the different promotion mechanisms provided a reasonable explanation for different changes of nitrate and nitrite removal performance with the increase of bio pd 0 i e with the increase of pd 0 loading the nitrite removal rate keep improving due to the abiotic nonenzymic roles of bio pd 0 but the increment of nap activity decreased due to the toxicity of high level of pd 0 loading resulted in the lower improvement of qmax no3 in b pd 2 figs 3f and 4d 4 2 extracellualr electron transfer process heme based and flavin based met processes are often individually proposed as two common met processes for gram positive strain distinctly with the previous reports in this work both heme based and flavin based eet pathways coexisted in b megaterium y 4 particularly the oxidation peak related to cytochrome bound flavin at ep 226 287 mv was detected in gram positive bacteria for the first time although gram positive bacteria lacked of the outer membrane structure the mhcs localize on cell wall or cell surface could be involved in the electron transfer across the cell envelope carlson et al 2012 therefore in this work a new eet process via mhc bound flavin was also proposed i e the flavin as a redox cofactor could combine with mhcs on cell surface to form the mhc bound flavins and involve in the ees process of gram positive bacteria as indicated by okamoto et al 2014 the electron transfer pathway by mhc bound flavins followed an one electron eet mechanism via semiquinone with a rapider electron transfer rate about 103 105 fold faster than that of the two electron reaciton with free flavins this might explain the significantly higher nitrogen removal rate of negative b megaterium y 4 compared with previous reports as listed in table s3 apparently the discovery of the one electron eet pathway involved in aerobic denitrification was an important supplement to the electron transfer mechanism and provided a new idea to enhance the electron transfer rate and to maximize the denitrification efficiencies more importantly the larger oxidative peak currents 226 287 mv together with the more positive oxidative peak potential of mhc bound flavins in the pd loaded systems suggested that the bio pd 0 could promote the binding of flavin and mhcs to form semiquinone which provided an extra consolidating evidence for bio pd 0 in promoting the interfacial eet process of b megaterium y 4 in addition the larger redox peak currents and the smaller δep table s2 of the redox couple related with c cyts and flavin in pd loaded cells indicated that bio pd 0 could stimulate to secrete electron shuttles such as c cyts and flavin and enhance the reversibility of redox reaction leading to a rapid conversion of redox mediators between oxidation state and reduction state every microbial cell is surrounded by eps and the roles of eps in eet has been proved by xiao et al 2017 they confirmed that the dense redox mediators in eps could transfer electron to electron acceptor by elelctron hopping with the increase of bio pd 0 the formal charge qformal values and the corresponding number of redox sites in the eps increased to 10 20 times higher than the result of xiao et al 2017 as a result bio pd 0 could be embed in eps and act as electron shuttles which markedly accelerated the electron hopping by shortening the average distance between the molecular redox sites in eps of pd loaded b megaterium y 4 consequently besides the superior conductivity of pd loaded cells the exposure of bio pd 0 promoted the one electron electron transfer process via inducing the formation of flavins bound substances and two electron electron transfer process via free flavins and c cyts moreover as a major long distance electron transfer pathway in eps the electron hopping rate was also accelerated due to the involvement of bio pd 0 fig 10 4 3 environmental implication aerobic denitrification is an emerging strategy to alleviate the negative environmental impacts of nitrogen pollution due to its environmental and economic benefits however the nitrite accumulation and the competition of electron transfer in co respiration with oxygen would result in incomplete denitrification and thriftless carbon sources in this work the incorporation of bio pd 0 could improve the nap activity and selectively increase the electron flux to nitrate rather than o2 which was crucial for aerobic denitrification simultaneously the nitrite accumulation decreased due to the abiotic catalysis while the emission of n2o with stronger greenhouse effect 300 folds co2 was closely related to the accumulated nitrite and the relief of nitrite accumulation could reduce the discharge of n2o to environmental meeting the appeal of global climate action summit compared with the complicate synthesis process in chem nps in situ bio nps could be synthesized more simply and economically under room temperature 20 30 c and mild ph condition normally 6 8 5 the high biocompatible and selective denitrification offer unique advantage over convention aerobic denitrification which is particularly important for the potential application of sustainable and economic to treat nitrate contaminated wastewater 5 conclusion in this work coupling aerobic denitrification with in situ bio pd 0 could not only improve the biotic nitrate reduction by improving nap activity and amplify the electron transfer flux to nitrate but also relieve the nitrite accumulation by abiotic catalysis notably a novel one electron eet pathway via mhc bound flavins was proposed in gram positive b megaterium y 4 and enhanced in pd loaded cells meanwhile the accelerated long distance electron hopping in eps was also confirmed under bio pd 0 mediated condition moreover all these electron transfer processes were regulated by the qs system however their exact role of qs in regulating electron transfer mediated by pd 0 is not fully illustrated and requires further exploration declaration of competing interest
