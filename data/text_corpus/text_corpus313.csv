was run for at least 10 mins to guarantee a steady inflow nacl was used as tracer at the very beginning of a tracer test 100 ml nacl solution 9 g l was pulsed instantaneously into the reactor through the three way tube hach sension ec5 was used to test the effluent conductivity at intervals of 15 s the test was stopped once the effluent water sample approached the background conductivity

means a narrow shape of the rtd curve 2 3 dye tracer test to track the flow path and to obtain the distributions of dead zones in the hssfcw reactor a water soluble dye acid red 315 cas 12220 47 2 china was used a led board was set behind the reactor to provide background light the dye tracer test was carried out in a dark room it was started with an injection of 20 ml acid red dye solution 5 g

grid cell related to conductivity storage and transport hydraulic conductivity is a property of the ability of a porous material to transmit water klute 1986 vm requires data to be provided for kx ky and kz hydraulic conductivity in the direction of the model x y z axis to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the stimulation models or choose the default value by referring to literature pandit et al 2010 storage parameters included ss specific storage sy specific yield eff por effective porosity and tot por total porosity the effective porosity has a very important influence on the movement of tracer particles the parameters are determined by the properties of the filler and the situation of the experiment which can be derived from literature data dispersion is a physical process it tends to disperse or spread the contaminant mass in the x y and z directions along the advective path of the plume and acts to reduce the solute concentration dispersion is caused by the tortuosity of the flow paths of the groundwater as it travells through the interconnected pores of the soil dispersion has been calculated using the equation walter et al 1994 8 d α l v l 2 ν α h v h 2 ν α v v v 2 ν d where d is the dispersion coefficient l2 t ɑl is the longitudinal dispersivity l v l is the longitudinal velocity of flow along the plume migration pathway l t ɑ h means the horizontal dispersivity l v h is the horizontal velocity of flow along the plume migration pathway l t ɑv is the vertical dispersivity l v v is the vertical velocity of flow along the plume migration pathway d is the diffusion coefficient l2 t and v is the magnitude of seepage velocity l t mt3d calculates the dispersion tensor for the mass transport model using the following parameters longitudinal dispersivity for each transport grid cell ratio of horizontal to longitudinal dispersivity ratio of vertical to longitudinal dispersivity and molecular diffusion coefficient for each layer the longitudinal dispersivity was related to the average particle size and the uniformity coefficient of the filler it increased with the uniformity coefficient longitudinal dispersion could be obtained by laboratory and field experiments however due to the size effect of longitudinal dispersion the results of large area experiments in the field were more than ten orders of magnitude larger than those of laboratory experiments in general the value of longitudinal dispersion was 5 to 20 times that of horizontal dispersion in this study data for the longitudinal dispersion and the horizontal dispersion were obtained by point by point parameter method this method is based on the measured rtd curves the formula is as follows 9 d l t 1 t 2 x 2 v 2 t 1 t 2 4 t 1 t 2 ln c 1 t 1 c 2 t 2 10 d t m 2 π n c 1 t 1 d l exp x vt 1 2 4 d l t 1 2 where d l and d t are the longitudinal dispersion and the horizontal dispersion l c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations corresponding to times t 1 and t 2 respectively in the rtd curve mol l x is the distance between the water inlet and the outlet m v means the velocity of the flow l2 t n represents the porosity of medium and m is the mass of tracer injected into the aquifer per unit thickness the molecular diffusion coefficient is a physical quantity which indicates the molecular diffusion capability of matter sorbie and clifford 1991 it is affected by the temperature pressure and concentration of the mixture in the system the molecular diffusion coefficients of nacl were obtained from literature the simulation domain length width and height 0 6 m l 0 05 m w 0 5 m h were used to build the simulation model in vm the units of the parameters and the values of the default parameters were set grid parameters were modified to divide the simulation model into grid the 3d image of the top inlet bottom outlet simulation model is shown in fig 2 in the vm input module parameters for every grid are needed the inlet outlet positions and the loading rates were simulated by adding pumping wells in this study the pumping wells were used as the inlets and outlets the location of the pumping wells were determined by adding the values for x and y by adding a conc observation well the tracer concentration audits changes over time are recorded the position of the conc observation well and the outlet pumping well share the same position and the height of the observe point were set by setting the screen elevation of the conc observation well measured data are recorded by the interface of conc observation well for comparison of the calculated with the measured results one constant concentration point source was set at the center of the inlet to simulate the impulse point source the model ran in the first phase for 120 s to ensure flow stability then the impulse tracer was resealed immediately the tracer concentration and the solute volume were equal to the nacl solution 100 ml 9 g l in the meantime 100 tracer particles were added to the inlet to track the flow path in the run module of vm time steps and the initial heads were set equal to the surface water level of hssfcw reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 rtd curves for nacl tracer tests the rtd curves were obtained by calculating the conductivity of the effluent fig 3 lists 27 rtd curves including 9 inlet outlet configurations and 3 flow rates theoretically all tracers should have left the reactor outlet at the same time and should have had the same residence time after impulse injection however since the flow included different path length velocity mechanical dispersion and diffusion this resulted in that lead to the emergence of the rtd in real cws the peak value of rtd curve decreased with the inflow rate a low inflow rate caused a delayed peak time and wide peak width even if the flow rate was reduced to a low value the rtd curve showed a long tail the porosity of the media was heterogeneous in size and distribution which caused the change of flow velocity and direction of the flow this resulted in a mixture of water and tracer along the flow path due to some mechanical dispersion fetter et al fetter 2011 therefore the main reason for this phenomenon was that in the case of a high flow rate the mechanical dispersion of tracer particles was dominant the molecular diffusion was neglected regularly thiele 1997 therefore the rtd curves exhibited a regular trend however the mechanical dispersion of water along the lateral flow path was weak compared with the flow rate the mixing of the water along the vertical direction increased with the molecular diffusion this caused the tracer to spread to the dead zone of the reactor away from the main moving path this lead to the obvious long tail phenomenon of the rtd curve for the same inlet and flow rate the peak value of the rtd curves increased with the height of the outlet the peak time was short and peak width was narrow as the height of the outlet increased the flow needed more energy to overcome gravitational energy thus reducing the linear velocity of the flow with the decrease of flow velocity the mixing of the flow along the radial direction increased this caused the flow to be close to plug flow 3 2 calculated results and measurements results calculated by vm were compared with the measurements the exported data from the output module is shown in fig 4 as shown the calculated rtds were generally in accordance with the measured ones especially for low flow rates if he flow rates were 10 and 15 ml s the calculated results were higher than the measured ones after the rtd curves reached the peak although the calculated results do not coincide completely with the measured ones the cw modeled by vm produced ideal simulation of the different flow rates and inlet outlet configurations on the rtd curves the reasons for the discrepancy between the calculated data and the measured results are as follows the existence of voids between the porous media and the reactor walls may have lead a flow direction against the reactor wall thus affecting the mass transfer wang et al 2014a 2014b 2014c the effect of the side wall in the reactor was obvious because the media porosity next to the side wall was larger than the media porosity with reduced water flow resistance thus the water flow tended to pass through the gap between porous media and side wall the influence of the side wall effect increased with the flow rate in this experiment consequently if the flow rates were 10 and 15 ml s they could be affected which resulted in differences 3 3 short circuiting s the residence time of the flow in the reactor was generally different some part of the residence time of the actual flow was shorter than the theoretical value this difference in hydraulic retention time is called short flow joong hyuk and william 2010 the short circuiting s represents the flow path length between the inlet and outlet of the reactor and a low short circuiting value indicates that the tracer particles in the water flow had a large contact volume with the porous media in actual cws if the contact volume between substrate and plant root system is increased the degradation of pollutants and the purification of water are efficient according to table 1 for the same inlet outlet configuration the rule is s5 s10 s15 the s value increases with the flow rate especially if the inlet height was lower than the outlet a low s value was observed as the water flowed upwards the dispersion increased and the short flow decreased gravity increased the linear velocity of the water along the flow path in addition a high flow rate caused short flow and a large aspect ratio effectively increased the dispersion of the flow and reduced the short flow 3 4 plug flow n a high n value means plug flow and a n close to 1 means mixed flow fan et al 2008 eq 2 indicates that n is related to t n and σ 2 t n v q is related to the flow rate with the result t n5 t n10 t n15 as mentioned above an increased flow rate causes a narrow peak width and a low σ 2 at a low flow rate of 5 ml s a long rtd curve tail inferrs an increased σ 2 as a result a low flow rate causes a large n in the experiments of wang et al 2014a 2014b 2014c and niu et al 2014 similar results were obtained indicating a high flow rate causes a reduced cstrs number it is known that a low flow rate strengthens the flow with radial mixing fetter 2011 if the flow rate was low the flow type became plug flow and the cstrs n increased under ideal conditions no back mixing phenomenon occurs in the plug flow the mixing phenomenon of tracer particles with different residence time is called back mixing however due to the low flow rate the residence time of the tracer particles in the reactor was long and the radial mixing was enhanced it was difficult for tracer particles with different residence time to be mixed and even some tracer particles diffused to the dead zone the occurrence of back mixing caused mixed flow if the flow rate became high the tracer dispersing ability in the radial direction decreased it means that the flow was close to plug flow both the measured and the simulated results showed the same pattern n5 n10 n15 n5 n10 n15 however it could be seen that in most cases that the simulated n values were larger than the measured n values the different inlet outlet configurations caused the different flow paths influencing the tracer diffusion to some extent 3 5 effective volume ratio e the effective volume ratio e is the ratio of the effective residence time versus the average residence time a high value for e indicates an efficient utilization of the reactor studies have shown that the e in subsurface of constructed wetlands is generally between 0 4 and 0 8 fan 2011 according to the measured results if the effective volume ratio had an obvious trend with the change of the flow rates generally showed the pattern e5 e10 e15 similarly based on the simulation results e5 e10 e15 was observed the most of the e5 values was greater than 1 which meaning the effective volume is larger than the actual volume if the flow rate was low the tracer had a strong radial disperse the tracer had a long residence time in the reactor and sufficiently diffused causing increased tracer recovery time according to the rtd curve there was an obvious tail at the flow rate of 5 ml s according to the definition a dispersion includes mechanical and molecular diffusion with fine porous media the flow rate slowed down and the effect of the molecular diffusion was obvious a result of the low porosity if the flow rate was high the effect of mechanical diffusion was greater than the effect of molecular diffusion thus the effect of molecular diffusion could be very low and can be neglected this explains the effect of molecular diffusion in the case of a low flow rate it was obvious that a part of the tracer diverted from the flow path and reached the dead zone of the reactor this caused an increase of the average residence time in the reactor if the flow rate was high the mechanical diffusion was greater than the molecular diffusion at the same flow rate conditions when the height of inlet was lower than the outlet large e values were measured if the flow path was set from a low to a high position the distribution degree of the flow increased against gravity and the linear velocity of the direction of the flow path decreased for overcoming the gravity the mixing of the flow along the radial direction was enhanced so the water flow was more like a mixed flow according to literature if the flow is more like a mixed flow compared with the plug flow the volume required for the pollutant to be reduced to the same concentration is small consequently the e value becomes high 3 6 hydraulic efficiency λ for the hydraulic efficiency generally the rule λ5 λ10 λ15 was determined according to eq 6 the value of λ is related to the values of e and n as seen in table 1 if the flow rate is 5 ml s the value of n becomes very low and close to 1 for the inlet outlet configuration with 5 ml l inflow rate in the experiments because λ5 acquired the lowest values this was caused by the low flow rate because the role of molecular diffusion became dominant yu et al 1999 vm does not take wall turbulence and molecular diffusion into account consequently the pattern of simulated hydraulic efficiency was λ5 λ10 λ15 3 7 field concentrations of vm visual modflow 3d explorer is an advanced three dimensional visualization and animation module for displaying and presenting water flow pathlines and solute transportation by using a variety of three dimensional graphical formats as shown in fig 5 the simulated concentration field of the reactor was compared with the pictures of the dye tracer test it displays the change of the tracer distribution at the time 1 5 10 and 15 min the simulated results indicate a fast tracer frontier advancing speed than the measured ones this finding is also obvious in the rtd curve obviously the simulated rtd curves began to rise earlier than the measured ones this finding might result from the fact that the concentration and volume of the tracer dye were different from that of the nacl tracer but the similar flow pattern proved that vm can be used to simulate the actual solute transport process in cws 3 8 the pathlines of the tracer particles in the output module the pathlines graphic illustrate the water flow path of the added tracer particles the comparison between the calculated results and the measured results added to the conc observation well was visualized intuitively simulated pathlines of the particles started at the inlet the exported pathlines from vm are shown in fig 6 for the configurations of t b and b t the distribution of the tracer particle paths was uniform and the degree of dispersion of the water flow was large for the condition m m the middle part of the pathlines were sparse and the particle density at the edge of the particle paths pattern was high between inlet and outlet the larger aspect ratio enhanced the dispersion of water flow and effectively reduced short flow in accordance with the measured results the highest n value was determined for the middle inlet and middle outlet conditions the water flow was of the plug flow type the dispersion of the water flow was low and the effective utilization ratio of the wetland was also with increasing flow rate the passing area of the tracer particle group decreased this resulted in an increasing dead zone area with the increase of the flow rate the dispersion degree of the water flow decreased causing the short flow phenomenon to increase and the effective volume ratio to decrease 4 conclusions in this study a non opaque pvc glass reactor was created for a subsurface flow as a quasi 2d flow constructed wetland for hydraulic performance investigation influences of flow rates and inlet outlet configurations were analyzed using a nacl tracer test the results indicate that both the flow rates and inlet outlet configurations had significant impacts on hydraulic performance the flow rates had obvious impacts on the rtd curve the shape of the rtd curve affects the value of σ2 and the peak time affects the value of tm the flow rates obviously influenced on the hydraulic efficiency of the constructed wetland it was necessary to determine the maximum hydraulic efficiency λ within a suitable range of the flow rates for the same flow rate inlet outlet configurations had direct impacts on these hydraulic characteristic parameters different inlet outlet configurations changed the direction of the flow the degree of dispersion of the flow and the velocity of the flow along the flow path under the same inlet outlet configuration s values and n values became high with an increase of the flow rate but the e value was low the comparison between the concentration fields is sufficient to prove that vm could well simulate the actual solute transport process in cws although there are differences between simulation and measurement the method of setting up simulated models using vm is feasible to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of cws acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

is the diffusion coefficient l2 t and v is the magnitude of seepage velocity l t mt3d calculates the dispersion tensor for the mass transport model using the following parameters longitudinal dispersivity for each transport grid cell ratio of horizontal to longitudinal dispersivity ratio of vertical to longitudinal dispersivity and molecular diffusion coefficient for each layer the longitudinal dispersivity was related to the average particle size and the uniformity coefficient of the filler it increased with the uniformity coefficient longitudinal dispersion could be obtained by laboratory and field experiments however due to the size effect of longitudinal dispersion the results of large area experiments in the field were more than ten orders of magnitude larger than those of laboratory experiments in general the value of longitudinal dispersion was 5 to 20 times that of horizontal dispersion in this study data for the longitudinal dispersion and the horizontal dispersion were obtained by point by point parameter method this method is based on the measured rtd curves the formula is as follows 9 d l t 1 t 2 x 2 v 2 t 1 t 2 4 t 1 t 2 ln c 1 t 1 c 2 t 2 10 d t m 2 π n c 1 t 1 d l exp x vt 1 2 4 d l t 1 2 where d l and d t are the longitudinal dispersion and the horizontal dispersion l c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations corresponding to times t 1 and t 2 respectively in the rtd curve mol l x is the distance between the water inlet and the outlet m v means the velocity of the flow l2 t n represents the porosity of medium and m is the mass of tracer injected into the aquifer per unit thickness the molecular diffusion coefficient is a physical quantity which indicates the molecular diffusion capability of matter sorbie and clifford 1991 it is affected by the temperature pressure and concentration of the mixture in the system the molecular diffusion coefficients of nacl were obtained from literature the simulation domain length width and height 0 6 m l 0 05 m w 0 5 m h were used to build the simulation model in vm the units of the parameters and the values of the default parameters were set grid parameters were modified to divide the simulation model into grid the 3d image of the top inlet bottom outlet simulation model is shown in fig 2 in the vm input module parameters for every grid are needed the inlet outlet positions and the loading rates were simulated by adding pumping wells in this study the pumping wells were used as the inlets and outlets the location of the pumping wells were determined by adding the values for x and y by adding a conc observation well the tracer concentration audits changes over time are recorded the position of the conc observation well and the outlet pumping well share the same position and the height of the observe point were set by setting the screen elevation of the conc observation well measured data are recorded by the interface of conc observation well for comparison of the calculated with the measured results one constant concentration point source was set at the center of the inlet to simulate the impulse point source the model ran in the first phase for 120 s to ensure flow stability then the impulse tracer was resealed immediately the tracer concentration and the solute volume were equal to the nacl solution 100 ml 9 g l in the meantime 100 tracer particles were added to the inlet to track the flow path in the run module of vm time steps and the initial heads were set equal to the surface water level of hssfcw reactor 3 results and discussion 3 1 rtd curves for nacl tracer tests the rtd curves were obtained by calculating the conductivity of the effluent fig 3 lists 27 rtd curves including 9 inlet outlet configurations and 3 flow rates theoretically all tracers should have left the reactor outlet at the same time and should have had the same residence time after impulse injection however since the flow included different path length velocity mechanical dispersion and diffusion this resulted in that lead to the emergence of the rtd in real cws the peak value of rtd curve decreased with the inflow rate a low inflow rate caused a delayed peak time and wide peak width even if the flow rate was reduced to a low value the rtd curve showed a long tail the porosity of the media was heterogeneous in size and distribution which caused the change of flow velocity and direction of the flow this resulted in a mixture of water and tracer along the flow path due to some mechanical dispersion fetter et al fetter 2011 therefore the main reason for this phenomenon was that in the case of a high flow rate the mechanical dispersion of tracer particles was dominant the molecular diffusion was neglected regularly thiele 1997 therefore the rtd curves exhibited a regular trend however the mechanical dispersion of water along the lateral flow path was weak compared with the flow rate the mixing of the water along the vertical direction increased with the molecular diffusion this caused the tracer to spread to the dead zone of the reactor away from the main moving path this lead to the obvious long tail phenomenon of the rtd curve for the same inlet and flow rate the peak value of the rtd curves increased with the height of the outlet the peak time was short and peak width was narrow as the height of the outlet increased the flow needed more energy to overcome gravitational energy thus reducing the linear velocity of the flow with the decrease of flow velocity the mixing of the flow along the radial direction increased this caused the flow to be close to plug flow 3 2 calculated results and measurements results calculated by vm were compared with the measurements the exported data from the output module is shown in fig 4 as shown the calculated rtds were generally in accordance with the measured ones especially for low flow rates if he flow rates were 10 and 15 ml s the calculated results were higher than the measured ones after the rtd curves reached the peak although the calculated results do not coincide completely with the measured ones the cw modeled by vm produced ideal simulation of the different flow rates and inlet outlet configurations on the rtd curves the reasons for the discrepancy between the calculated data and the measured results are as follows the existence of voids between the porous media and the reactor walls may have lead a flow direction against the reactor wall thus affecting the mass transfer wang et al 2014a 2014b 2014c the effect of the side wall in the reactor was obvious because the media porosity next to the side wall was larger than the media porosity with reduced water flow resistance thus the water flow tended to pass through the gap between porous media and side wall the influence of the side wall effect increased with the flow rate in this experiment consequently if the flow rates were 10 and 15 ml s they could be affected which resulted in differences 3 3 short circuiting s the residence time of the flow in the reactor was generally different some part of the residence time of the actual flow was shorter than the theoretical value this difference in hydraulic retention time is called short flow joong hyuk and william 2010 the short circuiting s represents the flow path length between the inlet and outlet of the reactor and a low short circuiting value indicates that the tracer particles in the water flow had a large contact volume with the porous media in actual cws if the contact volume between substrate and plant root system is increased the degradation of pollutants and the purification of water are efficient according to table 1 for the same inlet outlet configuration the rule is s5 s10 s15 the s value increases with the flow rate especially if the inlet height was lower than the outlet a low s value was observed as the water flowed upwards the dispersion increased and the short flow decreased gravity increased the linear velocity of the water along the flow path in addition a high flow rate caused short flow and a large aspect ratio effectively increased the dispersion of the flow and reduced the short flow 3 4 plug flow n a high n value means plug flow and a n close to 1 means mixed flow fan et al 2008 eq 2 indicates that n is related to t n and σ 2 t n v q is related to the flow rate with the result t n5 t n10 t n15 as mentioned above an increased flow rate causes a narrow peak width and a low σ 2 at a low flow rate of 5 ml s a long rtd curve tail inferrs an increased σ 2 as a result a low flow rate causes a large n in the experiments of wang et al 2014a 2014b 2014c and niu et al 2014 similar results were obtained indicating a high flow rate causes a reduced cstrs number it is known that a low flow rate strengthens the flow with radial mixing fetter 2011 if the flow rate was low the flow type became plug flow and the cstrs n increased under ideal conditions no back mixing phenomenon occurs in the plug flow the mixing phenomenon of tracer particles with different residence time is called back mixing however due to the low flow rate the residence time of the tracer particles in the reactor was long and the radial mixing was enhanced it was difficult for tracer particles with different residence time to be mixed and even some tracer particles diffused to the dead zone the occurrence of back mixing caused mixed flow if the flow rate became high the tracer dispersing ability in the radial direction decreased it means that the flow was close to plug flow both the measured and the simulated results showed the same pattern n5 n10 n15 n5 n10 n15 however it could be seen that in most cases that the simulated n values were larger than the measured n values the different inlet outlet configurations caused the different flow paths influencing the tracer diffusion to some extent 3 5 effective volume ratio e the effective volume ratio e is the ratio of the effective residence time versus the average residence time a high value for e indicates an efficient utilization of the reactor studies have shown that the e in subsurface of constructed wetlands is generally between 0 4 and 0 8 fan 2011 according to the measured results if the effective volume ratio had an obvious trend with the change of the flow rates generally showed the pattern e5 e10 e15 similarly based on the simulation results e5 e10 e15 was observed the most of the e5 values was greater than 1 which meaning the effective volume is larger than the actual volume if the flow rate was low the tracer had a strong radial disperse the tracer had a long residence time in the reactor and sufficiently diffused causing increased tracer recovery time according to the rtd curve there was an obvious tail at the flow rate of 5 ml s according to the definition a dispersion includes mechanical and molecular diffusion with fine porous media the flow rate slowed down and the effect of the molecular diffusion was obvious a result of the low porosity if the flow rate was high the effect of mechanical diffusion was greater than the effect of molecular diffusion thus the effect of molecular diffusion could be very low and can be neglected this explains the effect of molecular diffusion in the case of a low flow rate it was obvious that a part of the tracer diverted from the flow path and reached the dead zone of the reactor this caused an increase of the average residence time in the reactor if the flow rate was high the mechanical diffusion was greater than the molecular diffusion at the same flow rate conditions when the height of inlet was lower than the outlet large e values were measured if the flow path was set from a low to a high position the distribution degree of the flow increased against gravity and the linear velocity of the direction of the flow path decreased for overcoming the gravity the mixing of the flow along the radial direction was enhanced so the water flow was more like a mixed flow according to literature if the flow is more like a mixed flow compared with the plug flow the volume required for the pollutant to be reduced to the same concentration is small consequently the e value becomes high 3 6 hydraulic efficiency λ for the hydraulic efficiency generally the rule λ5 λ10 λ15 was determined according to eq 6 the value of λ is related to the values of e and n as seen in table 1 if the flow rate is 5 ml s the value of n becomes very low and close to 1 for the inlet outlet configuration with 5 ml l inflow rate in the experiments because λ5 acquired the lowest values this was caused by the low flow rate because the role of molecular diffusion became dominant yu et al 1999 vm does not take wall turbulence and molecular diffusion into account consequently the pattern of simulated hydraulic efficiency was λ5 λ10 λ15 3 7 field concentrations of vm visual modflow 3d explorer is an advanced three dimensional visualization and animation module for displaying and presenting water flow pathlines and solute transportation by using a variety of three dimensional graphical formats as shown in fig 5 the simulated concentration field of the reactor was compared with the pictures of the dye tracer test it displays the change of the tracer distribution at the time 1 5 10 and 15 min the simulated results indicate a fast tracer frontier advancing speed than the measured ones this finding is also obvious in the rtd curve obviously the simulated rtd curves began to rise earlier than the measured ones this finding might result from the fact that the concentration and volume of the tracer dye were different from that of the nacl tracer but the similar flow pattern proved that vm can be used to simulate the actual solute transport process in cws 3 8 the pathlines of the tracer particles in the output module the pathlines graphic illustrate the water flow path of the added tracer particles the comparison between the calculated results and the measured results added to the conc observation well was visualized intuitively simulated pathlines of the particles started at the inlet the exported pathlines from vm are shown in fig 6 for the configurations of t b and b t the distribution of the tracer particle paths was uniform and the degree of dispersion of the water flow was large for the condition m m the middle part of the pathlines were sparse and the particle density at the edge of the particle paths pattern was high between inlet and outlet the larger aspect ratio enhanced the dispersion of water flow and effectively reduced short flow in accordance with the measured results the highest n value was determined for the middle inlet and middle outlet conditions the water flow was of the plug flow type the dispersion of the water flow was low and the effective utilization ratio of the wetland was also with increasing flow rate the passing area of the tracer particle group decreased this resulted in an increasing dead zone area with the increase of the flow rate the dispersion degree of the water flow decreased causing the short flow phenomenon to increase and the effective volume ratio to decrease 4 conclusions in this study a non opaque pvc glass reactor was created for a subsurface flow as a quasi 2d flow constructed wetland for hydraulic performance investigation influences of flow rates and inlet outlet configurations were analyzed using a nacl tracer test the results indicate that both the flow rates and inlet outlet configurations had significant impacts on hydraulic performance the flow rates had obvious impacts on the rtd curve the shape of the rtd curve affects the value of σ2 and the peak time affects the value of tm the flow rates obviously influenced on the hydraulic efficiency of the constructed wetland it was necessary to determine the maximum hydraulic efficiency λ within a suitable range of the flow rates for the same flow rate inlet outlet configurations had direct impacts on these hydraulic characteristic parameters different inlet outlet configurations changed the direction of the flow the degree of dispersion of the flow and the velocity of the flow along the flow path under the same inlet outlet configuration s values and n values became high with an increase of the flow rate but the e value was low the comparison between the concentration fields is sufficient to prove that vm could well simulate the actual solute transport process in cws although there are differences between simulation and measurement the method of setting up simulated models using vm is feasible to simulate the hydrodynamic conditions of cws acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science

et al 2007 found that mutants of arabidopsis that grow at high salt concentrations and light intensities are nearly 10 times more tolerant to paraquat than wild type variants these conditions are common in extreme environments moirangthem et al 2014 based on these observations we propose that microorganisms isolated from hot springs such as thermophilic cyanobacteria could be tolerant to agrochemicals and provide a suitable strategy for biorremediation of contaminated effluents in this study we evaluate the herbicide paraquat and bromacil biosorption capacity of the thermophilic strain leptolyngbya 7m isolated from a thermal spring near miravalles volcano in northern costa rica morales 2008 we also determined the tolerance of cyanobacterial cells to these compounds using flow cytometry analysis to our knowledge this is the first study to explore the application of thermal spring cyanobacteria in herbicide biorremediation 2 material and methods 2 1 culture conditions the biomass source for biosorption studies leptolyngbya 7m was obtained from the thermophilic culture collection of environmental microbiology area cibcm associated to museo ucr university of costa rica the cyanobacterial isolate 7m was identified as leptolyngbya accesion number ncbi ef545599 1 using a polyphasic approach morales 2008 the culture was grown in bg11 medium rippka et al 1979 ph 7 at a temperature of 25 c in 1 l or 2 l erlenmeyer flasks under continuous light 30 lx and air bubbling cells were centrifuged at 10 000 g washed three times with deionized and sterile water and dried at 60 c for 24 h the resulting dry biomass was ground in a mortar and stored in a desiccator until experimental use 2 2 biosorption studies solutions of paraquat or bromacil distributor colono agropecuario s a cartago costa rica was prepared by dissolving the commercial products 0 500 mg l in bg11 medium the concentration of paraquat was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and uv spectroscopy sannino et al 2008 bromacil concentration was calculated using uv spectroscopy only linde et al 1996 five milligrams of cyanobacteria biomass were placed in 15 ml tubes and paraquat or bromacil were added at a range of concentrations from 0 0 to 285 7 mg l and 0 0 to 500 0 mg l respectively incubations were conducted at ph 7 for 5 days with continuous agitation 120 rpm after incubation solutions were centrifuged at 11 000 g and suspensions were filtered 0 45 μm filter the remaining aqueous phase was stored at 4 c cyanobacteria biomass was used for flow cytometric analysis theoretical models of langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were evaluated using r version 3 4 3 r core team 2018 and the goodness of fit was evaluated using the determination coefficient of the linearized model all measurements were performed in triplicate 2 3 flow cytometric analysis flow cytometry analysis was performed with a bd facscalibur flow cytometer we evaluated cell chlorophyll content and esterase activity as cell viability markers based on hadjoudja et al 2009 these variables were determined after a 5 days incubation of cells with paraquat or bromacil solutions at room temperature before each measurement cyanobacteria were filtered through a 40 μm filter and fluorescein diacetate fda 1 20 ul was added gating on a forward scatter fsc vs side scatter ssc dot plot was used to exclude debris fluorochromes were excited using an argon laser 488 nm red fluorescence by chlorophyll was collected with a 610 nm long band pass filter fl3 and green fluorescence by fluorescein derived from fda was collected with a 530 nm band pass filter fl1 for each sample at least 100 000 cells were counted data were displayed as one dimensional fl1 or fl3 histograms and positive events were defined in comparison to the untreated cell control 3 results and discussion 3 1 paraquat and bromacil biosorption both langmuir and freundlich models were able to describe the adsorption isotherm data for the adsorption of paraquat and bromacil onto cyanobacteria cultures however the langmuir model provides the best fit for the data table 1 the curves obtained from the paraquat and bromacil interaction with leptolyngbya 7m are shown in fig 1 both datasets presented a good fit r2 0 97 to the langmuir model table 1 the maximum biosorption capacity estimated by this model was 24 4 0 3 0 26 mmol g and 66 8 0 9 mg 0 09 mmol g for paraquat and bromacil respectively as shown in table 1 leptolyngbya 7m capacity qmax to remove paraquat was higher than reported for the filamentous cyanobacteria oscillatoria 0 3 mg g kumar et al 2010 and polyacrylamide hydrogels 14 3 mg g aouada et al 2009 conversely the removal capacity of leptolyngbya biomass adsorption for paraquat was below the sorption capacity of some inorganic or inert sorbents such as ashes 30 mg g igwe et al 2012 charcoal 116 mg g lerdsirivichai 2011 microporous materials rongchapo et al 2013 and nanosorbents 257 mg g fernandes et al 2017 it is important to point out that only inert materials possess a remotion capacity superior to the 7m isolate to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports on the use of cyanobaceria or other microorganisms in bromacil biorremediation mardini and legube 2009 report on the adsorption capacity and kinetics of this pesticide on powdered activated carbon with qmax values between 170 mg g and 190 mg g on the other hand ayranci and hoda 2004 studied bromacil adsorption from aqueous solution on high surface carbon cloth according to dotto et al 2012 binding sites for cations on biomass are more accessible above neutral ph 7 5 8 5 when the negative charge on the surface of cyanobacterial biomass increases vijayaraghavan et al 2018 cyanobacteria surface possesses anionic groups such as the carboxylic groups of uronic acids and pyruvate as well as phosphoryl sulfate and sulfonate moieties de philippis et al 2011 kamennaya et al 2018 these groups can interact with the positively charged herbicide permitting the adsorption on the negative charged cell wall in previous studies of paraquat and glyphosate adsorption to boiler fly ash bfa a freundlich fit was reported to more accurately describe the interaction than the langmuir model igwe et al 2012 the bromacil interaction with powdered activated carbon was found by mardini and legube 2009 as better described by a langmuir isotherm mardini and legube 2009 in our case we found that the langmuir model provided a moderately better fit for both herbicides the langmuir adsorption model assumes that maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of solute molecules on the adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 özacar and şengil 2005 wajda et al 2017 and all binding sites are identical these results suggest that the main mechanism responsible for herbicide recovery was an electrostatic interaction with homogeneous distribution of herbicide binding sites on the biomass surface kumar et al 2010 3 2 cyanobacteria tolerance to paraquat and bromacil we evaluated the effect of paraquat and bromacil on the viability of the thermophilic cyanobacteria strain 7m chlorophyll fluorescence and esterase activity were determined by flow cytometry after a 96 h incubation with increasing concentrations of paraquat or bromacil using chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator we observed a dose dependent effect of paraquat on viability indeed the lowest paraquat concentration that we tested 28 mg l reduced cell viability a 10 compared to untreated cells fig 2a however the amount of paraquat required to reduce 50 of the cyanobacterial fluorescence was 285 mg l a similar trend was observed when esterase activity was used as a viability marker in the case of bromacil fig 2b chlorophyll fluorescence of cyanobacterial cells did not show significant differences among treatments f 1 02 in addition we did not observe filament fragmentation and cell lysis of strains exposed to paraquat and bromacil fig 2a b fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis is a measure of total microbial esterase activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 according to our results the cell viability measured using fluorescein diacetate decreased with increasing paraquat concentrations no significant effect was observed for bromacil there are few reports on the use of this marker to study cell activity on cyanobacteria li et al 2011 submitted microcystis aeruginosa to several stress conditions p and n deficiency darkness and low temperature fda is an alternative method for the determination of cell viability the use of this marker requires low biomass and the fact that analyses are based on the observation of a high number of cells make this method very convenient for viability determinations cell viability is one of the most important indicators for assessing cell health photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence have been widely used in the past as a measure of biomass schulze et al 2011 tebbs et al 2013 since herbicides have a direct effect on photosynthesis as inhibitors of photosystem i or ii chlorophyll fluorescence has become a useful marker of cellular damage by herbicides in plants and cyanobacteria wu et al 2016 martínez and martínez 2018 a disadvantage of this marker is that the measures obtained are affected by cellular stress lu and vonshak 2002 dhankhar and rana 2016 hamed et al 2017 according to our results chlorophyll fluorescence was not affected by increasing bromacil concentrations suggesting this substance does not have an effect on chlorophyll content however after incubation with a high paraquat concentration above 250 mg l a decrease in chlorophyll a content became apparent similar results were observed with fda two previous studies report a remarkable tolerance to paraquat of the cyanobacteria nostoc punctiforme atcc 29133 and synechocystis sp pcc6803 for which a low toxicity was observed at millimolar concentration forlani et al 2008 prosecka et al 2009 the cyanobacteria 7m strain used in this study is a suitable biological option for biorremediation because the amount of paraquat required to reduce cyanobacterial viability was higher than the reported concentrations in aquatic environments from costa rica sfe 2016 leptolyngbya and other strains of this genus are particularly abundant in phototrophic biofilms dobretsov and thomason 2011 urbieta et al 2015 uribe lorío et al 2019 they are characterized by the presence of an envelope composed of a mucilaginous sheath on its extracellular surface which generally contains uv absorbing pigments osmo protecting sugars and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase bharti et al 2017 the mucilaginous sheath of cyanobacteria could play an important role as a barrier against pesticides herbicides and metals de philippis et al 2011 bharti et al 2017 thapa et al 2017 moreover under unfavorable conditions cyanobacteria cells can excrete exopolysaccharides into the surrounding as protection against harmful substances desiccation chemicals and nutrient deficiency singh et al 2016 singh et al 2019 4 conclusions thermophilic strains have been widely studied around the world however this study is the first reported for an isolate from a thermal spring in costa rica and it serve as model for future investigations based on the results of this work we propose leptolyngbya 7m as a suitable biological option for developing low cost bioremediation strategies and for detoxification of herbicides in agricultural fields this strain possesses particular characteristics that make it capable to remove herbicides has simple growth requirements as well as high tolerance to herbicides and versatile metabolic capabilities acknowledgements this

contaminated effluents bioremediation using cyanobacteria provides a strategy to remove contaminants from the environment núñez 2012 safi et al 2014 idi et al 2015 patel et al 2019 the advantages of these microorganisms are determined by their rate of reproduction surface to volume cell ratio morphology and cell size their survival in aquatic environments as well as their capacity to interact with inorganic and organic pollutants cepoi et al 2016 previous studies show that cyanobacteria have a high tolerance to various pesticides and herbicides and can metabolize these substances safi et al 2014 kumar and singh 2017 key points for the use of these organisms in bioremediation are maintaining cell viability over a long period of time and production of sufficient biomass flow cytometry has been successfully applied to study the effect of pollutants on cell viability of microalgae and cyanobacteria franqueira et al 1999 hadjoudja et al 2009 nam et al 2018 common viability markers are chlorophyll and esterase activity chlorophyll is an endogenous marker of cell viability zhang et al 2011 kabra et al 2014 kurade et al 2016 and esterase activity present only in live cells can be used to generate fluorescent compounds flow cytometry allows the measurement of biological responses in individual cells and the quantitation of thousands of cells per sample hadjoudja et al 2009 lascano et al 2007 found that mutants of arabidopsis that grow at high salt concentrations and light intensities are nearly 10 times more tolerant to paraquat than wild type variants these conditions are common in extreme environments moirangthem et al 2014 based on these observations we propose that microorganisms isolated from hot springs such as thermophilic cyanobacteria could be tolerant to agrochemicals and provide a suitable strategy for biorremediation of contaminated effluents in this study we evaluate the herbicide paraquat and bromacil biosorption capacity of the thermophilic strain leptolyngbya 7m isolated from a thermal spring near miravalles volcano in northern costa rica morales 2008 we also determined the tolerance of cyanobacterial cells to these compounds using flow cytometry analysis to our knowledge this is the first study to explore the application of thermal spring cyanobacteria in herbicide biorremediation 2 material and methods 2 1 culture conditions the biomass source for biosorption studies leptolyngbya 7m was obtained from the thermophilic culture collection of environmental microbiology area cibcm associated to museo ucr university of costa rica the cyanobacterial isolate 7m was identified as leptolyngbya accesion number ncbi ef545599 1 using a polyphasic approach morales 2008 the culture was grown in bg11 medium rippka et al 1979 ph 7 at a temperature of 25 c in 1 l or 2 l erlenmeyer flasks under continuous light 30 lx and air bubbling cells were centrifuged at 10 000 g washed three times with deionized and sterile water and dried at 60 c for 24 h the resulting dry biomass was ground in a mortar and stored in a desiccator until experimental use 2 2 biosorption studies solutions of paraquat or bromacil distributor colono agropecuario s a cartago costa rica was prepared by dissolving the commercial products 0 500 mg l in bg11 medium the concentration of paraquat was determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc and uv spectroscopy sannino et al 2008 bromacil concentration was calculated using uv spectroscopy only linde et al 1996 five milligrams of cyanobacteria biomass were placed in 15 ml tubes and paraquat or bromacil were added at a range of concentrations from 0 0 to 285 7 mg l and 0 0 to 500 0 mg l respectively incubations were conducted at ph 7 for 5 days with continuous agitation 120 rpm after incubation solutions were centrifuged at 11 000 g and suspensions were filtered 0 45 μm filter the remaining aqueous phase was stored at 4 c cyanobacteria biomass was used for flow cytometric analysis theoretical models of langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms were evaluated using r version 3 4 3 r core team 2018 and the goodness of fit was evaluated using the determination coefficient of the linearized model all measurements were performed in triplicate 2 3 flow cytometric analysis flow cytometry analysis was performed with a bd facscalibur flow cytometer we evaluated cell chlorophyll content and esterase activity as cell viability markers based on hadjoudja et al 2009 these variables were determined after a 5 days incubation of cells with paraquat or bromacil solutions at room temperature before each measurement cyanobacteria were filtered through a 40 μm filter and fluorescein diacetate fda 1 20 ul was added gating on a forward scatter fsc vs side scatter ssc dot plot was used to exclude debris fluorochromes were excited using an argon laser 488 nm red fluorescence by chlorophyll was collected with a 610 nm long band pass filter fl3 and green fluorescence by fluorescein derived from fda was collected with a 530 nm band pass filter fl1 for each sample at least 100 000 cells were counted data were displayed as one dimensional fl1 or fl3 histograms and positive events were defined in comparison to the untreated cell control 3 results and discussion 3 1 paraquat and bromacil biosorption both langmuir and freundlich models were able to describe the adsorption isotherm data for the adsorption of paraquat and bromacil onto cyanobacteria cultures however the langmuir model provides the best fit for the data table 1 the curves obtained from the paraquat and bromacil interaction with leptolyngbya 7m are shown in fig 1 both datasets presented a good fit r2 0 97 to the langmuir model table 1 the maximum biosorption capacity estimated by this model was 24 4 0 3 0 26 mmol g and 66 8 0 9 mg 0 09 mmol g for paraquat and bromacil respectively as shown in table 1 leptolyngbya 7m capacity qmax to remove paraquat was higher than reported for the filamentous cyanobacteria oscillatoria 0 3 mg g kumar et al 2010 and polyacrylamide hydrogels 14 3 mg g aouada et al 2009 conversely the removal capacity of leptolyngbya biomass adsorption for paraquat was below the sorption capacity of some inorganic or inert sorbents such as ashes 30 mg g igwe et al 2012 charcoal 116 mg g lerdsirivichai 2011 microporous materials rongchapo et al 2013 and nanosorbents 257 mg g fernandes et al 2017 it is important to point out that only inert materials possess a remotion capacity superior to the 7m isolate to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports on the use of cyanobaceria or other microorganisms in bromacil biorremediation mardini and legube 2009 report on the adsorption capacity and kinetics of this pesticide on powdered activated carbon with qmax values between 170 mg g and 190 mg g on the other hand ayranci and hoda 2004 studied bromacil adsorption from aqueous solution on high surface carbon cloth according to dotto et al 2012 binding sites for cations on biomass are more accessible above neutral ph 7 5 8 5 when the negative charge on the surface of cyanobacterial biomass increases vijayaraghavan et al 2018 cyanobacteria surface possesses anionic groups such as the carboxylic groups of uronic acids and pyruvate as well as phosphoryl sulfate and sulfonate moieties de philippis et al 2011 kamennaya et al 2018 these groups can interact with the positively charged herbicide permitting the adsorption on the negative charged cell wall in previous studies of paraquat and glyphosate adsorption to boiler fly ash bfa a freundlich fit was reported to more accurately describe the interaction than the langmuir model igwe et al 2012 the bromacil interaction with powdered activated carbon was found by mardini and legube 2009 as better described by a langmuir isotherm mardini and legube 2009 in our case we found that the langmuir model provided a moderately better fit for both herbicides the langmuir adsorption model assumes that maximum adsorption corresponds to a saturated monolayer of solute molecules on the adsorbent surface langmuir 1918 özacar and şengil 2005 wajda et al 2017 and all binding sites are identical these results suggest that the main mechanism responsible for herbicide recovery was an electrostatic interaction with homogeneous distribution of herbicide binding sites on the biomass surface kumar et al 2010 3 2 cyanobacteria tolerance to paraquat and bromacil we evaluated the effect of paraquat and bromacil on the viability of the thermophilic cyanobacteria strain 7m chlorophyll fluorescence and esterase activity were determined by flow cytometry after a 96 h incubation with increasing concentrations of paraquat or bromacil using chlorophyll fluorescence as an indicator we observed a dose dependent effect of paraquat on viability indeed the lowest paraquat concentration that we tested 28 mg l reduced cell viability a 10 compared to untreated cells fig 2a however the amount of paraquat required to reduce 50 of the cyanobacterial fluorescence was 285 mg l a similar trend was observed when esterase activity was used as a viability marker in the case of bromacil fig 2b chlorophyll fluorescence of cyanobacterial cells did not show significant differences among treatments f 1 02 in addition we did not observe filament fragmentation and cell lysis of strains exposed to paraquat and bromacil fig 2a b fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis is a measure of total microbial esterase activity schnürer and rosswall 1982 according to our results the cell viability measured using fluorescein diacetate decreased with increasing paraquat concentrations no significant effect was observed for bromacil there are few reports on the use of this marker to study cell activity on cyanobacteria li et al 2011 submitted microcystis aeruginosa to several stress conditions p and n deficiency darkness and low temperature fda is an alternative method for the determination of cell viability the use of this marker requires low biomass and the fact that analyses are based on the observation of a high number of cells make this method very convenient for viability determinations cell viability is one of the most important indicators for assessing cell health photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence have been widely used in the past as a measure of biomass schulze et al 2011 tebbs et al 2013 since herbicides have a direct effect on photosynthesis as inhibitors of photosystem i or ii chlorophyll fluorescence has become a useful marker of cellular damage by herbicides in plants and cyanobacteria wu et al 2016 martínez and martínez 2018 a disadvantage of this marker is that the measures obtained are affected by cellular stress lu and vonshak 2002 dhankhar and rana 2016 hamed et al 2017 according to our results chlorophyll fluorescence was not affected by increasing bromacil concentrations suggesting this substance does not have an effect on chlorophyll content however after incubation with a high paraquat concentration above 250 mg l a decrease in chlorophyll a content became apparent similar results were observed with fda two previous studies report a remarkable tolerance to paraquat of the cyanobacteria nostoc punctiforme atcc 29133 and synechocystis sp pcc6803 for which a low toxicity was observed at millimolar concentration forlani et al 2008 prosecka et al 2009 the cyanobacteria 7m strain used in this study is a suitable biological option for biorremediation because the amount of paraquat required to reduce cyanobacterial viability was higher than the reported concentrations in aquatic environments from costa rica sfe 2016 leptolyngbya and other strains of this genus are particularly abundant in phototrophic biofilms dobretsov and thomason 2011 urbieta et al 2015 uribe lorío et al 2019 they are characterized by the presence of an envelope composed of a mucilaginous sheath on its extracellular surface which generally contains uv absorbing pigments osmo protecting sugars and enzymes such as superoxide dismutase bharti et al 2017 the mucilaginous sheath of cyanobacteria could play an important role as a barrier against pesticides herbicides and metals de philippis et al 2011 bharti et al 2017 thapa et al 2017 moreover under unfavorable conditions cyanobacteria cells can excrete exopolysaccharides into the surrounding as protection against harmful substances desiccation chemicals and nutrient deficiency singh et al 2016 singh et al 2019 4 conclusions thermophilic strains have been widely studied around the world however this study is the first reported for an isolate from a thermal spring in costa rica and it serve as model for future investigations based on the results of this work we propose leptolyngbya 7m as a suitable biological option for developing low cost bioremediation strategies and for detoxification of herbicides in agricultural fields this strain possesses particular characteristics that make it capable to remove herbicides has simple growth requirements as well as high tolerance to herbicides and versatile metabolic capabilities acknowledgements this

1567,treatability tests can be carried out to assess the potential effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies under different site conditions and are important for specific technology selection and design in order to reduce the costs for laboratory tests and expand the insights from previous treatability studies a one dimensional 1d radial finite difference model was developed to simulate the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs in laboratory thermal treatability tests the processes considered in the model include heat conduction co boiling of single component or multi component napls with water and water boiling an explicit approach is used to simulate the evolution of napl composition for multi component napls during heating the developed model adopts only two fitting parameters and was calibrated and validated using previous laboratory experiments in this paper the developed model was first calibrated to three laboratory experiments using temperature measurements which resulted in matches to the napl and gas saturations after calibration the model was able to predict the temperature napl and gas saturations for the remaining seven experiments including those with single and multi component napls using the average value of each fitting parameter 1 introduction thermal treatment technologies can be deployed to address non aqueous phase liquids napls such as chlorinated solvents and petroleum products in unsaturated and saturated soils thermal treatment technologies include in situ thermal treatment istt and ex situ thermal desorption estd for istt applications thermal conductive heating tch electrical resistance heating erh and steam enhanced extraction see can be used and are selected individually or in combination based on the site geology hydrogeology chemical properties and remediation goals both tch and erh are suitable for low to moderate permeability sites tch can be used both above and below the water table and is able to achieve temperatures greater than 500 c if necessary stegemeier and vinegar 2001 erh requires sufficient water saturation to allow electrical current to flow and typically is limited to reaching temperatures of 120 c depending on depth of application epa 2014 because it is constrained by the boiling point of water which is pressure dependent thus erh is usually more suitable to treat volatile organic compounds vocs than semi volatile organic compounds svocs see is most suitable for less heterogeneous sites with relatively high permeability allowing for better distribution of injected steam similarly according to the heating temperature estd technologies can be categorized as low temperature 100 350 c or high temperature 350 600 c thermal desorption and thermal destruction 600 1000 c falciglia et al 2011a laboratory treatability tests can be used to assess the potential effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for various contaminants under varying conditions falciglia et al 2011a 2011b investigated thermal desorption in various soils and reported that clay required higher treatment temperature than silt and sand tatàno et al 2013 observed a removal efficiency greater than 99 4 by thermal desorption for diesel fuels in treatability tests at temperatures of 300 390 c park et al 2005 performed a pilot test of thermally enhanced soil vapor extraction sve using the parameters collected from laboratory treatability tests tzovolou et al 2011 investigated the effectiveness of steam injection under low permeability conditions and suggested that steam flow could alter the pore structure and form gas pathways which could enhance steam distillation and stripping for napl source zones removing napl is the key to reducing contaminant mass discharge falta et al 2005 suchomel and pennell 2006 wood et al 2005 with the goal of reaching site closure criteria kingston et al 2014 when using thermal treatment technologies to treat napl source zones phase change during heating is essential for mass removal in the presence of water the boiling point of a napl and water mixture is lower than the boiling point of either the napl or water this lower temperature is referred to as the co boiling point burghardt and kueper 2008 showed that the length of the co boiling plateau during which input energy is used for phase change rather than to increase temperature was positively correlated with the initial napl saturation zhao et al 2014 suggested that the end of co boiling plateaus observed at the measuring point might not indicate the complete depletion of napl in the system atteia et al 2017 observed a higher mass removal rate for thermal treatment than for persulfate oxidation surfactant flushing and air sparging technologies in three dimensional 3d laboratory experiments and highlighted the importance of co boiling for contaminant removal jousse et al 2017 found that the low vapor pressure components in a multi component napl could not be sufficiently removed at 80 c in addition for semi volatile napls laboratory study showed that only limited reduction of napl saturation could be achieved through co boiling hicknell et al 2018 despite the usefulness of treatability tests for technology selection and design it can be impractical or costly to address all possible scenarios e g contaminant type temperature range napl saturation moisture content and soil type using experimental approaches numerical models can provide a framework that allows a limited number of treatability test results to inform additional scenarios via calibration by incorporating dominant processes and output that can be matched to a smaller treatability test data set this will serve to reduce the number of treatability tests required for a particular site as well as the associated costs by building on previous studies it would also allow cost effective investigation of multiple scenarios to help guide design decisions various numerical models have been developed to simulate laboratory scale thermal desorption from soil falciglia et al 2011a keyes and silcox 1994 lighty et al 1990 tse and lo 2002 for simulating the removal of aqueous phase vocs krol et al 2011 developed a model to study the impact of temperature dependent properties during erh applications and emphasized the importance of changes to water flow at higher temperature in addition chen et al 2012 reproduced their experimental results using the tmvoc model and suggested that removing 50 of the pore water could achieve approximately 100 mass removal for dissolved phase vocs from a rock core the tmvoc model was also used to simulate napl removal and displacement by steam injection pruess and battistelli 2002 however the aforementioned models are either unable to simulate the napl water co boiling or costly to implement for estimating voc removal from napl impacted soil during thermal treatability tests therefore there is a need for an efficient numerical model to assist in evaluating and simulating laboratory treatability testing being able to efficiently simulate thermal treatment of napl impacted soil at the laboratory scale can help to assess the target temperature required heating duration and temporal changes in napl saturation and gas phase composition during treatment the objectives of this study are to 1 provide an efficient model that can predict temperature fluid saturations and napl composition during thermal treatability tests and 2 calibrate and validate the developed model using laboratory data this model was developed by simulating heat transfer within a cylinder under no flow conditions and incorporating phase change of both single component and multi component napls and water the developed model was calibrated and validated using data collected by zhao et al 2014 2 modeling approach the simulation domain of the model represents a cylinder that contains known masses of napl water and soil the cylinder is heated from the outside surface for example by placing the cylinder in an oven set to a constant temperature a one dimensional 1d finite difference approach was used to simulate radial heat conduction in the cylinder with insulated top and bottom surfaces the model was developed based on the four heating stages identified by burghardt and kueper 2008 and zhao et al 2014 1 napl water heating 2 napl water co boiling 3 water heating and 4 water boiling phase change is incorporated in stages 2 and 4 the model is focused on simulating the removal of napl and therefore neglects the aqueous and sorbed phase vocs nevertheless after the napl phase is depleted vocs in the aqueous and sorbed phases may dictate the achievement of regulatory standards at this point mass transfer and the decomposition of vocs e g hydrolysis can play important roles in reducing soil concentrations therefore follow on experimental and numerical work will address the aqueous and sorbed phase vocs as well as the decomposition of vocs during heating in addition the model assumes that vapors are recovered instantaneously and that there is no movement of water and napl in the cylinder for single component napl both implicit and explicit numerical approaches can be used to solve the heat conduction equation for multi component napl an explicit approach is presented 2 1 model development a volumetric average approach is used to calculate the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture based on lauriat and ghafir 2000 1 ρc p e s w ϕ ρ w c p w i 1 n s i ϕ ρ i c p i 1 ϕ ρ s c p s where ρc p e is the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture s w and s i are the saturation of water and napl component i respectively ϕ is the porosity c p w c p i and c p s are the specific heat capacity of water napl component i and soil grains respectively ρ w ρ i and ρ s are the density of water napl component i and soil grains respectively and n is the total number of napl components eq 1 is a modified form of that presented by lauriat and ghafir 2000 in that it incorporates the individual napl component density and specific heat capacity the heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates is crank 1979 2 ρ c p e t t 1 r r rλ t r q where t is the temperature t is the time r is the radial coordinate λ is the thermal conductivity and q is the heat sink associated with phase change the cylinder is discretized into multiple radial shells fig 1 in order to avoid the coordinate singularity at r 0 the local temperature of shell j t j is evaluated at 3 r j 2 j 1 r 2 j 1 2 m where j is the index of the shell r is the radial increment and m is the total number of shells a no flux boundary condition neumann condition is located at the centerline of the cylinder r 0 4 t r r 0 0 and a convective boundary condition robin condition is located at the surface of the cylinder r r 5 λ t r r r h t r r t where r is the radius of the cylinder h is the convective heat transfer coefficient t is the temperature of the surrounding fluid air in the oven and t r r is the temperature at the surface of the cylinder which can be estimated using t r r t m t m 1 2 the thickness of the cylinder wall is neglected and assumed to have no influence on heat transfer the co boiling of a napl water mixture occurs when the sum of the partial pressures of the components is equal to the ambient pressure 6 p w v p n v p w p d where p w v and p n v are the vapor pressures of water and napl respectively p w is the water pressure including the atmospheric pressure and p d is the displacement pressure used here as a representative capillary pressure during gas formation and expansion for a mixture of multi component napl and water the vapor pressure of the napl can be estimated using raoult s law assuming ideal behavior of the napl mixture 7 p n v i 1 n x i p i v where x i is the mole fraction of component i in the napl and p i v is the vapor pressure of pure component i the vapor pressure of each compound is dependent on temperature and can be estimated using the antoine equation lide and kehiaian 1994 8 log p i v a i b i c i t where a i b i and c i are compound specific empirical constants the co boiling temperature of a napl water mixture can be calculated using eqs 6 8 for the co boiling of a single component napl and water a defined temperature plateau can be observed hence the sink term for phase change can be calculated by substituting t t 0 into eq 2 the moles of gas produced every time step in every shell can be calculated using the sink term for phase change the latent heat of each compound and dalton s law 9 n g w n g i p w v p i v where n g w and n g i are the moles of steam and the vapor of napl component i produced respectively for the co boiling of a multi component napl and water there is no defined co boiling plateau due to the preferential removal of the more volatile components mathematically the mole fraction of the gas produced during co boiling can be estimated by 10a y i x i p i v i 1 n x i p i v p w v 10b y w p w v i 1 n x i p i v p w v where y i is the mole fraction of napl component i in the gas phase and y w is the mole fraction of steam in the gas phase this relationship causes the mole fractions of less volatile components in the napl phase to increase which results in an increasing co boiling temperature over the course of the co boiling stage furthermore there exists a temperature gradient within the cylinder thus x i y i and y w are different in different shells hence the spatial variables x i y i and y w in shell j are denoted as x i j y i j and y w j respectively in addition the model assumes that in a small time interval t between time steps t l and t l 1 during the co boiling stage the mole fraction in the produced gas can be estimated using an explicit in time approach which can be denoted as y i j l meanwhile the model treats the moles of gas produced in shell j between these two time steps t l and t l 1 as the variable n j due to the assumption of no water and napl movement the mole fraction of napl in shell j remains the same until the temperature of the shell reaches its initial co boiling temperature which can be calculated using its initial napl composition for example if time t l is the time step when the temperature of shell j t j l reaches its initial co boiling temperature based on the use of an explicit time approach the mole fraction of napl in this shell at t l 1 can be expressed by 11 x i j l 1 n n i j l y i j l n j i 1 n n n i j l y i j l n j where n n i j l is the number of moles of component i in the napl phase in shell j at t l at t l 1 this new napl composition x i j l 1 i 1 2 n determines the co boiling temperature of the shell t j l 1 in addition t j l 1 can be written as a function of x i j l 1 i 1 2 n using eqs 6 8 then the sensible heat term on the left hand side of eq 2 can be expressed by 12 ρ c p e t t ρ c p e j l t j l 1 t j l t l 1 t l where ρc p e j l is the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture in shell j at t l note that t j l 1 is dependent on x i j l 1 i 1 2 n based on eqs 6 8 and x i j l 1 is dependent on δn j based on eq 11 therefore δn j is the unknown in this system of equations meanwhile the sink term associated with phase change can be expressed by 13 q j l w n j y w j l i 1 n l i n j y i j l v j t where v j is the volume of shell j l w is the latent heat of evaporation for water and l i is the latent heat of evaporation for napl component i an explicit approach is used here such that the first term on the right hand side of eq 2 can be calculated using the temperatures at t l finally δn j can be solved using eqs 2 12 and 13 the temperature moles of napl and moles of gas produced in this shell during the time step can be calculated using n j the local saturations of napl and water can be calculated accordingly effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture is then updated based on the saturations of napl and water in the shell meanwhile the produced gas is removed from the system and treated as recovered mass the removal and recovery of gas is assumed to be instantaneous because the produced gas is quickly transferred out of the cylinder due to the small scale of the experiments and therefore gas flow is not explicitly simulated however it is important to note that for the simulation of istt at larger scales heat transfer related to fluid movement e g condensation convection as well as fluid movement itself can affect mass recovery and should be accounted for 2 2 experiments for model validation two series of experiments a and b conducted by zhao et al 2014 were used to calibrate and validate the developed model series a used tetrachloroethene pce as a single component napl series b used a multi component napl composed of 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca pce and chlorobenzene cb in equal parts by volume each series included experiments starting with three different initial napl saturations approximately 5 20 and 40 which are referred to as a5 a20 a40 and b5 b20 b40 experiments a20 and b20 were performed in triplicate referred to as a20 1 a20 2 a20 3 and b20 1 b20 2 b20 3 hence 10 experiments in total are addressed in this paper for each of these experiments a homogeneous mixture of napl water and silica sand was packed in a 1000 ml 9 cm diameter cylinder the cylinder was heated by placing it in a convection oven at 128 c temperature measurements were made using one thermocouple inserted through the cylinder lid and located 25 mm from the center of the cylinder and recorded temperature data every 8 s all vapors were collected using a pipe inserted through the cell lid and were condensed and collected in a graduated cylinder the volume of condensate was used to determine the napl and water saturation in the cylinder throughout the experiment for series b samples of water and napl from the condensate were collected in 5 ml glass vials with no headspace during the co boiling stage and analyzed for voc concentrations for these experiments voc decomposition via hydrolysis was assumed to have negligible effect on napl removal if the heating rate were lower or reaction hydrolysis rates were higher decomposition would play a more important role in depleting the napl phase and reducing soil concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration most of the model parameters are based on the laboratory settings and the chemical properties of the napl components table 1 only two fitting parameters thermal conductivity λ and convective heat transfer coefficient h are required to capture the heat transfer characteristics of the experiments experiments a20 1 a20 2 and a20 3 were used to calibrate the model and determine these parameters average values of these parameters were then used to simulate experiments a5 a40 b5 b20 and b40 with no further calibration it is important to note that the goal of this model is to simulate the removal of napl phase vocs however since aqueous and sorbed vocs are not included in the model a small quantity of contaminant mass can still remain in the system after the napl phase contaminants are completely removed thermal conductivity λ dictates the heat conduction rate within the cylinder and the convective heat transfer coefficient h dictates the heat transfer rate from the oven to the cylinder thermal conductivity of a napl water soil mixture can be influenced by the water saturation napl saturation and temperature the relationship between napl saturation and the thermal conductivity of a napl water soil mixture has not been well studied for water soil mixtures smits et al 2013 suggested that the thermal conductivity of the mixture was a function of both water saturation and temperature they showed that the thermal conductivity increased significantly from low to intermediate water saturations at high water saturations however the thermal conductivity was not a strong function of water saturation and temperature in this study a sensitivity test was performed to compare the simulations using a constant thermal conductivity and a saturation dependent thermal conductivity proposed by johansen 1975 the sensitivity test showed minimum influence of saturation dependent thermal conductivity as the water saturations were maintained relatively high therefore the thermal conductivity of the mixture was treated as a constant in the model in addition the convective heat transfer coefficient was also treated as a constant variable during heating these two parameters are determined by fitting the simulated temperature to the experimental temperature prior to water boiling using the temperature of the shell located 25 mm from the center of the cylinder the thermocouple location the combinations of λ and h that generated the best fit highest r squared to the temperature profiles are presented in table 2 for these experiments each fitting parameter has a relatively low variance and is consistent with values reported in the literature carson et al 2006 hamdhan and clarke 2010 simulated and measured temperature napl saturation and gas saturation for the a20 experiments are presented in fig 2 the simulated temperature agrees very well with the measured temperature some upward fluctuations of the measured temperature occurred during the co boiling stage and were not captured by the model these temperature fluctuations are possibly related to the pressurization effect caused by the development of gas pathways which can elevate the co boiling temperature disturbance due to gas movement in the cylinder and the superheating of vapors can also contribute to this effect by fitting the temperature the model can also match the napl and gas saturations during heating the simulated data support the conclusion of zhao et al 2014 that the observed end of the apparent co boiling plateau cannot indicate the complete removal of napl this suggests that even in a lab scale cylinder global napl removal depends on heat transfer and may not be directly linked to local temperature measurements at the beginning of the co boiling stage simulated napl saturation shows an earlier decrease compared to the measured saturation this delay may be due to the time required to form connected gas pathways hegele and mumford 2014 jousse et al 2017 or to a lag between voc removal and napl recovery as condensate during the co boiling stage simulated data show slightly lower napl removal rate gas production rate than the measured data in addition the model underestimates the slope of the gas saturation after 1 7 h indicating that the model underestimates the steam production rate during the water boiling stage this is likely due to neglecting the redistribution of water during heating by assuming no flow conditions in the experiments boiling or co boiling occurs towards the edge of the cylinder first as it is heated by the oven gas production and removal from the edge would promote water flow from the center cooler to the edge warmer this effect is relatively insignificant during the co boiling stage since the pressure gradient water and napl generated by co boiling is lower however is likely important during water boiling despite the discrepancy observed at the water boiling stage overall good agreement was found between simulated and measured saturation until napl is completely removed 3 2 predictive simulations for single component napl the average fitting parameters determined from matching the a20 experiments table 2 were used to predict the remaining single component experiments using their corresponding initial conditions predictive simulations for experiments a5 and a40 are presented in fig 3 the model predicted the temperature throughout heating including the length of the co boiling plateau based on different initial napl saturations for experiment a5 the measured co boiling temperature is slightly higher than the predicted one this may be due to the low initial napl saturation and consequently lower napl water interfacial area as a result the thermocouple would have been mostly in contact with water that can have a higher temperature than the napl water interface during co boiling in addition during the water heating stage the predicted temperature for experiment a40 is slightly lower than the measured temperature at approximately 2 2 h smits et al 2013 demonstrated that the effective thermal conductivity of intermediately saturated soil at higher temperature 70 c can be nearly twice as high as that at lower temperature 30 c suggesting that the model may underestimate the heat transfer rate during the water heating stage when gas saturation is relatively high hence more distinct for experiment a40 by assuming a constant thermal conductivity in addition good agreement was found between the measured and predicted napl and gas saturation for experiment a5 the predicted napl saturation curve is in the range of measurement uncertainty however it is slightly shifted to the left compared to the measured data for experiment a40 the model slightly under predicts the gas production rate during the co boiling stage 3 3 predictive simulations for multi component napl predictive simulations for the multi component experiments are presented in figs 4 and 5 same as the a5 and a40 simulations these simulations used average parameter values determined from the a20 experiments and no additional calibration was performed during co boiling of a multi component napl there is no co boiling plateau but a co boiling region of gradually increasing temperature zhao et al 2014 this temperature behavior is correctly predicted by the model for experiments b5 b20 1 and b40 for experiments b20 2 and b20 3 the temperature predictions show the correct trend but are slightly lower than the temperature measured during the co boiling stage the sensitivity of measured temperature to the proximity of the thermocouple to napl has been reported previously martin and kueper 2011 zhao et al 2014 therefore non uniformly distributed napl in these experiments may have caused the under predictions of temperature in these simulations for experiment b40 the model under predicts the temperature during the water heating stage at approximately 2 1 h which may be due to the assumption of a constant thermal conductivity as described for experiment a40 in spite of the fact that there are some mismatches between the predicted and measured local temperature the predicted napl saturation shows agreement with the measured napl saturation demonstrating that the model is capable of predicting the global mass recovery of multi component napl the predicted gas saturation also matches the measured gas saturation until water boiling for series b three samples of condensate were collected during the co boiling stage each 5 ml condensate sample included water and napl voc concentrations in the napl were measured to determine their mole fractions in the napl condensate the mole fractions are plotted over time fig 6 based on the end time of the sampling for the triplicate experiments b20 b20 1 b20 2 and b20 3 the average value for the mole fraction of napl is shown in fig 6b the error bars represent the 95 confidence interval from the mean of the triplicate experiments the model was also used to predict the mole fraction in the napl for every 5 ml of condensate generated instantaneous napl removal rate calculated from the model was plotted on the secondary axis for comparison because of the delay by collecting the 5 ml samples approximately 0 06 to 0 07 h zhao 2013 the mole fraction in the napl condensate is not equivalent to the instantaneous mole fraction in the produced gas e g not enough condensate can be sampled at the first moment of co boiling therefore curves for mole fraction in the napl condensate shift later in time compared to the co boiling duration some of the measured points from experiment b5 are not well predicted by the model the pce mole fraction in this experiment shows an unexpected downward trend for the first two measured points which is not captured by the model however for experiments b20 and b40 good agreement can be found between the measured and predicted data for the last condensate sample collected in these two experiments the model tends to slightly under predict the mole fraction of cb and over predict the mole fraction of pce this is possibly related to the under prediction of napl removal rate by the model in general the model suggests that 1 2 dca has the highest mole fraction in the samples collected earlier in time due to its highest volatility among the three napl components as co boiling continues the mole fraction of 1 2 dca continuously declines until it reaches 0 the mole fraction of pce starts slightly higher than cb and then gradually increases and reaches its maximum value at approximately 40 however the pce mole fraction only falls rapidly to 0 in the last moment of the co boiling stage as the mole fraction of pce falls to zero the mole fraction of cb reaches 100 accordingly the model indicates that even in the late stage of co boiling the napl condensate is still composed of two major components approximately 60 cb and 40 pce on a molar basis relatively speaking the decrease and extinction of the most volatile component 1 2 dca are more indicative of the progress of mass removal under this experimental condition however heterogeneous napl distribution napl redistribution and asymmetrical heat transfer can also influence the napl condensate composition 4 summary and conclusions an efficient numerical model was developed to simulate laboratory scale treatability tests of single and multi component napl impacted soils the developed model incorporates heat conduction napl water co boiling and water boiling in a radial coordinate system and uses an explicit in time approach to simulate the vaporization of multi component napls during co boiling this model requires only two fitting parameters the thermal conductivity of the soil mixture and the convective heat transfer coefficient from the oven to the cylinder to simulate the temperature fluid saturations and mole fractions in the gas phase during heating an example is presented in which the model was calibrated to three single component experiments and used to predict the remaining seven single and multi component experiments although the model under predicts the gas production rate during water boiling overall good agreements were found between simulated data and experimental data for all 10 experiments prior to water boiling the model can be calibrated to relatively few tests and run in predictive mode to simulate treatability tests under different scenarios thereby reducing the costs for conducting laboratory tests in addition results suggest that heat transfer plays an important role in mass removal as it dictates the vaporization of napl which is the dominant mechanism for mass removal therefore good estimates of the heat transfer parameters can be useful for estimating the mass recovery these simulation results support previous conclusions that local temperature measurements cannot be directly linked to global mass removal the model also provides a tool to simulate the evolution of composition for multi component napls during heating which can help assess the temperature and heating duration to achieve the treatment goals for different components and evaluate the risks associated with some specific components during heating acknowledgements funding for

1567,treatability tests can be carried out to assess the potential effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies under different site conditions and are important for specific technology selection and design in order to reduce the costs for laboratory tests and expand the insights from previous treatability studies a one dimensional 1d radial finite difference model was developed to simulate the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs in laboratory thermal treatability tests the processes considered in the model include heat conduction co boiling of single component or multi component napls with water and water boiling an explicit approach is used to simulate the evolution of napl composition for multi component napls during heating the developed model adopts only two fitting parameters and was calibrated and validated using previous laboratory experiments in this paper the developed model was first calibrated to three laboratory experiments using temperature measurements which resulted in matches to the napl and gas saturations after calibration the model was able to predict the temperature napl and gas saturations for the remaining seven experiments including those with single and multi component napls using the average value of each fitting parameter 1 introduction thermal treatment technologies can be deployed to address non aqueous phase liquids napls such as chlorinated solvents and petroleum products in unsaturated and saturated soils thermal treatment technologies include in situ thermal treatment istt and ex situ thermal desorption estd for istt applications thermal conductive heating tch electrical resistance heating erh and steam enhanced extraction see can be used and are selected individually or in combination based on the site geology hydrogeology chemical properties and remediation goals both tch and erh are suitable for low to moderate permeability sites tch can be used both above and below the water table and is able to achieve temperatures greater than 500 c if necessary stegemeier and vinegar 2001 erh requires sufficient water saturation to allow electrical current to flow and typically is limited to reaching temperatures of 120 c depending on depth of application epa 2014 because it is constrained by the boiling point of water which is pressure dependent thus erh is usually more suitable to treat volatile organic compounds vocs than semi volatile organic compounds svocs see is most suitable for less heterogeneous sites with relatively high permeability allowing for better distribution of injected steam similarly according to the heating temperature estd technologies can be categorized as low temperature 100 350 c or high temperature 350 600 c thermal desorption and thermal destruction 600 1000 c falciglia et al 2011a laboratory treatability tests can be used to assess the potential effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for various contaminants under varying conditions falciglia et al 2011a 2011b investigated thermal desorption in various soils and reported that clay required higher treatment temperature than silt and sand tatàno et al 2013 observed a removal efficiency greater than 99 4 by thermal desorption for diesel fuels in treatability tests at temperatures of 300 390 c park et al 2005 performed a pilot test of thermally enhanced soil vapor extraction sve using the parameters collected from laboratory treatability tests tzovolou et al 2011 investigated the effectiveness of steam injection under low permeability conditions and suggested that steam flow could alter the pore structure and form gas pathways which could enhance steam distillation and stripping for napl source zones removing napl is the key to reducing contaminant mass discharge falta et al 2005 suchomel and pennell 2006 wood et al 2005 with the goal of reaching site closure criteria kingston et al 2014 when using thermal treatment technologies to treat napl source zones phase change during heating is essential for mass removal in the presence of water the boiling point of a napl and water mixture is lower than the boiling point of either the napl or water this lower temperature is referred to as the co boiling point burghardt and kueper 2008 showed that the length of the co boiling plateau during which input energy is used for phase change rather than to increase temperature was positively correlated with the initial napl saturation zhao et al 2014 suggested that the end of co boiling plateaus observed at the measuring point might not indicate the complete depletion of napl in the system atteia et al 2017 observed a higher mass removal rate for thermal treatment than for persulfate oxidation surfactant flushing and air sparging technologies in three dimensional 3d laboratory experiments and highlighted the importance of co boiling for contaminant removal jousse et al 2017 found that the low vapor pressure components in a multi component napl could not be sufficiently removed at 80 c in addition for semi volatile napls laboratory study showed that only limited reduction of napl saturation could be achieved through co boiling hicknell et al 2018 despite the usefulness of treatability tests for technology selection and design it can be impractical or costly to address all possible scenarios e g contaminant type temperature range napl saturation moisture content and soil type using experimental approaches numerical models can provide a framework that allows a limited number of treatability test results to inform additional scenarios via calibration by incorporating dominant processes and output that can be matched to a smaller treatability test data set this will serve to reduce the number of treatability tests required for a particular site as well as the associated costs by building on previous studies it would also allow cost effective investigation of multiple scenarios to help guide design decisions various numerical models have been developed to simulate laboratory scale thermal desorption from soil falciglia et al 2011a keyes and silcox 1994 lighty et al 1990 tse and lo 2002 for simulating the removal of aqueous phase vocs krol et al 2011 developed a model to study the impact of temperature dependent properties during erh applications and emphasized the importance of changes to water flow at higher temperature in addition chen et al 2012 reproduced their experimental results using the tmvoc model and suggested that removing 50 of the pore water could achieve approximately 100 mass removal for dissolved phase vocs from a rock core the tmvoc model was also used to simulate napl removal and displacement by steam injection pruess and battistelli 2002 however the aforementioned models are either unable to simulate the napl water co boiling or costly to implement for estimating voc removal from napl impacted soil during thermal treatability tests therefore there is a need for an efficient numerical model to assist in evaluating and simulating laboratory treatability testing being able to efficiently simulate thermal treatment of napl impacted soil at the laboratory scale can help to assess the target temperature required heating duration and temporal changes in napl saturation and gas phase composition during treatment the objectives of this study are to 1 provide an efficient model that can predict temperature fluid saturations and napl composition during thermal treatability tests and 2 calibrate and validate the developed model using laboratory data this model was developed by simulating heat transfer within a cylinder under no flow conditions and incorporating phase change of both single component and multi component napls and water the developed model was calibrated and validated using data collected by zhao et al 2014 2 modeling approach the simulation domain of the model represents a cylinder that contains known masses of napl water and soil the cylinder is heated from the outside surface for example by placing the cylinder in an oven set to a constant temperature a one dimensional 1d finite difference approach was used to simulate radial heat conduction in the cylinder with insulated top and bottom surfaces the model was developed based on the four heating stages identified by burghardt and kueper 2008 and zhao et al 2014 1 napl water heating 2 napl water co boiling 3 water heating and 4 water boiling phase change is incorporated in stages 2 and 4 the model is focused on simulating the removal of napl and therefore neglects the aqueous and sorbed phase vocs nevertheless after the napl phase is depleted vocs in the aqueous and sorbed phases may dictate the achievement of regulatory standards at this point mass transfer and the decomposition of vocs e g hydrolysis can play important roles in reducing soil concentrations therefore follow on experimental and numerical work will address the aqueous and sorbed phase vocs as well as the decomposition of vocs during heating in addition the model assumes that vapors are recovered instantaneously and that there is no movement of water and napl in the cylinder for single component napl both implicit and explicit numerical approaches can be used to solve the heat conduction equation for multi component napl an explicit approach is presented 2 1 model development a volumetric average approach is used to calculate the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture based on lauriat and ghafir 2000 1 ρc p e s w ϕ ρ w c p w i 1 n s i ϕ ρ i c p i 1 ϕ ρ s c p s where ρc p e is the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture s w and s i are the saturation of water and napl component i respectively ϕ is the porosity c p w c p i and c p s are the specific heat capacity of water napl component i and soil grains respectively ρ w ρ i and ρ s are the density of water napl component i and soil grains respectively and n is the total number of napl components eq 1 is a modified form of that presented by lauriat and ghafir 2000 in that it incorporates the individual napl component density and specific heat capacity the heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates is crank 1979 2 ρ c p e t t 1 r r rλ t r q where t is the temperature t is the time r is the radial coordinate λ is the thermal conductivity and q is the heat sink associated with phase change the cylinder is discretized into multiple radial shells fig 1 in order to avoid the coordinate singularity at r 0 the local temperature of shell j t j is evaluated at 3 r j 2 j 1 r 2 j 1 2 m where j is the index of the shell r is the radial increment and m is the total number of shells a no flux boundary condition neumann condition is located at the centerline of the cylinder r 0 4 t r r 0 0 and a convective boundary condition robin condition is located at the surface of the cylinder r r 5 λ t r r r h t r r t where r is the radius of the cylinder h is the convective heat transfer coefficient t is the temperature of the surrounding fluid air in the oven and t r r is the temperature at the surface of the cylinder which can be estimated using t r r t m t m 1 2 the thickness of the cylinder wall is neglected and assumed to have no influence on heat transfer the co boiling of a napl water mixture occurs when the sum of the partial pressures of the components is equal to the ambient pressure 6 p w v p n v p w p d where p w v and p n v are the vapor pressures of water and napl respectively p w is the water pressure including the atmospheric pressure and p d is the displacement pressure used here as a representative capillary pressure during gas formation and expansion for a mixture of multi component napl and water the vapor pressure of the napl can be estimated using raoult s law assuming ideal behavior of the napl mixture 7 p n v i 1 n x i p i v where x i is the mole fraction of component i in the napl and p i v is the vapor pressure of pure component i the vapor pressure of each compound is dependent on temperature and can be estimated using the antoine equation lide and kehiaian 1994 8 log p i v a i b i c i t where a i b i and c i are compound specific empirical constants the co boiling temperature of a napl water mixture can be calculated using eqs 6 8 for the co boiling of a single component napl and water a defined temperature plateau can be observed hence the sink term for phase change can be calculated by substituting t t 0 into eq 2 the moles of gas produced every time step in every shell can be calculated using the sink term for phase change the latent heat of each compound and dalton s law 9 n g w n g i p w v p i v where n g w and n g i are the moles of steam and the vapor of napl component i produced respectively for the co boiling of a multi component napl and water there is no defined co boiling plateau due to the preferential removal of the more volatile components mathematically the mole fraction of the gas produced during co boiling can be estimated by 10a y i x i p i v i 1 n x i p i v p w v 10b y w p w v i 1 n x i p i v p w v where y i is the mole fraction of napl component i in the gas phase and y w is the mole fraction of steam in the gas phase this relationship causes the mole fractions of less volatile components in the napl phase to increase which results in an increasing co boiling temperature over the course of the co boiling stage furthermore there exists a temperature gradient within the cylinder thus x i y i and y w are different in different shells hence the spatial variables x i y i and y w in shell j are denoted as x i j y i j and y w j respectively in addition the model assumes that in a small time interval t between time steps t l and t l 1 during the co boiling stage the mole fraction in the produced gas can be estimated using an explicit in time approach which can be denoted as y i j l meanwhile the model treats the moles of gas produced in shell j between these two time steps t l and t l 1 as the variable n j due to the assumption of no water and napl movement the mole fraction of napl in shell j remains the same until the temperature of the shell reaches its initial co boiling temperature which can be calculated using its initial napl composition for example if time t l is the time step when the temperature of shell j t j l reaches its initial co boiling temperature based on the use of an explicit time approach the mole fraction of napl in this shell at t l 1 can be expressed by 11 x i j l 1 n n i j l y i j l n j i 1 n n n i j l y i j l n j where n n i j l is the number of moles of component i in the napl phase in shell j at t l at t l 1 this new napl composition x i j l 1 i 1 2 n determines the co boiling temperature of the shell t j l 1 in addition t j l 1 can be written as a function of x i j l 1 i 1 2 n using eqs 6 8 then the sensible heat term on the left hand side of eq 2 can be expressed by 12 ρ c p e t t ρ c p e j l t j l 1 t j l t l 1 t l where ρc p e j l is the effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture in shell j at t l note that t j l 1 is dependent on x i j l 1 i 1 2 n based on eqs 6 8 and x i j l 1 is dependent on δn j based on eq 11 therefore δn j is the unknown in this system of equations meanwhile the sink term associated with phase change can be expressed by 13 q j l w n j y w j l i 1 n l i n j y i j l v j t where v j is the volume of shell j l w is the latent heat of evaporation for water and l i is the latent heat of evaporation for napl component i an explicit approach is used here such that the first term on the right hand side of eq 2 can be calculated using the temperatures at t l finally δn j can be solved using eqs 2 12 and 13 the temperature moles of napl and moles of gas produced in this shell during the time step can be calculated using n j the local saturations of napl and water can be calculated accordingly effective heat capacity of the napl water soil mixture is then updated based on the saturations of napl and water in the shell meanwhile the produced gas is removed from the system and treated as recovered mass the removal and recovery of gas is assumed to be instantaneous because the produced gas is quickly transferred out of the cylinder due to the small scale of the experiments and therefore gas flow is not explicitly simulated however it is important to note that for the simulation of istt at larger scales heat transfer related to fluid movement e g condensation convection as well as fluid movement itself can affect mass recovery and should be accounted for 2 2 experiments for model validation two series of experiments a and b conducted by zhao et al 2014 were used to calibrate and validate the developed model series a used tetrachloroethene pce as a single component napl series b used a multi component napl composed of 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca pce and chlorobenzene cb in equal parts by volume each series included experiments starting with three different initial napl saturations approximately 5 20 and 40 which are referred to as a5 a20 a40 and b5 b20 b40 experiments a20 and b20 were performed in triplicate referred to as a20 1 a20 2 a20 3 and b20 1 b20 2 b20 3 hence 10 experiments in total are addressed in this paper for each of these experiments a homogeneous mixture of napl water and silica sand was packed in a 1000 ml 9 cm diameter cylinder the cylinder was heated by placing it in a convection oven at 128 c temperature measurements were made using one thermocouple inserted through the cylinder lid and located 25 mm from the center of the cylinder and recorded temperature data every 8 s all vapors were collected using a pipe inserted through the cell lid and were condensed and collected in a graduated cylinder the volume of condensate was used to determine the napl and water saturation in the cylinder throughout the experiment for series b samples of water and napl from the condensate were collected in 5 ml glass vials with no headspace during the co boiling stage and analyzed for voc concentrations for these experiments voc decomposition via hydrolysis was assumed to have negligible effect on napl removal if the heating rate were lower or reaction hydrolysis rates were higher decomposition would play a more important role in depleting the napl phase and reducing soil concentrations 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration most of the model parameters are based on the laboratory settings and the chemical properties of the napl components table 1 only two fitting parameters thermal conductivity λ and convective heat transfer coefficient h are required to capture the heat transfer characteristics of the experiments experiments a20 1 a20 2 and a20 3 were used to calibrate the model and determine these parameters average values of these parameters were then used to simulate experiments a5 a40 b5 b20 and b40 with no further calibration it is important to note that the goal of this model is to simulate the removal of napl phase vocs however since aqueous and sorbed vocs are not included in the model a small quantity of contaminant mass can still remain in the system after the napl phase contaminants are completely removed thermal conductivity λ dictates the heat conduction rate within the cylinder and the convective heat transfer coefficient h dictates the heat transfer rate from the oven to the cylinder thermal conductivity of a napl water soil mixture can be influenced by the water saturation napl saturation and temperature the relationship between napl saturation and the thermal conductivity of a napl water soil mixture has not been well studied for water soil mixtures smits et al 2013 suggested that the thermal conductivity of the mixture was a function of both water saturation and temperature they showed that the thermal conductivity increased significantly from low to intermediate water saturations at high water saturations however the thermal conductivity was not a strong function of water saturation and temperature in this study a sensitivity test was performed to compare the simulations using a constant thermal conductivity and a saturation dependent thermal conductivity proposed by johansen 1975 the sensitivity test showed minimum influence of saturation dependent thermal conductivity as the water saturations were maintained relatively high therefore the thermal conductivity of the mixture was treated as a constant in the model in addition the convective heat transfer coefficient was also treated as a constant variable during heating these two parameters are determined by fitting the simulated temperature to the experimental temperature prior to water boiling using the temperature of the shell located 25 mm from the center of the cylinder the thermocouple location the combinations of λ and h that generated the best fit highest r squared to the temperature profiles are presented in table 2 for these experiments each fitting parameter has a relatively low variance and is consistent with values reported in the literature carson et al 2006 hamdhan and clarke 2010 simulated and measured temperature napl saturation and gas saturation for the a20 experiments are presented in fig 2 the simulated temperature agrees very well with the measured temperature some upward fluctuations of the measured temperature occurred during the co boiling stage and were not captured by the model these temperature fluctuations are possibly related to the pressurization effect caused by the development of gas pathways which can elevate the co boiling temperature disturbance due to gas movement in the cylinder and the superheating of vapors can also contribute to this effect by fitting the temperature the model can also match the napl and gas saturations during heating the simulated data support the conclusion of zhao et al 2014 that the observed end of the apparent co boiling plateau cannot indicate the complete removal of napl this suggests that even in a lab scale cylinder global napl removal depends on heat transfer and may not be directly linked to local temperature measurements at the beginning of the co boiling stage simulated napl saturation shows an earlier decrease compared to the measured saturation this delay may be due to the time required to form connected gas pathways hegele and mumford 2014 jousse et al 2017 or to a lag between voc removal and napl recovery as condensate during the co boiling stage simulated data show slightly lower napl removal rate gas production rate than the measured data in addition the model underestimates the slope of the gas saturation after 1 7 h indicating that the model underestimates the steam production rate during the water boiling stage this is likely due to neglecting the redistribution of water during heating by assuming no flow conditions in the experiments boiling or co boiling occurs towards the edge of the cylinder first as it is heated by the oven gas production and removal from the edge would promote water flow from the center cooler to the edge warmer this effect is relatively insignificant during the co boiling stage since the pressure gradient water and napl generated by co boiling is lower however is likely important during water boiling despite the discrepancy observed at the water boiling stage overall good agreement was found between simulated and measured saturation until napl is completely removed 3 2 predictive simulations for single component napl the average fitting parameters determined from matching the a20 experiments table 2 were used to predict the remaining single component experiments using their corresponding initial conditions predictive simulations for experiments a5 and a40 are presented in fig 3 the model predicted the temperature throughout heating including the length of the co boiling plateau based on different initial napl saturations for experiment a5 the measured co boiling temperature is slightly higher than the predicted one this may be due to the low initial napl saturation and consequently lower napl water interfacial area as a result the thermocouple would have been mostly in contact with water that can have a higher temperature than the napl water interface during co boiling in addition during the water heating stage the predicted temperature for experiment a40 is slightly lower than the measured temperature at approximately 2 2 h smits et al 2013 demonstrated that the effective thermal conductivity of intermediately saturated soil at higher temperature 70 c can be nearly twice as high as that at lower temperature 30 c suggesting that the model may underestimate the heat transfer rate during the water heating stage when gas saturation is relatively high hence more distinct for experiment a40 by assuming a constant thermal conductivity in addition good agreement was found between the measured and predicted napl and gas saturation for experiment a5 the predicted napl saturation curve is in the range of measurement uncertainty however it is slightly shifted to the left compared to the measured data for experiment a40 the model slightly under predicts the gas production rate during the co boiling stage 3 3 predictive simulations for multi component napl predictive simulations for the multi component experiments are presented in figs 4 and 5 same as the a5 and a40 simulations these simulations used average parameter values determined from the a20 experiments and no additional calibration was performed during co boiling of a multi component napl there is no co boiling plateau but a co boiling region of gradually increasing temperature zhao et al 2014 this temperature behavior is correctly predicted by the model for experiments b5 b20 1 and b40 for experiments b20 2 and b20 3 the temperature predictions show the correct trend but are slightly lower than the temperature measured during the co boiling stage the sensitivity of measured temperature to the proximity of the thermocouple to napl has been reported previously martin and kueper 2011 zhao et al 2014 therefore non uniformly distributed napl in these experiments may have caused the under predictions of temperature in these simulations for experiment b40 the model under predicts the temperature during the water heating stage at approximately 2 1 h which may be due to the assumption of a constant thermal conductivity as described for experiment a40 in spite of the fact that there are some mismatches between the predicted and measured local temperature the predicted napl saturation shows agreement with the measured napl saturation demonstrating that the model is capable of predicting the global mass recovery of multi component napl the predicted gas saturation also matches the measured gas saturation until water boiling for series b three samples of condensate were collected during the co boiling stage each 5 ml condensate sample included water and napl voc concentrations in the napl were measured to determine their mole fractions in the napl condensate the mole fractions are plotted over time fig 6 based on the end time of the sampling for the triplicate experiments b20 b20 1 b20 2 and b20 3 the average value for the mole fraction of napl is shown in fig 6b the error bars represent the 95 confidence interval from the mean of the triplicate experiments the model was also used to predict the mole fraction in the napl for every 5 ml of condensate generated instantaneous napl removal rate calculated from the model was plotted on the secondary axis for comparison because of the delay by collecting the 5 ml samples approximately 0 06 to 0 07 h zhao 2013 the mole fraction in the napl condensate is not equivalent to the instantaneous mole fraction in the produced gas e g not enough condensate can be sampled at the first moment of co boiling therefore curves for mole fraction in the napl condensate shift later in time compared to the co boiling duration some of the measured points from experiment b5 are not well predicted by the model the pce mole fraction in this experiment shows an unexpected downward trend for the first two measured points which is not captured by the model however for experiments b20 and b40 good agreement can be found between the measured and predicted data for the last condensate sample collected in these two experiments the model tends to slightly under predict the mole fraction of cb and over predict the mole fraction of pce this is possibly related to the under prediction of napl removal rate by the model in general the model suggests that 1 2 dca has the highest mole fraction in the samples collected earlier in time due to its highest volatility among the three napl components as co boiling continues the mole fraction of 1 2 dca continuously declines until it reaches 0 the mole fraction of pce starts slightly higher than cb and then gradually increases and reaches its maximum value at approximately 40 however the pce mole fraction only falls rapidly to 0 in the last moment of the co boiling stage as the mole fraction of pce falls to zero the mole fraction of cb reaches 100 accordingly the model indicates that even in the late stage of co boiling the napl condensate is still composed of two major components approximately 60 cb and 40 pce on a molar basis relatively speaking the decrease and extinction of the most volatile component 1 2 dca are more indicative of the progress of mass removal under this experimental condition however heterogeneous napl distribution napl redistribution and asymmetrical heat transfer can also influence the napl condensate composition 4 summary and conclusions an efficient numerical model was developed to simulate laboratory scale treatability tests of single and multi component napl impacted soils the developed model incorporates heat conduction napl water co boiling and water boiling in a radial coordinate system and uses an explicit in time approach to simulate the vaporization of multi component napls during co boiling this model requires only two fitting parameters the thermal conductivity of the soil mixture and the convective heat transfer coefficient from the oven to the cylinder to simulate the temperature fluid saturations and mole fractions in the gas phase during heating an example is presented in which the model was calibrated to three single component experiments and used to predict the remaining seven single and multi component experiments although the model under predicts the gas production rate during water boiling overall good agreements were found between simulated data and experimental data for all 10 experiments prior to water boiling the model can be calibrated to relatively few tests and run in predictive mode to simulate treatability tests under different scenarios thereby reducing the costs for conducting laboratory tests in addition results suggest that heat transfer plays an important role in mass removal as it dictates the vaporization of napl which is the dominant mechanism for mass removal therefore good estimates of the heat transfer parameters can be useful for estimating the mass recovery these simulation results support previous conclusions that local temperature measurements cannot be directly linked to global mass removal the model also provides a tool to simulate the evolution of composition for multi component napls during heating which can help assess the temperature and heating duration to achieve the treatment goals for different components and evaluate the risks associated with some specific components during heating acknowledgements funding for

1568,surface ground waters could be polluted when rain water and or snow melt water infiltrate through waste rock piles at mine sites and dissolve secondary minerals salts from rock surfaces it is important to reduce solute loading by the optimal configuration of waste rock piles this requires the proper definition and determination of the characteristic properties of waste rock piles in terms of metal leaching and in particular rate control mechanisms and scaling laws and their dependence upon configuration variables for revealing these characteristic properties this paper proposes a pile scale c q relation c cs 1 e p q p kλβψ where c and cs are respectively solute concentration and particle s saturation concentration q is the flow rate of the water through a waste rock pile k represents the effective or average dissolution coefficient of a mineral specie from rock surfaces β represents rock pile depth λ represents the ratio of the sum of the surface areas of rocks to the volume that the rocks occupy and ψ is the sum of the cross sections of water flow channels in a waste rock pile the two characteristic properties revealed by the c q relation are 1 p the product of k λ β and ψ p kλβψ which is the characteristic property of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching named here the solute production potential and 2 the ratio of p to q p q a non dimensional number designated as α α p q named here the rate control quotient which is the scaling law and the rate control mechanism indicator the value of α quantitatively indicates what controls the rate of mineral dissolution and it also relates smaller scale metal leaching testing results to their corresponding full scales when α becomes small say α 0 5 the rate of solute production potential p becomes in control and the solute loading is nearly independent of q when α becomes larger say α 2 5 solute concentration would become close to its saturation concentration cs and q determines solute loading that is the solute loading is proportional to q when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p are in control a mixed control mechanism the 20 years of measurements of mine drainage chemistry from the main waste rock piles at the equity silver mine bc canada are used to illustrate how to determine the two characteristic properties p and α and how well they are able to describe the waste rock piles in terms of

rock piles are seen at mine sites in particular at open pit mines in virtually every country in the world they contain leachable minerals that can be leached out by rain water and or snowmelt water for many decades to millennia and the drainage waters from them pose serious hazards to the environment and to humans hudson edwards 2016 morin 2011 morin and hutt 2007 weber et al 2018 hudson edwards et al 2011 liu et al 2017 leachable minerals can contain chemical elements such as arsenic selenium aluminum lead zinc iron and copper etc and hence mine drainage can be toxic corrosive radioactive or some combination of these large volumes of mine wastes have been accumulated by contemporary mining operations compared with the mine wastes previously produced because of the depletion of high grade ores as a consequence the cost for collecting and treating the mine drainage has been increasing it is not uncommon that it costs 2 3 million annually to collect and treat mine drainage from a pile of many tens to hundreds of millions of tons of waste rocks a typical size at larger open pit mine sites moreover mine drainage treatment by the lime neutralization approach the most widely used technology for treating mine drainage leaves behand large amounts of sludge whose storage poses a serious challenge due to its toxicity physical and geochemical stability and large volume therefore a practical challenge arises how can waste rock piles be optimally configured to reduce solute loadings in mine drainage another practical challenge is how smaller scale tests for predicting drainage chemistry such as humidity cell testing column leach testing and leach pad testing can be designed so that test results can be accurately scaled up to the full field size to address these two challenges one has to have a deep understanding of the metal leaching phenomenon in terms of what are the quantities variables that can sufficiently describe the phenomenon and what are their relations in particular what are the most important characteristic properties of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching regarding the challenges there is little accumulation of knowledge for understanding the metal leaching phenomenon in a waste rock pile and predicting its long term behavior three categories of approaches have been developed and used one category is to formulate the mathematical models a set of differential equations plus boundary conditions and initial conditions that govern mass transport through waste rock piles coupled with geochemical reactions and then to solve the equations using finite element methods according to the level of the sophistication of the mathematical models the models could be conceptual models or 1 d models or 2 d models or 3d pile scale mega models with hydrological geochemical and even biological processes included the advantages and disadvantages of this approach are outlined and or reflected in research articles liu et al 2017 nordstrom and nicholson 2017 williams and diehl 2014 lefebvre et al 2001a 2001b molson et al 2005 da silva et al 2009 fala et al 2005 mayer 2017 ma et al 2019 one notable advantage of this category is their ability to give relatively complete and detailed information with fine resolutions one primary disadvantage is the difficulty of reducing their deviations from realities the deviations are from both the assumptions made on the models and the difficult to attain properties that occur as the coefficients of the equations for example darcy s law based models and even computational fluid dynamic cfd based models are not able to capture the detailed physics of channeled flows also called preferential flows or fingered flows in which rainwater and snowmelt water infiltrate through waste rock piles nevertheless the reality is that infiltrated water flows down through waste rock piles nearly always in the form of discrete individual flow channels li 1999 cesare et al 2014 wei et al 2014 annaka and hanayama 2010 the channeled flows at the scale of waste rock piles are extremely difficult even if possible to mathematically model and numerically simulate given the power of today s computers because of this type of difficulty the existing models have not been able to predict accurately drainage chemistry at the scale of waste rock piles the second category of approaches is to take sufficient amount of samples from a waste rock pile and test the samples for their mineral dissolution rates using humidity cells leach columns or leach pads and then scale up the test results to the full field size this category has been widely applied in the mining industry but metal leaching consultants have met foundational challenges and struggled with accurately scaling up the test results to the full field size the third category is empirical i e to curve fit the historical monitoring data of drainage chemistry and discharge rates and then use it for predicting drainage chemistry sarah et al 2009 villeneuve et al 2017 because the curve fitting does not contain any information of the layouts of waste rock piles this approach is not able to provide guidance for configuring future waste rock piles the objective of this research is to identify the most important characteristic properties of waste rock piles in terms of metal leaching in particular the characteristic properties that are able to indicate quantitatively the mineral dissolution potential and the rate control mechanisms of mineral dissolution from waste rock piles including what variables quantities constitute the characteristic properties this objective is achieved through a simple and effective model note that the characteristic properties of a phenomenon such as metal leaching from waste rock piles are nearly always associated with models and it is by the models that the properties can be defined and determined the models for defining revealing characteristic properties are supposed to capture dominant factors only and hence are simple but effective due to the fact that the number of dominant factors would be few hence the models for defining revealing the characteristic properties of a phenomenon are rarely the 2 d and 3 d mega models that require large scale numerical calculations such as finite element methods as a result the nature of establishing the models for defining revealing characteristic properties is both science and art the model proposed here is of this category being rapid and in particular allowing users to rapidly grasp the effects of the layouts of waste rock piles on mineral dissolution we avoid mega models such as 2 d or 3 d pile scale models involving computational fluid dynamics coupled with geochemical reactions another advantage of this model is that it reveals how the relevant variables conspire together to determine the top characteristic properties solute production potential and rate control quotient to affect solute concentrations and loadings in addition the model shows how the two characteristic properties are determined using mine site monitoring data or smaller scale testing such as column leach testing 2 metal leaching from waste rock piles the aqueous solubility of sulfide minerals contained in waste rocks is generally speaking much lower than the solubility of the associated sulfide oxidation products also called as secondary minerals for example copper sulfide cus is relatively insoluble in water compared with the aqueous solubility of cuso4 a product of copper sulfide oxidation that is to say for reaction products of sulfide minerals contained in waste rocks to appear in mine drainage two steps are essential the first step is sulfide mineral oxidation by moisture and air water and oxygen with the catalyzing effects of bacteria colmer and hinkle 1947 releasing aqueous acidity sulphate metals and other elements that may form secondary minerals the second step is the dissolution of the oxidation reaction products i e salts and acidity into pore water that flows generally downward through individual flow channels in waste rock piles as mine drainage to attain the whole picture of this phenomenon both steps need to be well understood according to the relative rapidity of the sulfide mineral oxidation to the rapidity of the dissolution of sulfide oxidation products into pore water the two steps can be analyzed separately without coupling them together by differentiating the three situations 1 sulfide mineral oxidation in control in which the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation are much slower than the rates of oxidation product dissolution 2 oxidation product dissolution in control in which the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation are much greater than the rates of oxidation product dissolution and 3 the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation and the rates of oxidation product dissolution are close to each other that is to say both steps are limiting steps and hence cannot be decoupled completely the situation 1 is favored by low oxygen concentration and or low moisture content inside waste rock piles and or frequent water flushing through waste rock piles at high flow rates while the situation 2 is favored by high oxygen concentration and high moisture content inside waste rock piles and or infrequent water flushing and or water flushing at very low flow rates waste rock piles tend to favour one of the situations depending upon local climate precipitation humidity and temperature waste rock pile layout and pile size and gas water permeability it also depends upon the history of waste rocks in the piles for example sulfide minerals on the surfaces of waste rocks could have been oxidized over time and significant amount of oxidation products salts and acidity could have been already accumulated on rock surfaces waiting to be leached one common characteristic of situation 2 is relatively high aqueous concentrations of sulfate close to or at the solubility of gypsum this is commonly observed in full scale drainages at sulfide bearing mine sites and in small scale drainages from sulphide bearing columns e g morin 2011 morin and hutt 2007 weber et al 2018 therefore this paper addresses common situation 2 without dealing with the other two situations that is to say this paper addresses the situation where there are significant amounts of salts and acidity on rock surfaces waiting to be leached by infiltrated rainwater and or snowmelt water and or groundwater 3 model development 3 1 channeled flows in waste rock piles according to our observations it is through numerous separate flow channels called channeled flow li 1999 cesare et al 2014 wei et al 2014 annaka and hanayama 2010 that rain water and or snowmelt water predominantly flow through waste rock piles the total number of active flow channels inside a waste rock pile could be steady within a certain range of water infiltration rates but would occasionally increase when water infiltration rates increase beyond this range as the rocks within the flow channels become wet and actively rinsed sulfide oxidation products on rock surfaces are gradually leached out exposed sulfide minerals on rocks outside the flow channels can continue oxidizing because they are exposed to moisture and air but are not washed and leached as there is little active water movement that is to say the rocks inside the flow channels contribute directly to the solute concentrations of mine drainage while the rocks outside of the flow channels may contribute indirectly such as through diffusion and or condensation migration here we assume that the direct contribution in the channels outweighs the indirect contribution outside the channels and hence the indirect contribution is neglected in this paper based on a case study of high frequency monitoring of full scale waste rock drainage the indirect contribution may be minor but can still be significant morin 2017 this will be examined in a later paper consider a single vertical flow channel in a waste rock pile here it is assumed that the pore volume within the flow channel does not change with time and is continuously flushed with water it is also assumed that the pore water is well mixed horizontally so that solute concentrations within the flow channel are horizontally uniform but the concentrations increase as the water flows downward along the vertical axis in this way the concentration c of a solute species is a function of vertical location x expressed as c x which increases with x at x 0 c 0 0 meaning that fresh water enters into the top of the flow channel when water travels downward it will progressively dissolve additional oxidation products salts and acidity on the rock surfaces into pore water making concentration c x increase as x increases at x β the bottom position of the flow channel that is the bottom position of the waste rock pile concentration c β achieves its largest value here it is assumed that the pore water volume does not increase due to dissolved minerals added into the pore water this is reasonable because rarely does total dissolved solids of waste rock drainage significantly exceed 10 g l or roughly 1 of a liter 3 2 the noyes whitney equation the noyes whitney equation relates the rate of the dissolution of a solid particle to the properties of the solid and its dissolution medium the relationship is given by 1a d m dt a p c s c d d whered m dt mineral dissolution rate mg s m the mass of a specific mineral dissolved into pore water mg t time s ap the surface area of a solid particle dm2 d the diffusion coefficient of a mineral dissolved in pore water dm2 s cs the saturation concentration of a mineral in pore water mg l c the concentration of a mineral in the bulk pore water mg l d diffusion layer thickness dm to apply eq 1a to the rocks that situate inside a flow channel whose surfaces have specific secondary mineral particles with varying distribution densities let us modify the format of eq 1a as 1b d m dt a s k c s c whereas rock surface area that is submerged in pore water dm2 k effective average dissolution coefficient of a specific mineral species on a rock surface normalized to as dm s eq 1b shows that the dissolution rate of a specific secondary mineral species d m dt is proportional to the difference between its saturation concentration and its concentration in the bulk pore water and proportional to k an average effective dissolution coefficient of a specific mineral species on a rock surface that is submerged in pore water as a material property k can have different values with respect to different mineral species and in addition k is dependent on the distribution density of the mineral particles on a rock surface becoming larger when the distribution density is higher 3 3 the principle of conservation of mass now let us analyze by the mass conservation principle the change of solute concentration c along a short vertical section δx within the flow channel as shown in fig 1 a mass balance is taken about the volume along the vertical axis x within a time period δt the amount of mineral sin that enters the section from the top surface of the section can be written as 2 s in avc x t δt where a is the cross section area of the flow channel c x t represents the concentration of the mineral at location x and at time t and v is the vertical flow speed of pore water with its unit with av being flow rate l s in the channel here denote sp as the amount of a secondary mineral species that is dissolved from the rock surfaces inside the section δx within time period δt and follow the noyes whitney equation eq 1b one can have 3 s p λ aδx k c s c x t δt where λ aδx represents the total surface area of the rocks inside the volume aδx and λ is the ratio of the total rock surface area to the volume of the section δx 1 dm called as surface area index reflecting rock particle size being larger when particle size is smaller at the bottom of the short section δx the amount of the mineral species out sout within time period δt can be written as 4 s out av c x t c x δx δt the amount of the mineral species sc that is built up within the section δx within time period δt can be written as 5 s c εaδx c x t δt c x t εaδx c t δt where ε is the ratio of pore water volume to the whole channel volume introducing eqs 2 5 into eq 6 the law of mass conservation shown below 6 s c s in s p s out one can get εaδx c t δt avc x t δt λ aδx k c s c x t δt av c x t c x δx δt which can be re written as 7 ε c t λk c s c x t v c x assuming steady state conditions i e ε c t 0 one can have the following differential equation and boundary condition dc x dx λk v c s c x 8 c 0 0 x 0 this differential equation has the following solution 9 c x c s 1 e λxk v at the bottom of the waste rock pile i e x β eq 9 can be written as 10 c β c s 1 e λβk v in the practice of mine drainage monitoring what is measured is not v the flow speed of pore water but q the flow rate of mine drainage measured at a low point on a mine drainage ditch in a waste rock pile there are numerous flow channels and they together contribute to flow rate q designating ψ as the sum of the cross section areas of the numerous flow channels in a waste rock pile one has v q ψ introducing v q ψ to eq 10 yields 11 c β c s 1 e λβk ψ q use p to represent λβkψ i e p λβkψ and use α to represent p q i e α p q eq 11 becomes 12 c β c s 1 e p q c s 1 e α eq 12 is the c q relation that has the two characteristic properties of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching p and α and will be discussed further in the next section 4 solute production potential p the forms of p and α in eq 12 contains valuable information the four variables λ β k and ψ conspire together to determine one quantity p p λβkψ the product of the four variables together affecting solute concentration c rather than independent influences from each of the four variables here we name p as solute production potential p is a characteristic property of a waste rock pile in terms of mineral dissolution by inspection of the dimensions of λ β k and ψ one can see that p has the same dimension as q i e l s q being flushing rate the larger the value of p is the larger the potential for the associated mineral species to be dissolved in water and to end up in mine drainage at the bottom of a waste rock pile p as the product of the four variables inform us that the effect of changing λ i e rock surface area index is exactly the same as that of changing β i e rock pile depth if we double λ i e double rock surface area while keeping the other variables fixed we affect solute concentration c precisely as we would if we doubled β i e double rock pile depth keeping the other variables constant this provides a room for the configuration optimization of waste rock piles using eq 12 solute production potential p of a waste rock pile can be conveniently determined by a set of mine drainage measurements i e a set of c q measurements denote the set of measurements of c and q as ci qi i 1 2 3 n and denote the associated solute concentrations given by eq 12 as cs 1 exp p qi i 1 2 n define the following single variable optimization as 13 minimize c i c s 1 e x p p q i 2 with respect to p by solving this optimization problem 13 the value of p can be determined 5 determination of k values by small scale tests for small scale tests such as column leach tests or leach pad tests λ β and ψ that are associated with the small scale tests can be determined conveniently after a set of c q measurements from the small scale tests are available the corresponding p values can be determined by eq 13 as long as p λ β and ψ are available one can calculate the associated k values from p λβkψ when the same rocks as that inside the waste rock pile are tested one can assume that the k values determined by the small scale tests would be the same as that of the rocks inside the pile that is to say the small scale tests can determine the three quantities of p λ and ψ and hence k values can be determined from p λβkψ as long as the k values are available one can determine the p values and α values of the waste rock pile as long as λ β and ψ of the waste rock pile can be determined here it would not be a challenge to estimate λ β of a waste rock pile because rock particle size distribution pile volume and pile depth are often available but it would be a challenge to determine ψ i e the sum of the cross section areas of the flow channels inside a waste rock pile it is our intention to give a separate report on how to determine ψ 6 rate control quotient α scaling law an interesting thing of eq 12 is that p p kλβψ and q conspire together to form one quantity α α p q and it is α that dictates solute concentration c β instead of p and q independently here α is a dimensionless number and is a ratio of p to q the preservation of α is crucial when upscaling given any two waste rock piles as long as their ranges of α values are the same the two waste rock piles share the same behavior in terms of the c q relation whatever the individual values of p and q of each waste rock pile are a practical implication of this scaling law is its guidance for designing and scaling up small scale tests of mineral dissolution to its full field size as long as α values of a small scale tests are in the same range of α values of its full field size the c q relation given by the small scale tests would be the same as the c q relation of the full size field according the scaling law even if a small scale tests and the full size field have different range of α values they can be still scaled to each other according to c β cs 1 e α 7 rate control quotient α rate control mechanisms here α is not only a key parameter of the scaling law but also the rate control quotient it quantitatively indicates the rate control mechanisms as shown in fig 2 7 1 when 0 α 0 5 solute production potential p p kβλψ is in control when 0 α 0 5 1 e α can be approximated as 1 e α α so the expression c β cs 1 e α can be re written as 14 c β αc s or c β p q c s then the loading of the mineral species t with its dimension as mg s can be expressed as 15 t qc β pc s eq 15 shows that when α is small say 0 α 0 5 solute production potential p p kβλψ is in control the total loading is proportional to p independent of flow rate q and eq 14 shows that solute concentration c β is proportional to p inversely proportional to q 7 2 when α 2 5 flow rate of mine drainage q is in control of mineral loading when α 2 5 1 e α becomes less sensitive with respect to α that is c β cs 1 e α can be approximated as 16 c β c s then the loading of mineral species t can be expressed as 17 t qc β qc s eq 17 shows that when α 2 5 flow rate of mine drainage q is in control the total loading is proportional to q independent of solute production potential p and the concentration c β becomes almost constant being close to saturation concentration cs 7 3 when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p are in control of solute loading a mixed control mechanism when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p contribute to α and neither can be neglected as a result expression c β cs 1 e α cannot be simplified in the above manners it means that both flow rate q and solute production potential p are in control a mixed control mechanism in this case solute loading is 18 t qc β qc s 1 e α 8 application to the waste rock piles of the equity silver mine bc canada 8 1 confirmation of the c q relation c β cs 1 e α the c q relation c β cs 1 e α shows the dependence of solute concentration c β upon α α p q kβλψ q the solute production potential p p kβλψ is a characteristic property of a waste rock pile and can be considered as a fixed quantity to a given waste rock pile but q the flow rate of mine drainage from the waste rock pile depends upon the rate of the infiltration of rainwater and or snowmelt water and hence q fluctuates a lot with time the fluctuation of q with time causes the fluctuation of c β with time here let us test the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q against a set of c q measurements from full scale field monitoring data for visualization let us perform a coordinate transformation from c q relation to y x relation let y ln 1 c β cs and let x 1 q under the y x coordinate the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q becomes the y x relation as y px the y x relation is a straight line with its slope as p the full scale field measurements of c q are from the main waste rock pile and the bessemer waste rock pile at the equity silver mine bc canada as shown in figs 3 and 4 the c q measurements spanned 20 years from 1998 to 2017 according to the q c relation the full scale data that is coordinate transformed on the x y coordinate should fall along a straight line y px passing through the origin point the main waste rock pile and the bessemer waste rock pile sit at the lower part of fig 3 the mine drainage from all of the follow channels in the main waste rock pile ends up at c7 location on the acid mine drainage ard ditch which is shown by the blue line in fig 4 and the mine drainage from all of the follow channels in the bessemer waste rock pile ends up at the bessemer location on the ard ditch which is shown by the blue line in fig 4 at the two locations marked by c7 and bessemer respectively the solute concentrations c and drainage flow rates q were measured over the past 20 years 1998 2017 at time intervals of 2 weeks on c q coordinates and y x coordinates as well the dependences of the concentrations of ten different solutes on flow rates are plotted to save space only a few solutes are shown in figs 5 11 not included are the months from october to may because flow rates in those months are either too low winter seasons or too high it is known that in april and may there is a lot of groundwater coming from its nearby forest area flowing through the bottom part of the waste rock piles and ends up in the ard ditches it is speculated that from october to may the contribution from the ground water to the flow rates q is significant compared with the amount of water flowing downward from the top of the waste rock piles to the bottom of the waste rock piles as a consequence those months deviate too much from the model which addresses channeled flows only from the top of a waste rock pile to its bottom other elements such as se and as had fewer measurements during the monitoring period and thus were not assessed here the overall trends of the data shown in figs 5 11 seem quite supportive of the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q in that their overall trends are in agreement with straight lines y px the correlation coefficients are in the range of 0 65 0 80 8 2 p and α the two characteristic properties of the waste rock piles the slopes of the straight lines in figs 5 11 have clear physical meaning i e they are exactly the values of p p kβλψ the range of the data points in the y coordinate has also clear physical meaning i e it is exactly the range of α values representing rate control mechanisms note that the rate control mechanisms depend upon saturation concentration cs the saturation concentrations used in figs 5 11 were the maximum ones among the concentrations measured from 1998 to 2017 when cs is available and p p kβλψ is determined by eq 13 the range of α can be calculated based on the range of q the flow rate of mine drainage measured table 1 lists the values of p and α corresponding to the bessemer waste rock pile and table 2 lists the values of p and α corresponding to the main waste rock pile they also list rate control mechanisms according to the range of α values which are the range of the data points on the y coordinate on figs 5 11 the last two columns show how solute concentrations c and solute loadings t depend on flow rate q according to eqs 12 and 18 the two characteristic properties p and α allow us to see the effect of changing the configuration of the waste rock piles on rate control mechanisms solute concentration c and solute loadings t let us illustrate this consider a 50 reduction of the footprint on each of the two waste rock piles and an increase in their height by 50 each keeping the other configuration variables such as rock sizes unchanged this change would lead to a reduction of ψ by 50 ψ is the sum of the cross section areas of flow channels in a waste rock pile and an increase of β to the 2 times of the original height hence solute production potential p p kβλψ would not change at all due to the fact that the effect of doubling β is canceled out by a reduction of ψ by 50 but this configuration change would lead to 50 reduction of q flow rate of mine drainage due to 50 reduction of the footprint hence rate control quotient α α p q would be doubled the increase of α by 100 implies that rate control mechanism would shift towards to the saturation zone as shown in fig 2 and would lead to a change in solute concentration c and solute loading t in the way as eqs 12 and 18 these changes induced by the configuration change as listed in tables 1 and 2 show that the configuration change of the waste rock piles as described above couldindeed lead to the reductions of solute concentrations and solute loadings and can shift rate control mechanism towards to the solute saturation zone meaning reduced solute loadings 9 concluding remarks this paper reveals the two characteristic properties of waste rock piles solute production potential p p kβλψ and rate control quotient α α p q for characterizing waste rock piles in terms of mineral dissolution the characteristic properties are defined by a simple and effective model that relates solute concentration c with flow rate q the model gives an explicit c q relation as c cs 1 e p q this relation is in good agreement with the 20 years of monitoring data at the equity silver mine a few interesting things shown by the c q relation include 1 solute concentration c is dependent upon one quantity α alone rather than the five quantities k β λ ψ and q separately 2 the quantity α is a ratio of p to q where p represents solute production potential and q represents water flushing rate α is a pure number a non dimensional quantity 3 in terms of mineral dissolution the four variables of k β λ and ψ combine together to form one quantity p p kβλψ which determines the mineral dissolution potential of a waste rock pile instead of individual quantities of k β λ and ψ in another words the product kβλψ is the characteristic property of a waste rock pile instead of the four individual variables 4 the quantity α is the scaling law by which smaller scale test results can be scaled up to its full scale field 5 the quantity α is an indicator of the rate control mechanism quantitatively indicating rate control mechanisms when α is small say α 0 5 solute production potential p determines solute loadings when α is large say α 2 5 flow rate q determines solute loadings when 0 5 α 2 5 both p and q exert control a mixed control mechanism the rate control mechanisms are needed for determining optimal configurations for waste rock piles so that solute loadings can be reduced the authors believe that the concept here would be effective and quantitative for understanding how minerals are leached out from waste rock piles while applying the c q relation given here one needs to know its underlying assumptions 1 mineral dissolution rate from rock surfaces follows the noyes whitney equation as shown in eq 1b 2 solute concentration is uniformly distributed horizontally 3 channeled flow is assumed to be the major form in which infiltrated water flows through a waste rock pile 4 the effect of water storage inside rocks and pores on flow rates is neglected 5 infiltrated water comes mainly from the top of a waste rock pile instead of flowing through a reservoir at the bottom part of a waste rock pile the assumption 4 could be the reason why this model does not work well for those months when infiltration rates become very low the assumption 5 could be the reason why the model does not work well for those months when ground water contributes considerably to discharge rates in the ard ditches at the equity silver mine another assumption is that the model is mainly for the situation of minerals dissolution in control that is to say the model might not work well if the rates of sulfide oxidation in a waste rock pile is slower that the dissolution rates of sulfide oxidation products into pore water regarding the noyes whitney equation the mineral dissolution rate equation we do not doubt its wide range of applicability in mineral dissolution of from rock surfaces to pore water a difficulty in use of it would be quantifying the effective average dissolution coefficient k however k values can be determined as described above 
1568,surface ground waters could be polluted when rain water and or snow melt water infiltrate through waste rock piles at mine sites and dissolve secondary minerals salts from rock surfaces it is important to reduce solute loading by the optimal configuration of waste rock piles this requires the proper definition and determination of the characteristic properties of waste rock piles in terms of metal leaching and in particular rate control mechanisms and scaling laws and their dependence upon configuration variables for revealing these characteristic properties this paper proposes a pile scale c q relation c cs 1 e p q p kλβψ where c and cs are respectively solute concentration and particle s saturation concentration q is the flow rate of the water through a waste rock pile k represents the effective or average dissolution coefficient of a mineral specie from rock surfaces β represents rock pile depth λ represents the ratio of the sum of the surface areas of rocks to the volume that the rocks occupy and ψ is the sum of the cross sections of water flow channels in a waste rock pile the two characteristic properties revealed by the c q relation are 1 p the product of k λ β and ψ p kλβψ which is the characteristic property of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching named here the solute production potential and 2 the ratio of p to q p q a non dimensional number designated as α α p q named here the rate control quotient which is the scaling law and the rate control mechanism indicator the value of α quantitatively indicates what controls the rate of mineral dissolution and it also relates smaller scale metal leaching testing results to their corresponding full scales when α becomes small say α 0 5 the rate of solute production potential p becomes in control and the solute loading is nearly independent of q when α becomes larger say α 2 5 solute concentration would become close to its saturation concentration cs and q determines solute loading that is the solute loading is proportional to q when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p are in control a mixed control mechanism the 20 years of measurements of mine drainage chemistry from the main waste rock piles at the equity silver mine bc canada are used to illustrate how to determine the two characteristic properties p and α and how well they are able to describe the waste rock piles in terms of

rock piles are seen at mine sites in particular at open pit mines in virtually every country in the world they contain leachable minerals that can be leached out by rain water and or snowmelt water for many decades to millennia and the drainage waters from them pose serious hazards to the environment and to humans hudson edwards 2016 morin 2011 morin and hutt 2007 weber et al 2018 hudson edwards et al 2011 liu et al 2017 leachable minerals can contain chemical elements such as arsenic selenium aluminum lead zinc iron and copper etc and hence mine drainage can be toxic corrosive radioactive or some combination of these large volumes of mine wastes have been accumulated by contemporary mining operations compared with the mine wastes previously produced because of the depletion of high grade ores as a consequence the cost for collecting and treating the mine drainage has been increasing it is not uncommon that it costs 2 3 million annually to collect and treat mine drainage from a pile of many tens to hundreds of millions of tons of waste rocks a typical size at larger open pit mine sites moreover mine drainage treatment by the lime neutralization approach the most widely used technology for treating mine drainage leaves behand large amounts of sludge whose storage poses a serious challenge due to its toxicity physical and geochemical stability and large volume therefore a practical challenge arises how can waste rock piles be optimally configured to reduce solute loadings in mine drainage another practical challenge is how smaller scale tests for predicting drainage chemistry such as humidity cell testing column leach testing and leach pad testing can be designed so that test results can be accurately scaled up to the full field size to address these two challenges one has to have a deep understanding of the metal leaching phenomenon in terms of what are the quantities variables that can sufficiently describe the phenomenon and what are their relations in particular what are the most important characteristic properties of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching regarding the challenges there is little accumulation of knowledge for understanding the metal leaching phenomenon in a waste rock pile and predicting its long term behavior three categories of approaches have been developed and used one category is to formulate the mathematical models a set of differential equations plus boundary conditions and initial conditions that govern mass transport through waste rock piles coupled with geochemical reactions and then to solve the equations using finite element methods according to the level of the sophistication of the mathematical models the models could be conceptual models or 1 d models or 2 d models or 3d pile scale mega models with hydrological geochemical and even biological processes included the advantages and disadvantages of this approach are outlined and or reflected in research articles liu et al 2017 nordstrom and nicholson 2017 williams and diehl 2014 lefebvre et al 2001a 2001b molson et al 2005 da silva et al 2009 fala et al 2005 mayer 2017 ma et al 2019 one notable advantage of this category is their ability to give relatively complete and detailed information with fine resolutions one primary disadvantage is the difficulty of reducing their deviations from realities the deviations are from both the assumptions made on the models and the difficult to attain properties that occur as the coefficients of the equations for example darcy s law based models and even computational fluid dynamic cfd based models are not able to capture the detailed physics of channeled flows also called preferential flows or fingered flows in which rainwater and snowmelt water infiltrate through waste rock piles nevertheless the reality is that infiltrated water flows down through waste rock piles nearly always in the form of discrete individual flow channels li 1999 cesare et al 2014 wei et al 2014 annaka and hanayama 2010 the channeled flows at the scale of waste rock piles are extremely difficult even if possible to mathematically model and numerically simulate given the power of today s computers because of this type of difficulty the existing models have not been able to predict accurately drainage chemistry at the scale of waste rock piles the second category of approaches is to take sufficient amount of samples from a waste rock pile and test the samples for their mineral dissolution rates using humidity cells leach columns or leach pads and then scale up the test results to the full field size this category has been widely applied in the mining industry but metal leaching consultants have met foundational challenges and struggled with accurately scaling up the test results to the full field size the third category is empirical i e to curve fit the historical monitoring data of drainage chemistry and discharge rates and then use it for predicting drainage chemistry sarah et al 2009 villeneuve et al 2017 because the curve fitting does not contain any information of the layouts of waste rock piles this approach is not able to provide guidance for configuring future waste rock piles the objective of this research is to identify the most important characteristic properties of waste rock piles in terms of metal leaching in particular the characteristic properties that are able to indicate quantitatively the mineral dissolution potential and the rate control mechanisms of mineral dissolution from waste rock piles including what variables quantities constitute the characteristic properties this objective is achieved through a simple and effective model note that the characteristic properties of a phenomenon such as metal leaching from waste rock piles are nearly always associated with models and it is by the models that the properties can be defined and determined the models for defining revealing characteristic properties are supposed to capture dominant factors only and hence are simple but effective due to the fact that the number of dominant factors would be few hence the models for defining revealing the characteristic properties of a phenomenon are rarely the 2 d and 3 d mega models that require large scale numerical calculations such as finite element methods as a result the nature of establishing the models for defining revealing characteristic properties is both science and art the model proposed here is of this category being rapid and in particular allowing users to rapidly grasp the effects of the layouts of waste rock piles on mineral dissolution we avoid mega models such as 2 d or 3 d pile scale models involving computational fluid dynamics coupled with geochemical reactions another advantage of this model is that it reveals how the relevant variables conspire together to determine the top characteristic properties solute production potential and rate control quotient to affect solute concentrations and loadings in addition the model shows how the two characteristic properties are determined using mine site monitoring data or smaller scale testing such as column leach testing 2 metal leaching from waste rock piles the aqueous solubility of sulfide minerals contained in waste rocks is generally speaking much lower than the solubility of the associated sulfide oxidation products also called as secondary minerals for example copper sulfide cus is relatively insoluble in water compared with the aqueous solubility of cuso4 a product of copper sulfide oxidation that is to say for reaction products of sulfide minerals contained in waste rocks to appear in mine drainage two steps are essential the first step is sulfide mineral oxidation by moisture and air water and oxygen with the catalyzing effects of bacteria colmer and hinkle 1947 releasing aqueous acidity sulphate metals and other elements that may form secondary minerals the second step is the dissolution of the oxidation reaction products i e salts and acidity into pore water that flows generally downward through individual flow channels in waste rock piles as mine drainage to attain the whole picture of this phenomenon both steps need to be well understood according to the relative rapidity of the sulfide mineral oxidation to the rapidity of the dissolution of sulfide oxidation products into pore water the two steps can be analyzed separately without coupling them together by differentiating the three situations 1 sulfide mineral oxidation in control in which the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation are much slower than the rates of oxidation product dissolution 2 oxidation product dissolution in control in which the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation are much greater than the rates of oxidation product dissolution and 3 the rates of sulfide mineral oxidation and the rates of oxidation product dissolution are close to each other that is to say both steps are limiting steps and hence cannot be decoupled completely the situation 1 is favored by low oxygen concentration and or low moisture content inside waste rock piles and or frequent water flushing through waste rock piles at high flow rates while the situation 2 is favored by high oxygen concentration and high moisture content inside waste rock piles and or infrequent water flushing and or water flushing at very low flow rates waste rock piles tend to favour one of the situations depending upon local climate precipitation humidity and temperature waste rock pile layout and pile size and gas water permeability it also depends upon the history of waste rocks in the piles for example sulfide minerals on the surfaces of waste rocks could have been oxidized over time and significant amount of oxidation products salts and acidity could have been already accumulated on rock surfaces waiting to be leached one common characteristic of situation 2 is relatively high aqueous concentrations of sulfate close to or at the solubility of gypsum this is commonly observed in full scale drainages at sulfide bearing mine sites and in small scale drainages from sulphide bearing columns e g morin 2011 morin and hutt 2007 weber et al 2018 therefore this paper addresses common situation 2 without dealing with the other two situations that is to say this paper addresses the situation where there are significant amounts of salts and acidity on rock surfaces waiting to be leached by infiltrated rainwater and or snowmelt water and or groundwater 3 model development 3 1 channeled flows in waste rock piles according to our observations it is through numerous separate flow channels called channeled flow li 1999 cesare et al 2014 wei et al 2014 annaka and hanayama 2010 that rain water and or snowmelt water predominantly flow through waste rock piles the total number of active flow channels inside a waste rock pile could be steady within a certain range of water infiltration rates but would occasionally increase when water infiltration rates increase beyond this range as the rocks within the flow channels become wet and actively rinsed sulfide oxidation products on rock surfaces are gradually leached out exposed sulfide minerals on rocks outside the flow channels can continue oxidizing because they are exposed to moisture and air but are not washed and leached as there is little active water movement that is to say the rocks inside the flow channels contribute directly to the solute concentrations of mine drainage while the rocks outside of the flow channels may contribute indirectly such as through diffusion and or condensation migration here we assume that the direct contribution in the channels outweighs the indirect contribution outside the channels and hence the indirect contribution is neglected in this paper based on a case study of high frequency monitoring of full scale waste rock drainage the indirect contribution may be minor but can still be significant morin 2017 this will be examined in a later paper consider a single vertical flow channel in a waste rock pile here it is assumed that the pore volume within the flow channel does not change with time and is continuously flushed with water it is also assumed that the pore water is well mixed horizontally so that solute concentrations within the flow channel are horizontally uniform but the concentrations increase as the water flows downward along the vertical axis in this way the concentration c of a solute species is a function of vertical location x expressed as c x which increases with x at x 0 c 0 0 meaning that fresh water enters into the top of the flow channel when water travels downward it will progressively dissolve additional oxidation products salts and acidity on the rock surfaces into pore water making concentration c x increase as x increases at x β the bottom position of the flow channel that is the bottom position of the waste rock pile concentration c β achieves its largest value here it is assumed that the pore water volume does not increase due to dissolved minerals added into the pore water this is reasonable because rarely does total dissolved solids of waste rock drainage significantly exceed 10 g l or roughly 1 of a liter 3 2 the noyes whitney equation the noyes whitney equation relates the rate of the dissolution of a solid particle to the properties of the solid and its dissolution medium the relationship is given by 1a d m dt a p c s c d d whered m dt mineral dissolution rate mg s m the mass of a specific mineral dissolved into pore water mg t time s ap the surface area of a solid particle dm2 d the diffusion coefficient of a mineral dissolved in pore water dm2 s cs the saturation concentration of a mineral in pore water mg l c the concentration of a mineral in the bulk pore water mg l d diffusion layer thickness dm to apply eq 1a to the rocks that situate inside a flow channel whose surfaces have specific secondary mineral particles with varying distribution densities let us modify the format of eq 1a as 1b d m dt a s k c s c whereas rock surface area that is submerged in pore water dm2 k effective average dissolution coefficient of a specific mineral species on a rock surface normalized to as dm s eq 1b shows that the dissolution rate of a specific secondary mineral species d m dt is proportional to the difference between its saturation concentration and its concentration in the bulk pore water and proportional to k an average effective dissolution coefficient of a specific mineral species on a rock surface that is submerged in pore water as a material property k can have different values with respect to different mineral species and in addition k is dependent on the distribution density of the mineral particles on a rock surface becoming larger when the distribution density is higher 3 3 the principle of conservation of mass now let us analyze by the mass conservation principle the change of solute concentration c along a short vertical section δx within the flow channel as shown in fig 1 a mass balance is taken about the volume along the vertical axis x within a time period δt the amount of mineral sin that enters the section from the top surface of the section can be written as 2 s in avc x t δt where a is the cross section area of the flow channel c x t represents the concentration of the mineral at location x and at time t and v is the vertical flow speed of pore water with its unit with av being flow rate l s in the channel here denote sp as the amount of a secondary mineral species that is dissolved from the rock surfaces inside the section δx within time period δt and follow the noyes whitney equation eq 1b one can have 3 s p λ aδx k c s c x t δt where λ aδx represents the total surface area of the rocks inside the volume aδx and λ is the ratio of the total rock surface area to the volume of the section δx 1 dm called as surface area index reflecting rock particle size being larger when particle size is smaller at the bottom of the short section δx the amount of the mineral species out sout within time period δt can be written as 4 s out av c x t c x δx δt the amount of the mineral species sc that is built up within the section δx within time period δt can be written as 5 s c εaδx c x t δt c x t εaδx c t δt where ε is the ratio of pore water volume to the whole channel volume introducing eqs 2 5 into eq 6 the law of mass conservation shown below 6 s c s in s p s out one can get εaδx c t δt avc x t δt λ aδx k c s c x t δt av c x t c x δx δt which can be re written as 7 ε c t λk c s c x t v c x assuming steady state conditions i e ε c t 0 one can have the following differential equation and boundary condition dc x dx λk v c s c x 8 c 0 0 x 0 this differential equation has the following solution 9 c x c s 1 e λxk v at the bottom of the waste rock pile i e x β eq 9 can be written as 10 c β c s 1 e λβk v in the practice of mine drainage monitoring what is measured is not v the flow speed of pore water but q the flow rate of mine drainage measured at a low point on a mine drainage ditch in a waste rock pile there are numerous flow channels and they together contribute to flow rate q designating ψ as the sum of the cross section areas of the numerous flow channels in a waste rock pile one has v q ψ introducing v q ψ to eq 10 yields 11 c β c s 1 e λβk ψ q use p to represent λβkψ i e p λβkψ and use α to represent p q i e α p q eq 11 becomes 12 c β c s 1 e p q c s 1 e α eq 12 is the c q relation that has the two characteristic properties of a waste rock pile in terms of metal leaching p and α and will be discussed further in the next section 4 solute production potential p the forms of p and α in eq 12 contains valuable information the four variables λ β k and ψ conspire together to determine one quantity p p λβkψ the product of the four variables together affecting solute concentration c rather than independent influences from each of the four variables here we name p as solute production potential p is a characteristic property of a waste rock pile in terms of mineral dissolution by inspection of the dimensions of λ β k and ψ one can see that p has the same dimension as q i e l s q being flushing rate the larger the value of p is the larger the potential for the associated mineral species to be dissolved in water and to end up in mine drainage at the bottom of a waste rock pile p as the product of the four variables inform us that the effect of changing λ i e rock surface area index is exactly the same as that of changing β i e rock pile depth if we double λ i e double rock surface area while keeping the other variables fixed we affect solute concentration c precisely as we would if we doubled β i e double rock pile depth keeping the other variables constant this provides a room for the configuration optimization of waste rock piles using eq 12 solute production potential p of a waste rock pile can be conveniently determined by a set of mine drainage measurements i e a set of c q measurements denote the set of measurements of c and q as ci qi i 1 2 3 n and denote the associated solute concentrations given by eq 12 as cs 1 exp p qi i 1 2 n define the following single variable optimization as 13 minimize c i c s 1 e x p p q i 2 with respect to p by solving this optimization problem 13 the value of p can be determined 5 determination of k values by small scale tests for small scale tests such as column leach tests or leach pad tests λ β and ψ that are associated with the small scale tests can be determined conveniently after a set of c q measurements from the small scale tests are available the corresponding p values can be determined by eq 13 as long as p λ β and ψ are available one can calculate the associated k values from p λβkψ when the same rocks as that inside the waste rock pile are tested one can assume that the k values determined by the small scale tests would be the same as that of the rocks inside the pile that is to say the small scale tests can determine the three quantities of p λ and ψ and hence k values can be determined from p λβkψ as long as the k values are available one can determine the p values and α values of the waste rock pile as long as λ β and ψ of the waste rock pile can be determined here it would not be a challenge to estimate λ β of a waste rock pile because rock particle size distribution pile volume and pile depth are often available but it would be a challenge to determine ψ i e the sum of the cross section areas of the flow channels inside a waste rock pile it is our intention to give a separate report on how to determine ψ 6 rate control quotient α scaling law an interesting thing of eq 12 is that p p kλβψ and q conspire together to form one quantity α α p q and it is α that dictates solute concentration c β instead of p and q independently here α is a dimensionless number and is a ratio of p to q the preservation of α is crucial when upscaling given any two waste rock piles as long as their ranges of α values are the same the two waste rock piles share the same behavior in terms of the c q relation whatever the individual values of p and q of each waste rock pile are a practical implication of this scaling law is its guidance for designing and scaling up small scale tests of mineral dissolution to its full field size as long as α values of a small scale tests are in the same range of α values of its full field size the c q relation given by the small scale tests would be the same as the c q relation of the full size field according the scaling law even if a small scale tests and the full size field have different range of α values they can be still scaled to each other according to c β cs 1 e α 7 rate control quotient α rate control mechanisms here α is not only a key parameter of the scaling law but also the rate control quotient it quantitatively indicates the rate control mechanisms as shown in fig 2 7 1 when 0 α 0 5 solute production potential p p kβλψ is in control when 0 α 0 5 1 e α can be approximated as 1 e α α so the expression c β cs 1 e α can be re written as 14 c β αc s or c β p q c s then the loading of the mineral species t with its dimension as mg s can be expressed as 15 t qc β pc s eq 15 shows that when α is small say 0 α 0 5 solute production potential p p kβλψ is in control the total loading is proportional to p independent of flow rate q and eq 14 shows that solute concentration c β is proportional to p inversely proportional to q 7 2 when α 2 5 flow rate of mine drainage q is in control of mineral loading when α 2 5 1 e α becomes less sensitive with respect to α that is c β cs 1 e α can be approximated as 16 c β c s then the loading of mineral species t can be expressed as 17 t qc β qc s eq 17 shows that when α 2 5 flow rate of mine drainage q is in control the total loading is proportional to q independent of solute production potential p and the concentration c β becomes almost constant being close to saturation concentration cs 7 3 when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p are in control of solute loading a mixed control mechanism when 0 5 α 2 5 both q and p contribute to α and neither can be neglected as a result expression c β cs 1 e α cannot be simplified in the above manners it means that both flow rate q and solute production potential p are in control a mixed control mechanism in this case solute loading is 18 t qc β qc s 1 e α 8 application to the waste rock piles of the equity silver mine bc canada 8 1 confirmation of the c q relation c β cs 1 e α the c q relation c β cs 1 e α shows the dependence of solute concentration c β upon α α p q kβλψ q the solute production potential p p kβλψ is a characteristic property of a waste rock pile and can be considered as a fixed quantity to a given waste rock pile but q the flow rate of mine drainage from the waste rock pile depends upon the rate of the infiltration of rainwater and or snowmelt water and hence q fluctuates a lot with time the fluctuation of q with time causes the fluctuation of c β with time here let us test the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q against a set of c q measurements from full scale field monitoring data for visualization let us perform a coordinate transformation from c q relation to y x relation let y ln 1 c β cs and let x 1 q under the y x coordinate the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q becomes the y x relation as y px the y x relation is a straight line with its slope as p the full scale field measurements of c q are from the main waste rock pile and the bessemer waste rock pile at the equity silver mine bc canada as shown in figs 3 and 4 the c q measurements spanned 20 years from 1998 to 2017 according to the q c relation the full scale data that is coordinate transformed on the x y coordinate should fall along a straight line y px passing through the origin point the main waste rock pile and the bessemer waste rock pile sit at the lower part of fig 3 the mine drainage from all of the follow channels in the main waste rock pile ends up at c7 location on the acid mine drainage ard ditch which is shown by the blue line in fig 4 and the mine drainage from all of the follow channels in the bessemer waste rock pile ends up at the bessemer location on the ard ditch which is shown by the blue line in fig 4 at the two locations marked by c7 and bessemer respectively the solute concentrations c and drainage flow rates q were measured over the past 20 years 1998 2017 at time intervals of 2 weeks on c q coordinates and y x coordinates as well the dependences of the concentrations of ten different solutes on flow rates are plotted to save space only a few solutes are shown in figs 5 11 not included are the months from october to may because flow rates in those months are either too low winter seasons or too high it is known that in april and may there is a lot of groundwater coming from its nearby forest area flowing through the bottom part of the waste rock piles and ends up in the ard ditches it is speculated that from october to may the contribution from the ground water to the flow rates q is significant compared with the amount of water flowing downward from the top of the waste rock piles to the bottom of the waste rock piles as a consequence those months deviate too much from the model which addresses channeled flows only from the top of a waste rock pile to its bottom other elements such as se and as had fewer measurements during the monitoring period and thus were not assessed here the overall trends of the data shown in figs 5 11 seem quite supportive of the c q relation c β cs 1 e p q in that their overall trends are in agreement with straight lines y px the correlation coefficients are in the range of 0 65 0 80 8 2 p and α the two characteristic properties of the waste rock piles the slopes of the straight lines in figs 5 11 have clear physical meaning i e they are exactly the values of p p kβλψ the range of the data points in the y coordinate has also clear physical meaning i e it is exactly the range of α values representing rate control mechanisms note that the rate control mechanisms depend upon saturation concentration cs the saturation concentrations used in figs 5 11 were the maximum ones among the concentrations measured from 1998 to 2017 when cs is available and p p kβλψ is determined by eq 13 the range of α can be calculated based on the range of q the flow rate of mine drainage measured table 1 lists the values of p and α corresponding to the bessemer waste rock pile and table 2 lists the values of p and α corresponding to the main waste rock pile they also list rate control mechanisms according to the range of α values which are the range of the data points on the y coordinate on figs 5 11 the last two columns show how solute concentrations c and solute loadings t depend on flow rate q according to eqs 12 and 18 the two characteristic properties p and α allow us to see the effect of changing the configuration of the waste rock piles on rate control mechanisms solute concentration c and solute loadings t let us illustrate this consider a 50 reduction of the footprint on each of the two waste rock piles and an increase in their height by 50 each keeping the other configuration variables such as rock sizes unchanged this change would lead to a reduction of ψ by 50 ψ is the sum of the cross section areas of flow channels in a waste rock pile and an increase of β to the 2 times of the original height hence solute production potential p p kβλψ would not change at all due to the fact that the effect of doubling β is canceled out by a reduction of ψ by 50 but this configuration change would lead to 50 reduction of q flow rate of mine drainage due to 50 reduction of the footprint hence rate control quotient α α p q would be doubled the increase of α by 100 implies that rate control mechanism would shift towards to the saturation zone as shown in fig 2 and would lead to a change in solute concentration c and solute loading t in the way as eqs 12 and 18 these changes induced by the configuration change as listed in tables 1 and 2 show that the configuration change of the waste rock piles as described above couldindeed lead to the reductions of solute concentrations and solute loadings and can shift rate control mechanism towards to the solute saturation zone meaning reduced solute loadings 9 concluding remarks this paper reveals the two characteristic properties of waste rock piles solute production potential p p kβλψ and rate control quotient α α p q for characterizing waste rock piles in terms of mineral dissolution the characteristic properties are defined by a simple and effective model that relates solute concentration c with flow rate q the model gives an explicit c q relation as c cs 1 e p q this relation is in good agreement with the 20 years of monitoring data at the equity silver mine a few interesting things shown by the c q relation include 1 solute concentration c is dependent upon one quantity α alone rather than the five quantities k β λ ψ and q separately 2 the quantity α is a ratio of p to q where p represents solute production potential and q represents water flushing rate α is a pure number a non dimensional quantity 3 in terms of mineral dissolution the four variables of k β λ and ψ combine together to form one quantity p p kβλψ which determines the mineral dissolution potential of a waste rock pile instead of individual quantities of k β λ and ψ in another words the product kβλψ is the characteristic property of a waste rock pile instead of the four individual variables 4 the quantity α is the scaling law by which smaller scale test results can be scaled up to its full scale field 5 the quantity α is an indicator of the rate control mechanism quantitatively indicating rate control mechanisms when α is small say α 0 5 solute production potential p determines solute loadings when α is large say α 2 5 flow rate q determines solute loadings when 0 5 α 2 5 both p and q exert control a mixed control mechanism the rate control mechanisms are needed for determining optimal configurations for waste rock piles so that solute loadings can be reduced the authors believe that the concept here would be effective and quantitative for understanding how minerals are leached out from waste rock piles while applying the c q relation given here one needs to know its underlying assumptions 1 mineral dissolution rate from rock surfaces follows the noyes whitney equation as shown in eq 1b 2 solute concentration is uniformly distributed horizontally 3 channeled flow is assumed to be the major form in which infiltrated water flows through a waste rock pile 4 the effect of water storage inside rocks and pores on flow rates is neglected 5 infiltrated water comes mainly from the top of a waste rock pile instead of flowing through a reservoir at the bottom part of a waste rock pile the assumption 4 could be the reason why this model does not work well for those months when infiltration rates become very low the assumption 5 could be the reason why the model does not work well for those months when ground water contributes considerably to discharge rates in the ard ditches at the equity silver mine another assumption is that the model is mainly for the situation of minerals dissolution in control that is to say the model might not work well if the rates of sulfide oxidation in a waste rock pile is slower that the dissolution rates of sulfide oxidation products into pore water regarding the noyes whitney equation the mineral dissolution rate equation we do not doubt its wide range of applicability in mineral dissolution of from rock surfaces to pore water a difficulty in use of it would be quantifying the effective average dissolution coefficient k however k values can be determined as described above

carcinogenic heavy metals are not biodegradable therefore the removal of heavy metals from process effluent becomes environmentally important nowadays there are a lot of methods to remove heavy metal ions in solution including chemical physical and biological methods wang et al 2010 ng et al 2016 mäenpää et al 2011 among these methods chemical precipitation method is effective and widely used in industry because of the simple and inexpensive operation during the precipitation process chemical adsorbents can react with heavy metal ions to form insoluble precipitates which can be subsequently separated from the solution by filtration centrifugation or filtration for example özverdi et al removed cu2 cd2 and pb2 ions from aqueous solutions by adsorption onto synthetic pyrite and fes adsorbents özverdi and erdem 2006 the results showed that the chemical precipitation took place at low ph 3 and adsorption occurred at high ph 3 6 hydroxide precipitation was another technique to remove the heavy metal ions in solution in the ph range of 8 11 for instance mirbagheri et al employed ca oh 2 and naoh to remove cu ii and cr iv ions by chemical precipitation operation using the established method the concentration of cu2 ions could be reduced from 48 51 mg l 1 to 0 694 mg l 1 which is below the environmental standards for water resources mirbagheri and hosseini 2005 with the development of nanotechnology lu et al 2019 many nanomaterials were used to remove the heavy metal ions in solution zou et al have synthesized ferriferrous oxide l cysteine fe3o4 cys magnetic microspheres to adsorb pb2 ions in aqueous solution and the maximum adsorption capacity can reach 459 33 mg g 1 zou et al 2015 in fact a variety of heavy metal ions are commonly present in the solution while most adsorbents only remove one or a small number of heavy metal ions at the same time agoubordea and navia 2009 muya et al 2016 huisman et al 2006 porous hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 hap nanomaterials singh et al 2012 papageorgiou et al 2014 lin et al 2014 gittings et al 2009 roshanbinfar and ansari 2013 have large specific surface area and good environmental compatibility which have large reactivity and adsorption capacity to remove heavy metal ions in solution in this paper we prepared hap nanostructures with various morphologies in a facile method then we employed the porous hap nanospheres nss as adsorbent to remove seven heavy metal ions pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 in solution the adsorption equilibrium data and adsorption kinetics were also analyzed by several

and fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir avatar360 usa were employed to characterize the morphology and composition of the prepared hap nanostructures the surface area of porous hap nss was measured by the brunauer emmett teller method bet quadrasorb usa the concentration of metal ions were measured by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy icp optima 2100dv usa 2 2 preparation of hap nanostructures in a typical synthesis hap nanostructures were prepared by hydrothermal method briefly 0 04 0 4 g of p2o5 was added into 15 ml of absolute ethanol followed by the addition of the ca solution 0 24 2 40 g cano3 4h2o and 15 ml of h2o under stirring dropping speed of ca solution 20 days min 1 then the ph value was adjusted to 4 10 by ammonia spirit and the reaction was kept at 4 30 c in the ice bath by heating under stirring for 30 min subsequently the solution was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave sealed and heated at 165 c for 12 h finally the solution was cooled centrifuged and washed by ethanol and water for several times to obtain the hap nanostructures 2 3 adsorption of pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 ions in solution the effect of the prepared hap nss in adsorbing pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 ions in solution was investigated at room temperature briefly 0 1 g 0 5 g hap nss were dispersed into 30 00 ml 20 mg l 1 of pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 single mixed ions solution and shaken for 30 min at a rotation speed of 180 rpm then the supernatant was collected by centrifugation and analyzed by icp in order to investigate the relationship between the adsorption rate and adsorption time 0 10 g of hap nss were dispersed in 30 00 ml of mixed ions solution 20 mg l 1 for each ion by stirring at 25 c for predetermined time interval 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min then the supernatants were gotten by centrifugation and all precipitates were collected and washed with 10 ml water to remove the physically adsorbed m2 ions then another 10 ml of water was added into it after 1 h the supernatant was collected and the above operation was repeated for 12 times taking pb2 as an example the adsorption thermodynamics and adsorption kinetics of hap nss were studied briefly different amounts of hap nss 0 04 g 0 06 g 0 08 g 0 10 g were dispersed in 30 ml of pb2 solution 860 mg l 1 by stirring at room temperature for 2 h the concentrations of pb2 ions in the supernatant were analyzed by icp to research the adsorption kinetics of hap nss on pb2 ions we kept the amount of hap sample unchanged 0 1 g then eight hap samples were weighted in parallel and oscillated at different time intervals 2 4 8 12 14 16 20 1440 min at room temperature at last all the supernatant obtained by centrifugation were analyzed by icp 3 results and discussion to investigate the effect of ph value of the solution on the morphology of the prepared hap nanostructures fig 1 gave the tem images of the hap samples prepared at different ph values it can be seen that the prepared hap samples presented various morphologies under different acidity conditions as can be seen from fig 1a the prepared hap sample at ph 4 0 was a fluffy spongy deposit which was composed of pellets with particle size of about 10 nm when ph increased to 7 5 the prepared hap sample was a porous sphere in shape with an average size of 140 nm and the porous structure with holes of different sizes is visible fig 1b when the ph continued to rise to 8 3 the obtained hap sample was changed from porous spheres into a solid spheres and the average particle size was significantly reduced about 31 nm with good dispersity fig 1c as seen from fig 1d when the ph further elevated slightly to 8 5 the morphology of the prepared hap sample changed greatly changing from spheres to uniform nanotubes with a length of 34 220 nm and a width of 17 45 nm finally when ph was adjusted to 9 5 the hap sample showed spherical again with an average particle size of 58 nm and the interior of these nss were porous to sum up the different morphology of the prepared hap nanostructure can be controlled by changing the ph value of the solution keeping ph 8 3 constant the effect of the reaction temperature on the morphology of the prepared hap samples during the stirring was investigated fig 2 presented the tem images of prepared hap samples at different stirring temperature conditions it can be seen that the prepared hap samples were all nanotubes in shape at different stirring temperature however the size of the gotten nanotubes varied slightly the distribution of length and width of hap nanotubes prepared at 3 c 10 c 17 c 24 c 31 c were 30 190 nm and 17 37 nm fig 2a 44 130 nm and 17 31 nm fig 2b 43 186 nm and 12 30 nm fig 2c 63 250 nm and 15 33 nm fig 2d 24 352 nm and 13 30 nm fig 2e respectively it was not difficult to find that the length of these hap nanotubes gradually became longer and the width remained basically unchanged with the stirring temperature increasing which indicated that the stirring temperature mainly affected the longitudinal growth of the nanotubes fig 2f was the xrd pattern of hap nanotubes shown in fig 2c it can be seen that the hap nanotubes displayed obvious characteristic peaks at 25 8 31 7 32 2 39 7 46 7 49 3 indicating that the main component of the sample was hap in order to investigate the effect of the additive amount of p2o5 cano3 on the morphology of hap we increased the addition of p2o5 cano3 proportionally while keeping other reaction conditions unchanged fig 3 gave the sem images of hap nss in different additive amount of p2o5 cano3 as can be seen from fig 3a when the adding amount of p2o5 cano3 was 0 04 g 0 24 g the prepared hap sample was porous nss with good dispersion and the average particle size was 76 nm when the addition of p2o5 cano3 was further increased and the gotten hap sample was still porous nss with size of 85 nm fig 3b 74 nm fig 3c 77 nm fig 3d 83 nm fig 3e 64 nm fig 3f this indicated that the increase of p source and ca source had little effect on the morphology of hap however its significance was that it can significantly increase the yield of prepared hap nss which had obvious value for further amplification of production in the future in order to investigate the adsorption property we chose the hap nss shown in fig 3a as the target materials fig 4 gave the tem a hrtem b images and electron diffraction pattern c of hap nss the prepared hap nss were porous and their diameter was 76 nm hrtem image revealed a set of fringes with the 0 35 nm interplanar spacing indicating that hap sample was single crystal corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern fig 4c exhibited discrete spots and these spots can be easily indexed to hap crystal which was consistent with the relevant xrd pattern fig 5d the porosity of hap nss was investigated by n2 adsorption desorption measurements as shown in fig 5a the hap sample exhibited a type v isotherm with a type h2 hysteresis loop suggesting it was porous structure the bet area pore volume and pore size of the hap sample were 45 3 m2 g 1 0 23 m3 g 1 and 2 7 nm respectively fig 5c represented the ft ir spectrum of the prepared hap nss the intense peaks at 960 1041 and 1094 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the phosphate groups in the crystal lattice of hap and the peak at 570 cm 1 was due to asymmetric bending vibration of phosphate group po4 3 kuriakose et al 2004 the peak at 3568 cm 1 was assigned to oh stretching vibration the hap nss were randomly selected for xrd characterization from fig 5d it can be seen that the hap nss presented diffraction characteristic peaks assigned to the 002 211 112 310 222 213 planes of hap crystal pdf 46 0905 which was agreement with the hap nanotubes fig 2 in order to further verify the adsorption capacity of the prepared hap nss on heavy metal ions in solution seven common heavy metal ions pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and hg2 ions were selected as research objects from fig 6a we can see that the prepared hap nss had a good adsorption capacity for every single ion in solution and the adsorption rate on pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and hg2 ions for 2 h were 99 61 30 95 71 08 70 36 79 56 98 60 and 99 90 respectively according to the comparison the adsorption capacity on these ions were hg2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cu2 co2 cd2 ions subsequently we further investigated the adsorption property of hap nss on seven mixed ions solution it can be seen in fig 6c that for the mixed ions hap sample still displayed a strong adsorption capacity for hg2 pb2 cu2 ni2 and co2 ions for 2 h with an adsorption rate of 99 fig 6b showed the relationship between the adsorption time and adsorption rate on mixed ions for hap nss it can be seen that except hg ions the adsorption rate for the other ions can reach 100 in 20 min indicating that the adsorption reaction between hap nss and mixed ions on was very fast in order to verify the stability of hap m complex hap nss adsorbed the target heavy metal ions we conducted a continuous 12 h desorption experiment except on hg2 27 65 the desorption rate of cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and pb2 ions were 1 which showed a strong stability fig 3a it may be that the adsorption between hap and hg2 was physically adsorbed so it was easy to desorption in order to investigate the adsorption mechanism of hap on metal ions the eds analysis was conducted on the gotten hap m m means to pb cd cu co ni zn and hg elements it can be seen from eds analysis that there were cd cu co ni zn hg elements in hap m which was consistent with results of icp meanwhile we can see that atomic percent ca p of hap m was about 1 44 less than that of ca5 po4 3 oh hap 1 67 this may be because some m2 ions exchanged with ca2 ions which led to the decrease of amount of ca2 ions the hap m obtained by ion exchange reaction was very stable which was consistent with the results of desorption experiment in fig 6d equilibrium studies were carried out to determine the adsorption capacity and equilibrium constant for pb2 on hap nss generally speaking langmuir model and freundlich model were often selected to expose the adsorption relationship the linear forms of the both models were presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 bq m 2 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k where c e mg l 1 was the equilibrium concentration of pb2 in solution q e mg g 1 was the amount of pb2 adsorbed per gram of hap nss q m mg g 1 represented the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 was the langmuir constant k mg g 1 was the freundlich isotherm constant and 1 n was the the degree of non linearity between solution concentration and adsorption zou et al 2015 fig 7 exhibited the plots of langmuir a and freundlich b isotherms it can be seen in fig 7a that the prepared hap nss showed a large adsorption capacity and the q m was recorded as 252 53 mg g 1 at initial concentration of 860 mg l 1 which was consistent with the result of icp 254 90 mg g 1 it was indicated that the adsorption capacity of the hap nss on pb2 was higher than the reports of the academic references foroughi and zarei 2015 corami et al 2008 besides due to the higher the regression coefficients r2 0 9999 for pb2 ions adsorption the langmuir model was greatly suitable to explicate the experimental data than freundlich model r2 0 5443 kinetic study was usually conducted to analyze the adsorption time necessary for reaction equilibrium there were two kinds of kinetic model pseudo 1st and 2rd order and the kinetic equations were given as follow 3 ln q e q t k 1 t ln q e 4 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where q e mg g 1 and q t mg g 1 were the amount of pb2 adsorbed per gram of hap nss at equilibrium and at time t respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min 1 were the rate constant of pseudo 1st and 2rd order model respectively mahajan and sud 2014 fig 7c insert was the relationship between adsorption capacity and adsorption time of hap nss on pb2 ions in solution we can see that the adsorption capacity of the hap nss increased rapidly as extending adsorption time and quickly reached the adsorption balance after 16 min it was indicated that the adsorption reaction between hap nss and pb2 ions was fast which was consistent with the results of fig 6b fig 7c and d are the kinetic plots for pb2 ions onto hap nss we can see that r2 from the pseudo1st model was 0 9841 while that from pseudo 2rd model was r2 0 9999 which indicated that the adsorption data better fitted the pseudo 2rd kinetic model meanwhile the q e value calculated from the pseudo 2rd model 253 81 mg g 1 was very consistent with the experimental q e value 254 90 mg g 1 4 conclusions hap nanostructures with different morphologies have synthesized in a facile method and the ph value of the solution had an important effect on morphology among the hap nanostructures porous hap nss were further employed as adsorbent to remove the heavy metal ions in solution the porous hap nss displayed a high adsorption capacity on seven metal ions the hap m complex showed a good stability the adsorption of hap on metal ions was ion exchange reaction between m2 and ca2 ions langmuir model and the pseudo 2rd kinetic model were well fit the experimental equilibrium data and adsorption kinetic data the porous hap nss would be a

of hap nanostructures in a typical synthesis hap nanostructures were prepared by hydrothermal method briefly 0 04 0 4 g of p2o5 was added into 15 ml of absolute ethanol followed by the addition of the ca solution 0 24 2 40 g cano3 4h2o and 15 ml of h2o under stirring dropping speed of ca solution 20 days min 1 then the ph value was adjusted to 4 10 by ammonia spirit and the reaction was kept at 4 30 c in the ice bath by heating under stirring for 30 min subsequently the solution was transferred into a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave sealed and heated at 165 c for 12 h finally the solution was cooled centrifuged and washed by ethanol and water for several times to obtain the hap nanostructures 2 3 adsorption of pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 ions in solution the effect of the prepared hap nss in adsorbing pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 ions in solution was investigated at room temperature briefly 0 1 g 0 5 g hap nss were dispersed into 30 00 ml 20 mg l 1 of pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 hg2 single mixed ions solution and shaken for 30 min at a rotation speed of 180 rpm then the supernatant was collected by centrifugation and analyzed by icp in order to investigate the relationship between the adsorption rate and adsorption time 0 10 g of hap nss were dispersed in 30 00 ml of mixed ions solution 20 mg l 1 for each ion by stirring at 25 c for predetermined time interval 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min then the supernatants were gotten by centrifugation and all precipitates were collected and washed with 10 ml water to remove the physically adsorbed m2 ions then another 10 ml of water was added into it after 1 h the supernatant was collected and the above operation was repeated for 12 times taking pb2 as an example the adsorption thermodynamics and adsorption kinetics of hap nss were studied briefly different amounts of hap nss 0 04 g 0 06 g 0 08 g 0 10 g were dispersed in 30 ml of pb2 solution 860 mg l 1 by stirring at room temperature for 2 h the concentrations of pb2 ions in the supernatant were analyzed by icp to research the adsorption kinetics of hap nss on pb2 ions we kept the amount of hap sample unchanged 0 1 g then eight hap samples were weighted in parallel and oscillated at different time intervals 2 4 8 12 14 16 20 1440 min at room temperature at last all the supernatant obtained by centrifugation were analyzed by icp 3 results and discussion to investigate the effect of ph value of the solution on the morphology of the prepared hap nanostructures fig 1 gave the tem images of the hap samples prepared at different ph values it can be seen that the prepared hap samples presented various morphologies under different acidity conditions as can be seen from fig 1a the prepared hap sample at ph 4 0 was a fluffy spongy deposit which was composed of pellets with particle size of about 10 nm when ph increased to 7 5 the prepared hap sample was a porous sphere in shape with an average size of 140 nm and the porous structure with holes of different sizes is visible fig 1b when the ph continued to rise to 8 3 the obtained hap sample was changed from porous spheres into a solid spheres and the average particle size was significantly reduced about 31 nm with good dispersity fig 1c as seen from fig 1d when the ph further elevated slightly to 8 5 the morphology of the prepared hap sample changed greatly changing from spheres to uniform nanotubes with a length of 34 220 nm and a width of 17 45 nm finally when ph was adjusted to 9 5 the hap sample showed spherical again with an average particle size of 58 nm and the interior of these nss were porous to sum up the different morphology of the prepared hap nanostructure can be controlled by changing the ph value of the solution keeping ph 8 3 constant the effect of the reaction temperature on the morphology of the prepared hap samples during the stirring was investigated fig 2 presented the tem images of prepared hap samples at different stirring temperature conditions it can be seen that the prepared hap samples were all nanotubes in shape at different stirring temperature however the size of the gotten nanotubes varied slightly the distribution of length and width of hap nanotubes prepared at 3 c 10 c 17 c 24 c 31 c were 30 190 nm and 17 37 nm fig 2a 44 130 nm and 17 31 nm fig 2b 43 186 nm and 12 30 nm fig 2c 63 250 nm and 15 33 nm fig 2d 24 352 nm and 13 30 nm fig 2e respectively it was not difficult to find that the length of these hap nanotubes gradually became longer and the width remained basically unchanged with the stirring temperature increasing which indicated that the stirring temperature mainly affected the longitudinal growth of the nanotubes fig 2f was the xrd pattern of hap nanotubes shown in fig 2c it can be seen that the hap nanotubes displayed obvious characteristic peaks at 25 8 31 7 32 2 39 7 46 7 49 3 indicating that the main component of the sample was hap in order to investigate the effect of the additive amount of p2o5 cano3 on the morphology of hap we increased the addition of p2o5 cano3 proportionally while keeping other reaction conditions unchanged fig 3 gave the sem images of hap nss in different additive amount of p2o5 cano3 as can be seen from fig 3a when the adding amount of p2o5 cano3 was 0 04 g 0 24 g the prepared hap sample was porous nss with good dispersion and the average particle size was 76 nm when the addition of p2o5 cano3 was further increased and the gotten hap sample was still porous nss with size of 85 nm fig 3b 74 nm fig 3c 77 nm fig 3d 83 nm fig 3e 64 nm fig 3f this indicated that the increase of p source and ca source had little effect on the morphology of hap however its significance was that it can significantly increase the yield of prepared hap nss which had obvious value for further amplification of production in the future in order to investigate the adsorption property we chose the hap nss shown in fig 3a as the target materials fig 4 gave the tem a hrtem b images and electron diffraction pattern c of hap nss the prepared hap nss were porous and their diameter was 76 nm hrtem image revealed a set of fringes with the 0 35 nm interplanar spacing indicating that hap sample was single crystal corresponding selected area electron diffraction pattern fig 4c exhibited discrete spots and these spots can be easily indexed to hap crystal which was consistent with the relevant xrd pattern fig 5d the porosity of hap nss was investigated by n2 adsorption desorption measurements as shown in fig 5a the hap sample exhibited a type v isotherm with a type h2 hysteresis loop suggesting it was porous structure the bet area pore volume and pore size of the hap sample were 45 3 m2 g 1 0 23 m3 g 1 and 2 7 nm respectively fig 5c represented the ft ir spectrum of the prepared hap nss the intense peaks at 960 1041 and 1094 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of the phosphate groups in the crystal lattice of hap and the peak at 570 cm 1 was due to asymmetric bending vibration of phosphate group po4 3 kuriakose et al 2004 the peak at 3568 cm 1 was assigned to oh stretching vibration the hap nss were randomly selected for xrd characterization from fig 5d it can be seen that the hap nss presented diffraction characteristic peaks assigned to the 002 211 112 310 222 213 planes of hap crystal pdf 46 0905 which was agreement with the hap nanotubes fig 2 in order to further verify the adsorption capacity of the prepared hap nss on heavy metal ions in solution seven common heavy metal ions pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and hg2 ions were selected as research objects from fig 6a we can see that the prepared hap nss had a good adsorption capacity for every single ion in solution and the adsorption rate on pb2 cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and hg2 ions for 2 h were 99 61 30 95 71 08 70 36 79 56 98 60 and 99 90 respectively according to the comparison the adsorption capacity on these ions were hg2 pb2 zn2 ni2 cu2 co2 cd2 ions subsequently we further investigated the adsorption property of hap nss on seven mixed ions solution it can be seen in fig 6c that for the mixed ions hap sample still displayed a strong adsorption capacity for hg2 pb2 cu2 ni2 and co2 ions for 2 h with an adsorption rate of 99 fig 6b showed the relationship between the adsorption time and adsorption rate on mixed ions for hap nss it can be seen that except hg ions the adsorption rate for the other ions can reach 100 in 20 min indicating that the adsorption reaction between hap nss and mixed ions on was very fast in order to verify the stability of hap m complex hap nss adsorbed the target heavy metal ions we conducted a continuous 12 h desorption experiment except on hg2 27 65 the desorption rate of cd2 cu2 co2 ni2 zn2 and pb2 ions were 1 which showed a strong stability fig 3a it may be that the adsorption between hap and hg2 was physically adsorbed so it was easy to desorption in order to investigate the adsorption mechanism of hap on metal ions the eds analysis was conducted on the gotten hap m m means to pb cd cu co ni zn and hg elements it can be seen from eds analysis that there were cd cu co ni zn hg elements in hap m which was consistent with results of icp meanwhile we can see that atomic percent ca p of hap m was about 1 44 less than that of ca5 po4 3 oh hap 1 67 this may be because some m2 ions exchanged with ca2 ions which led to the decrease of amount of ca2 ions the hap m obtained by ion exchange reaction was very stable which was consistent with the results of desorption experiment in fig 6d equilibrium studies were carried out to determine the adsorption capacity and equilibrium constant for pb2 on hap nss generally speaking langmuir model and freundlich model were often selected to expose the adsorption relationship the linear forms of the both models were presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 c e q e 1 q m c e 1 bq m 2 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k where c e mg l 1 was the equilibrium concentration of pb2 in solution q e mg g 1 was the amount of pb2 adsorbed per gram of hap nss q m mg g 1 represented the maximum monolayer adsorption capacity and b l mg 1 was the langmuir constant k mg g 1 was the freundlich isotherm constant and 1 n was the the degree of non linearity between solution concentration and adsorption zou et al 2015 fig 7 exhibited the plots of langmuir a and freundlich b isotherms it can be seen in fig 7a that the prepared hap nss showed a large adsorption capacity and the q m was recorded as 252 53 mg g 1 at initial concentration of 860 mg l 1 which was consistent with the result of icp 254 90 mg g 1 it was indicated that the adsorption capacity of the hap nss on pb2 was higher than the reports of the academic references foroughi and zarei 2015 corami et al 2008 besides due to the higher the regression coefficients r2 0 9999 for pb2 ions adsorption the langmuir model was greatly suitable to explicate the experimental data than freundlich model r2 0 5443 kinetic study was usually conducted to analyze the adsorption time necessary for reaction equilibrium there were two kinds of kinetic model pseudo 1st and 2rd order and the kinetic equations were given as follow 3 ln q e q t k 1 t ln q e 4 t q t t q e 1 k 2 q e 2 where q e mg g 1 and q t mg g 1 were the amount of pb2 adsorbed per gram of hap nss at equilibrium and at time t respectively k 1 min 1 and k 2 g mg min 1 were the rate constant of pseudo 1st and 2rd order model respectively mahajan and sud 2014 fig 7c insert was the relationship between adsorption capacity and adsorption time of hap nss on pb2 ions in solution we can see that the adsorption capacity of the hap nss increased rapidly as extending adsorption time and quickly reached the adsorption balance after 16 min it was indicated that the adsorption reaction between hap nss and pb2 ions was fast which was consistent with the results of fig 6b fig 7c and d are the kinetic plots for pb2 ions onto hap nss we can see that r2 from the pseudo1st model was 0 9841 while that from pseudo 2rd model was r2 0 9999 which indicated that the adsorption data better fitted the pseudo 2rd kinetic model meanwhile the q e value calculated from the pseudo 2rd model 253 81 mg g 1 was very consistent with the experimental q e value 254 90 mg g 1 4 conclusions hap nanostructures with different morphologies have synthesized in a facile method and the ph value of the solution had an important effect on morphology among the hap nanostructures porous hap nss were further employed as adsorbent to remove the heavy metal ions in solution the porous hap nss displayed a high adsorption capacity on seven metal ions the hap m complex showed a good stability the adsorption of hap on metal ions was ion exchange reaction between m2 and ca2 ions langmuir model and the pseudo 2rd kinetic model were well fit the experimental equilibrium data and adsorption kinetic data the porous hap nss would be a promising nanoadsorbent for heavy metal ions in waste water acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support provided by the national natural science foundation of china grant number
