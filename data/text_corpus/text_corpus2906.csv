all additives in ac pva composites all samples have been specifically named as ap1 to ap16 for instance sample ap1 is the immobilized ac pva sample which containing 4 g ac 12 ml pva 10 ml gla 0 56 g aps and 0 1 g si while ap12 sample contained 4 g ac 32 ml pva 20 ml gla 0 56 g aps and 0 2 g si the relative strength of the casted composite on the glass plates was studied by varying the amount of pva 12 to 32 ml gla 0 to 20 ml aps 0 to 0 84 g si 0 to 0 4 g and ac 4 to 8 g in the ac pva composite table 1 summarizes the relative strength of the composite at different composition upon 30 s of sonication it was observed that the relative strength of the composite increases significantly with the increase of pva gla and aps loading pva is one of the popular synthetic polymers used as an adhesive binder due to its excellent film forming emulsifying and adhesive properties 27 on the other hand gla was used in the composite as a cross linker to improve the chemical and thermal stabilities of the immobilized ac pva composite 28 29 aps acted as surfactant to improve the dispersion of ac into the composite 28 30 31 ap12 has the optimum relative strength with pva gla and aps loadings of 32 ml 20 ml and 0 56 g respectively without the binders the ac pva composite was easily detach from the glass support further increase in the binder s composition does give significant difference in the relative strength of the immobilized ac pva composite functionalized silica filler was added to the composite to improve the stability and relative strength of the immobilized composite 28 32 however increased the amount of silica and ac in the composite slightly decreased the relative strength of the composite this observation could be attributed to the excess of silica and carbon added to the composite which reduces the mechanical and adherence strength of the composite another factor that could be considered in choosing the optimum amount of pva in ac formulation was through adsorption behavior of the immobilized ac for the removal of 20 mg l 1 2 4 d as can be seen in table 1 no significant difference in the removal of 2 4 d when the pva amount was varied within the composite for ap1 ap2 and ap3 samples where the percent removal were 95 2 94 1 and 95 5 at 60 min adsorption the effect of the different amount of gla within the ac formulation on the removal of 2 4 d was also studied for ap4 ap5 and ap6 samples in order to evaluate the optimum gla amount in the ac formulation it was observed that the additional amount of gla to 20 ml has significantly increased the percent of 2 4 d removal this could be attributed to the cross linked pva gla which enhanced not only the mechanical strength of the immobilized ac layer but also the interaction and dispersion of ac powder in the formulation 28 the removal of 2 4 d under different amount of aps for ap7 ap8 ap9 and ap10 samples in table 1 showed almost similar trend of percentage remaining it can be concluded that ap9 with 0 56 g aps was sufficient for removal of 2 4 d with higher aps loading sample like 0 84 g ap10 may affect the effectiveness of the immobilized ac layer system as an adsorbent the effect of different amount of silica for ap11 ap9 ap12 and ap13 samples were also studied as can be seen in table 1 there were no significant changes in the removal of 2 4 d as different amount of silica was added in the ac formulation different amount of ac for ap12 ap14 ap15 and ap16 samples shows that increased amount of ac to 4 g is the highest 2 4 d removal and this could be attributed to the increased in number of active sites available for adsorption process however increasing the amount of ac powder within the composite beyond 4 g showed a slightly lower percentage removal of 2 4 d based on the relative strength and percent removal of 2 4 d it can be concluded ap12 is the optimum by considering the various effect additives 3 2 characterization of ac pva composite 3 2 1 sem edx analysis the sem analysis was carried out to evaluate the surface physical morphology of commercial ac powder and ap12 sample fig 1 a c shows the sem images of commercial ac powder ap12 sample at 1000 and 5000 times magnification it can be seen from the fig 1 c that the surface of ac powder is amorphous irregular and porous which indicates a relatively high surface area on the other hand the ap12 prepared by using pva as a binder and gla as the cross linker will results in the cross linked pva chain network in the composite 33 as shown in fig 1 b the surface morphology of ac pva composite is predominantly a cross linked network and the ac particle were covered or coated under the binder chain edx analysis performed on the ac pva composite shows that the composite is composed mostly of carbon fig 1 d the peaks corresponding to oxygen and silica are extremely low and there were no other heteroatoms n p s present in the composite 3 2 2 bet analysis fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k of a commercial ac powder and b ap12 composite based on the classification by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm for both commercial ac powder and ac pva composite belongs to type ii isotherm 34 the textural properties of commercial ac powder and ap12 sample are summarized in table 2 it was observed that the surface area and total pores volume of ac powder reduced drastically after modification the bet surface area of ac powder decreased from 715 to 202 mg2 g whereas the total pore volume reduced from 62 to 21 cm3 g the decrease in the bet surface area of ac pva composite is reasonable due to the coverage of the carbon particles by the binders a similar observation was also reported by ngoh and nawi 35 related to the presence of organic binder in pva based montmorillonite the average pore size as defined by the iupac suggested that both commercial ac powder and ac pva composite consists of mesopores pore diameter 2 50 nm 34 3 2 3 ftir analysis ftir analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups of the ac pva composite fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of ac powder pva solution pva gla formulation and immobilized ap12 composite the characteristic vibration bands of ac powder are shown at 3418 and 1638 cm 1 which are attributed to stretching and bending vibration of the oh group respectively on the other hand the pva solution shows characteristic vibration at 3415 cm 1 which is assigned to oh stretching bands at 2923 and 846 cm 1 are for ch stretching peak at 1730 cm 1 corresponding to co band at 1098 cm 1 was due to co stretching 33 36 meanwhile by crosslinking pva with gla the intensity of the bands at 1638 1401 and 1098 cm 1 increases and the band at 3162 cm 1 appears while 1730 cm 1 disappears cm 1 confirming the interaction of pva gla 36 after modification of ac with pva gla the large band was observed at 3414 cm 1 which refers to o h stretching from hydrogen bonds indicating the ac composite form 3 3 adsorption study 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the removal of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite was investigated using different amount of the adsorbent on glass plate ranging from 0 87 to 3 70 mg cm 3 as shown in fig 4 the adsorption of 2 4 d was found to be high at low adsorbent dosage the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed decreased from 13 57 to 3 8 mg g 1 while the percentage removal decreased from 93 to 82 with the increased of the adsorbent dosage some factors can contribute to this observation as the loading of the adsorbent was increased the thickness and density of the immobilized adsorbent layer also increased resulting in the limited diffusion of model pollutant to the inner layer of the adsorbent 37 a similar observation was also reported by nawi et al 38 on the adsorption of reactive red 4 rr4 dye by immobilized chitosan on glass plates 3 3 2 effect of initial ph solution the initial ph of 2 4 d solution affects not only the pollutant species in the solution but also the surface charge properties of the adsorbent in this study the ph was varied from 2 0 to 8 0 in order to obtain the best ph for the adsorption fig 5 shows that the optimum ph for the adsorption of 2 4 d was at ph 3 0 with 15 74 mg g 1 of 2 4 d adsorbed and 98 3 removed the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed was found to decrease with increasing ph the pka value of 2 4 d is 2 98 39 therefore 2 4 d is dominantly present in anionic states at ph above 2 9 and becomes predominantly uncharged at ph below the pka value as the ph increased beyond the pka value the degree of dissociation of 2 4 d also increased making it more negatively charged the decrease in the equilibrium adsorption capacity with increasing solution ph could be attributed to increased repulsion between the negatively charged functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent and the negatively charge 2 4 d molecules 37 40 3 3 3 effect of initial 2 4 d concentration and contact time the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 was studied at different initial 2 4 d concentrations 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 and contact time 0 120 min as depicted in fig 6 the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed on the surface of the ap12 composite was increased with time until the equilibrium the equilibrium time is however depending on the initial concentrations of 2 4 d the adsorption was initially fast within 15 min but progressively slow at the later stage until equilibrium was reached during the initial stage a large number of vacant active sites are available for adsorption at the later stage the adsorption slowed down due to the repulsion forces existing between 2 4 d molecules and negative charged oh co and so functional group from pva in the absorbance the equilibrium was attained within 60 90 and 120 min for the initial concentrations of 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 respectively the higher the initial concentration is the longer time required to attain the equilibrium the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed also increased with the increasing of the initial concentrations might be due to the extra reinforcement from 2 4 d in adsorbing to the surface of immobilized ap12 the amount adsorbed increases from 15 74 to 41 40 mg g 1 with the increase of initial concentrations from 20 to 60 mg l 1 this observation is similar to the adsorption of 2 4 d on granular ac 41 3 4 adsorption kinetics two non linear kinetic models the pseudo first order and pseudo second order 24 42 were used to determine the mechanism and the rate controlling step the predicted non linear pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite is illustrated in fig 6 table 3 shows the calculated kinetic data obtained from both models it was observed that the experimental value was well fitted by the pseudo second order kinetic model this means that the adsorption 2 4 d by ap12 is chemisorption with respect to operational conditions used in this study similar observations were also reported by njoku et al 43 for the adsorption of 2 4 d by pumpkin seed hull ac the experimental results were are also fitted to the weber s intraparticle diffusion in which the model is expressed as 44 13 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and c is the intercept related to the boundary layer effect mg g 1 the values of kid and c can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of qt versus t1 2 fig 7 if the regression of qt versus t1 2 is linear and passes through the origin then the adsorption is controlled solely by the intraparticle diffusion 45 on the other hand the intercept of the plot reflects the boundary layer effect the larger the intercept the greater the contribution of the surface sorption in the rate controlling step 46 the plots in fig 7 consist of two separate stages the first stage of the plot was close to the origin indicating that the intraparticle diffusion is the only rate limiting step however the second stage of the plot did not pass through the origin this indicates that the intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate limiting step 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm was used to describe the equilibrium distribution of the 2 4 d molecules at the solid liquid phases 36 fig 8 shows the adsorption isotherm plots of the langmuir and freundlich models for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite table 4 summarizes the calculated parameters of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir isotherm fits well with the experimental data which was attributed to homogenous distribution of active site on the immobilized ap12 composite since the langmuir isotherm assumes that the surface is homogenous 47 the r2 and rmse values for both models suggested that the langmuir model was more convenient in describing the adsorption of 2 4 d onto the immobilized ap12 composite the qmax of 2 4 d was found to be 55 48 mg g 1 the value obtained was comparable with other adsorbents reported in the literature table 5 although some of the reported adsorbent have higher qmax the immobilized ac pva composite is suggested as a potent adsorbent for the removal of 2 4 d due to its practical and greener adsorbent 3 6 reusability of the adsorbent the reusability of the immobilized ap12 was investigated via three consecutive recycled applications of the same adsorbent on the removal of three different sets of 2 4 d in same condition 20 mg l 1 all the experiments were done in triplicates under identical conditions and the results is reported as the average fig 9 the significant reusability of immobilized ap12 is due to the cross linked pva on immobilized ap12 composite which has been proved by sem and ftir analyses as presented in fig 9 the removal of 2 4 d was slightly decreased after 3 times of repeated uses of the immobilized ap12 however the immobilized adsorbent offers an ease of recycled technique where no separation of the adsorbent needed after each cycle of application considering the simple and environmental friendly method of preparation and regeneration the immobilized ap12 was a good potential adsorbent for 2 4 d removal from wastewater 4 conclusion immobilized ap12 have been successfully fabricated and applied for the adsorption of 2 4 d based on the relative strength of the immobilized adsorbent the final composition of ac pva gla aps and si composite was 4 g 32 ml 20 ml 0 56 g and 0 1 g respectively the adsorption kinetic studies demonstrated that the adsorption obeyed the pseudo second order rate model which indicates chemisorptions as being the rate controlling step furthermore the langmuir isotherm model yields a better fit than the freundlich isotherm due to its better r2 and rmse values the qmax calculated for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 was 55 9 mg g the immobilized adsorbent shows a relatively good reusability performance which suggested that the immobilized ap12 is an effective and promising adsorbent for herbicide removal

ac pva composite was immersed into the glass cell containing 20 ml of 2 4 d solution at various concentrations the solution was aerated with air at 100 ml min 1 for proper mixing and improve mass transport of the pollutant towards the immobilized adsorbent the adsorption process was optimized by varying the adsorbent dosage 0 87 3 7 mg cm 2 solution ph 2 8 contact time 0 2 h and initial dye

all additives in ac pva composites all samples have been specifically named as ap1 to ap16 for instance sample ap1 is the immobilized ac pva sample which containing 4 g ac 12 ml pva 10 ml gla 0 56 g aps and 0 1 g si while ap12 sample contained 4 g ac 32 ml pva 20 ml gla 0 56 g aps and 0 2 g si the relative strength of the casted composite on the glass plates was studied by varying the amount of pva 12 to 32 ml gla 0 to 20 ml aps 0 to 0 84 g si 0 to 0 4 g and ac 4 to 8 g in the ac pva composite table 1 summarizes the relative strength of the composite at different composition upon 30 s of sonication it was observed that the relative strength of the composite increases significantly with the increase of pva gla and aps loading pva is one of the popular synthetic polymers used as an adhesive binder due to its excellent film forming emulsifying and adhesive properties 27 on the other hand gla was used in the composite as a cross linker to improve the chemical and thermal stabilities of the immobilized ac pva composite 28 29 aps acted as surfactant to improve the dispersion of ac into the composite 28 30 31 ap12 has the optimum relative strength with pva gla and aps loadings of 32 ml 20 ml and 0 56 g respectively without the binders the ac pva composite was easily detach from the glass support further increase in the binder s composition does give significant difference in the relative strength of the immobilized ac pva composite functionalized silica filler was added to the composite to improve the stability and relative strength of the immobilized composite 28 32 however increased the amount of silica and ac in the composite slightly decreased the relative strength of the composite this observation could be attributed to the excess of silica and carbon added to the composite which reduces the mechanical and adherence strength of the composite another factor that could be considered in choosing the optimum amount of pva in ac formulation was through adsorption behavior of the immobilized ac for the removal of 20 mg l 1 2 4 d as can be seen in table 1 no significant difference in the removal of 2 4 d when the pva amount was varied within the composite for ap1 ap2 and ap3 samples where the percent removal were 95 2 94 1 and 95 5 at 60 min adsorption the effect of the different amount of gla within the ac formulation on the removal of 2 4 d was also studied for ap4 ap5 and ap6 samples in order to evaluate the optimum gla amount in the ac formulation it was observed that the additional amount of gla to 20 ml has significantly increased the percent of 2 4 d removal this could be attributed to the cross linked pva gla which enhanced not only the mechanical strength of the immobilized ac layer but also the interaction and dispersion of ac powder in the formulation 28 the removal of 2 4 d under different amount of aps for ap7 ap8 ap9 and ap10 samples in table 1 showed almost similar trend of percentage remaining it can be concluded that ap9 with 0 56 g aps was sufficient for removal of 2 4 d with higher aps loading sample like 0 84 g ap10 may affect the effectiveness of the immobilized ac layer system as an adsorbent the effect of different amount of silica for ap11 ap9 ap12 and ap13 samples were also studied as can be seen in table 1 there were no significant changes in the removal of 2 4 d as different amount of silica was added in the ac formulation different amount of ac for ap12 ap14 ap15 and ap16 samples shows that increased amount of ac to 4 g is the highest 2 4 d removal and this could be attributed to the increased in number of active sites available for adsorption process however increasing the amount of ac powder within the composite beyond 4 g showed a slightly lower percentage removal of 2 4 d based on the relative strength and percent removal of 2 4 d it can be concluded ap12 is the optimum by considering the various effect additives 3 2 characterization of ac pva composite 3 2 1 sem edx analysis the sem analysis was carried out to evaluate the surface physical morphology of commercial ac powder and ap12 sample fig 1 a c shows the sem images of commercial ac powder ap12 sample at 1000 and 5000 times magnification it can be seen from the fig 1 c that the surface of ac powder is amorphous irregular and porous which indicates a relatively high surface area on the other hand the ap12 prepared by using pva as a binder and gla as the cross linker will results in the cross linked pva chain network in the composite 33 as shown in fig 1 b the surface morphology of ac pva composite is predominantly a cross linked network and the ac particle were covered or coated under the binder chain edx analysis performed on the ac pva composite shows that the composite is composed mostly of carbon fig 1 d the peaks corresponding to oxygen and silica are extremely low and there were no other heteroatoms n p s present in the composite 3 2 2 bet analysis fig 2 shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm at 77 k of a commercial ac powder and b ap12 composite based on the classification by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm for both commercial ac powder and ac pva composite belongs to type ii isotherm 34 the textural properties of commercial ac powder and ap12 sample are summarized in table 2 it was observed that the surface area and total pores volume of ac powder reduced drastically after modification the bet surface area of ac powder decreased from 715 to 202 mg2 g whereas the total pore volume reduced from 62 to 21 cm3 g the decrease in the bet surface area of ac pva composite is reasonable due to the coverage of the carbon particles by the binders a similar observation was also reported by ngoh and nawi 35 related to the presence of organic binder in pva based montmorillonite the average pore size as defined by the iupac suggested that both commercial ac powder and ac pva composite consists of mesopores pore diameter 2 50 nm 34 3 2 3 ftir analysis ftir analysis was carried out to identify the functional groups of the ac pva composite fig 3 shows the ftir spectra of ac powder pva solution pva gla formulation and immobilized ap12 composite the characteristic vibration bands of ac powder are shown at 3418 and 1638 cm 1 which are attributed to stretching and bending vibration of the oh group respectively on the other hand the pva solution shows characteristic vibration at 3415 cm 1 which is assigned to oh stretching bands at 2923 and 846 cm 1 are for ch stretching peak at 1730 cm 1 corresponding to co band at 1098 cm 1 was due to co stretching 33 36 meanwhile by crosslinking pva with gla the intensity of the bands at 1638 1401 and 1098 cm 1 increases and the band at 3162 cm 1 appears while 1730 cm 1 disappears cm 1 confirming the interaction of pva gla 36 after modification of ac with pva gla the large band was observed at 3414 cm 1 which refers to o h stretching from hydrogen bonds indicating the ac composite form 3 3 adsorption study 3 3 1 effect of adsorbent dosage the removal of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite was investigated using different amount of the adsorbent on glass plate ranging from 0 87 to 3 70 mg cm 3 as shown in fig 4 the adsorption of 2 4 d was found to be high at low adsorbent dosage the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed decreased from 13 57 to 3 8 mg g 1 while the percentage removal decreased from 93 to 82 with the increased of the adsorbent dosage some factors can contribute to this observation as the loading of the adsorbent was increased the thickness and density of the immobilized adsorbent layer also increased resulting in the limited diffusion of model pollutant to the inner layer of the adsorbent 37 a similar observation was also reported by nawi et al 38 on the adsorption of reactive red 4 rr4 dye by immobilized chitosan on glass plates 3 3 2 effect of initial ph solution the initial ph of 2 4 d solution affects not only the pollutant species in the solution but also the surface charge properties of the adsorbent in this study the ph was varied from 2 0 to 8 0 in order to obtain the best ph for the adsorption fig 5 shows that the optimum ph for the adsorption of 2 4 d was at ph 3 0 with 15 74 mg g 1 of 2 4 d adsorbed and 98 3 removed the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed was found to decrease with increasing ph the pka value of 2 4 d is 2 98 39 therefore 2 4 d is dominantly present in anionic states at ph above 2 9 and becomes predominantly uncharged at ph below the pka value as the ph increased beyond the pka value the degree of dissociation of 2 4 d also increased making it more negatively charged the decrease in the equilibrium adsorption capacity with increasing solution ph could be attributed to increased repulsion between the negatively charged functional groups on the surface of the adsorbent and the negatively charge 2 4 d molecules 37 40 3 3 3 effect of initial 2 4 d concentration and contact time the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 was studied at different initial 2 4 d concentrations 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 and contact time 0 120 min as depicted in fig 6 the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed on the surface of the ap12 composite was increased with time until the equilibrium the equilibrium time is however depending on the initial concentrations of 2 4 d the adsorption was initially fast within 15 min but progressively slow at the later stage until equilibrium was reached during the initial stage a large number of vacant active sites are available for adsorption at the later stage the adsorption slowed down due to the repulsion forces existing between 2 4 d molecules and negative charged oh co and so functional group from pva in the absorbance the equilibrium was attained within 60 90 and 120 min for the initial concentrations of 20 40 and 60 mg l 1 respectively the higher the initial concentration is the longer time required to attain the equilibrium the amount of 2 4 d adsorbed also increased with the increasing of the initial concentrations might be due to the extra reinforcement from 2 4 d in adsorbing to the surface of immobilized ap12 the amount adsorbed increases from 15 74 to 41 40 mg g 1 with the increase of initial concentrations from 20 to 60 mg l 1 this observation is similar to the adsorption of 2 4 d on granular ac 41 3 4 adsorption kinetics two non linear kinetic models the pseudo first order and pseudo second order 24 42 were used to determine the mechanism and the rate controlling step the predicted non linear pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite is illustrated in fig 6 table 3 shows the calculated kinetic data obtained from both models it was observed that the experimental value was well fitted by the pseudo second order kinetic model this means that the adsorption 2 4 d by ap12 is chemisorption with respect to operational conditions used in this study similar observations were also reported by njoku et al 43 for the adsorption of 2 4 d by pumpkin seed hull ac the experimental results were are also fitted to the weber s intraparticle diffusion in which the model is expressed as 44 13 q t k i t 1 2 c where ki is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant mg g 1 min 1 2 and c is the intercept related to the boundary layer effect mg g 1 the values of kid and c can be obtained from the slope and intercept of the linear plot of qt versus t1 2 fig 7 if the regression of qt versus t1 2 is linear and passes through the origin then the adsorption is controlled solely by the intraparticle diffusion 45 on the other hand the intercept of the plot reflects the boundary layer effect the larger the intercept the greater the contribution of the surface sorption in the rate controlling step 46 the plots in fig 7 consist of two separate stages the first stage of the plot was close to the origin indicating that the intraparticle diffusion is the only rate limiting step however the second stage of the plot did not pass through the origin this indicates that the intraparticle diffusion was not the only rate limiting step 3 5 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherm was used to describe the equilibrium distribution of the 2 4 d molecules at the solid liquid phases 36 fig 8 shows the adsorption isotherm plots of the langmuir and freundlich models for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 composite table 4 summarizes the calculated parameters of the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the langmuir isotherm fits well with the experimental data which was attributed to homogenous distribution of active site on the immobilized ap12 composite since the langmuir isotherm assumes that the surface is homogenous 47 the r2 and rmse values for both models suggested that the langmuir model was more convenient in describing the adsorption of 2 4 d onto the immobilized ap12 composite the qmax of 2 4 d was found to be 55 48 mg g 1 the value obtained was comparable with other adsorbents reported in the literature table 5 although some of the reported adsorbent have higher qmax the immobilized ac pva composite is suggested as a potent adsorbent for the removal of 2 4 d due to its practical and greener adsorbent 3 6 reusability of the adsorbent the reusability of the immobilized ap12 was investigated via three consecutive recycled applications of the same adsorbent on the removal of three different sets of 2 4 d in same condition 20 mg l 1 all the experiments were done in triplicates under identical conditions and the results is reported as the average fig 9 the significant reusability of immobilized ap12 is due to the cross linked pva on immobilized ap12 composite which has been proved by sem and ftir analyses as presented in fig 9 the removal of 2 4 d was slightly decreased after 3 times of repeated uses of the immobilized ap12 however the immobilized adsorbent offers an ease of recycled technique where no separation of the adsorbent needed after each cycle of application considering the simple and environmental friendly method of preparation and regeneration the immobilized ap12 was a good potential adsorbent for 2 4 d removal from wastewater 4 conclusion immobilized ap12 have been successfully fabricated and applied for the adsorption of 2 4 d based on the relative strength of the immobilized adsorbent the final composition of ac pva gla aps and si composite was 4 g 32 ml 20 ml 0 56 g and 0 1 g respectively the adsorption kinetic studies demonstrated that the adsorption obeyed the pseudo second order rate model which indicates chemisorptions as being the rate controlling step furthermore the langmuir isotherm model yields a better fit than the freundlich isotherm due to its better r2 and rmse values the qmax calculated for the adsorption of 2 4 d by the immobilized ap12 was 55 9 mg g the immobilized adsorbent shows a relatively good reusability performance which suggested that the immobilized ap12 is an effective and promising adsorbent for herbicide removal

14531,the study analyzes a potential to improve the local waste and wastewater management in a finnish community the lappeenranta wastewater treatment plant wwtp is used as a case study two different technological setups are considered for improving the wastewater treatment plant these are used to construct four alternative wastewater reclamation scenarios the mass and energy balances for the considered scenarios are developed and used as input for the profitability evaluation the utilization of the sewage sludge from the wwtp and municipal solid waste fraction that cannot be recycled for the generation of heat and electricity at the chp plant is investigated with the aim to improve the economic performance of the wastewater treatment facility the studied scenarios are initially compared based on their investment and operational costs the cost of water treatment increases significantly in the case of the investigated tertiary treatment systems higher amounts of chemicals and electricity are needed to improve the water quality at the same time the study indicates that the profitability of a wwtp integrated with a chp plant can be reasonably high in a wide range of likely price scenarios for alternative wastewater purification systems the results of the analysis showed a significant potential for the investigated wastewater reclamation systems to improve the efficiency of solid waste and wastewater management in the community keywords wastewater treatment plant sewage sludge municipal solid waste economic analysis fluidized bed boiler 1 introduction urban wastewater is a mixture of wastewater from domestic and industrial sources and in many cases also from rainwater run offs discharge of urban wastewater into natural water basins leads to high levels of nutrient pollution causing eutrophication 1 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp which usually include chemical physical and biological treatment processes cannot fully prevent nutrient pollution as a result the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds originating from wwtp discharge in many rivers and lakes in the european union eu are relatively high 2 in addition to the nutrient pollution there are increasing health concerns about the harmful effects of micro plastics pesticides hormones drugs antibiotics fire retardants and heavy metals finding their way into the fresh water supply these man made environmental challenges urgently require systemic and sustainable solutions wastewater reclamation and reuse is one of the most promising solutions for decreasing the pollution run offs into rivers and lakes 2 the effluents of a conventional wwtp can be treated further and reused for example for irrigation or for various industrial purposes under certain conditions water reuse may have a lower environmental impact than utilization of other alternatives of fresh water supply such as water transfer or desalination 3 in addition it can enable the recovery of nutrients resulting in a reduction of raw materials required for fertilizer production 4 despite the possible advantages of the wastewater reclamation and reuse it is not common in the eu mainly due to the low economical attractiveness of reuse solutions and a lack of common eu environmental standards 2 in 2015 the european commission presented an action plan for the circular economy to promote the water reuse 5 one of the proposed actions was to set minimum quality requirements for the use of reclaimed water in agricultural irrigation to reduce the need for over precautionary approaches and unnecessary treatment costs in addition in 2016 the european commission approved guidelines for the harmonization of water reuse practices across the eu 6 despite this progress the economic attractiveness of wastewater reclamation and reuse is still an open question the issue of cost of water reclamation is especially important in finland where despite advanced wwtp systems effluent discharges have caused significant nutrient pollution in many lakes and the baltic sea for example in 2010 the accumulated level of nutrient pollution in lake haapajÃ¤rvi in the lappeenranta region was unacceptably high and temporary drying of the whole lake had to be implemented in order to improve its ecological situation 7 currently in finland due to the wide availability and low cost of clean surface and ground water water is consumed without long term consideration of the consequences of the so far limited implementation of wastewater reclamation and reuse leading to continued effluent discharges into waterways and lakes such a situation leads to gradual pollution of potential surface water resources moreover the contaminants from municipal and industrial waste sources can be transferred via rivers to the baltic sea which is almost totally surrounded by agricultural land and presents a vulnerable ecosystem which is highly endangered by continued pollution wastewater reclamation and reuse is not only a solution to the problem of limiting the contamination of fresh water resources but it also offers a new reusable fresh water supply therefore it is extremely important to study the profitability of investing in enhanced treatment of wastewater on a global and local scale in this work a concept for de centralized waste management is analyzed the aim of the study is to assess the potential of the concept to improve the economic feasibility of wastewater reclamation in finland the region of south karelia is considered as a case study to improve the quality of the treated wastewater at the lappeenranta wwtp two tertiary treatment systems which consist of a ultrafiltration uf membranes a reverse osmosis ro membranes filtration and an ultraviolet uv disinfection are considered these tertiary treatment technologies are selected as they are commonly implemented for the production of reclaimed water from wastewater effluent 8 at present membrane technologies have been broadly applied for deep treatment of different types of wastewaters 9 11 the combination of uf membranes and ultrasound for cleaning the municipal wastewaters was experimentally investigated by borea et al 12 krahnstÃ¶ver et al 13 demonstrated the separation efficiency of uf membranes in a pilot scale wastewater reclamation system ro membrane technology is a fully mature technology for the desalination of seawater 14 15 and ro membranes have been used effectively for removing salts and organic compounds from industrial and municipal wastewaters 16 gÃ¼ndoÄdu et al 17 showed that by integrating membrane bioreactor mbr with nanofiltration and ro processes it is possible to produce water which well satisfies the quality standard requirements for use in agricultural irrigation and as process water therefore reverse osmosis technologies are installed and used in wastewater reclamation plants generally to act as a final stage treatment process 18 various combinations of membrane filtration technologies membrane bioreactor with reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration unit with reverse osmosis have been tested in a pilot study in 19 the pilot study showed that both systems demonstrate excellent performance for the treatment of wastewater stream however to the best knowledge of the authors the majority of these studies only look at one or a couple of treatment methods but they do not provide the comprehensive comparison between possible configurations moreover there is lack of studies identifying the determinants of economic efficiency improvement of a wwtp when modern tertiary treatment technologies are used therefore in this article the integration of the wastewater sludge and the municipal solid waste msw co incineration within the wastewater treatment process is evaluated from the perspective of improving the economic feasibility of a wwtp that is equipped with modern tertiary treatment technologies based on the selected tertiary treatment systems four different scenarios are considered to analyze the suggested de centralized waste management concept 2 material and methods 2 1 current wastewater treatment system and processes the study uses the waste and wastewater management data of the lappeenranta wwtp example case the latest complete annual data is available from the year 2016 which is used in this work if not mentioned otherwise lappeenranta is the capital of the south karelia region which is situated on the shores of lake saimaa and has a population density of 24 6 inhabitants km2 corresponding to the average finnish population density 20 there are 132 000 inhabitants in the south karelian area of which 73 000 live in the city of lappeenranta the average amount of wastewater generated in lappeenranta is 16 000 m3 day and most of the wastewater is produced by households 21 the lappeenranta wwtp is the largest wwtp in the south karelia region 22 the wwtp applies chemical and biological means to treat the wastewater the majority of the phosphorous is removed from the wastewater by applying chemicals such as ferrous sulphate pix 105 and the average efficiency of phosphorus removal by this procedure ranges up to about 96 21 calcium hydroxide is used to maintain an adequate level of alkalinity the annual consumption of ferrous sulphate and calcium hydroxide are 791 t and 555 t respectively nitrogen is mostly removed by using biological treatment methods with an average removal efficiency of 61 21 moreover sodium hypochlorite 15 is used for the disinfection of the wastewater after biological treatment the consumption of this chemical is 8 tons per year the sludge produced from wastewater treatment has a total solids ts concentration of 3 5 and is dewatered with centrifuges up to 21 ts by using polymer zetag 8165 which is consumed at an average rate of 8 8 t a 21 finally the sludge is transported over a distance of 20 km to the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant fig 1 for composting with other biomasses lappeenranta wwtp produces about 9600 t a of 21 ts sewage sludge the current cost of the transportation and treatment of the sewage sludge is about 80 t the electric energy consumption of the lappeenranta wwtp in 2016 was 2 1 gwh 21 the renovation of the lappeenranta wwtp is currently under consideration the new wwtp would include a tertiary treatment system which should improve the characteristics of the effluent table 1 shows a comparison of the characteristics of the effluent produced in the existing and the planned lappeenranta wwtp the municipal solid waste msw produced in the south karelia region is collected by the municipality the msw is source separated into fractions of biodegradable waste glass metals cardboard and paper by the inhabitants in the considered area 23 the fractions that cannot be subjected to any material recovery are directed to the riihimÃ¤ki chp plant for incineration located 219 km from the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant in 2016 25 000 tons of mixed msw with 75 ts were delivered from the south karelian waste management centre in kukkuroinmÃ¤ki to the riihimÃ¤ki chp plant 24 the current gate cost for the mixed msw in riihimÃ¤ki is 55 t of the mixed msw the major share of the mixed msw is produced in the largest cities of the region lappeenranta and imatra the part of the mixed msw which is produced in the rural areas of the south karelia region is estimated to total only 3100 t a 23 2 2 scenarios a scenario based cost benefit approach is developed to assess the potential of improving the wastewater and waste management in the considered area the concept of industrial symbiosis is implemented in the scenario building industrial symbiosis in wastewater management focuses on taking maximum advantage of the flows of resources such as materials energy water and by products generated during the treatment processes industrial symbiosis is understood here as the process that potentially can support the establishment of an industrial ecosystem in the field of waste and wastewater management 25 in the first scenario a wwtp with a tertiary treatment system including ultrafiltration uf and ultraviolet uv light disinfection is investigated this system was suggested for the improvement of the lappeenranta wwtp by pÃ¶yry finland oy in its final report based upon a study completed in 2013 by the company 26 the report showed that the suggested tertiary treatment system could meet the strict requirements set for the effluent 27 moreover the report showed that by using uf followed by uv disinfection for the wastewater reclamation processes it is possible to achieve acceptable results allowing the reuse of water for irrigation 28 additionally sand filtering is included in the system prior to uf to prevent fouling and damage to the uf membranes similarly as it was done in 28 29 in this scenario the sludge is still transported to the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant the msw is directed to the riihimÃ¤ki chp incineration plant in the second scenario the previously discussed tertiary system is improved by adding a reverse osmosis ro system the ro process provides a notably high removal efficiency for a wide range of wastewater contaminants 30 however if the feed water quality is not suitable fouling of the ro membranes can significantly reduce their lifetime therefore a pre treatment system is necessary for ro ultrafiltration is considered as one of the possible pre treatment systems for the ro which can reduce the fouling and increase the flux by 30 50 compared to the ro system without uf 31 a uf ro tertiary treatment system was previously analysed for the water reuse in 32 36 and it has showed a noticeably good performance in wastewater reclamation the treatment of the ro concentrate is performed similarly as reported by erdal et al 37 where the concentrate volume reduction is performed by using a vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep followed by a thermal treatment the latter is performed with a brine concentrator with mechanical vapour recompression mvr and a mvr crystallizer the sludge and msw are treated in the same way as in the previous scenario the third scenario implements the same tertiary treatment system as the first scenario but it additionally includes integration of the chp unit into the wastewater treatment process the mixture of the sewage sludge and the msw streams is selected as a fuel for the chp unit the co combustion option is selected to improve the combustion efficiency and the economic feasibility of the incineration plant msw is used as the primary fuel due to its higher heating value compared to the sludge also it increases the total amount of available fuel in the considered area 38 40 the incineration of the msw and the sludge in the area where they are produced significantly reduces the transportation costs in comparison with the previous scenarios before incineration the msw is converted to solid recovered fuel srf and sludge is dried up to 70 ts which is enough to convert it from a viscous dough to a granular solid material 41 a circulating fluidized bed furnace is selected for the incineration as it is a proven technology which can effectively dispose different kinds of fuels including wastes 42 it is assumed that the ash from the fuel combustion is disposed of in the local landfill in the fourth scenario the treatment system of the second scenario and the co combustion option of the third scenario are integrated the reject from the vsep system is dewatered in a zero liquid discharge zld system by thermal treatment process in this scenario a multiple effect evaporator and a steam driven crystallizer are used instead of brine concentrator and mvr crystallizer correspondingly such a configuration is chosen to utilize the available heat energy from the chp unit more efficiently the reject left from the zld system is transported to riihimÃ¤ki for further thermal treatment and the ash from the fuel combustion is disposed in the local landfill 3 mass end energy balances 3 1 wastewater treatment plant the mass balance of the considered wwtp is based on the information presented in 21 a simplified block diagram of the wwtp is shown in fig 2 based on the forecast of the wastewater production in lappeenranta the average influent flow rate of the wwtp is assumed to be equal to 20 000 m3 d in the future 22 based on the measured data of the lappeenranta wwtp influent flow rate the maximum influent flow rate is assumed to be 60 higher than the average resulting in 32 000 m3 d 21 the average consumption of 11 2 ferric sulphate and calcium hydroxide are estimated to be 134 g m3 and 95 g m3 respectively 21 the 21 ts sludge production is estimated by assuming its proportional dependence on the influent flow 11 500 t a and 18 400 t a for the average and maximum capacities respectively the sludge flow rate is estimated by considering the solid specific gravity 1 2 kg m3 43 and 97 of solids removal efficiency in the sludge dewatering system 26 the average polymer consumption is assumed to be 4 4 g kg of sludge ts 21 the effluent flow rate is estimated to be 19 800 m3 d and 31 700 m3 d for the average and the maximum influent flow rates respectively the average energy consumption of the components of the new wwtp is calculated based on longo et al 44 and presented in appendix table a 1 the energy consumption of the grit removal process is assumed to be equal to 2 of the total energy consumption 44 3 2 tertiary treatment a simplified diagram of the uf tertiary treatment system for the first and the third scenario is shown in fig 3 the mass and energy balances of the uf system are obtained from the uf system budgetary proposal a coagulation and pre chlorination of the sludge are necessary prior to the uf unit the usage of 0 6 t d of 35 ferric chloride and 2 7 t d of 10 3 sodium hypochlorite are suggested by the uf membranes manufacturer for the coagulation and pre chlorination process the membrane cleaning is performed by citric acid and 33 hydrochloric acid with annual consumptions estimated as 11 4 t a and 17 8 t a respectively the influent and effluent flow rates are estimated neglecting the flow rates of the chemical treatment which are relatively small compared to the wastewater flow rate due to the uf concentrate recirculation to the wwtp in the selected configuration it is assumed that a generation of the sludge increases by 20 compared to the sludge generation in original wwtp the ro tertiary system is considered as an extension of the previously described treatment system after uf additional chemical dosing is necessary to prevent damaging and fouling of the ro membranes the use of sodium bisulphite an antiscalant and a biocide are suggested for this by the manufacturer the estimated consumption of the sodium bisulphite and the antiscalant are 3 and 1 mg l respectively the biocide should be used periodically for 30 min per week with a concentration of 100 mg l the cleaning of the ro membranes is suggested to be performed four times annually with acid and alkaline surfactants the chemical consumption of the clean in place cip process is estimated to be equal to 20 5 t a a simplified diagram of the uf ro tertiary treatment system for the second and the fourth scenario is shown in fig 4 the mass and energy balances of the vsep are created based on the information obtained from the manufacturer the daily chemical consumption of the cip process is estimated to be 114 l d the volume reduction in the brine concentrator in zld system is assumed to be 90 45 the mass and energy balances of the multiple effect evaporator and the crystallizer for the fourth scenario are calculated using the methods presented by zacharias et al 46 and bennett et al 47 the energy consumption rates of the components of the tertiary treatment systems are shown in table 2 3 3 sludge and municipal solid waste pre treatment the typical process for the srf production presented by wilÃ©n et al 53 is considered for the msw pre treatment before incineration fig 5 pre shredding is used to decrease the particle size of the mixed msw below 150 mm to prevent problems in the subsequent processing stages the metal particles are removed from the shredded msw by magnetic separation the separation of the bio waste is done during the sorting process with a drum screen post shredding is used to decrease the particle size below 50 mm ballistic separation is applied to remove any remaining heavy impurities such as glass and hard plastics the assumed average efficiency of the srf production is 75 53 the assumed average amount of metals in the msw is 3 53 54 the shares of the bio waste and other heavy impurities are assumed to be 19 and 3 of the msw input respectively on the basis of the operation data of the tarastenjÃ¤rvi plant 53 the sewage sludge is dried up to 70 ts by using a belt drying system with heat supply from the chp unit with the required heat energy consumption of 800 kwh per ton of evaporated moisture the energy consumption of the fuel pre treatment process is given in table 3 the annual electrical demand of the fuel preparation process is 1 1 gwh a corresponding to 125 kw average power 3 4 fluidized bed incinerator mass and energy balance calculations for the sewage sludge and srf thermal treatment processes are performed for a small scale circulating fluidized bed cfb incinerator fig 6 the full load case performance and the complete combustion of the input fuel to flue gas and ash are assumed the properties of the srf and sludge are presented in appendix table a 2 the proximate analysis and the heating values are based on measurements 61 while the ultimate analysis values are based on reported literature values 62 68 the incinerator is designed with combustion air ratio of 1 31 apparent gas velocity of 4 7 m s and residual oxygen of 4 2 vol in the flue gas to keep the incinerator temperature over the required 850 c an adiabatic refractory covered construction is considered in this construction one heat exchanger is located in the return leg to control the incinerator temperature while the rest of the heat transfer surfaces are located in the backpass a small steam turbine 69 is used to generate electricity from the steam and the rest of the steam is condensed and utilized as heat the turbine operates with 405 c and 20 bar input steam and the condensing take place at 80 c at 0 47 bar with these values and about 83 7 isentropic efficiency the turbogenerator can attain 21 process efficiency in electricity production the incinerator unit produces 2 1 mw of electricity and 8 1 mw of thermal output at full load the auxiliary power consumption is estimated based on saari et al 70 flue gas treatment consists of the injection of activated carbon and limestone to capture the heavy metal sulphur dioxide chlorine fluorine as well as dioxins and furans a selective catalytic reduction to control nitrous oxide emission and a bag filters to reduce the particulate emissions before the stack 71 73 an ash residue of 4 6 t d is generated from the incineration and it is assumed to be landfilled results of the thermal conversion and steam production are presented in appendixes table a 3 and table a 4 4 economic analysis the equipment of the considered tertiary treatment systems is sized on the basis of the maximum influent flow rate 32 000 m3 d the design capacity of each item obtained from the mass and energy balances is increased by an over design factor 10 to mitigate the design uncertainties and possible alterations of the operating performance 74 the cost of purchased equipment pec is calculated by means of cost indices and scaling factors chemical engineering plant cost index cepci is used to estimate the cost of the equipment based on available data all prices are converted to year 2015 euros data in us dollars usd are converted to euros with the average annual exchange rate 75 1 cost 2015 cost usd y cepci 2015 cepci y y usd y the scaling factors allow the estimation of the cost of equipment based on the available data for similar equipment at different capacity 74 76 2 cost a cost b x a x b Î± where Î± is a scaling factor value of 0 6 is used if no other information is available and x is the capacity of the equipment besides the cost of purchased equipment the total module cost cbm is needed for further calculation the cbm of equipment includes the cost of equipment and other cost factors directly related to the commissioning i e instrumentation and controls equipment erection and construction expenses piping and electrical equipment and materials as a result it can be significantly higher than the purchased equipment cost if no item specific data is available the ratio cbm pec is assumed to be 2 2 for the incinerator plant components and 3 3 for the tertiary treatment systems and the fuel preparation units 76 the equipment list for the considered systems together with the total module costs are listed in table 4 the total capital investment tci required for the project implementation consists of several individual expense factors the assumptions for the tci components are taken from 74 76 the offsite costs 45 pec include the cost of land ancillary buildings site development and utilities engineering and supervision 12 pec covers the cost for construction design together with procurement and construction supervision start up expenses 10 pec amount to the cost of possible start up changes in materials and equipment and loss of income while the plant is operating at partial capacity the contractor s fee 5 of indirect and

capital 15 fci estimates the total amount of money needed above the fixed capital to start up the plant and operate until the moment incomes is received 5 results and discussion 5 1 tci and operating cost the analysis of the tci shows that the implementation of scenario 2 with uf ro system require almost in 3 times higher capital investments 24 6 m compared to the tci of scenario 1 9 1 m the main reason is the high cost of ro and vsep units which accounts for nearly a half of the total equipment costs in scenario 2 the integration of the chp unit in the wastewater treatment process also significantly increases the tci of scenarios 3 24 m and 4 40 8 m compared to the tci of scenarios 1 and 2 the notable increasing of the tci cost in scenarios 3 and 4 is explained by the high cost of the incinerator plant which is equal to 60 of the tci in scenario 3 and 40 of the tci in scenario 4 the cost data for the considered scenarios is summarized in appendix table c 1 the total operating expenses are evaluated for each scenario based on the mass and energy balances the mass balances for each of the considered scenarios are given in appendixes b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 the conventional process of the wastewater treatment in all scenarios requires 333 kw of electrical power the electrical power needed for the operation of the tertiary systems in each scenario is shown in fig 7 moreover 912 kw of heat should be supplied for the sludge drying in the scenario 3 and 7602 kw of heat is necessary for the sludge and vsep reject drying in scenario 4 despite the higher requirements for availability of power in scenarios 3 and 4 compared to scenarios 1 and 2 the considered incinerator plant can fully cover the electrical and heat energy needs the required power can be generated from the msw and the sludge available in the considered region without any additional fuel moreover as it can be seen in fig 7 the utilization of the available heat from the incineration can be used to substitute part of the electrical power required by the zld system the qualitative distribution among the main expense items is presented in fig 8 additional information can be found in appendixes table c 3 table c 4 and table c 5 the cost of the sludge landfilling accounts for nearly a half of all expenses of the currently operated wastewater treatment plant the shares of the personnel chemicals and purchased electricity costs are relatively equal in the overall balance of the wwtp as it can be seen in fig 8 in case of scenarios with the tertiary treatment systems the annual expenses on the chemicals increase dramatically moreover the ro membranes system and the brine concentrator with high power demands increase the electricity costs in scenario 2 as for scenarios 3 and 4 with the integrated incineration plant the cost of chemicals is the largest part of the overall operating expenses the quantitative analysis of the total operating costs together with the specific operating cost assuming 20 000 m3 d of the influent flow for each scenario are presented in fig 9 as a result of the additional equipment both total and specific costs are higher for all considered tertiary treatment scenarios in comparison with the original wwtp the specific operating costs increase from the original 0 26 m3 to at least to 0 50 m3 in scenario 3 and up to 1 23 m3 in scenario 2 on the other hand the higher quality of cleaned water after the tertiary treatment process should be taken into account the implementation of the ro system scenarios 2 and 4 allows the removal of a wide range of contaminants and production of cleaner water than the original wwtp in addition the benefits of the integration of the incineration plant are seen savings on the purchased electricity and the sludge landfilling costs in scenarios 3 and 4 the integration with the incinerator unit results in saving 0 95 m in scenario 3 and 2 72 m in scenario 4 compared to the corresponding non integrated scenarios 5 2 profitability evaluation three common metrics for the profitability evaluation net present value npv internal rate of return irr and payback period pbp are applied in the current work the economic assessment of the four studied scenarios considers only the additional revenues and expenses that appear if the tertiary system is integrated with the original waste water treatment plant while the initial expenses and revenues of the wwtp are constant for all cases the expenses consist of the salaries chemicals and equipment replacement parts purchased electricity maintenance cost 2 of tci and insurances 1 of tci the revenues for all scenarios are primarily based on selling the main product the cleaned water the utilization of msw and sludge in heat and power generation results in additional benefits in scenarios 3 and 4 savings in the purchased electricity landfilling costs of the sewage sludge and transport costs in the msw treatment the electricity produced in these two scenarios covers the total electricity consumption of the tertiary systems and the wwtp while the rest is sold to the grid three electricity price levels high medium and low are set for the market price of the sold electricity based on 83 as for the revenue from the msw stream the current price of the msw disposal in riihimÃ¤ki 55 t was considered as the maximum price for its utilization with several price variations per 1 ton of the msw the possibility to sell the unused heat is not examined due to its low temperature level the main parameters for the economic evaluation that are applied in the current study when they are not treated as variables are given in appendix table c 2 considering the uncertainty of the equipment costs three scenarios for the total capital investment of the studied cases are used base level optimistic 25 from the base scenario investment and pessimistic 25 from the base scenario investment the main results of irr npv and pbp calculations for scenarios 1 and 3 are illustrated in fig 10 and in fig 11 for scenarios 2 and 4 the variation of the tci is presented by the colour of the lines base tci in black optimistic in green and pessimistic in red for scenario 3 the line pattern indicates the msw cost variation and the line colour gradient illustrates the sold electricity price level as for scenario 4 the generated power is mostly consumed by the tertiary system and the amount of electricity sold to the grid is negligible therefore the profitability is not affected by the electricity price the effect of msw cost fluctuations is studied more intensively for scenario 4 and the line colour gradient in fig 11 illustrates the msw cost variation as can be expected for all studied cases a lower price of the cleaned water results in lower profitability also the variation of the total capital investments affects the profitability of all studied scenarios in a relatively similar manner at the same time the possibility to generate heat and electricity for own consumption and sell the rest to the grid brings visible benefits in the overall economic performance of scenarios 3 and 4 in scenario 1 the net present value for the baseline tci assumption equals zero at the cleaned water price of 0 48 m3 fig 10 while the npv values for scenario 3 are in the range from 3 4 m to 7 3 m depending on the sold electricity price and the revenues from msw utilization for the same cleaned water price and the base level tci in the case of the ro system application the difference is even larger a zero npv for scenario 2 baseline tci at the cleaned water price of 1 34 m3 and from 12 m 22 t of msw to 19 m 55 t of msw of npv in scenario 4 for an equivalent water price in addition the payback period for the scenarios with the integrated incineration plant can be still feasible at certain combinations of other factors while scenarios 1 and 2 are not economically profitable it should be also noted that within the higher limits of the cleaned water prices the payback period is solely affected by the capital investments while the effect of the obtainable revenue from the msw treatment and expenses on the purchased electricity price become negligible to identify the major economic drivers of the project performance sensitivity analysis on the project irr is performed the main parameters included in the previous calculations namely the investment cost the cleaned water price the electricity price and the cost of the msw utilization are varied in 20 range and their influence is presented in fig 12 the baseline tci medium level price of the sold electricity and the average price of the cleaned water are used for each scenario to calculate the baseline value of irr as can be expected the irr in scenarios 1 and 2 are particularly sensitive to the cleaned water price as it is the only revenue source the investment cost presents the second important factor influencing the profitability of the system the variation of the purchased electricity price affects more significantly the performance of scenario 2 where the power demand is notably higher than in scenario 1 in scenarios 3 and 4 the impacts of both the investment cost and the cleaned water price are comparable taking into account higher quality and corresponding price of the cleaned water in scenario 4 the variation in the water price has the largest effect on the profitability also the effect of the msw cost is notable 5 3 of the irr change for scenario 3 and 2 5 change for scenario 4 the amount of the residual electricity that can be sold to the grid is more significant in scenario 3 than in scenario 4 which has much higher power demand for the tertiary system consequently the price variation of the sold electricity has a small but more pronounced effect on the irr value in scenario 3 can be also seen in fig 10 compared to scenario 4 6 conclusions the problems concerning fresh water resources and solid waste management are related and they are becoming increasingly serious worldwide it is now more than ever important to develop new more sustainable solutions to use and reuse water and here the waste and wastewater industries have a significant and responsible role to play this study presents a scenario based analysis of the potential to improve the local waste and wastewater management in a finnish community the analysis implements the concept of industrial symbiosis to link the wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste management processes which would allow recirculation and discharge of water safely while closing the water cycle four alternative wastewater reclamation scenarios are modelled and based on these the potential and benefits of implementing the concept of industrial symbiosis are assessed the main advantages and disadvantages of each treatment scenario were summarized in table 5 in the first scenario a tertiary treatment is employed by using ultrafiltration followed by ultraviolet light disinfection such a tertiary treatment system improves the quality of the wastewater treatment and allows reuse of the cleaned water for irrigation purposes however the implementation of such system increases the operation cost of the wastewater treatment process almost two times compared to the conventional process up to 0 63 m3 in the second configuration the tertiary system is improved by adding a ro membranes system such a configuration delivers notably high removal efficiency for a wide range of wastewater contaminants and enables closure of the wastewater cycle inside of the community however the overall operating cost is significantly higher than the operation cost of the conventional wastewater treatment process and it is equal to 1 23 m3 the main factors which increase the operation costs of both considered scenarios are the higher amounts of chemicals required for the operation of the systems and higher electricity demands of the considered tertiary treatment systems the energy demand in first scenario is almost 2 times higher than in the case of the conventional wastewater treatment process when ro is employed together with uf and uv systems the energy demand significantly increases and it is almost 8 times higher than in the case of the conventional wastewater treatment process moreover even though the quality of the effluent can be significantly enhanced with the described modifications the wastewater plant still generates quite a considerable amount of sewage sludge that has to be transported to the landfill plant for composting in the first and second scenarios the cost of treating and managing the sludge accounts for 12 24 of all operating expenses it is obvious that the described disadvantages of the considered tertiary treatment systems should be minimized in order to increase the popularity of such systems utilization for wastewater reclamation the study presented in this article shows that the integration of the chp plant with considered tertiary treatment systems may be a solution which can significantly decrease the overall operation cost of these systems even though the cost of integrating is high and requires additional capital investment the potential benefits are considerable by co firing sludge and msw it is possible to cover the electricity and heat energy demands of the advanced wastewater treatment processes in the finnish community studied the integration of a chp plant where co incineration of sludge and msw is performed into a wwtp with considered tertiary treatment systems decreases the relative operational cost per 1 m3 of the influent by 21 for the scenario with uf and uv treatment and by 30 for the scenario with uf ro and uv treatment moreover the profitability evaluation of such scenarios shows that the achieved decrease in the operation cost most likely compensates for the increase in tci cost which in turn increases the profit obtained from the investment in such systems similar results were obtained from the sensitivity analysis of the internal rate of return which shows a high dependence of the system profitability on the price of the effluent cleaned water from this perspective it can be stated that the potential and future performance of decentralized wastewater treatment plants equipped to handle tertiary treatment and enable closed loop operation of the system depend only partially on capital investments they mostly depend on the supply of the final product to consumers at a price consumers are ready to pay therefore despite the significant increase in tci cost in the scenarios where the chp plant was integrated into the wwtp with tertiary treatment systems such an integration is recommended for the realization in the considered finnish community acknowledgements this work was supported by the european regional development fund erdf and leverage from the eu 2014 2020 a70015 2015 2017 appendix a see tablesa 1 a

14531,the study analyzes a potential to improve the local waste and wastewater management in a finnish community the lappeenranta wastewater treatment plant wwtp is used as a case study two different technological setups are considered for improving the wastewater treatment plant these are used to construct four alternative wastewater reclamation scenarios the mass and energy balances for the considered scenarios are developed and used as input for the profitability evaluation the utilization of the sewage sludge from the wwtp and municipal solid waste fraction that cannot be recycled for the generation of heat and electricity at the chp plant is investigated with the aim to improve the economic performance of the wastewater treatment facility the studied scenarios are initially compared based on their investment and operational costs the cost of water treatment increases significantly in the case of the investigated tertiary treatment systems higher amounts of chemicals and electricity are needed to improve the water quality at the same time the study indicates that the profitability of a wwtp integrated with a chp plant can be reasonably high in a wide range of likely price scenarios for alternative wastewater purification systems the results of the analysis showed a significant potential for the investigated wastewater reclamation systems to improve the efficiency of solid waste and wastewater management in the community keywords wastewater treatment plant sewage sludge municipal solid waste economic analysis fluidized bed boiler 1 introduction urban wastewater is a mixture of wastewater from domestic and industrial sources and in many cases also from rainwater run offs discharge of urban wastewater into natural water basins leads to high levels of nutrient pollution causing eutrophication 1 conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtp which usually include chemical physical and biological treatment processes cannot fully prevent nutrient pollution as a result the levels of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds originating from wwtp discharge in many rivers and lakes in the european union eu are relatively high 2 in addition to the nutrient pollution there are increasing health concerns about the harmful effects of micro plastics pesticides hormones drugs antibiotics fire retardants and heavy metals finding their way into the fresh water supply these man made environmental challenges urgently require systemic and sustainable solutions wastewater reclamation and reuse is one of the most promising solutions for decreasing the pollution run offs into rivers and lakes 2 the effluents of a conventional wwtp can be treated further and reused for example for irrigation or for various industrial purposes under certain conditions water reuse may have a lower environmental impact than utilization of other alternatives of fresh water supply such as water transfer or desalination 3 in addition it can enable the recovery of nutrients resulting in a reduction of raw materials required for fertilizer production 4 despite the possible advantages of the wastewater reclamation and reuse it is not common in the eu mainly due to the low economical attractiveness of reuse solutions and a lack of common eu environmental standards 2 in 2015 the european commission presented an action plan for the circular economy to promote the water reuse 5 one of the proposed actions was to set minimum quality requirements for the use of reclaimed water in agricultural irrigation to reduce the need for over precautionary approaches and unnecessary treatment costs in addition in 2016 the european commission approved guidelines for the harmonization of water reuse practices across the eu 6 despite this progress the economic attractiveness of wastewater reclamation and reuse is still an open question the issue of cost of water reclamation is especially important in finland where despite advanced wwtp systems effluent discharges have caused significant nutrient pollution in many lakes and the baltic sea for example in 2010 the accumulated level of nutrient pollution in lake haapajÃ¤rvi in the lappeenranta region was unacceptably high and temporary drying of the whole lake had to be implemented in order to improve its ecological situation 7 currently in finland due to the wide availability and low cost of clean surface and ground water water is consumed without long term consideration of the consequences of the so far limited implementation of wastewater reclamation and reuse leading to continued effluent discharges into waterways and lakes such a situation leads to gradual pollution of potential surface water resources moreover the contaminants from municipal and industrial waste sources can be transferred via rivers to the baltic sea which is almost totally surrounded by agricultural land and presents a vulnerable ecosystem which is highly endangered by continued pollution wastewater reclamation and reuse is not only a solution to the problem of limiting the contamination of fresh water resources but it also offers a new reusable fresh water supply therefore it is extremely important to study the profitability of investing in enhanced treatment of wastewater on a global and local scale in this work a concept for de centralized waste management is analyzed the aim of the study is to assess the potential of the concept to improve the economic feasibility of wastewater reclamation in finland the region of south karelia is considered as a case study to improve the quality of the treated wastewater at the lappeenranta wwtp two tertiary treatment systems which consist of a ultrafiltration uf membranes a reverse osmosis ro membranes filtration and an ultraviolet uv disinfection are considered these tertiary treatment technologies are selected as they are commonly implemented for the production of reclaimed water from wastewater effluent 8 at present membrane technologies have been broadly applied for deep treatment of different types of wastewaters 9 11 the combination of uf membranes and ultrasound for cleaning the municipal wastewaters was experimentally investigated by borea et al 12 krahnstÃ¶ver et al 13 demonstrated the separation efficiency of uf membranes in a pilot scale wastewater reclamation system ro membrane technology is a fully mature technology for the desalination of seawater 14 15 and ro membranes have been used effectively for removing salts and organic compounds from industrial and municipal wastewaters 16 gÃ¼ndoÄdu et al 17 showed that by integrating membrane bioreactor mbr with nanofiltration and ro processes it is possible to produce water which well satisfies the quality standard requirements for use in agricultural irrigation and as process water therefore reverse osmosis technologies are installed and used in wastewater reclamation plants generally to act as a final stage treatment process 18 various combinations of membrane filtration technologies membrane bioreactor with reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration unit with reverse osmosis have been tested in a pilot study in 19 the pilot study showed that both systems demonstrate excellent performance for the treatment of wastewater stream however to the best knowledge of the authors the majority of these studies only look at one or a couple of treatment methods but they do not provide the comprehensive comparison between possible configurations moreover there is lack of studies identifying the determinants of economic efficiency improvement of a wwtp when modern tertiary treatment technologies are used therefore in this article the integration of the wastewater sludge and the municipal solid waste msw co incineration within the wastewater treatment process is evaluated from the perspective of improving the economic feasibility of a wwtp that is equipped with modern tertiary treatment technologies based on the selected tertiary treatment systems four different scenarios are considered to analyze the suggested de centralized waste management concept 2 material and methods 2 1 current wastewater treatment system and processes the study uses the waste and wastewater management data of the lappeenranta wwtp example case the latest complete annual data is available from the year 2016 which is used in this work if not mentioned otherwise lappeenranta is the capital of the south karelia region which is situated on the shores of lake saimaa and has a population density of 24 6 inhabitants km2 corresponding to the average finnish population density 20 there are 132 000 inhabitants in the south karelian area of which 73 000 live in the city of lappeenranta the average amount of wastewater generated in lappeenranta is 16 000 m3 day and most of the wastewater is produced by households 21 the lappeenranta wwtp is the largest wwtp in the south karelia region 22 the wwtp applies chemical and biological means to treat the wastewater the majority of the phosphorous is removed from the wastewater by applying chemicals such as ferrous sulphate pix 105 and the average efficiency of phosphorus removal by this procedure ranges up to about 96 21 calcium hydroxide is used to maintain an adequate level of alkalinity the annual consumption of ferrous sulphate and calcium hydroxide are 791 t and 555 t respectively nitrogen is mostly removed by using biological treatment methods with an average removal efficiency of 61 21 moreover sodium hypochlorite 15 is used for the disinfection of the wastewater after biological treatment the consumption of this chemical is 8 tons per year the sludge produced from wastewater treatment has a total solids ts concentration of 3 5 and is dewatered with centrifuges up to 21 ts by using polymer zetag 8165 which is consumed at an average rate of 8 8 t a 21 finally the sludge is transported over a distance of 20 km to the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant fig 1 for composting with other biomasses lappeenranta wwtp produces about 9600 t a of 21 ts sewage sludge the current cost of the transportation and treatment of the sewage sludge is about 80 t the electric energy consumption of the lappeenranta wwtp in 2016 was 2 1 gwh 21 the renovation of the lappeenranta wwtp is currently under consideration the new wwtp would include a tertiary treatment system which should improve the characteristics of the effluent table 1 shows a comparison of the characteristics of the effluent produced in the existing and the planned lappeenranta wwtp the municipal solid waste msw produced in the south karelia region is collected by the municipality the msw is source separated into fractions of biodegradable waste glass metals cardboard and paper by the inhabitants in the considered area 23 the fractions that cannot be subjected to any material recovery are directed to the riihimÃ¤ki chp plant for incineration located 219 km from the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant in 2016 25 000 tons of mixed msw with 75 ts were delivered from the south karelian waste management centre in kukkuroinmÃ¤ki to the riihimÃ¤ki chp plant 24 the current gate cost for the mixed msw in riihimÃ¤ki is 55 t of the mixed msw the major share of the mixed msw is produced in the largest cities of the region lappeenranta and imatra the part of the mixed msw which is produced in the rural areas of the south karelia region is estimated to total only 3100 t a 23 2 2 scenarios a scenario based cost benefit approach is developed to assess the potential of improving the wastewater and waste management in the considered area the concept of industrial symbiosis is implemented in the scenario building industrial symbiosis in wastewater management focuses on taking maximum advantage of the flows of resources such as materials energy water and by products generated during the treatment processes industrial symbiosis is understood here as the process that potentially can support the establishment of an industrial ecosystem in the field of waste and wastewater management 25 in the first scenario a wwtp with a tertiary treatment system including ultrafiltration uf and ultraviolet uv light disinfection is investigated this system was suggested for the improvement of the lappeenranta wwtp by pÃ¶yry finland oy in its final report based upon a study completed in 2013 by the company 26 the report showed that the suggested tertiary treatment system could meet the strict requirements set for the effluent 27 moreover the report showed that by using uf followed by uv disinfection for the wastewater reclamation processes it is possible to achieve acceptable results allowing the reuse of water for irrigation 28 additionally sand filtering is included in the system prior to uf to prevent fouling and damage to the uf membranes similarly as it was done in 28 29 in this scenario the sludge is still transported to the kukkuroinmÃ¤ki landfill plant the msw is directed to the riihimÃ¤ki chp incineration plant in the second scenario the previously discussed tertiary system is improved by adding a reverse osmosis ro system the ro process provides a notably high removal efficiency for a wide range of wastewater contaminants 30 however if the feed water quality is not suitable fouling of the ro membranes can significantly reduce their lifetime therefore a pre treatment system is necessary for ro ultrafiltration is considered as one of the possible pre treatment systems for the ro which can reduce the fouling and increase the flux by 30 50 compared to the ro system without uf 31 a uf ro tertiary treatment system was previously analysed for the water reuse in 32 36 and it has showed a noticeably good performance in wastewater reclamation the treatment of the ro concentrate is performed similarly as reported by erdal et al 37 where the concentrate volume reduction is performed by using a vibratory shear enhanced processing vsep followed by a thermal treatment the latter is performed with a brine concentrator with mechanical vapour recompression mvr and a mvr crystallizer the sludge and msw are treated in the same way as in the previous scenario the third scenario implements the same tertiary treatment system as the first scenario but it additionally includes integration of the chp unit into the wastewater treatment process the mixture of the sewage sludge and the msw streams is selected as a fuel for the chp unit the co combustion option is selected to improve the combustion efficiency and the economic feasibility of the incineration plant msw is used as the primary fuel due to its higher heating value compared to the sludge also it increases the total amount of available fuel in the considered area 38 40 the incineration of the msw and the sludge in the area where they are produced significantly reduces the transportation costs in comparison with the previous scenarios before incineration the msw is converted to solid recovered fuel srf and sludge is dried up to 70 ts which is enough to convert it from a viscous dough to a granular solid material 41 a circulating fluidized bed furnace is selected for the incineration as it is a proven technology which can effectively dispose different kinds of fuels including wastes 42 it is assumed that the ash from the fuel combustion is disposed of in the local landfill in the fourth scenario the treatment system of the second scenario and the co combustion option of the third scenario are integrated the reject from the vsep system is dewatered in a zero liquid discharge zld system by thermal treatment process in this scenario a multiple effect evaporator and a steam driven crystallizer are used instead of brine concentrator and mvr crystallizer correspondingly such a configuration is chosen to utilize the available heat energy from the chp unit more efficiently the reject left from the zld system is transported to riihimÃ¤ki for further thermal treatment and the ash from the fuel combustion is disposed in the local landfill 3 mass end energy balances 3 1 wastewater treatment plant the mass balance of the considered wwtp is based on the information presented in 21 a simplified block diagram of the wwtp is shown in fig 2 based on the forecast of the wastewater production in lappeenranta the average influent flow rate of the wwtp is assumed to be equal to 20 000 m3 d in the future 22 based on the measured data of the lappeenranta wwtp influent flow rate the maximum influent flow rate is assumed to be 60 higher than the average resulting in 32 000 m3 d 21 the average consumption of 11 2 ferric sulphate and calcium hydroxide are estimated to be 134 g m3 and 95 g m3 respectively 21 the 21 ts sludge production is estimated by assuming its proportional dependence on the influent flow 11 500 t a and 18 400 t a for the average and maximum capacities respectively the sludge flow rate is estimated by considering the solid specific gravity 1 2 kg m3 43 and 97 of solids removal efficiency in the sludge dewatering system 26 the average polymer consumption is assumed to be 4 4 g kg of sludge ts 21 the effluent flow rate is estimated to be 19 800 m3 d and 31 700 m3 d for the average and the maximum influent flow rates respectively the average energy consumption of the components of the new wwtp is calculated based on longo et al 44 and presented in appendix table a 1 the energy consumption of the grit removal process is assumed to be equal to 2 of the total energy consumption 44 3 2 tertiary treatment a simplified diagram of the uf tertiary treatment system for the first and the third scenario is shown in fig 3 the mass and energy balances of the uf system are obtained from the uf system budgetary proposal a coagulation and pre chlorination of the sludge are necessary prior to the uf unit the usage of 0 6 t d of 35 ferric chloride and 2 7 t d of 10 3 sodium hypochlorite are suggested by the uf membranes manufacturer for the coagulation and pre chlorination process the membrane cleaning is performed by citric acid and 33 hydrochloric acid with annual consumptions estimated as 11 4 t a and 17 8 t a respectively the influent and effluent flow rates are estimated neglecting the flow rates of the chemical treatment which are relatively small compared to the wastewater flow rate due to the uf concentrate recirculation to the wwtp in the selected configuration it is assumed that a generation of the sludge increases by 20 compared to the sludge generation in original wwtp the ro tertiary system is considered as an extension of the previously described treatment system after uf additional chemical dosing is necessary to prevent damaging and fouling of the ro membranes the use of sodium bisulphite an antiscalant and a biocide are suggested for this by the manufacturer the estimated consumption of the sodium bisulphite and the antiscalant are 3 and 1 mg l respectively the biocide should be used periodically for 30 min per week with a concentration of 100 mg l the cleaning of the ro membranes is suggested to be performed four times annually with acid and alkaline surfactants the chemical consumption of the clean in place cip process is estimated to be equal to 20 5 t a a simplified diagram of the uf ro tertiary treatment system for the second and the fourth scenario is shown in fig 4 the mass and energy balances of the vsep are created based on the information obtained from the manufacturer the daily chemical consumption of the cip process is estimated to be 114 l d the volume reduction in the brine concentrator in zld system is assumed to be 90 45 the mass and energy balances of the multiple effect evaporator and the crystallizer for the fourth scenario are calculated using the methods presented by zacharias et al 46 and bennett et al 47 the energy consumption rates of the components of the tertiary treatment systems are shown in table 2 3 3 sludge and municipal solid waste pre treatment the typical process for the srf production presented by wilÃ©n et al 53 is considered for the msw pre treatment before incineration fig 5 pre shredding is used to decrease the particle size of the mixed msw below 150 mm to prevent problems in the subsequent processing stages the metal particles are removed from the shredded msw by magnetic separation the separation of the bio waste is done during the sorting process with a drum screen post shredding is used to decrease the particle size below 50 mm ballistic separation is applied to remove any remaining heavy impurities such as glass and hard plastics the assumed average efficiency of the srf production is 75 53 the assumed average amount of metals in the msw is 3 53 54 the shares of the bio waste and other heavy impurities are assumed to be 19 and 3 of the msw input respectively on the basis of the operation data of the tarastenjÃ¤rvi plant 53 the sewage sludge is dried up to 70 ts by using a belt drying system with heat supply from the chp unit with the required heat energy consumption of 800 kwh per ton of evaporated moisture the energy consumption of the fuel pre treatment process is given in table 3 the annual electrical demand of the fuel preparation process is 1 1 gwh a corresponding to 125 kw average power 3 4 fluidized bed incinerator mass and energy balance calculations for the sewage sludge and srf thermal treatment processes are performed for a small scale circulating fluidized bed cfb incinerator fig 6 the full load case performance and the complete combustion of the input fuel to flue gas and ash are assumed the properties of the srf and sludge are presented in appendix table a 2 the proximate analysis and the heating values are based on measurements 61 while the ultimate analysis values are based on reported literature values 62 68 the incinerator is designed with combustion air ratio of 1 31 apparent gas velocity of 4 7 m s and residual oxygen of 4 2 vol in the flue gas to keep the incinerator temperature over the required 850 c an adiabatic refractory covered construction is considered in this construction one heat exchanger is located in the return leg to control the incinerator temperature while the rest of the heat transfer surfaces are located in the backpass a small steam turbine 69 is used to generate electricity from the steam and the rest of the steam is condensed and utilized as heat the turbine operates with 405 c and 20 bar input steam and the condensing take place at 80 c at 0 47 bar with these values and about 83 7 isentropic efficiency the turbogenerator can attain 21 process efficiency in electricity production the incinerator unit produces 2 1 mw of electricity and 8 1 mw of thermal output at full load the auxiliary power consumption is estimated based on saari et al 70 flue gas treatment consists of the injection of activated carbon and limestone to capture the heavy metal sulphur dioxide chlorine fluorine as well as dioxins and furans a selective catalytic reduction to control nitrous oxide emission and a bag filters to reduce the particulate emissions before the stack 71 73 an ash residue of 4 6 t d is generated from the incineration and it is assumed to be landfilled results of the thermal conversion and steam production are presented in appendixes table a 3 and table a 4 4 economic analysis the equipment of the considered tertiary treatment systems is sized on the basis of the maximum influent flow rate 32 000 m3 d the design capacity of each item obtained from the mass and energy balances is increased by an over design factor 10 to mitigate the design uncertainties and possible alterations of the operating performance 74 the cost of purchased equipment pec is calculated by means of cost indices and scaling factors chemical engineering plant cost index cepci is used to estimate the cost of the equipment based on available data all prices are converted to year 2015 euros data in us dollars usd are converted to euros with the average annual exchange rate 75 1 cost 2015 cost usd y cepci 2015 cepci y y usd y the scaling factors allow the estimation of the cost of equipment based on the available data for similar equipment at different capacity 74 76 2 cost a cost b x a x b Î± where Î± is a scaling factor value of 0 6 is used if no other information is available and x is the capacity of the equipment besides the cost of purchased equipment the total module cost cbm is needed for further calculation the cbm of equipment includes the cost of equipment and other cost factors directly related to the commissioning i e instrumentation and controls equipment erection and construction expenses piping and electrical equipment and materials as a result it can be significantly higher than the purchased equipment cost if no item specific data is available the ratio cbm pec is assumed to be 2 2 for the incinerator plant components and 3 3 for the tertiary treatment systems and the fuel preparation units 76 the equipment list for the considered systems together with the total module costs are listed in table 4 the total capital investment tci required for the project implementation consists of several individual expense factors the assumptions for the tci components are taken from 74 76 the offsite costs 45 pec include the cost of land ancillary buildings site development and utilities engineering and supervision 12 pec covers the cost for construction design together with procurement and construction supervision start up expenses 10 pec amount to the cost of possible start up changes in materials and equipment and loss of income while the plant is operating at partial capacity the contractor s fee 5 of indirect and

capital 15 fci estimates the total amount of money needed above the fixed capital to start up the plant and operate until the moment incomes is received 5 results and discussion 5 1 tci and operating cost the analysis of the tci shows that the implementation of scenario 2 with uf ro system require almost in 3 times higher capital investments 24 6 m compared to the tci of scenario 1 9 1 m the main reason is the high cost of ro and vsep units which accounts for nearly a half of the total equipment costs in scenario 2 the integration of the chp unit in the wastewater treatment process also significantly increases the tci of scenarios 3 24 m and 4 40 8 m compared to the tci of scenarios 1 and 2 the notable increasing of the tci cost in scenarios 3 and 4 is explained by the high cost of the incinerator plant which is equal to 60 of the tci in scenario 3 and 40 of the tci in scenario 4 the cost data for the considered scenarios is summarized in appendix table c 1 the total operating expenses are evaluated for each scenario based on the mass and energy balances the mass balances for each of the considered scenarios are given in appendixes b 1 b 2 b 3 and b 4 the conventional process of the wastewater treatment in all scenarios requires 333 kw of electrical power the electrical power needed for the operation of the tertiary systems in each scenario is shown in fig 7 moreover 912 kw of heat should be supplied for the sludge drying in the scenario 3 and 7602 kw of heat is necessary for the sludge and vsep reject drying in scenario 4 despite the higher requirements for availability of power in scenarios 3 and 4 compared to scenarios 1 and 2 the considered incinerator plant can fully cover the electrical and heat energy needs the required power can be generated from the msw and the sludge available in the considered region without any additional fuel moreover as it can be seen in fig 7 the utilization of the available heat from the incineration can be used to substitute part of the electrical power required by the zld system the qualitative distribution among the main expense items is presented in fig 8 additional information can be found in appendixes table c 3 table c 4 and table c 5 the cost of the sludge landfilling accounts for nearly a half of all expenses of the currently operated wastewater treatment plant the shares of the personnel chemicals and purchased electricity costs are relatively equal in the overall balance of the wwtp as it can be seen in fig 8 in case of scenarios with the tertiary treatment systems the annual expenses on the chemicals increase dramatically moreover the ro membranes system and the brine concentrator with high power demands increase the electricity costs in scenario 2 as for scenarios 3 and 4 with the integrated incineration plant the cost of chemicals is the largest part of the overall operating expenses the quantitative analysis of the total operating costs together with the specific operating cost assuming 20 000 m3 d of the influent flow for each scenario are presented in fig 9 as a result of the additional equipment both total and specific costs are higher for all considered tertiary treatment scenarios in comparison with the original wwtp the specific operating costs increase from the original 0 26 m3 to at least to 0 50 m3 in scenario 3 and up to 1 23 m3 in scenario 2 on the other hand the higher quality of cleaned water after the tertiary treatment process should be taken into account the implementation of the ro system scenarios 2 and 4 allows the removal of a wide range of contaminants and production of cleaner water than the original wwtp in addition the benefits of the integration of the incineration plant are seen savings on the purchased electricity and the sludge landfilling costs in scenarios 3 and 4 the integration with the incinerator unit results in saving 0 95 m in scenario 3 and 2 72 m in scenario 4 compared to the corresponding non integrated scenarios 5 2 profitability evaluation three common metrics for the profitability evaluation net present value npv internal rate of return irr and payback period pbp are applied in the current work the economic assessment of the four studied scenarios considers only the additional revenues and expenses that appear if the tertiary system is integrated with the original waste water treatment plant while the initial expenses and revenues of the wwtp are constant for all cases the expenses consist of the salaries chemicals and equipment replacement parts purchased electricity maintenance cost 2 of tci and insurances 1 of tci the revenues for all scenarios are primarily based on selling the main product the cleaned water the utilization of msw and sludge in heat and power generation results in additional benefits in scenarios 3 and 4 savings in the purchased electricity landfilling costs of the sewage sludge and transport costs in the msw treatment the electricity produced in these two scenarios covers the total electricity consumption of the tertiary systems and the wwtp while the rest is sold to the grid three electricity price levels high medium and low are set for the market price of the sold electricity based on 83 as for the revenue from the msw stream the current price of the msw disposal in riihimÃ¤ki 55 t was considered as the maximum price for its utilization with several price variations per 1 ton of the msw the possibility to sell the unused heat is not examined due to its low temperature level the main parameters for the economic evaluation that are applied in the current study when they are not treated as variables are given in appendix table c 2 considering the uncertainty of the equipment costs three scenarios for the total capital investment of the studied cases are used base level optimistic 25 from the base scenario investment and pessimistic 25 from the base scenario investment the main results of irr npv and pbp calculations for scenarios 1 and 3 are illustrated in fig 10 and in fig 11 for scenarios 2 and 4 the variation of the tci is presented by the colour of the lines base tci in black optimistic in green and pessimistic in red for scenario 3 the line pattern indicates the msw cost variation and the line colour gradient illustrates the sold electricity price level as for scenario 4 the generated power is mostly consumed by the tertiary system and the amount of electricity sold to the grid is negligible therefore the profitability is not affected by the electricity price the effect of msw cost fluctuations is studied more intensively for scenario 4 and the line colour gradient in fig 11 illustrates the msw cost variation as can be expected for all studied cases a lower price of the cleaned water results in lower profitability also the variation of the total capital investments affects the profitability of all studied scenarios in a relatively similar manner at the same time the possibility to generate heat and electricity for own consumption and sell the rest to the grid brings visible benefits in the overall economic performance of scenarios 3 and 4 in scenario 1 the net present value for the baseline tci assumption equals zero at the cleaned water price of 0 48 m3 fig 10 while the npv values for scenario 3 are in the range from 3 4 m to 7 3 m depending on the sold electricity price and the revenues from msw utilization for the same cleaned water price and the base level tci in the case of the ro system application the difference is even larger a zero npv for scenario 2 baseline tci at the cleaned water price of 1 34 m3 and from 12 m 22 t of msw to 19 m 55 t of msw of npv in scenario 4 for an equivalent water price in addition the payback period for the scenarios with the integrated incineration plant can be still feasible at certain combinations of other factors while scenarios 1 and 2 are not economically profitable it should be also noted that within the higher limits of the cleaned water prices the payback period is solely affected by the capital investments while the effect of the obtainable revenue from the msw treatment and expenses on the purchased electricity price become negligible to identify the major economic drivers of the project performance sensitivity analysis on the project irr is performed the main parameters included in the previous calculations namely the investment cost the cleaned water price the electricity price and the cost of the msw utilization are varied in 20 range and their influence is presented in fig 12 the baseline tci medium level price of the sold electricity and the average price of the cleaned water are used for each scenario to calculate the baseline value of irr as can be expected the irr in scenarios 1 and 2 are particularly sensitive to the cleaned water price as it is the only revenue source the investment cost presents the second important factor influencing the profitability of the system the variation of the purchased electricity price affects more significantly the performance of scenario 2 where the power demand is notably higher than in scenario 1 in scenarios 3 and 4 the impacts of both the investment cost and the cleaned water price are comparable taking into account higher quality and corresponding price of the cleaned water in scenario 4 the variation in the water price has the largest effect on the profitability also the effect of the msw cost is notable 5 3 of the irr change for scenario 3 and 2 5 change for scenario 4 the amount of the residual electricity that can be sold to the grid is more significant in scenario 3 than in scenario 4 which has much higher power demand for the tertiary system consequently the price variation of the sold electricity has a small but more pronounced effect on the irr value in scenario 3 can be also seen in fig 10 compared to scenario 4 6 conclusions the problems concerning fresh water resources and solid waste management are related and they are becoming increasingly serious worldwide it is now more than ever important to develop new more sustainable solutions to use and reuse water and here the waste and wastewater industries have a significant and responsible role to play this study presents a scenario based analysis of the potential to improve the local waste and wastewater management in a finnish community the analysis implements the concept of industrial symbiosis to link the wastewater treatment and municipal solid waste management processes which would allow recirculation and discharge of water safely while closing the water cycle four alternative wastewater reclamation scenarios are modelled and based on these the potential and benefits of implementing the concept of industrial symbiosis are assessed the main advantages and disadvantages of each treatment scenario were summarized in table 5 in the first scenario a tertiary treatment is employed by using ultrafiltration followed by ultraviolet light disinfection such a tertiary treatment system improves the quality of the wastewater treatment and allows reuse of the cleaned water for irrigation purposes however the implementation of such system increases the operation cost of the wastewater treatment process almost two times compared to the conventional process up to 0 63 m3 in the second configuration the tertiary system is improved by adding a ro membranes system such a configuration delivers notably high removal efficiency for a wide range of wastewater contaminants and enables closure of the wastewater cycle inside of the community however the overall operating cost is significantly higher than the operation cost of the conventional wastewater treatment process and it is equal to 1 23 m3 the main factors which increase the operation costs of both considered scenarios are the higher amounts of chemicals required for the operation of the systems and higher electricity demands of the considered tertiary treatment systems the energy demand in first scenario is almost 2 times higher than in the case of the conventional wastewater treatment process when ro is employed together with uf and uv systems the energy demand significantly increases and it is almost 8 times higher than in the case of the conventional wastewater treatment process moreover even though the quality of the effluent can be significantly enhanced with the described modifications the wastewater plant still generates quite a considerable amount of sewage sludge that has to be transported to the landfill plant for composting in the first and second scenarios the cost of treating and managing the sludge accounts for 12 24 of all operating expenses it is obvious that the described disadvantages of the considered tertiary treatment systems should be minimized in order to increase the popularity of such systems utilization for wastewater reclamation the study presented in this article shows that the integration of the chp plant with considered tertiary treatment systems may be a solution which can significantly decrease the overall operation cost of these systems even though the cost of integrating is high and requires additional capital investment the potential benefits are considerable by co firing sludge and msw it is possible to cover the electricity and heat energy demands of the advanced wastewater treatment processes in the finnish community studied the integration of a chp plant where co incineration of sludge and msw is performed into a wwtp with considered tertiary treatment systems decreases the relative operational cost per 1 m3 of the influent by 21 for the scenario with uf and uv treatment and by 30 for the scenario with uf ro and uv treatment moreover the profitability evaluation of such scenarios shows that the achieved decrease in the operation cost most likely compensates for the increase in tci cost which in turn increases the profit obtained from the investment in such systems similar results were obtained from the sensitivity analysis of the internal rate of return which shows a high dependence of the system profitability on the price of the effluent cleaned water from this perspective it can be stated that the potential and future performance of decentralized wastewater treatment plants equipped to handle tertiary treatment and enable closed loop operation of the system depend only partially on capital investments they mostly depend on the supply of the final product to consumers at a price consumers are ready to pay therefore despite the significant increase in tci cost in the scenarios where the chp plant was integrated into the wwtp with tertiary treatment systems such an integration is recommended for the realization in the considered finnish community acknowledgements this work was supported by the european regional development fund erdf and leverage from the eu 2014 2020 a70015 2015 2017 appendix a see tablesa 1 a

14532,distillery wastewater is treated widely by anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw still poses high concentration of pollutants which requires further treatment in this study the possibilities of the effect of spirulina sp biomass ranging from 1 to 5 g l value on the treatment of addw was carried out under xenon lamp illumination of 10 000 200 lx with the photo period of 16 8 the reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod up to 15 23 total carbon tc up to 18 31 total inorganic carbon tic up to 31 51 and total organic carbon toc up to 1 8 were observed for the algae concentration ranging from 1 to 5 g l over a period of 5 days ion chromatography analysis was carried out to analyze the concentration of inorganic compounds in the wastewater before and after the treatment the reduction of carbonate up to 32 56 ammonium 48 72 phosphate 18 100 chloride 1 8 potassium 2 7 magnesium 10 23 and sodium 1 9 were observed in the wastewater after treating with algal biomass ranging from 1 to 5 g l it was inferred from the analysis that the spirulina sp utilized the inorganic compounds from the wastewater as its nutrients and thus resulted in the substantial removal of pollutants from the wastewater however it requires further assessment for the sustainability of the algae on the wastewater the calorific value of dry algae biomass was found as 12 mj kg

introduction industrial wastewater treatment is a demanding fundamental area of environment research due to the emerging pollution problems being faced by receiving body either water or land although nutrients removal from the wastewater using microalgae cyanobacteria has been practiced for years 1 only limited reports are available in case of distillery wastewater due to its high pollution profile 2 the molasses based distillery wastewater has the characteristics of chemical oxygen demand cod 85 000 1 10 000 ppm tds 85 000 1 10 000 bod 25 000 35 000 ppm 3 low ph high temperature high ash content and dark brown color which make the wastewater very difficult for the safe discharge 4 in southern india due to stringent regulations stipulated by the central pollution control board cpcb many distilleries adopt techniques such as anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic operation as effluent treatment practices etp to achieve zero liquid discharge zld 5 anaerobic digestion is chosen by distillery since it is highly effective in reducing the pollution load up to 60 65 in terms of cod and generate biogas as by product through which the industry balances the power requirement up to 90 95 6 the wastewater after anaerobic digestion is rich in inorganic nutrients besides organic load microalgae could be employed at this stage as the condition satisfy the possibility of its growth 7 and reduce the water requirement for the cultivation of microalgae thereby reducing the associated cost for the cultivation in addition microalgae do not generate secondary pollution and the nutrients can be recycled after separation of algae biomass 8 the biomass thus generated could be used as biofuel bio products based on its characterization 2 in general a tonne of microalgae biomass has the worth of 1646 euro and it is based on the lipid protein and carbohydrate percentage in the biomass 3 microalgae such as scenedesmus chlorella oscillatoria and spirulina are utilized for its remediation potential in the distillery brewery wastewater 1 3 8 9 cod and total nitrogen reduction up to 57 5 and 20 8 respectively are obtained in the brewery effluent cultivated with scenedesmus obliquus for the period of 14 days 1 nitrogen and ammonia reduction are 90 2 and 84 1 respectively by chlorella vulgaris 8 cultivated for 30 days in anaerobically digested distillery wastewater spirulina maxima consumed organic nitrogen completely from distillery wastewater when the schlosser media supplemented with 5 g l of distillery wastewater 9 recently coelastrella sp 10 rhodobacter blasticus and rhodobacter capsulatus 11 are tested for its nutrient removal potential from anaerobically digested wastewater however no report is available for the treatment of distillery wastewater of pollution load equivalent to 30 000 ppm or more in terms of cod hence this investigation is mainly aimed to report the treatability of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater with the higher pollution load cod 30 000 ppm using spirulina sp with varying algae biomass value to reveal insights the study aims further to report the reduction of major inorganic compounds which contribute the pollution load of wastewater with the help of ion chromatography since many nutrient removal studies from the wastewater report only the removal of total nitrogen ammonia and phosphate 10 12 13 further the growth of microalgae is regularly observed under fluorescent light sunlight in the prevalent literature the present study utilizes xenon lamp as a light source for the treatment which is rarely reported finally the possible mechanism of nutrients uptake by microalgae is also proposed with the citation for the phycoremediation of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater by spirulina sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 spirulina culture spirulina sp obtained from gandhigram rural institute gri dindigul tamil nadu was used as a stock culture in this study the species was

wastewater for the study it was centrifuged total suspended solids tss 1 g lit at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to remove tss bacteria majorly methanogens from the addw thereby avoiding interaction of methanogens with spirulina culture further it was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min to ensure the avoidance of other contamination the parameters of the wastewater like ph conductivity salinity total

the five tanks in which 3 6 9 12 and 15 g of spirulina sp biomass wet basis were added respectively amount of algal biomass was 1 5 g l of wastewater various concentrations were chosen to determine the effective algae concentration required for the treatment of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw two spargers were provided for each reactor with the air flow rate of 3 l min for the purpose of aeration and mixing this arrangement was kept under the xenon lamp for the illumination 10 000 200 lx measured using lux meter the two spargers in each reactor were connected to the power supply and the xenon lamp was switched on it was operated for 5 days with the photo period of 16 8 the set up was open and kept under xenon lamp hood the hood was provided with fan arrangement to abate the heat arising out from the illumination of xenon lamp the experiments were performed in the laboratory environment with the temperature of 32 2 c measured using thermometer at regular time interval 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to prove the significance of compounds reduction measured using relevant parameters in the distillery wastewater by spirulina sp significance level was set at Î± 0 05 95 confidential interval duncan s multi range test was also performed to compare compound reduction in the wastewater for every concentration of spirulina sp for all the parameters analyzed 3 results and discussion studies with illumination of fluorescent and xenon lamps with the photo periods of 12 12 16 8 and 14 10 light dark l d and 8 8 8 l d l for the growth of microalgae were conducted as a preliminary study appendix a supplementary file it showed that the xenon lamp with the photo period of 16 8 resulted relatively higher growth rate of spirulina sp compared to fluorescent lamp and other photo periods in the same fixed open tank of capacity 5 l however the results were not statistically significant p 0 01 in this study the treatment was carried out using xenon lamp as a light source the parameters such as ph conductivity tds and salinity were analyzed with a regular interval of 3 h over a period of 5 days of the study the concentration value of algae biomass was measured each day of treatment study other parameters such as total carbon and chemical oxygen demand for the wastewater were also analyzed before and after the treatment study it was observed that the spirulina sp was able to uptake the nutrients while treating anaerobically digested distillery wastewater during the first day of treatment study it was monitored through the change in different parameters as shown in fig 1 a d fig 2 ph shift was observed between 14 18 for the corresponding algae biomass value of 1 5 g l fig 1 a influence of ph on biomass production of spirulina sp was also studied by ogbonda et al 15 reduction in conductivity tds and salinity were 14 25 14 25 and 15 27 respectively for a corresponding algae biomass value celekli et al 16 evaluated the spirulina sp characteristics by monitoring ph conductivity tds and salinity in the cow effluent kumari et al 17 concluded that the fall in conductivity tds and salinity were mainly due to the uptake of cations and anions from the medium by spirulina platensis the microalgae exhibited reduction in the parameters such as ph conductivity tds and salinity up to 21 h in case of 4 g l and 5 g l algae biomass value fig 1 it was up to 18 h in case of 3 g l algae biomass value it was up to 12 h for the algae biomass value of 1 g l and 2 g l of spirulina sp on addw however the parameters were not changed appreciably from day 2 to day 5 fig 2 shows the growth of spirulina platensis during the treatment period it was observed that the species had no lag phase and entered log phase after cultivation 18 the concentration of algae biomass was increased in the first day and thereafter attained a stationary phase followed by decline phase in the rest of the days of treatment fig 2 the growth was not seen from day2 to day 5 in all the treatment tanks it was witnessed that the growth was largely affected by the pollution load of wastewater since the characteristics of wastewater was largely differ from growing the algae in zarrouk media of the composition mentioned in section 2 1 the chemical oxygen demand and carbon analysis were carried out before and after the treatment period a maximum reduction of cod up to 23 and total carbon reduction up to 29 were obtained for 5 g l algae biomass value mata et al 1 also studied the reduction in cod up to 57 5 after 14 days and total carbon reduction up to 56 9 after 13 days in the brewery effluent by scenedesmus obliquus one way anova and multi range test were carried out to determine the significance of treatability of wastewater it was witnessed from the anova that the physico chemical analysis of parameters resulted in the significant reduction of pollution load of addw for all the concentration of spirulina sp added p 0 01 it was also observed that the treatability of spirulina sp on the addw during the treatment period was not significantly increased from 1 to 5 g l p 0 01 further the culture lost its treatability after the first day in all the algae biomass tank for the treatment period of 5 days zhou et al 19 was observed slower growth of algae such as chlorella vulgaris um235 chlorella sp um224 and scenedesmus sp um258 followed by reaching the declining phase after 4 days when cultivated in concentrated municipal wastewater they stated that the declination of algae treatability was due to the shortage of carbon sources in this study it was due to the fact that the nutrient concentration in the addw was much higher than the uptake level of spirulina sp and the presence of other complex substances like melanoidin hence it necessitates the requirement of more initial population of algae species for the treatment of addw since the pollution load was much higher and the optimization of wastewater characteristics for the algae growth nevertheless the pollution load of addw was significantly reduced by the species that shows the availability of required nutrients for the growth of spirulina sp in the wastewater addw the reduction in every monitored parameter in day 1 with regard to the concentration of spirulina sp added to the respective open tank set up were tabulated table 1 it was witnessed from table 1 that the percentage reduction in the pollution load was different for the different parameters measured corresponding to the increase in algae biomass value of spirulina sp it was also interesting to observe that the microalgae tends to uptake the inorganic nutrients than the organic which brought out the major reduction in tic as compared to toc table 1 the multi range anova test also resulted in the significant changes p 0 01 in the characteristics of the wastewater except in the value of total organic carbon total carbon p value 0 489 0 013 choosing a wide range of algae biomass value above the present study might be helpful to optimize the algae biomass value of spirulina sp for the sustainable cultivation of spirulina sp on the treatment of addw as indicated from the result of tic and toc values table 1 spirulina sp was tend to uptake inorganic salts than organic and so it was interesting to determine the reduction in the various inorganic salts available in the wastewater table 2 shows the concentration of major cations and anions present in the anaerobically digested wastewater used for the study carbonate was the predominant anion followed by chloride and phosphate by its concentration similarly potassium was the predominant cation followed by ammonium magnesium sodium and calcium by its concentration the selectivity of targeting specific compound in the real wastewater was the major issue for other technology such as adsorption and membrane technology 20 21 in case of spirulina sp it was found that the species was highly selective and reduced the different pollutants as per its metabolic requirement table 2 shows the reduction of anions and cations with regard to the algae biomass value of spirulina sp it was observed that the ammonium in the addw was majorly reduced by spirulina sp followed by carbonate reduction which contribute the major reduction in cod 22 of wastewater p 0 01 table 2 phosphate in the addw was completely utilized by spirulina sp of concentration 5 g l of addw 23 table 2 however its contribution to the cod was negligible p 0 01 calcium potassium and magnesium were also reduced by spirulina sp appreciably p 0 01 the reduction was also observed in sodium and chloride substances but not reduced significantly p 0 01 table 2 the uptake of nutriens by spirulina sp depends on the metabolism of the species nutrient stress posed by the wastewater and the operating conditions provided for the study 24 the operating conditions such as light source xenon lamp mimicking sunlight photo period 16 8 aeration 6 l min and temperature 32 2 c were provided for the cultivation of spirulina sp the species were cultivated in addw under mixotrophic conditions using both light and organic substances for the energy requirement and nutrients for the metabolism 1 the species consists of two interacting membranes namely thylakoid membrane and plasma membrane on the cell surface 25 the thylakoid membrane was responsible for the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport whereas plasma membrane hold a respiratory chain and various transporters for ion homeostasis and the uptake of nutrients 26 photosynthesis and respiration process were already investigated in spirulina sp especially with reference to the stress posed by inorganic substances 27 28 however the knowledge in ion transport process and ion homeostasis in spirulina sp was still limited it was stated that the reduction in the pollution load of wastewater by cyanobacteria microalgae was due to the release of toxic active oxygen species namely superoxide anion hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide through electron transport systems this oxidizing agent produced by cyanobacteria blue green algae was fundamental in the phycoremediation 3 further carbon nitrogen and phosphorous are the essential elements for the growth of spirulina sp the species utilized the carbonate as a major carbon source and chemically reduced through photosynthesis to build a large organic molecules inside the cell 1 thus it showed a major reduction in carbonate content 32 47 of addw p 0 01 nitrogen contributes for the protein formation in the cell of spirulina sp 29 30 the sources of nitrogen could be nitrates nitrites urea and ammonium salt in the addw the urea was not present and the concentration of nitrates nitrites was less as compared to ammonium salt concentration it was said that when ammonium salt was available microalgae did not utilize other nitrogen sources until all the ammonium ion was utilized 31 hence the ammonium salt was utilized as an alternate nitrogen source by spirulina sp in addw resulting in the reduction of ammonium concentration 48 72 p 0 01 phosphorous was also an essential macronutrient for spirulina sp for the synthesis of nucleotides 29 phosphorous in the form of phosphate was available in the addw which was taken up by spirulina sp showed the complete utilization of the same in case of 5 g l algae biomass value the utilization of phosphate was energy dependent and the uptake rate was slower in the dark period than in the light cycle 32 however the concentration of phosphate in the wastewater was low and so the reduction was not significant compared to other substances in the wastewater p 0 01 chlorides were assimilated by spirulina sp due to the selective permeability of chloride ions through plasma membrane which was driven by concentration gradient across the membrane 33 hence it resulted the decrease in concentration of chloride in the addw but not significantly p 0 01 transport of cations such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k across the plasma membrane of spirulina sp depend on the external osmotic pressure posed by the wastewater and the low light intensity due to the dark brown color of addw it was also noted that the addw contained other recalcitrant compound such as melanoidin which posed severe threat for the treatability of spirulina sp in addw 34 any pretreatment technique before the phycoremediation would enhance the treatability and may reduce the pollution characteristics of wastewater and may favor the treatment by spirulina sp the biomass generated from the study could be utilized for the biogas production through anaerobic digestion the calorific value of biomass was 12 mj kg mussgnug et al 35 conducted the experimental studies on biogas production with six microalgae species their studies resulted in the biogas production ranging between 0 28 and 0 65 m3 kg dry weight of microalgae further spirulina sp used for this treatment studies have low lipid content sialve et al 36 reported that lipid percentage in spirulina maxima is up to 6 7 and in spirulina platensis is up to 4 9 when the lipid content of the microalgae cell does not exceed 40 the optimum strategy in view of economics is to recover energy through the anaerobic digestion of whole biomass 36 4 conclusion this work investigated the treatability of spirulina sp on the highly polluted anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw the effect of spirulina sp concentration on addw was significant in the concentration range tested 1 5 g l carbonate ammonium and phosphate were majorly utilized from the addw by spirulina sp resulting in the reduction of cod and total carbon up to 23 and 31 respectively it could be concluded that the spirulina sp succeeded in utilizing the pollutants from addw as its nutrients however the culture lost its treatability at the end due to the pollution characteristics of the wastewater which were away from the commercial media characteristics and also due to the presence of other complex substances in the wastewater it could also be inferred that the higher the spirulina sp biomass value and the optimization of wastewater characteristics might have been resulted in higher pollution load reduction and higher treatability of the addw the spirulina biomass thus generated after the treatment would yield biogas and might support the distillery for its power requirement acknowledgements authors acknowledge serb govt of india and

14532,distillery wastewater is treated widely by anaerobic digestion the anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw still poses high concentration of pollutants which requires further treatment in this study the possibilities of the effect of spirulina sp biomass ranging from 1 to 5 g l value on the treatment of addw was carried out under xenon lamp illumination of 10 000 200 lx with the photo period of 16 8 the reduction of chemical oxygen demand cod up to 15 23 total carbon tc up to 18 31 total inorganic carbon tic up to 31 51 and total organic carbon toc up to 1 8 were observed for the algae concentration ranging from 1 to 5 g l over a period of 5 days ion chromatography analysis was carried out to analyze the concentration of inorganic compounds in the wastewater before and after the treatment the reduction of carbonate up to 32 56 ammonium 48 72 phosphate 18 100 chloride 1 8 potassium 2 7 magnesium 10 23 and sodium 1 9 were observed in the wastewater after treating with algal biomass ranging from 1 to 5 g l it was inferred from the analysis that the spirulina sp utilized the inorganic compounds from the wastewater as its nutrients and thus resulted in the substantial removal of pollutants from the wastewater however it requires further assessment for the sustainability of the algae on the wastewater the calorific value of dry algae biomass was found as 12 mj kg which might be utilized for the production of biofuel abbreviations addw anaerobically digested distillery wastewater apha american public health association cod chemical oxygen demand tc total carbon tds total dissolved solids tic total inorganic carbon toc total organic carbon keywords anaerobically digested distillery wastewater batch study spirulina sp inorganic compounds algae biomass 1 introduction industrial wastewater treatment is a demanding fundamental area of environment research due to the emerging pollution problems being faced by receiving body either water or land although nutrients removal from the wastewater using microalgae cyanobacteria has been practiced for years 1 only limited reports are available in case of distillery wastewater due to its high pollution profile 2 the molasses based distillery wastewater has the characteristics of chemical oxygen demand cod 85 000 1 10 000 ppm tds 85 000 1 10 000 bod 25 000 35 000 ppm 3 low ph high temperature high ash content and dark brown color which make the wastewater very difficult for the safe discharge 4 in southern india due to stringent regulations stipulated by the central pollution control board cpcb many distilleries adopt techniques such as anaerobic digestion followed by aerobic operation as effluent treatment practices etp to achieve zero liquid discharge zld 5 anaerobic digestion is chosen by distillery since it is highly effective in reducing the pollution load up to 60 65 in terms of cod and generate biogas as by product through which the industry balances the power requirement up to 90 95 6 the wastewater after anaerobic digestion is rich in inorganic nutrients besides organic load microalgae could be employed at this stage as the condition satisfy the possibility of its growth 7 and reduce the water requirement for the cultivation of microalgae thereby reducing the associated cost for the cultivation in addition microalgae do not generate secondary pollution and the nutrients can be recycled after separation of algae biomass 8 the biomass thus generated could be used as biofuel bio products based on its characterization 2 in general a tonne of microalgae biomass has the worth of 1646 euro and it is based on the lipid protein and carbohydrate percentage in the biomass 3 microalgae such as scenedesmus chlorella oscillatoria and spirulina are utilized for its remediation potential in the distillery brewery wastewater 1 3 8 9 cod and total nitrogen reduction up to 57 5 and 20 8 respectively are obtained in the brewery effluent cultivated with scenedesmus obliquus for the period of 14 days 1 nitrogen and ammonia reduction are 90 2 and 84 1 respectively by chlorella vulgaris 8 cultivated for 30 days in anaerobically digested distillery wastewater spirulina maxima consumed organic nitrogen completely from distillery wastewater when the schlosser media supplemented with 5 g l of distillery wastewater 9 recently coelastrella sp 10 rhodobacter blasticus and rhodobacter capsulatus 11 are tested for its nutrient removal potential from anaerobically digested wastewater however no report is available for the treatment of distillery wastewater of pollution load equivalent to 30 000 ppm or more in terms of cod hence this investigation is mainly aimed to report the treatability of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater with the higher pollution load cod 30 000 ppm using spirulina sp with varying algae biomass value to reveal insights the study aims further to report the reduction of major inorganic compounds which contribute the pollution load of wastewater with the help of ion chromatography since many nutrient removal studies from the wastewater report only the removal of total nitrogen ammonia and phosphate 10 12 13 further the growth of microalgae is regularly observed under fluorescent light sunlight in the prevalent literature the present study utilizes xenon lamp as a light source for the treatment which is rarely reported finally the possible mechanism of nutrients uptake by microalgae is also proposed with the citation for the phycoremediation of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater by spirulina sp 2 materials and methods 2 1 spirulina culture spirulina sp obtained from gandhigram rural institute gri dindigul tamil nadu was used as a stock culture in this study the species was cultivated in a rectangular transparent tank laboratory scale open tank containing zarrouk media of composition per liter nano3 2 5 g k2hpo4 0 5 g k2so4 1 0 g nacl 1 0 g mgso4 7h2o 0 2 g cacl2 2h2o 0

illumination of xenon lamp the wet biomass was harvested by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 15 min rinsed twice with deionized water and used for the study the concentration of algae biomass was measured as a growth parameter laboratory material and glass wares used for the study were washed and autoclaved at 121 c for 15 20 min and kept under uv irradiation for an hour in the laminar air flow chamber to avoid contamination 2 2 wastewater collection and characterization the anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw was collected from m s trichy distilleries chemicals ltd tdcl tiruchirappalli tamil nadu gps coordinate 10 8009 n 78 7168 e the wastewater sample was used directly on the same day of collection to avoid variations in the characteristics before using the wastewater for the study it was centrifuged total suspended solids tss 1 g lit at 10 000 rpm for 15 min to remove tss bacteria majorly methanogens from the addw thereby avoiding interaction of methanogens with spirulina culture further it was autoclaved at 121 c for 15 min to ensure the avoidance of other contamination the parameters of the wastewater like ph conductivity salinity total dissolved solids tds chemical oxygen demand cod were measured as per apha procedure 14 carbon total carbon tc total inorganic carbon tic total organic carbon toc were analyzed using toc analyzer analytikjena multi n c 2100 inorganic content of the wastewater was analyzed using ion chromatography metrohm 930 compact ic flex chs pp 2 3 experimental set up the batch study was performed in a series of five rectangular transparent laboratory scale open tank with the dimension of 0 33 m 0 22 m 0 1 m each giving the working volume of 5 l three liter addw without dilution was introduced to the five tanks in which 3 6 9 12 and 15 g of spirulina sp biomass wet basis were added respectively amount of algal biomass was 1 5 g l of wastewater various concentrations were chosen to determine the effective algae concentration required for the treatment of anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw two spargers were provided for each reactor with the air flow rate of 3 l min for the purpose of aeration and mixing this arrangement was kept under the xenon lamp for the illumination 10 000 200 lx measured using lux meter the two spargers in each reactor were connected to the power supply and the xenon lamp was switched on it was operated for 5 days with the photo period of 16 8 the set up was open and kept under xenon lamp hood the hood was provided with fan arrangement to abate the heat arising out from the illumination of xenon lamp the experiments were performed in the laboratory environment with the temperature of 32 2 c measured using thermometer at regular time interval 2 4 statistical analysis a one way analysis of variance anova was conducted to prove the significance of compounds reduction measured using relevant parameters in the distillery wastewater by spirulina sp significance level was set at Î± 0 05 95 confidential interval duncan s multi range test was also performed to compare compound reduction in the wastewater for every concentration of spirulina sp for all the parameters analyzed 3 results and discussion studies with illumination of fluorescent and xenon lamps with the photo periods of 12 12 16 8 and 14 10 light dark l d and 8 8 8 l d l for the growth of microalgae were conducted as a preliminary study appendix a supplementary file it showed that the xenon lamp with the photo period of 16 8 resulted relatively higher growth rate of spirulina sp compared to fluorescent lamp and other photo periods in the same fixed open tank of capacity 5 l however the results were not statistically significant p 0 01 in this study the treatment was carried out using xenon lamp as a light source the parameters such as ph conductivity tds and salinity were analyzed with a regular interval of 3 h over a period of 5 days of the study the concentration value of algae biomass was measured each day of treatment study other parameters such as total carbon and chemical oxygen demand for the wastewater were also analyzed before and after the treatment study it was observed that the spirulina sp was able to uptake the nutrients while treating anaerobically digested distillery wastewater during the first day of treatment study it was monitored through the change in different parameters as shown in fig 1 a d fig 2 ph shift was observed between 14 18 for the corresponding algae biomass value of 1 5 g l fig 1 a influence of ph on biomass production of spirulina sp was also studied by ogbonda et al 15 reduction in conductivity tds and salinity were 14 25 14 25 and 15 27 respectively for a corresponding algae biomass value celekli et al 16 evaluated the spirulina sp characteristics by monitoring ph conductivity tds and salinity in the cow effluent kumari et al 17 concluded that the fall in conductivity tds and salinity were mainly due to the uptake of cations and anions from the medium by spirulina platensis the microalgae exhibited reduction in the parameters such as ph conductivity tds and salinity up to 21 h in case of 4 g l and 5 g l algae biomass value fig 1 it was up to 18 h in case of 3 g l algae biomass value it was up to 12 h for the algae biomass value of 1 g l and 2 g l of spirulina sp on addw however the parameters were not changed appreciably from day 2 to day 5 fig 2 shows the growth of spirulina platensis during the treatment period it was observed that the species had no lag phase and entered log phase after cultivation 18 the concentration of algae biomass was increased in the first day and thereafter attained a stationary phase followed by decline phase in the rest of the days of treatment fig 2 the growth was not seen from day2 to day 5 in all the treatment tanks it was witnessed that the growth was largely affected by the pollution load of wastewater since the characteristics of wastewater was largely differ from growing the algae in zarrouk media of the composition mentioned in section 2 1 the chemical oxygen demand and carbon analysis were carried out before and after the treatment period a maximum reduction of cod up to 23 and total carbon reduction up to 29 were obtained for 5 g l algae biomass value mata et al 1 also studied the reduction in cod up to 57 5 after 14 days and total carbon reduction up to 56 9 after 13 days in the brewery effluent by scenedesmus obliquus one way anova and multi range test were carried out to determine the significance of treatability of wastewater it was witnessed from the anova that the physico chemical analysis of parameters resulted in the significant reduction of pollution load of addw for all the concentration of spirulina sp added p 0 01 it was also observed that the treatability of spirulina sp on the addw during the treatment period was not significantly increased from 1 to 5 g l p 0 01 further the culture lost its treatability after the first day in all the algae biomass tank for the treatment period of 5 days zhou et al 19 was observed slower growth of algae such as chlorella vulgaris um235 chlorella sp um224 and scenedesmus sp um258 followed by reaching the declining phase after 4 days when cultivated in concentrated municipal wastewater they stated that the declination of algae treatability was due to the shortage of carbon sources in this study it was due to the fact that the nutrient concentration in the addw was much higher than the uptake level of spirulina sp and the presence of other complex substances like melanoidin hence it necessitates the requirement of more initial population of algae species for the treatment of addw since the pollution load was much higher and the optimization of wastewater characteristics for the algae growth nevertheless the pollution load of addw was significantly reduced by the species that shows the availability of required nutrients for the growth of spirulina sp in the wastewater addw the reduction in every monitored parameter in day 1 with regard to the concentration of spirulina sp added to the respective open tank set up were tabulated table 1 it was witnessed from table 1 that the percentage reduction in the pollution load was different for the different parameters measured corresponding to the increase in algae biomass value of spirulina sp it was also interesting to observe that the microalgae tends to uptake the inorganic nutrients than the organic which brought out the major reduction in tic as compared to toc table 1 the multi range anova test also resulted in the significant changes p 0 01 in the characteristics of the wastewater except in the value of total organic carbon total carbon p value 0 489 0 013 choosing a wide range of algae biomass value above the present study might be helpful to optimize the algae biomass value of spirulina sp for the sustainable cultivation of spirulina sp on the treatment of addw as indicated from the result of tic and toc values table 1 spirulina sp was tend to uptake inorganic salts than organic and so it was interesting to determine the reduction in the various inorganic salts available in the wastewater table 2 shows the concentration of major cations and anions present in the anaerobically digested wastewater used for the study carbonate was the predominant anion followed by chloride and phosphate by its concentration similarly potassium was the predominant cation followed by ammonium magnesium sodium and calcium by its concentration the selectivity of targeting specific compound in the real wastewater was the major issue for other technology such as adsorption and membrane technology 20 21 in case of spirulina sp it was found that the species was highly selective and reduced the different pollutants as per its metabolic requirement table 2 shows the reduction of anions and cations with regard to the algae biomass value of spirulina sp it was observed that the ammonium in the addw was majorly reduced by spirulina sp followed by carbonate reduction which contribute the major reduction in cod 22 of wastewater p 0 01 table 2 phosphate in the addw was completely utilized by spirulina sp of concentration 5 g l of addw 23 table 2 however its contribution to the cod was negligible p 0 01 calcium potassium and magnesium were also reduced by spirulina sp appreciably p 0 01 the reduction was also observed in sodium and chloride substances but not reduced significantly p 0 01 table 2 the uptake of nutriens by spirulina sp depends on the metabolism of the species nutrient stress posed by the wastewater and the operating conditions provided for the study 24 the operating conditions such as light source xenon lamp mimicking sunlight photo period 16 8 aeration 6 l min and temperature 32 2 c were provided for the cultivation of spirulina sp the species were cultivated in addw under mixotrophic conditions using both light and organic substances for the energy requirement and nutrients for the metabolism 1 the species consists of two interacting membranes namely thylakoid membrane and plasma membrane on the cell surface 25 the thylakoid membrane was responsible for the photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport whereas plasma membrane hold a respiratory chain and various transporters for ion homeostasis and the uptake of nutrients 26 photosynthesis and respiration process were already investigated in spirulina sp especially with reference to the stress posed by inorganic substances 27 28 however the knowledge in ion transport process and ion homeostasis in spirulina sp was still limited it was stated that the reduction in the pollution load of wastewater by cyanobacteria microalgae was due to the release of toxic active oxygen species namely superoxide anion hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide through electron transport systems this oxidizing agent produced by cyanobacteria blue green algae was fundamental in the phycoremediation 3 further carbon nitrogen and phosphorous are the essential elements for the growth of spirulina sp the species utilized the carbonate as a major carbon source and chemically reduced through photosynthesis to build a large organic molecules inside the cell 1 thus it showed a major reduction in carbonate content 32 47 of addw p 0 01 nitrogen contributes for the protein formation in the cell of spirulina sp 29 30 the sources of nitrogen could be nitrates nitrites urea and ammonium salt in the addw the urea was not present and the concentration of nitrates nitrites was less as compared to ammonium salt concentration it was said that when ammonium salt was available microalgae did not utilize other nitrogen sources until all the ammonium ion was utilized 31 hence the ammonium salt was utilized as an alternate nitrogen source by spirulina sp in addw resulting in the reduction of ammonium concentration 48 72 p 0 01 phosphorous was also an essential macronutrient for spirulina sp for the synthesis of nucleotides 29 phosphorous in the form of phosphate was available in the addw which was taken up by spirulina sp showed the complete utilization of the same in case of 5 g l algae biomass value the utilization of phosphate was energy dependent and the uptake rate was slower in the dark period than in the light cycle 32 however the concentration of phosphate in the wastewater was low and so the reduction was not significant compared to other substances in the wastewater p 0 01 chlorides were assimilated by spirulina sp due to the selective permeability of chloride ions through plasma membrane which was driven by concentration gradient across the membrane 33 hence it resulted the decrease in concentration of chloride in the addw but not significantly p 0 01 transport of cations such as calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na and potassium k across the plasma membrane of spirulina sp depend on the external osmotic pressure posed by the wastewater and the low light intensity due to the dark brown color of addw it was also noted that the addw contained other recalcitrant compound such as melanoidin which posed severe threat for the treatability of spirulina sp in addw 34 any pretreatment technique before the phycoremediation would enhance the treatability and may reduce the pollution characteristics of wastewater and may favor the treatment by spirulina sp the biomass generated from the study could be utilized for the biogas production through anaerobic digestion the calorific value of biomass was 12 mj kg mussgnug et al 35 conducted the experimental studies on biogas production with six microalgae species their studies resulted in the biogas production ranging between 0 28 and 0 65 m3 kg dry weight of microalgae further spirulina sp used for this treatment studies have low lipid content sialve et al 36 reported that lipid percentage in spirulina maxima is up to 6 7 and in spirulina platensis is up to 4 9 when the lipid content of the microalgae cell does not exceed 40 the optimum strategy in view of economics is to recover energy through the anaerobic digestion of whole biomass 36 4 conclusion this work investigated the treatability of spirulina sp on the highly polluted anaerobically digested distillery wastewater addw the effect of spirulina sp concentration on addw was significant in the concentration range tested 1 5 g l carbonate ammonium and phosphate were majorly utilized from the addw by spirulina sp resulting in the reduction of cod and total carbon up to 23 and 31 respectively it could be concluded that the spirulina sp succeeded in utilizing the pollutants from addw as its nutrients however the culture lost its treatability at the end due to the pollution characteristics of the wastewater which were away from the commercial media characteristics and also due to the presence of other complex substances in the wastewater it could also be inferred that the higher the spirulina sp biomass value and the optimization of wastewater characteristics might have been resulted in higher pollution load reduction and higher treatability of the addw the spirulina biomass thus generated after the treatment would yield biogas and might support the distillery for its power requirement acknowledgements authors acknowledge serb govt of india and

14533,the current study reports synthesis and characterization of an ecofriendly cheap and efficient biosorbent sulfonated spent coffee waste scw so3h for water remediation scw so3h was synthesized through introducing sulfonic acid polar functionalities over the polymeric biomass cellulose and lignin of the spent coffee waste scw by a simple facile and versatile method icp oes sem edx ft ir xps tga raman and uv vis spectroscopy were used to analyze the developed scw so3h biosorbent and its adsorption capacity towards the removal of different environmental pollutants in order to optimize and maximize adsorption capacity of the developed biosorbent different variables such as initial concentration biosorbent dosage ph time and temperature were evaluated the chemically engineered biosorbent showed excellent pollutant removal capacity of 812 mg g 462 mg g and 302 mg g toward methylene blue tetracycline and cr vi respectively isotherms studies showed that while organic pollutants adsorption follow langmuir isotherm cr vi adsorption follows freundlich isotherm it was also found that adsorption of all the adsorbates follow pseudo second order rate kinetic and thermodynamic values Î´h 0 and Î´g 0 showed endothermic nature as well as spontaneity of the adsorption process the present study can provide a platform in developing new generation of eco friendly cost effective and efficient biosorbent for environmental remediation keywords adsorption chromium methylene blue tetracycline spent coffee waste 1 introduction agrofood industry annually produces enormous amounts of inedible residues originating mainly from edible cereals and vegetables 1 conversion of these wastes to useful resource not just reduces ecological risk imposed by dumping them into the environment but also eliminates the need for waste management and the costs associated with the waste management 2 3 due to owning unique characteristic for instance renewability eco friendliness abundance low cost and tunable chemical composition these residues can be used as sustainable biosorbents for environmental remediation 4 9 unsurprisingly biosorbents do not have many disadvantages associated with conventional adsorbents including costly synthesis expensive equipment requirements high energy consumption and environmental issues generation 10 after tea coffee is the second most widely used agrofood and universal production of coffee residue is around 6 million tons per year deriving from manufacturing industries domestic and restaurants 11 the major components of the spent coffee waste scw are cellulose and lignin containing polar and nonpolar functionalities like hydroxyl carboxylic aldehydes ketones ether which make scw valuable source of fertilizer biodiesel fuel component animal feedstuff and pollutants adsorbent 10 12 indeed tunable functionalities over polymeric biomass of scw can be used for adsorption of different environmental pollutants 4 9 nowadays rapid industrial advancement resulted in generation and dumping various pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals to the environment causing increased global awareness for instance pharmaceutical antibiotics like tetracyclines tc have been extensively used for therapy purposes in human beings and livestock 13 18 ubiquitous distribution of highly soluble tc is posing serious environmental and health related issues at which the presence of tc in water can provoke drug resistance and challenge current antibiotic therapies 17 18 synthetic dyes which are also among the most hazardous organic pollutants in industrial effluents along with heavy metals posing a serious environmental issues due to their high biotoxicity and carcinogenic effects 19 25 due to simplicity low cost and ease of operation adsorption has been considered a versatile technique in elimination of various pollutants regardless of their physicochemical characteristic 4 9 recently there has been a great interest in development of scw based biosorbent for environmental pollutants removal surface modification e g chemical treatment and composite making were shown to be a versatile technique in significantly enhancing scw adsorption capacity 7 5 9 12 13 however the techniques used so far have not shown any promising results compared to other available pollutant biosorbents and a need for a

the samples were monitored by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using phi 5600 spectrometer at which a 1253 6 ev at 100 w magnesium mgkÎ± source was used 2 4 batch adsorption studies at first 800 ppm mb 600 ppm tc and 400 ppm cr vi stock solutions were prepared by dissolving them in deionized water and solutions of the each pollutants at desired concentrations were prepared by successive dilutions of their freshly prepared stock solutions for the batch adsorption study 10 mg of scw so3h adsorbent was added to 20 ml of adsorbate solution mb tc and cr vi in a glass vial with constant stirring for 24 h except for the time study where 20 mg adsorbent was added to 40 ml of adsorbate solution the adsorbate solution was bath sonicated for 30 min after adding the adsorbent into it 1 m

purification using continuous flow column scw so3h and sand were packed in a glass chromatographic column with dimensions 20 26 45 7 cm with this respect 1 g of scw so3h along with 110 g of sand were mixed homogeneously and filled the column as dry to support the column sand was used at the top and cotton was used at the bottom 500 ml di water was used to wash the column prior to filtering mb solution an aqueous solution of 20 ppm mb was filtered through the column at which the filtrate was analyzed using uv vis spectroscopy to measure adsorption capacity of the filter 2 6 experimental data modeling the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models were applied to examine the interaction behavior between the target pollutants and adsorbent 23 24 furthermore pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models were used to fit the kinetic data of the adsorption experiments 26 27 the equations are given in table 1 2 6 1 langmuir isotherm model the langmuir isotherm is expressed by eq 3 where qe is adsorption capacity mg g of the scw so3h qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce is the

discussion 3 1 characterization of the biosorbent morphological and elemental analysis of the scw so3h biosorbent was investigated by sem eds and the findings are shown in fig 1 sem analysis shows that the developed scw so3h biosorbent is formed of irregular microparticles as shown in fig 1 a b as it can be seen from fig 1c eds shows presence of all the elemental composition of the scw as well as introduced sulfonic acid functionalities with elemental ratio of 75 13 22 76 and 2 11 with respect to carbon oxygen and sulfur respectively fig 1 d f shows the elemental color mapping of the as synthesized biosorbent revealing the presence of c o and s respectively zeta potential analysis was carried out to find out surface charge of the developed scw so3h biosorbent according to the findings as shown in fig 2 a the scw so3h shows a highly negative surface charge over a ph range of 1 5 to 10 as expected of introduced sulfonic acid groups this large negative charge over the surface of scw so3h can induce a strong charge charge electrostatic interactions with pollutants and as a result high pollutant adsorption can be achieved raman spectra of scw so3h shows a prominent g band peak at around 1583 cm 1 revealing the sp2 type carbon or graphitic nature of the biosorbent as shown in fig 2 b 28 29 to investigate the functional groups of the developed scw so3h biosorbent and character of interactions between the biosrobent and adsorbates ftir analysis was conducted as shown in fig 3 a presence of so3 stretching peak at around 1153 cm 1 oso stretching signal at around 1356 cm 1 and co peak at around 1700 cm 1 proves successful incorporation of sulfone functionality over the surface of scw 30 furthermore coexistence of signals related to the biosrobent and pollutants show physical character of interactions between biosrobent and adsorbates with no chemical reactions tga curves of scw so3h biosorbent before and after adsorption of cr vi are shown in fig 3 b the curve of bare scw so3h shows two weight losses in the applied temperature range the first one is around 100 200 c which is related to evaporation of free water as well as water adsorbed over molecular space of the biosorbent the second weight loss is deriving from decomposition of polymeric biomass and the process ends at around 650 c however upon cr vi adsorption over scw so3h surface there is negligible mass lose at below 100 c resulting from moisture evaporation and considerable mass loss starts from around 110 c and continues to around 500 c in comparison to bare scw so3h the increased threshold of mass lose in the cr vi loaded scw so3h can be attributed to cr ions occupying water positions and formation of chromium oxide may be the reason for the cr vi loaded scw so3h material not to be fully decomposed even till 800 c 31 these results also show considerable adsorption of cr vi by biosorbent 31 xps was performed to investigate elemental composition as well as chemical and electronic state of the cr vi loaded scw so3h biosorbent which the corresponding results are plotted in fig 4 according to the findings cr 2p1 2 orbital cr 2p3 2 orbital o 1s orbital c 1s orbital s 2p orbital cr 2s orbital and o 2s orbital were detected in the samples in the regions 586 0 ev 577 7 ev 531 4 ev 284 8 ev 167 4 ev 80 9 ev 75 1 ev 43 6 ev and 24 9 ev respectively as shown in fig 4 a according to fig 4b the signals observed at be of 586 0 ev and 577 7 ev are related to chromium trioxide cr2o3 and chromium iii hydroxide cr oh 3 respectively 32 33 the three signals related to electronic structure of o 1 s orbital observed at 531 4 532 1 and 530 5 ev as shown in fig 4c correspond the species chromium iii hydroxide oxide cr oh o chromium iii sulfate cr2 so4 3 and chromium trioxide cr2o3 34 36 respectively according to fig 4d the observed signals related to c 1 s orbital at 283 3 ev 284 8 ev and 286 2 ev which can be ascribed to trichromium dicarbide cr3c2 carbon carbon cc bonding and carbon oxygen c o bounding respectively 37 39 the signal related to s 2p orbital was observed at 167 4 ev as shown in fig 4 e fig 4 f shows irregular peaks observed at 75 1 ev and 80 9 ev which can be ascribed to cr 3s orbital are related to dichromium trisulfide cr2s3 and chromium trioxide cr2o3 respectively the signals observed at 43 6 ev fig 4g and 24 9 ev fig 4h correspond to cr 3p orbital of chromium trioxide cr2o3 and o 2s orbital of hydroxide oh and c o 3 2 adsorption study effect of biosorbent dosage exposure time ph and temperature the influence of several variables such as dosage of scw so3h extent of time at which the pollutants are exposed to the biosorbent ph of the solution and temperature over adsorption capacity of the developed scw so3h biosorbent was tested and analyzed as shown in fig 5 a adsorption of all the three pollutants of mb tc and cr vi was increased upon increasing dosage of biosorbent which can be attributed to more available functionalities and chemical sites over the surface of scw to interact with the pollutants 6 13 similar results were found by increasing time exposure of pollutants to the scw so3h biosorbent as shown in fig 5 b it is apparent form this figure that the maximum adsorption of these pollutants onto scw so3h biosorbent occurred within 30 min of the time exposure however different results were found regarding influence of ph of the solution over adsorption capacity of scw so3h biosorbent it is known that ph of the solution plays an important role in adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in several ways influencing surface charge of adsorbent degree of ionization of the pollutants dissociation extent of functionalities over active sites of the adsorbent and structure of the pollutant while with respect to mb and cr vi a straight relationship between ph of the solution and the adsorption extent is found 7 20 41 tc shows completely different behavior 13 14 17 18 the influence of solution ph over adsorption of cr vi onto scw so3h was studied in ph range of 2 8 as shown in fig 5 c and in accordance with previous reports 7 41 maximum cr vi adsorption can be achieved in acidic environments indeed depending on the ph of the solution different hexavalent chromium species of cro4 2 hcro4 h2cro4 hcr2o7 or cr2o7 2 can exist 7 41 cr vi exists as cro4 2 ions at ph higher than 5 5 and it exists as hcro4 or cr2o7 2 at lower ph values depending on the chromium concentration due to the high redox potential value of cr vi 1 3 v and the presence of electron donor groups of the scw so3h biomass material and there is a probability that cr vi can be reduced to cr iii 40 additionally the phenolic groups and tannin groups are described to be electron donor groups in biomass materials 40 polyphenols are considerably found in coffee and over 30 other polyphenolic compounds are present in complex forms including flavones anthocyanin catechin and phenolic acid hence the possible reduction reactions of cr vi to cr iii is given by the following equations 40 14 h c r o 4 7 h 3 e c r 3 4 h 2 o 15 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o then the formed cr3 in the medium will bind to sulfonic acid groups of the scw so3h material moreover the acidic ph helps to enhance the redox reaction as the protons are part of this reaction 40 although cr2o7 2 specie have the same charge as cro4 2 but due to repulsion between the negatively charged functionalities over scw so3h at high ph and negatively charges hexavalent chromium adsorption capacity of scw so3h at very high ph is even lower than mid ph where hcro4 is the main existing specie 7 40 41 mb adsorption over scw so3h biosorbent increases as the ph of the solution raises 20 this phenomenon can be explained by referring to the chemical structure of mb and its cationic state as shown in fig 6 a in fact at low ph there is small interaction between scw so3h surface and cationic dye which can be due to non electrostatic interactions like Ï Ï stacking between aromatic rings of polymers cellulose and lignin existing in scw so3h and mb dye 20 in addition presence of h at low ph can results in repulsion with mb cationic state and lower the adsorption capacity however by increasing ph of the solution more sulfonic acid groups of scw so3h get dissociated and as a result more negative charge would be available for cationic mb dye to interact this strong electrostatic interaction leads to high adsorption found at high ph values 20 24 due to having complex structure and functionalities tcs are expected to show different results than that of cr vi and mb dye the chemical structures of tc are given in fig 6 b c depending on the ph of the solution tc can exist in three forms of tch tch and tch 13 17 raman studies revealed that the biosorbent can form Ï Ï interaction with the benzene rings of tc as they are sp2 type in nature as shown in fig 5c at phs below pka of tc there is some interactions between tc and scw so3h which might be due to Ï Ï stacking between the aromatic rings as well as Ï bonds of the adsorbent and adsorbate 10 however in ph more than pka of tc and due to formation of negative charged surface of tc and scw biosorbent there is an electrostatic repulsion which is the reason behind decreased adsorption in high ph values temperature of the solution has shown to have significant effect on adsorption capacity of scw so3h biosorbent according to the findings shown in fig 7 increasing temperature resulted in sharp increases in adsorption of tc and cr vi this can be explained by increased kinetic energy of adsorbates as well as scw so3h functionalities which are more available to interact with the pollutants at elevated temperatures 6 7 however no temperature influence was found with respect to mb adsorption up to 400 ppm however temperature is shown to have positive impact on the adsorption of mb dye over scw so3h at applied concentration higher than 500 ppm 3 3 isotherm study to analyze nature of interactive mechanism between the biosorbent and adsorbate and to design model and evaluate an adsorption system adsorption isotherm is considered a strong tool the isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich d r are among the well known isotherm models were applied in this study 26 27 hence in the current study we carried out isotherm study on the developed scw so3h biosorbent using different isotherms to fit our experimental data in the langmuir isotherm model it is assumed that adsorption occurs onto a homogenous surface of adsorbent which means that all of binding sites over an adsorbent are similarly interactive 26 27 on the other hand in the freundlich isotherm model it is assumed that the strength of all binding sites over an adsorbent are heterogeneous where temkin isotherm model includes a factor to investigate interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate dubinin redushkevich isotherm model is used to explore nature of an adsorption process as chemical or physical 26 27 our findings regarding isotherm study of interaction between scw so3h biosorbent and pollutants using langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich isotherm models are shown in fig 8 a d and table s1 supplementary information as it can be seen mb and tc patterns match up langmuir isotherm with r2 value of 0 999 and 0 988 respectively demonstrating that the developed scw so3h biosorbent acts as having uniform binding sites toward adsorbing mb and tc pollutants on the other hand cr vi pattern matches up freundlich isotherm with r2 value of 0 996 showing that the scw so3h biosorbent acts as having heterogeneous binding sites toward adsorbing cr vi pollutant 3 4 kinetic and thermodynamic study based on different kinetic models such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion extent of pollutant adsorption per gram of adsorbent qe after adsorption over scw so3h biosorbent is measured as plotted in fig 9 a d and table s2 supplementary information according to the findings adsorption of all the adsorbates over scw so3h biosorbent follows pseudo second order kinetic at which experimental data fits very well the calculated data 26 27 while fitting experimental data to theoretical data using pseudo first order and pseudo second order might not provide absolute sorption mechanism intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models were also performed 26 27 however both the intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models failed in fitting between experimental and theoretical data as evident from significantly lower r2 value compared to pseudo first order and pseudo second order models hence it shows that it is unlikely that intra particle diffusion is the rate determining step in the sorption of pollutants over scw so3h biosorbent 26 27 the thermodynamic study gives valuable information about an adsorption process whether it is occurring spontaneously or not as well as we can get the values of Î´ho Î´go and Î´so by calculating the fundamental thermodynamic parameters 42 46 with this respect and to better realize the influence of temperature on the mb tc and cr vi adsorption over the scw so3h biosorbent the thermodynamic parameters of Î´go Î´ho and Î´so were calculated by using the following equations 42 46 14 k c q e c e 15 Î´ g o r t l n k c 16 l n k c Î´ h o r t Î´ s o r where t k is absolute temperature r 8 314 jmol 1 k 1 is universal gas constant kc is the adsorption equilibrium constant lg 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration of the pollutants in the solution Î´go Î´so and Î´ho are standard gibb s free energy entropy and enthalpy changes respectively Î´ho and Î´so were calculated from the slope and intercept derived from the plot of lnkc vs 1 t as shown in fig s1 supplementary information from table 2 we can be seen that the kc values are increasing with increasing temperature from 298 k to 338 k which suggests the endothermic nature of the process Î´ho 0 the negative value of Î´go also indicates the spontaneity of the adsorption process with no need for foreign energy source for interactions the Î´go values are more negative at higher temperatures showing that at higher temperature the biosorption process is more favorable positive value of Î´so confirms an increased disorder and accident in the solid biosorbent and solution interface as well as high affinity towards the adsorption process 42 46 3 5 a filter based on the developed scw so3h biosorbent for pollutant removal the packed scw so3h based filter was used to remove 20 ppm mb aqueous solution in a continuous mode and the filtrate was analyzed using uv vis spectroscopy to measure the extent of mb adsorption using the developed biosorbent according to the results shown in fig 10 which shows plot of filtered water versus mb removal 100 of the mb was adsorbed over the biosorbent and removed by the filter moreover fig 10 shows that the filter is capable of removing all the mb till 13 l of mb solution and after that small drop in adsorption capacity of the filter is observed which can be due to saturation of the biosorbent by mb 3 6 comparison of the scw so3h with other coffee based adsorbents in terms of adsorption capacity according to the table 3 our developed scw so3h shows much higher adsorption capacity toward mb tc and cr vi compared to previously reported coffee waste based biosorbents hao et al coated spent coffee with polyethylenimine pei and ferric ions to remove as v cu ii and p v ions from aqueous media 47 their developed biosorbent showed maximum adsorption capacity of 83 3 200 1 and 50 2 mg g for as v cu ii and p v respectively they have also found that cu ii adsorption follows pseudo first order model while adsorption of other pollutants follow pseudo second order model 47 george z kyzas used the raw coffee spent for removal of cu ii and cr vi from aqueous media and by fitting the kinetic data on pseudo first second and third order equations reached a maximum adsorption capacity of 70 mg g for cu ii and 45 mg g for cr vi 9 he also found that rate of agitation and ph has considerable influence over pollutant adsorption 9 prabhakaran et al studied removal of cr vi ion over coffee dust and a maximum reported cr adsorption was 39 0 mg g 7 they have also found that phenolic functionalities of surface of coffee are responsible for reduction of cr vi to cr iii their findings also address that while cr vi adsorption was independent of ph cr iii was strongly depended on the ph of the aqueous media 3 7 conclusion it is shown that our developed biosorbent sulfonated spent coffee waste scw so3h synthesized via introduction of sulfonic acid polar functionalities over the polymeric biomass cellulose and lignin of the scw was an efficient biosorbent in removal of different environmental pollutants of mb tc and cr vi with higher adsorption capacities of 812 462 and 302 mg g respectively kinetic study showed that all the adsorbates were adsorbed over scw so3h following pseudo second order rate and thermodynamic study showed Î´h 0 and Î´g 0 values demonstrating endothermic nature and spontaneity of the adsoption of pollutants over scw so3h biosorbent it was also shown that while adsorption of mb and tc follow langmuir isotherm cr vi adsorption matches up with freundlich isotherm due to superior adsorption capacity observed by scw so3h compared to recently reported scw based biosorbents authors hope that this report

14533,the current study reports synthesis and characterization of an ecofriendly cheap and efficient biosorbent sulfonated spent coffee waste scw so3h for water remediation scw so3h was synthesized through introducing sulfonic acid polar functionalities over the polymeric biomass cellulose and lignin of the spent coffee waste scw by a simple facile and versatile method icp oes sem edx ft ir xps

showed excellent pollutant removal capacity of 812 mg g 462 mg g and 302 mg g toward methylene blue tetracycline and cr vi respectively isotherms studies showed that while organic pollutants adsorption follow langmuir isotherm cr vi adsorption follows freundlich isotherm it was also found that adsorption of all the adsorbates follow pseudo second order rate kinetic and thermodynamic

and efficient biosorbent for environmental remediation keywords adsorption chromium methylene blue tetracycline spent coffee waste 1 introduction agrofood industry annually produces enormous amounts of inedible residues originating mainly from edible cereals and vegetables 1 conversion of these wastes to useful resource not just reduces ecological risk imposed by dumping them into the environment but also eliminates the need for waste management and the costs associated with the waste management 2 3 due to owning unique characteristic for instance renewability eco friendliness abundance low cost and tunable chemical composition these residues can be used as sustainable biosorbents for environmental remediation 4 9 unsurprisingly biosorbents do not have many disadvantages associated with conventional adsorbents including costly synthesis expensive equipment requirements high energy consumption and environmental issues generation 10 after tea coffee is the second most widely used agrofood and universal production of coffee residue is around 6 million tons per year deriving from manufacturing industries domestic and restaurants 11 the major components of the spent coffee waste scw are cellulose and lignin containing polar and nonpolar functionalities like hydroxyl carboxylic aldehydes ketones ether which make scw valuable source of fertilizer biodiesel fuel component animal feedstuff and pollutants adsorbent 10 12 indeed tunable functionalities over polymeric biomass of scw can be used for adsorption of different environmental pollutants 4 9 nowadays rapid industrial advancement resulted in generation and dumping various pollutants e g heavy metals organic pollutants and pharmaceuticals to the environment causing increased global awareness for instance pharmaceutical antibiotics like tetracyclines tc have been extensively used for therapy purposes in human beings and livestock 13 18 ubiquitous distribution of highly soluble tc is posing serious environmental and health related issues at which the presence of tc in water can provoke drug resistance and challenge current antibiotic therapies 17 18 synthetic dyes which are also among the most hazardous organic pollutants in industrial effluents along with heavy metals posing a serious environmental issues due to their high biotoxicity and carcinogenic effects 19 25 due to simplicity low cost and ease of operation adsorption has been considered a versatile technique in elimination of various pollutants regardless of their physicochemical characteristic 4 9 recently there has been a great interest in development of scw based biosorbent for environmental pollutants removal surface modification e g chemical treatment and composite making were shown to be a versatile technique in significantly enhancing scw adsorption capacity 7 5 9 12 13 however the techniques used so far have not shown any promising results compared to other available pollutant biosorbents and a need for a highly efficient biosorbent can be felt herein we report fabrication of highly efficient biosorbent sulfonated spent coffee waste scw so3h through modification of surface chemistry and introduction of highly polar and active sulfonic acid functionalities onto the scw the adsorption capacity of the developed scw so3h was tested in the removal of different range of environmental pollutants including methylene blue mb tetracycline tc and chromium cr vi the spent coffee waste derived biosorbent showed high adsorption capacity and fast adsorption rate for the removal of mb tc and cr vi due to the

the samples were monitored by an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps using phi 5600 spectrometer at which a 1253 6 ev at 100 w magnesium mgkÎ± source was used 2 4 batch adsorption studies at first 800 ppm mb 600 ppm tc and 400 ppm cr vi stock solutions were prepared by dissolving them in deionized water and solutions of the each pollutants at desired concentrations were prepared by successive dilutions of their freshly prepared stock solutions for the batch adsorption study 10 mg of scw so3h adsorbent was added to 20 ml of adsorbate solution mb tc and cr vi in a glass vial with constant stirring for 24 h except for the time study where 20 mg adsorbent was added to 40 ml of adsorbate solution the adsorbate solution was bath sonicated for 30 min after adding the adsorbent into it 1 m

concentration of the adsorbate mb tc and cr vi solutions v is the volume of adsorbate solution ml m is the weight of the adsorbent mg and qe is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent 2 5 water purification using continuous flow column scw so3h and sand were packed in a glass chromatographic column with dimensions 20 26 45 7 cm with this respect 1 g of scw so3h along with 110 g of sand were mixed homogeneously and filled the column as dry to support the column sand was used at the top and cotton was used at the bottom 500 ml di water was used to wash the column prior to filtering mb solution an aqueous solution of 20 ppm mb was filtered through the column at which the filtrate was analyzed using uv vis spectroscopy to measure adsorption capacity of the filter 2 6 experimental data modeling the langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm models were applied to examine the interaction behavior between the target pollutants and adsorbent 23 24 furthermore pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models were used to fit the kinetic data of the adsorption experiments 26 27 the equations are given in table 1 2 6 1 langmuir isotherm model the langmuir isotherm is expressed by eq 3 where qe is adsorption capacity mg g of the scw so3h qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce is the

discussion 3 1 characterization of the biosorbent morphological and elemental analysis of the scw so3h biosorbent was investigated by sem eds and the findings are shown in fig 1 sem analysis shows that the developed scw so3h biosorbent is formed of irregular microparticles as shown in fig 1 a b as it can be seen from fig 1c eds shows presence of all the elemental composition of the scw as well as introduced sulfonic acid functionalities with elemental ratio of 75 13 22 76 and 2 11 with respect to carbon oxygen and sulfur respectively fig 1 d f shows the elemental color mapping of the as synthesized biosorbent revealing the presence of c o and s respectively zeta potential analysis was carried out to find out surface charge of the developed scw so3h biosorbent according to the findings as shown in fig 2 a the scw so3h shows a highly negative surface charge over a ph range of 1 5 to 10 as expected of introduced sulfonic acid groups this large negative charge over the surface of scw so3h can induce a strong charge charge electrostatic interactions with pollutants and as a result high pollutant adsorption can be achieved raman spectra of scw so3h shows a prominent g band peak at around 1583 cm 1 revealing the sp2 type carbon or graphitic nature of the biosorbent as shown in fig 2 b 28 29 to investigate the functional groups of the developed scw so3h biosorbent and character of interactions between the biosrobent and adsorbates ftir analysis was conducted as shown in fig 3 a presence of so3 stretching peak at around 1153 cm 1 oso stretching signal at around 1356 cm 1 and co peak at around 1700 cm 1 proves successful incorporation of sulfone functionality over the surface of scw 30 furthermore coexistence of signals related to the biosrobent and pollutants show physical character of interactions between biosrobent and adsorbates with no chemical reactions tga curves of scw so3h biosorbent before and after adsorption of cr vi are shown in fig 3 b the curve of bare scw so3h shows two weight losses in the applied temperature range the first one is around 100 200 c which is related to evaporation of free water as well as water adsorbed over molecular space of the biosorbent the second weight loss is deriving from decomposition of polymeric biomass and the process ends at around 650 c however upon cr vi adsorption over scw so3h surface there is negligible mass lose at below 100 c resulting from moisture evaporation and considerable mass loss starts from around 110 c and continues to around 500 c in comparison to bare scw so3h the increased threshold of mass lose in the cr vi loaded scw so3h can be attributed to cr ions occupying water positions and formation of chromium oxide may be the reason for the cr vi loaded scw so3h material not to be fully decomposed even till 800 c 31 these results also show considerable adsorption of cr vi by biosorbent 31 xps was performed to investigate elemental composition as well as chemical and electronic state of the cr vi loaded scw so3h biosorbent which the corresponding results are plotted in fig 4 according to the findings cr 2p1 2 orbital cr 2p3 2 orbital o 1s orbital c 1s orbital s 2p orbital cr 2s orbital and o 2s orbital were detected in the samples in the regions 586 0 ev 577 7 ev 531 4 ev 284 8 ev 167 4 ev 80 9 ev 75 1 ev 43 6 ev and 24 9 ev respectively as shown in fig 4 a according to fig 4b the signals observed at be of 586 0 ev and 577 7 ev are related to chromium trioxide cr2o3 and chromium iii hydroxide cr oh 3 respectively 32 33 the three signals related to electronic structure of o 1 s orbital observed at 531 4 532 1 and 530 5 ev as shown in fig 4c correspond the species chromium iii hydroxide oxide cr oh o chromium iii sulfate cr2 so4 3 and chromium trioxide cr2o3 34 36 respectively according to fig 4d the observed signals related to c 1 s orbital at 283 3 ev 284 8 ev and 286 2 ev which can be ascribed to trichromium dicarbide cr3c2 carbon carbon cc bonding and carbon oxygen c o bounding respectively 37 39 the signal related to s 2p orbital was observed at 167 4 ev as shown in fig 4 e fig 4 f shows irregular peaks observed at 75 1 ev and 80 9 ev which can be ascribed to cr 3s orbital are related to dichromium trisulfide cr2s3 and chromium trioxide cr2o3 respectively the signals observed at 43 6 ev fig 4g and 24 9 ev fig 4h correspond to cr 3p orbital of chromium trioxide cr2o3 and o 2s orbital of hydroxide oh and c o 3 2 adsorption study effect of biosorbent dosage exposure time ph and temperature the influence of several variables such as dosage of scw so3h extent of time at which the pollutants are exposed to the biosorbent ph of the solution and temperature over adsorption capacity of the developed scw so3h biosorbent was tested and analyzed as shown in fig 5 a adsorption of all the three pollutants of mb tc and cr vi was increased upon increasing dosage of biosorbent which can be attributed to more available functionalities and chemical sites over the surface of scw to interact with the pollutants 6 13 similar results were found by increasing time exposure of pollutants to the scw so3h biosorbent as shown in fig 5 b it is apparent form this figure that the maximum adsorption of these pollutants onto scw so3h biosorbent occurred within 30 min of the time exposure however different results were found regarding influence of ph of the solution over adsorption capacity of scw so3h biosorbent it is known that ph of the solution plays an important role in adsorption capacity of the adsorbent in several ways influencing surface charge of adsorbent degree of ionization of the pollutants dissociation extent of functionalities over active sites of the adsorbent and structure of the pollutant while with respect to mb and cr vi a straight relationship between ph of the solution and the adsorption extent is found 7 20 41 tc shows completely different behavior 13 14 17 18 the influence of solution ph over adsorption of cr vi onto scw so3h was studied in ph range of 2 8 as shown in fig 5 c and in accordance with previous reports 7 41 maximum cr vi adsorption can be achieved in acidic environments indeed depending on the ph of the solution different hexavalent chromium species of cro4 2 hcro4 h2cro4 hcr2o7 or cr2o7 2 can exist 7 41 cr vi exists as cro4 2 ions at ph higher than 5 5 and it exists as hcro4 or cr2o7 2 at lower ph values depending on the chromium concentration due to the high redox potential value of cr vi 1 3 v and the presence of electron donor groups of the scw so3h biomass material and there is a probability that cr vi can be reduced to cr iii 40 additionally the phenolic groups and tannin groups are described to be electron donor groups in biomass materials 40 polyphenols are considerably found in coffee and over 30 other polyphenolic compounds are present in complex forms including flavones anthocyanin catechin and phenolic acid hence the possible reduction reactions of cr vi to cr iii is given by the following equations 40 14 h c r o 4 7 h 3 e c r 3 4 h 2 o 15 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 6 e 2 c r 3 7 h 2 o then the formed cr3 in the medium will bind to sulfonic acid groups of the scw so3h material moreover the acidic ph helps to enhance the redox reaction as the protons are part of this reaction 40 although cr2o7 2 specie have the same charge as cro4 2 but due to repulsion between the negatively charged functionalities over scw so3h at high ph and negatively charges hexavalent chromium adsorption capacity of scw so3h at very high ph is even lower than mid ph where hcro4 is the main existing specie 7 40 41 mb adsorption over scw so3h biosorbent increases as the ph of the solution raises 20 this phenomenon can be explained by referring to the chemical structure of mb and its cationic state as shown in fig 6 a in fact at low ph there is small interaction between scw so3h surface and cationic dye which can be due to non electrostatic interactions like Ï Ï stacking between aromatic rings of polymers cellulose and lignin existing in scw so3h and mb dye 20 in addition presence of h at low ph can results in repulsion with mb cationic state and lower the adsorption capacity however by increasing ph of the solution more sulfonic acid groups of scw so3h get dissociated and as a result more negative charge would be available for cationic mb dye to interact this strong electrostatic interaction leads to high adsorption found at high ph values 20 24 due to having complex structure and functionalities tcs are expected to show different results than that of cr vi and mb dye the chemical structures of tc are given in fig 6 b c depending on the ph of the solution tc can exist in three forms of tch tch and tch 13 17 raman studies revealed that the biosorbent can form Ï Ï interaction with the benzene rings of tc as they are sp2 type in nature as shown in fig 5c at phs below pka of tc there is some interactions between tc and scw so3h which might be due to Ï Ï stacking between the aromatic rings as well as Ï bonds of the adsorbent and adsorbate 10 however in ph more than pka of tc and due to formation of negative charged surface of tc and scw biosorbent there is an electrostatic repulsion which is the reason behind decreased adsorption in high ph values temperature of the solution has shown to have significant effect on adsorption capacity of scw so3h biosorbent according to the findings shown in fig 7 increasing temperature resulted in sharp increases in adsorption of tc and cr vi this can be explained by increased kinetic energy of adsorbates as well as scw so3h functionalities which are more available to interact with the pollutants at elevated temperatures 6 7 however no temperature influence was found with respect to mb adsorption up to 400 ppm however temperature is shown to have positive impact on the adsorption of mb dye over scw so3h at applied concentration higher than 500 ppm 3 3 isotherm study to analyze nature of interactive mechanism between the biosorbent and adsorbate and to design model and evaluate an adsorption system adsorption isotherm is considered a strong tool the isotherm models such as langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich d r are among the well known isotherm models were applied in this study 26 27 hence in the current study we carried out isotherm study on the developed scw so3h biosorbent using different isotherms to fit our experimental data in the langmuir isotherm model it is assumed that adsorption occurs onto a homogenous surface of adsorbent which means that all of binding sites over an adsorbent are similarly interactive 26 27 on the other hand in the freundlich isotherm model it is assumed that the strength of all binding sites over an adsorbent are heterogeneous where temkin isotherm model includes a factor to investigate interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate dubinin redushkevich isotherm model is used to explore nature of an adsorption process as chemical or physical 26 27 our findings regarding isotherm study of interaction between scw so3h biosorbent and pollutants using langmuir freundlich temkin and dubinin redushkevich isotherm models are shown in fig 8 a d and table s1 supplementary information as it can be seen mb and tc patterns match up langmuir isotherm with r2 value of 0 999 and 0 988 respectively demonstrating that the developed scw so3h biosorbent acts as having uniform binding sites toward adsorbing mb and tc pollutants on the other hand cr vi pattern matches up freundlich isotherm with r2 value of 0 996 showing that the scw so3h biosorbent acts as having heterogeneous binding sites toward adsorbing cr vi pollutant 3 4 kinetic and thermodynamic study based on different kinetic models such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion extent of pollutant adsorption per gram of adsorbent qe after adsorption over scw so3h biosorbent is measured as plotted in fig 9 a d and table s2 supplementary information according to the findings adsorption of all the adsorbates over scw so3h biosorbent follows pseudo second order kinetic at which experimental data fits very well the calculated data 26 27 while fitting experimental data to theoretical data using pseudo first order and pseudo second order might not provide absolute sorption mechanism intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models were also performed 26 27 however both the intra particle diffusion and liquid film diffusion kinetic models failed in fitting between experimental and theoretical data as evident from significantly lower r2 value compared to pseudo first order and pseudo second order models hence it shows that it is unlikely that intra particle diffusion is the rate determining step in the sorption of pollutants over scw so3h biosorbent 26 27 the thermodynamic study gives valuable information about an adsorption process whether it is occurring spontaneously or not as well as we can get the values of Î´ho Î´go and Î´so by calculating the fundamental thermodynamic parameters 42 46 with this respect and to better realize the influence of temperature on the mb tc and cr vi adsorption over the scw so3h biosorbent the thermodynamic parameters of Î´go Î´ho and Î´so were calculated by using the following equations 42 46 14 k c q e c e 15 Î´ g o r t l n k c 16 l n k c Î´ h o r t Î´ s o r where t k is absolute temperature r 8 314 jmol 1 k 1 is universal gas constant kc is the adsorption equilibrium constant lg 1 ce is the equilibrium concentration of the pollutants in the solution Î´go Î´so and Î´ho are standard gibb s free energy entropy and enthalpy changes respectively Î´ho and Î´so were calculated from the slope and intercept derived from the plot of lnkc vs 1 t as shown in fig s1 supplementary information from table 2 we can be seen that the kc values are increasing with increasing temperature from 298 k to 338 k which suggests the endothermic nature of the process Î´ho 0 the negative value of Î´go also indicates the spontaneity of the adsorption process with no need for foreign energy source for interactions the Î´go values are more negative at higher temperatures showing that at higher temperature the biosorption process is more favorable positive value of Î´so confirms an increased disorder and accident in the solid biosorbent and solution interface as well as high affinity towards the adsorption process 42 46 3 5 a filter based on the developed scw so3h biosorbent for pollutant removal the packed scw so3h based filter was used to remove 20 ppm mb aqueous solution in a continuous mode and the filtrate was analyzed using uv vis spectroscopy to measure the extent of mb adsorption using the developed biosorbent according to the results shown in fig 10 which shows plot of filtered water versus mb removal 100 of the mb was adsorbed over the biosorbent and removed by the filter moreover fig 10 shows that the filter is capable of removing all the mb till 13 l of mb solution and after that small drop in adsorption capacity of the filter is observed which can be due to saturation of the biosorbent by mb 3 6 comparison of the scw so3h with other coffee based adsorbents in terms of adsorption capacity according to the table 3 our developed scw so3h shows much higher adsorption capacity toward mb tc and cr vi compared to previously reported coffee waste based biosorbents hao et al coated spent coffee with polyethylenimine pei and ferric ions to remove as v cu ii and p v ions from aqueous media 47 their developed biosorbent showed maximum adsorption capacity of 83 3 200 1 and 50 2 mg g for as v cu ii and p v respectively they have also found that cu ii adsorption follows pseudo first order model while adsorption of other pollutants follow pseudo second order model 47 george z kyzas used the raw coffee spent for removal of cu ii and cr vi from aqueous media and by fitting the kinetic data on pseudo first second and third order equations reached a maximum adsorption capacity of 70 mg g for cu ii and 45 mg g for cr vi 9 he also found that rate of agitation and ph has considerable influence over pollutant adsorption 9 prabhakaran et al studied removal of cr vi ion over coffee dust and a maximum reported cr adsorption was 39 0 mg g 7 they have also found that phenolic functionalities of surface of coffee are responsible for reduction of cr vi to cr iii their findings also address that while cr vi adsorption was independent of ph cr iii was strongly depended on the ph of the aqueous media 3 7 conclusion it is shown that our developed biosorbent sulfonated spent coffee waste scw so3h synthesized via introduction of sulfonic acid polar functionalities over the polymeric biomass cellulose and lignin of the scw was an efficient biosorbent in removal of different environmental pollutants of mb tc and cr vi with higher adsorption capacities of 812 462 and 302 mg g respectively kinetic study showed that all the adsorbates were adsorbed over scw so3h following pseudo second order rate and thermodynamic study showed Î´h 0 and Î´g 0 values demonstrating endothermic nature and spontaneity of the adsoption of pollutants over scw so3h biosorbent it was also shown that while adsorption of mb and tc follow langmuir isotherm cr vi adsorption matches up with freundlich isotherm due to superior adsorption capacity observed by scw so3h compared to recently reported scw based biosorbents authors hope that this report

14534,recovery followed by re use of process water obtained from dairy effluents by means of reverse osmosis technology is one route that can provide the dairy industry with the possibility to reach sustainable water regimes however membrane fouling is a phenomenon that limits both the efficiency and increases the running costs of such reverse osmosis units and can potentially alter the quality characteristics of permeate water in this paper several industrial scale ro membranes used for recovery of process water from whey uf permeate have been examined for their fouling tendency at the end of a complete clean in place cip protocol based on alkaline acid formulations biofouling appears to be the main issue in the investigated ro elements between 4 19 and 5 69 log10 cfu cm 2 of viable microorganisms still remained on the membrane retentate surface and more surprisingly evidence of significant contamination was found on permeate side of these particular membranes microbiological analysis indicate that minor loads of microorganisms do pass into the permeate streams but final uv treatments ensured final process water with non detectable levels there is a need for optimization of cleaning procedures and finding the best compromise for achieving surface disinfection while still preserving membrane integrity and not compromising the water quality keywords reverse osmosis ro membranes water recovery biofouling cip confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 1 introduction climate change responsibilities fresh water shortage strict discharge regulations and financial gains are all factors that drive industries to seek out more sustainable practices and possibilities of water recovery in order to lower their effluents and water intake over the years reverse osmosis ro membrane technology has demonstrated to be an excellent platform for recovery of water with high quality characteristics acting as a barrier to nearly all pollutants the ro membranes produce water which can fulfill the strict quality regulations for public health and environment protection 1 the food industries depend upon clean fresh water for a wide range of processes and cleaning operations and the implementation of safe and efficient water recovery strategies has become a major priority for many stakeholders 2 several examples of water recycling or reuse within the food sector have been reviewed by vourch et al 3 and casani et al 4 emerging originally as the biggest consumer and wastewater producer within the food area the dairy industry is becoming one of the leaders in water reuse practices 5 this is enabled primarily by their vast experience in applying membrane technology for concentrating or fractionating different liquid streams but also due to the great potential of recovering water from different process streams such as milk or cheese whey 6 7 this trend is also stimulated by the large volumes of water required for cleaning 8 raw whey was traditionally considered a big biological pollutant however using various membrane technologies in series such as ultrafiltration uf followed by ro and possibly a ro polisher it can now be valorized by harvesting high nutritional products whey and lactose powder and ultimately the liquid can be recovered as water which can qualify for reuse in production steps such as heat exchangers and clean in place cip operations 9 ro units primarily use reverse osmosis membrane elements with a spiral wound configuration the main reason for this is their compact format advantageous price high membrane surface area in relation to their volume and fitness for multiple applications 10 unfortunately when processing a product with increased organic loads such as permeates from whey separation organic fouling and more notable biofouling are major risks that need to be minimized next to the potential safety risks the biofilm formation can have a serious negative impact on the performance of the filtration system by lowering the trans membrane flux 11 and cause decreased salt rejection 12 most published works conclude that biofouling appears to be an inevitable phenomenon which dictates the need to develop strategies to keep it under control these may include development of novel more easily cleanable membrane configurations and materials or control of fouling of existing technologies by optimizing the cleaning formulation and operational conditions in relation to the characteristics of the feed product however the operation and maintenance costs combined with the risk of destroying the membranes structural integrity will increase if too frequent or too harsh cleaning is applied an additional sanitation in place sip step right after cip using e g peroxides or chlorine containing formulations could shorten the lifetime of membrane elements considerably and is thus limited to special occasions like any technological solution in the food industry a positive cost benefit assessment will make the difference and running costs of the equipment is an important aspect in this in spite of cleaning and technological improvements of membrane properties aimed to mitigate the issue biofouling is still reported on whey concentration ro membranes by e g hassan et al 2009 13 adnan et al 14 and tang et al 15 their findings showed that cip was not entirely efficient in removing the resident microflora and could in the worst case result in cross contaminating of the concentrated product similarly when a new water recovery mode is added to the functionality of existing ro systems processing whey uf permeate it becomes important to understand the biofouling trends and even more the impact on the ro permeates quality the published work of meneses and flores 16 supports the feasibility and safety aspects of using the recovered process water for cleaning purposes depending on the specific industry and application the process water treatment operations may have multiple ro units in series and this is generally followed by uv treatment to further safeguard the microbiological quality here we focus on the extent of biofouling on industrial scale ro membrane elements used in recovering process water from whey uf permeate operational conditions in industrial set ups are in general complex due to factors which may be hard to be controlled such as variable quality of whey uf permeate batch to batch and dairy to dairy variations unforeseen break downs leakages or simply due to parameters that are occasionally tuned based on production demands and even on a short term i e weeks the semi continuous production chain in ro production cip production cip has many unpredictable dynamic patterns where the previous run s can leave an imprint on the elements influencing the present performance 17 all these render any industrial ro membrane to be exposed to a large set of varying conditions during their life time which are impossible to simulate realistically in laboratory studies it is therefore important to derive operational practices based on observations attained from industrial scale ro membranes and evaluate the efficiency of industrial cleaning in removing any type of fouling to do so membrane autopsy is the best tool to gain accurate insights concerning fouling composition patterns and their residing communities in this study the condition of used industrial scale reverse osmosis membranes on both retentate and permeate surfaces will be characterized from a biofouling perspective in order to provide new knowledge which may help to improve practices for reusing process water 2 methods and materials 2 1 collection of ro membrane a total of six ro elements have been subjected to membrane autopsy and examined for their fouling tendencies elements are denoted alphabetically in table 1 where their membrane specific characteristics can be found as well with one exception namely ro e all elements originate from the same processing plant which uses cheese whey uf permeate trucked in from different dairies as a feed product for a two stage reverse osmosis system ro plus ro polisher operated in a recovery mode for process water see fig 1 a the elements investigated were collected in particular from the first stage ro of the reverse osmosis process the collection has been conducted in two steps namely phase i ro a and ro b and six months later phase ii ro bb ro c ro d and ro e phase i was initiated as an exploratory stage meant to assess the extent of fouling at this particular ro unit in this phase the first interest was to determine the level of actual surface fouling at the end of a production cycle that a cip protocol would have to remove or reduce for that purpose element ro a was collected prior to cleaning after flushing with water also in phase i element ro b was collected at a different location loop after subjecting the entire unit to the current cip protocol which at that time used an alkaline acid cleaning formulation this formulation had been in place for more than one year in phase ii all elements have been collected after having completed their cip cycle it should be noted that due to a management decision shortly after phase i the routine cip protocol for the ro units has been changed to a new alkaline acid cleaning formulation in phase ii it was also possible to inspect the surface of element ro e from a different production plant it was in particular interesting to examine ro e due to the heat sanitation step included in the routine cip sip regime such a sip step in particular via hydrogen peroxide or by short heat treatments is a known efficient way to counteract biofouling trends to further explore this option element ro c was taken from production and moved to a pilot unit to undergo a heat sanitation step given their industrial history of use distinct locations within the unit and the before mentioned complex process dynamics of membrane operations each inspected ro element should be considered as a snap shot of its independent scenario direct quantitative comparisons can thus not be made this is only possible to a minor extent for ro b ro bb ro c and ro d due to their origin being the same pressure vessel all ro elements were transported in polyethylene bags from the production site to the university on the day of their removal and stored at 5 c for up to 5 days until autopsy and analysis 2 2 membrane configuration and autopsy procedure the ro membrane itself is structured in a three layer configuration namely a thin polyamide layer 200 nm deposited on top of a polyethersulfone porous layer about 50 Î¼m placed on top of a non woven fabric support sheet see fig 2 b the polyamide top layer is responsible for the permeability of water and rejection of dissolved impurities whereas the other layers give the membrane mechanical strength therefore the concentration of the feed product takes place at the side of the polyamide layer which will be further named as retentate surface side while the bottom support layer represents the permeate surface side when constructing them in the spiral wound elements fig 2a several membrane sheets are laid out alternating their display namely one facing inward while the next membrane faces outward following this arrangement in the whole stack the retentate sides of consecutive membranes end up facing each other and similar sorting happens for the permeate sides the edges of consecutive membranes are glued by sealing their permeate sides together with a fine permeate spacer in between leaving only one side to serve as an exit for the permeate stream the outer sides of the glued membrane envelopes the retentate sides are also separated this time by coarser feed spacers in order to ensure flow of the feed product finally a central tube is attached to the exit side of each of the resulting envelopes and rolled around the tube creating the spiral shape see fig 2a which is further enclosed in a polypropylene hard outer shell for the elements investigated the autopsy was initiated by cutting the polypropylene hard outer shell and exposing the membranes by unrolling all leaves from their connection to the central permeate tube for each ro element two non consecutive envelopes with sufficient distance between each other were investigated next a series of large coupons of 10 10 cm size were cut aseptically along each leaf surface as illustrated in fig 1b and inspected for biofilm presence by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm all coupons were stored at 5 c until the following day when visualized with clsm note that phase i was conducted as an exploratory phase to capture any potential biofilm structure present across the ro membranes thus an extensive sampling pattern was employed in order to capture enough biofilm structure variation and identifying a potential location effect over one membrane surfaces due to different flow profiles 18 phase ii was used as a verification experiment to collect more snap shots as described before of normal production and as demonstration for a relatively fast collection of information on cip and or sip efficiency and residual surface fouling 2 3 isolation sample collection for isolation purposes was done via a scrapping or swabbing procedure a 10 Î¼l plastic sterile loop sigmaaldrich was used to scrape and collect samples from both the retentate and permeate side whenever thicker deposits could be seen on the membrane surface these samples were streaked onto both standard mypg selective agar prepared with 0 01 chloramphenicol and 0 005 chlortetracycline antibiotics for yeast isolation and plate count agar pca plates for heterotrophic bacteria isolation whenever scrapping was not possible due to a lack of a visible residual fouling samples were collected instead via the swab procedure using sterile 10 10 cm compress tissues the swab samples were placed on agar plates at room temperature and then removed after one day all plates scraping and swabbing followed incubation at 25 c until growth and dominant colonies correspondent for both sides retentate and permeate were isolated and sequenced in a separate investigation data not shown 2 4 microbiological analysis on membrane surface standard aerobic plate counting was performed on standard pca substrate by the drop plating technique as described by herigstad et al 19 the microbial population levels were estimated based on 10 10 cm areas using four sampling spots on the retentate side fig 1b note that microbial levels were determined also on the permeate side however using one single spot per inspected leaf and conducted only for membrane samples originating from phase ii fig 1b sample collection was done via a swabbing procedure briefly sterile 10 10 cm compress tissues were first pre hydrated in autoclaved 0 9 saline peptone water spo in a sterile closed container the moisturized tissues were used to swab the assigned area and placed in sterile stomacher bags 50 ml of autoclaved 0 9 spo was added to each bag under sterile conditions followed by homogenization in a stomacher 400 circulator seward limited uk for 1 min the homogenized solution from each bag served as zero dilution for their corresponding sampling next series of tenfold dilution were performed at four levels in 9 ml of 0 9 spo for each sample and plated onto pca agar plates by dispersing five evenly spaced 5 Î¼l drops after the drops on the agar dried 10 20 min the pca plates were inverted and incubated at 25 c for 17 20 h the total colony forming units cfu over all drops at the countable dilution level 30 300 colonies were determined scaled back and expressed as log10 cfu cm 2 2 5 microbiological analysis on ro permeate streams ro permeate samples were collected after 10 h of production hence following the last cip cycle from positions p1 p6 as indicated in fig 1 and transported in the same day to the university s lab during transportation the temperature in containers fluctuated between 7 and 10 c at arrival all samples were stored overnight at 4 c followed by microbial analysis next morning standard aerobic plate counting was conducted in pca agar via the spread plating technique in addition aerobic plate counting was conducted in parallel also on mypg prepared with antibiotics as described before in order to support growth for only yeast species and thus estimate yeast population levels tenfold serial dilutions done in duplicate at three levels were performed for each of the initial samples zero dilutions and spread further onto pca and mypg antibiotics plates during spread plating a volume of 100 Î¼l was taken from each dilution and spread individually over one agar plate following this method a limit of detection lod of 10 cfu ml 1 could be achieved since low cell counts were expected in samples taken from p3 p4 p5 and p6 the spread plating technique has been supplemented with the triple plate method for only the initial sample zero dilution in order to achieve an lod of 1 cfu ml 1 triple plating here means that 1 ml was taken directly from the intended sample and equally distributed in three agar plates approx 0 33 ml per plate at the end of plate incubation the colonies grown on all the three plates were added incubation was done at 25 c for all plates followed for 10 days to ensure that slow growing or injured species e g after uv treatment will get sufficient time to develop due to low cell counts results are shown as cfu ml 1 as opposed to microbiological analysis on membrane surface where counts are expressed in log10 cfu cm 2 2 6 confocal laser scanning microscopy coupons dedicated for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were analyzed within two days of their removal from membrane elements using a clsm instrument zeiss lsm 800 carl zeiss inc equipped with an inverted microscope and multiple laser lines note that in the exploratory phase i a total number of 16 coupons for each sampled leaf were inspected whereas in phase ii given the aim of a quick spot check only 2 coupons per leaf were visualized fig 1b each coupon was divided into two sub samples and dedicated to visualize their surface one for the retentate side and the other for the permeate side observations of spatial distribution of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps potentially present on the membrane samples were achieved by combining three fluorescent dyes selected based on literature 20 21 all fluorochromes were purchased from invitrogen molecular probes eugene or usa briefly nucleic acids were stained with syto 9 live dead biofilm viability kit l10316 the entire biofilm matrix was stained with sypro ruby sypro ruby biofilm matrix stain f10318 labeling all types of proteins whereas concanavalin a cona c860 was chosen to target specifically the glycoproteins within the entire biofilm matrix thus the bacterial eps glycoconjugates the three stains syto 9 sypro ruby and cona were excited at 483 nm 283 nm and 558 nm respectively their detection wavelengths were optimized for minimum cross talk based on pre experiments and from there on applied to all samples this resulted in emission from syto 9 nucleic acids bacterial cells being recorded in the range of 480 520 nm emission from sypro ruby biofilm matrix acquired between 599 and 700 nm and emission from cona eps glycoconjugates was detected at 535 592 nm during one recording an image for each channel was generated with a frame size of 512 512 pixels and a field of view of 101 41 101 41 Î¼m acquired via an oil objective 63 x n a 1 2 a representative example is shown in fig 3 in all other figures in this paper the channel merged image is used the staining procedure involved the preparation of a working solution which contained equal volumes of each stain prepared according to the supplier s instructions a similar method of staining simultaneously with three fluorochromes has been employed by bar zeev et al 2014 20 a 200 Î¼l volume of the final mixture was added on top of the coupon piece on the surface side intended to be imaged the prepared sample was incubated in darkness at room temperature for 30 min followed by rinsing with 15 ml of sterile water in order to remove unbound stain and all loosely adherent cells or thicker deposits of organic matter generally a gentle rinse with a few ml of water is recommended in our study a more intensive washing was chosen to ensure that any remaining microorganisms were attached to the sample surface coupons were then fixed onto a glass slide using a cover glass and transparent nail polish an example of a z stack of the coupons can be seen in fig 2c for a layer of budding yeast cells of approximately 5 Î¼m thickness deposited on the ro b retentate surface in this case z1 represents the top image while z5 captures the bottom layer when reaching the membrane surface similarly fig 2d shows a z stack for a filamentous yeast layer deposited on the ro b permeate surface due to its thickness a fairly larger number of optical sections were needed here in order to capture the entire bulk structure where z7 is the top first image inside the layer and z51 is the optical section in the overall z stack where the membrane surface is reached we can assume that the corresponding yeast layer here reaches about a 47 Î¼m thickness for simplicity all clsm images presented in this paper are the most representative optical section within a particular z stack which could e g be z2 and z18 for measurement series displayed in figs 2c and d respectively 3 results and discussions several ro elements utilized for processing whey uf permeate were screened for their fouling status and the microbial community characterized from a quantitative and morphological perspective based on total viable counts of aerobic microbial cells and microscopic analysis 3 1 visual characteristics of ro elements collected prior to cleaning after flushing element ro a displayed as expected wet yellow colored deposits covering the entire retentate side of each membrane leaf both yeast and bacteria could be observed by microscopy in the correspondent foulant nothing could be seen on the permeate side of ro a the retentate side of all other elements appeared cleaned upon visual inspection the overall appearance of a clean surface suggests the efficiency of the different cip protocols in removing most organic fouling from the retentate side of the membranes on inspection of the permeate surfaces of membranes from ro b ro bb roc and ro d all showed isolated white colored deposits which contained mainly filamentous yeast this foulant was in homogeneously distributed across membrane s surface 3 2 microbiological analysis on membrane surface fig 4 summarizes the counts on the retentate surface of each inspected membrane microbial levels did not vary significantly between the two leaves from the same element as stated before all cleaned ro elements showed evidence of having undergone the cip protocol regardless of their cleaning formulation as most of the organic matter was removed however certain levels of a microbial population still remained on the membrane retentate surface an average microbial count of 4 19 log10 cfu cm 2 was found on ro b ciped retentate side whereas both ro d and ro bb both ciped had a higher microflora level between 5 56 and 5 69 log10 cfu cm 2 which was unexpectedly comparable with an average of 5 94 log10 cfu cm 2 detected on ro a that had only a water flush fig 4 similar levels have been reported before by other researchers on industrial ro membranes where the feed product consisted of whey 22 considering that the inspected ro elements all had been processing whey uf permeate a general lower count would have been expected since the upstream ultrafiltration unit should retain most of the microbial load 3 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy next to the total counts visualizing the status of residual microflora can assist in understanding the extent of surface attachment given the large number of recordings obtained in phase i it was observed that most images display structures that can be classified in four general categories representative examples of these four biofilm structures are presented in fig 5 applying this visual classification it can be determined that most structures identified on ro b show loose bacterial cells surrounded or trapped in a biofilm matrix structures b and d with significantly less recordings that display free cells structure a the microbial community of non ciped element ro a retentate side consisted mainly of streptococci and rod shaped bacteria plus budding and filamentous yeast as isolated from pca and mypg antibiotics selective plates upon inspection of the retentate side of ro a coupons under the confocal microscope it was found that the different isolates were in most cases present as free cells structure a or packed in a dense protein like matrix structure d see fig 6 for a quantitative evaluation based on visual scoring of the clsm recordings it should be noted here that the areas involved approximately 1m2 per leaf see fig 1b in combination with microscopy make quantification challenging moreover in the clsm we actively searched for a contamination spot in each measurement sample coupon hence the results presented should be interpreted as semi quantitative several permeate side ro a coupons selected randomly were investigated by confocal microscopy none of them had evidence of contamination on the permeate surface as a result clsm analysis continued by only evaluating the retentate surface of ro a coupons the structures on ro b ciped retentate consisted mostly of loose yeast cell aggregates structure b see fig 6 mainly budding and filamentous yeast with the same morphology as found on ro a could be isolated from ro b retentate some evidence of remaining bacterial rods was found in the clsm images captured albeit only on one coupon a common characteristic for ro b and all other cleaned ro elements is that the residual microflora present on the retentate surface exhibits cellular membranes stained primarily by cona it is known that microorganisms tend to encapsulating themselves in a self produced extracellular polymeric matrix eps in order to survive stressful conditions such as shear stress competition low nutrients availability etc 23 such structures were not identified in most of the images recorded on the retentate ro a coupons which could suggest that the production of extracellular polysaccharides eps may have been stimulated by the hostile conditions induced by cleaning see figs 7 and 8 an alternative interpretation is that the applied cleaning treatments specifically the alkaline step in the cip recipe may expose the deeper attached layers that contain more eps to fully elucidate the biofouling status of these yeasts is not possible in a closed industrial system the permeate surface of all ro b coupons was found widely covered by multiple layers of exclusively filamentous yeast that displayed the same type of structures fig 7 the individual yeast cells were extremely long with branching hyphae that spread and covered a large area their structures were primarily stained by sypro ruby and cona it was observed in the mypg antibiotics selective agar that the filamentous isolates grew slowly taking between three and four days the combination of slow growth and the relative low number of cells compared with bacterial cells in many cases may have prevented the detection of these yeast previously the present direct microscopically approach indicates that they may have an important role in the biofouling due to the large coverage by each cell when ro bb ro c and ro d originating from same pressure vessel as ro b were sampled several months later during phase ii the same type of previously isolated budding and filamentous yeast were colonizing this time they were seen on both retentate and permeate side of all three elements and rod shaped bacteria could be more easily spotted on each element s retentate surface see fig 8 an additional experimental sanitation step at 78 c for 20 min was applied on ro c in a pilot facility the low viable counts on the ro c retentate side indicated the efficiency of this sanitation step based on n 8 observations for each surface side retentate and permeate for each ro element sampled in phase ii the clsm images suggest that the microbial levels in ro c were comparable with levels found in ro bb and ro d considering that ro d and ro bb had a distinct operating time namely 6 months and 3 4 years respectively one could expect to see differences in their biofouling structure overall similar types of aggregates could however be observed across the retentate surface fig 8 compared to ro b the eps surrounded cells were arranged in more dense clusters also on the permeate surface of all phase ii ro elements filamentous cells were intertwined with budding yeast cells and in some cases without full coverage in an eps matrix as compared to ro b figs 7 and 8 this could indicate the presence of a younger microflora the effective age of use did not seem to have an influence on present microbiota when judging solely on the results from the retentate side and the two operation times investigated on the other hand the clsm images and the total counts detected on the permeate membrane surface suggest that ro d had less microbial contamination here than the older ro bb element although the character of the observations one swab sample and two membrane coupons for each leaf visualized by confocal microscopy makes the comparisons semi quantitative clsm images of the permeate side of the heat sanitized ro c show a fairly contaminated surface but with no viable counts detected upon plating this confirms the efficiency of the extreme heating step in inactivating any residual microorganisms on this membrane on the other hand viable counts were still detected though at considerable lower level on both the retentate and permeate side of ro e element which came from another process function but also had a 78 c sanitation step included in its cleaning protocol little was observed upon confocal microscopy inspection of the sampled membrane coupons but rods cocci pink budding yeast as well as filamentous yeast could be isolated in agar plates with samples from the ro e retentate side while rod shaped bacteria were isolated from the ro e permeate side samples results not shown the hyphal cells may be responsible for an increased strength of the biofilm and show resistance to the shearing effect of the permeate streams a dense filamentous yeast structure as found on ro b fig 7 might cause decreased permeate flux necessitating more pressure this corrective measure is common in an industrial set up and translates directly into increased costs for the production plant our findings indicate that yeast may play an important role in the biofouling process and that biofouling on the ro membranes permeate side should not be overlooked 3 4 microbiological analysis on ro permeate streams in the spiral wound configuration the permeate side is considered a closed space where only clean water is allowed to circulate a cip protocol can only restore the properties of retentate surface efficiently while cleaning agents are not meant to reach the permeate side consequently any opportunity for microorganisms to access the permeate space is undesirable if microorganisms arrive on the permeate side the non woven fabric could act as an excellent type of surface for attachment and it has been observed that the very low nutrient levels are able to create suitable conditions for specific cells to proliferate 24 consequently the development of microorganisms on membrane surface may lead to a permanent source of cross contamination for permeate streams our findings show that the feed product whey uf permeate contained viable microorganisms in the order of 100 cfu ml 1 while the ro permeate streams had levels below or at the detection limit in the final water which in this case had been exposed to two ro treatments as well as uv before and after the buffer tank no microorganisms were detected table 2 this suggests that in spite of evidence of high microbial contamination on membrane permeate surfaces the microbial safety parameters of permeate streams do not necessarily reflect any risks however worse case scenarios can potentially happen in industrial set ups which from a long term perspective requires a strategy and monitoring procedure for reclaimed water suitable to prevent failures in operating such units the foremost issue seems to be the technological implications related to biofouling and flux decline routine checks conducted over time with a strategic sampling for membrane autopsy may be an example of a small compromise that can help industries to adapt and optimize their practices especially when accurate real time monitoring techniques are difficult to implement for such closed high pressure and compact systems even better these types of checks could start with the membrane autopsy of elements that show low performance and are intended for replacement anyway valuable insights can be gained from understanding their particular cause of failure such data bases may help on the one hand to identify if any trends occur within the production plant but also to formulate new specifications for developing membranes with improved properties or configurations based on full scale practice rather than small scale experiments different feed spacers materials or flow regimes may dictate biofilm morphology and potentially influence the type of microbial community thus optimization e g by periodical low frequency heat sanitation should be seen as a continuous process since one adjustment will lead to new issues consequently tuning the process conditions based on results of the autopsy procedure can be a better approach compared to sticking to fixed recipes until significantly low performance arises sampling and achieving true quantitative comparisons for large surface areas is difficult to conduct in an industrial set up a production plant is a system far from the ideal scenario since its operational conditions feed product characteristics and cleaning efficiency are variables that change continuously thereby influencing the overall unit performance and state of the system in spite of this process water recovery is a rapidly growing area and more investigations as hereby presented in full scale production are needed to get a better understanding and a route to further optimization 4 conclusions autopsy was performed on industrial scale reverse osmosis membrane elements that have been used for water recovery from whey separation permeate and their different biofouling structures were characterized via clsm extensive biofouling was seen on membranes after simple flushing but biofouling was also present on membranes after routine cip treatment on the retentate side and more surprisingly on the permeate side a mixed microbial community was generally found on the retentate surface of all inspected membranes visually primarily composed of yeast filamentous yeast with numerous long hyphae were observed on the permeate surfaces and the layer stained primarily by cona labeling glycoconjugates microbiological analysis of the reclaimed double uv treated process water streams showed no detectable microbial activity acknowledgements this work was supported by the reuse of water

14534,recovery followed by re use of process water obtained from dairy effluents by means of reverse osmosis technology is one route that can provide the dairy industry with the possibility to reach sustainable water regimes however membrane fouling is a phenomenon that limits both the efficiency and increases the running costs of such reverse osmosis units and can potentially alter the quality characteristics of permeate water in this paper several industrial scale ro membranes used for recovery of process water from whey uf permeate have been examined for their fouling tendency at the end of a complete clean in place cip protocol based on alkaline acid formulations biofouling appears to be the main issue in the investigated ro elements between 4 19 and 5 69 log10 cfu cm 2 of viable microorganisms still remained on the membrane retentate surface and more surprisingly evidence of significant contamination was found on permeate side of these particular membranes microbiological analysis indicate that minor loads of microorganisms do pass into the permeate streams but final uv treatments ensured final process water with non detectable levels there is a need for optimization of cleaning procedures and finding the best compromise for achieving surface disinfection while still preserving membrane integrity and not compromising the water quality keywords reverse osmosis ro membranes water recovery biofouling cip confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm 1 introduction climate change responsibilities fresh water shortage strict discharge regulations and financial gains are all factors that drive industries to seek out more sustainable practices and possibilities of water recovery in order to lower their effluents and water intake over the years reverse osmosis ro membrane technology has demonstrated to be an excellent platform for recovery of water with high quality characteristics acting as a barrier to nearly all pollutants the ro membranes produce water which can fulfill the strict quality regulations for public health and environment protection 1 the food industries depend upon clean fresh water for a wide range of processes and cleaning operations and the implementation of safe and efficient water recovery strategies has become a major priority for many stakeholders 2 several examples of water recycling or reuse within the food sector have been reviewed by vourch et al 3 and casani et al 4 emerging originally as the biggest consumer and wastewater producer within the food area the dairy industry is becoming one of the leaders in water reuse practices 5 this is enabled primarily by their vast experience in applying membrane technology for concentrating or fractionating different liquid streams but also due to the great potential of recovering water from different process streams such as milk or cheese whey 6 7 this trend is also stimulated by the large volumes of water required for cleaning 8 raw whey was traditionally considered a big biological pollutant however using various membrane technologies in series such as ultrafiltration uf followed by ro and possibly a ro polisher it can now be valorized by harvesting high nutritional products whey and lactose powder and ultimately the liquid can be recovered as water which can qualify for reuse in production steps such as heat exchangers and clean in place cip operations 9 ro units primarily use reverse osmosis membrane elements with a spiral wound configuration the main reason for this is their compact format advantageous price high membrane surface area in relation to their volume and fitness for multiple applications 10 unfortunately when processing a product with increased organic loads such as permeates from whey separation organic fouling and more notable biofouling are major risks that need to be minimized next to the potential safety risks the biofilm formation can have a serious negative impact on the performance of the filtration system by lowering the trans membrane flux 11 and cause decreased salt rejection 12 most published works conclude that biofouling appears to be an inevitable phenomenon which dictates the need to develop strategies to keep it under control these may include development of novel more easily cleanable membrane configurations and materials or control of fouling of existing technologies by optimizing the cleaning formulation and operational conditions in relation to the characteristics of the feed product however the operation and maintenance costs combined with the risk of destroying the membranes structural integrity will increase if too frequent or too harsh cleaning is applied an additional sanitation in place sip step right after cip using e g peroxides or chlorine containing formulations could shorten the lifetime of membrane elements considerably and is thus limited to special occasions like any technological solution in the food industry a positive cost benefit assessment will make the difference and running costs of the equipment is an important aspect in this in spite of cleaning and technological improvements of membrane properties aimed to mitigate the issue biofouling is still reported on whey concentration ro membranes by e g hassan et al 2009 13 adnan et al 14 and tang et al 15 their findings showed that cip was not entirely efficient in removing the resident microflora and could in the worst case result in cross contaminating of the concentrated product similarly when a new water recovery mode is added to the functionality of existing ro systems processing whey uf permeate it becomes important to understand the biofouling trends and even more the impact on the ro permeates quality the published work of meneses and flores 16 supports the feasibility and safety aspects of using the recovered process water for cleaning purposes depending on the specific industry and application the process water treatment operations may have multiple ro units in series and this is generally followed by uv treatment to further safeguard the microbiological quality here we focus on the extent of biofouling on industrial scale ro membrane elements used in recovering process water from whey uf permeate operational conditions in industrial set ups are in general complex due to factors which may be hard to be controlled such as variable quality of whey uf permeate batch to batch and dairy to dairy variations unforeseen break downs leakages or simply due to parameters that are occasionally tuned based on production demands and even on a short term i e weeks the semi continuous production chain in ro production cip production cip has many unpredictable dynamic patterns where the previous run s can leave an imprint on the elements influencing the present performance 17 all these render any industrial ro membrane to be exposed to a large set of varying conditions during their life time which are impossible to simulate realistically in laboratory studies it is therefore important to derive operational practices based on observations attained from industrial scale ro membranes and evaluate the efficiency of industrial cleaning in removing any type of fouling to do so membrane autopsy is the best tool to gain accurate insights concerning fouling composition patterns and their residing communities in this study the condition of used industrial scale reverse osmosis membranes on both retentate and permeate surfaces will be characterized from a biofouling perspective in order to provide new knowledge which may help to improve practices for reusing process water 2 methods and materials 2 1 collection of ro membrane a total of six ro elements have been subjected to membrane autopsy and examined for their fouling tendencies elements are denoted alphabetically in table 1 where their membrane specific characteristics can be found as well with one exception namely ro e all elements originate from the same processing plant which uses cheese whey uf permeate trucked in from different dairies as a feed product for a two stage reverse osmosis system ro plus ro polisher operated in a recovery mode for process water see fig 1 a the elements investigated were collected in particular from the first stage ro of the reverse osmosis process the collection has been conducted in two steps namely phase i ro a and ro b and six months later phase ii ro bb ro c ro d and ro e phase i was initiated as an exploratory stage meant to assess the extent of fouling at this particular ro unit in this phase the first interest was to determine the level of actual surface fouling at the end of a production cycle that a cip protocol would have to remove or reduce for that purpose element ro a was collected prior to cleaning after flushing with water also in phase i element ro b was collected at a different location loop after subjecting the entire unit to the current cip protocol which at that time used an alkaline acid cleaning formulation this formulation had been in place for more than one year in phase ii all elements have been collected after having completed their cip cycle it should be noted that due to a management decision shortly after phase i the routine cip protocol for the ro units has been changed to a new alkaline acid cleaning formulation in phase ii it was also possible to inspect the surface of element ro e from a different production plant it was in particular interesting to examine ro e due to the heat sanitation step included in the routine cip sip regime such a sip step in particular via hydrogen peroxide or by short heat treatments is a known efficient way to counteract biofouling trends to further explore this option element ro c was taken from production and moved to a pilot unit to undergo a heat sanitation step given their industrial history of use distinct locations within the unit and the before mentioned complex process dynamics of membrane operations each inspected ro element should be considered as a snap shot of its independent scenario direct quantitative comparisons can thus not be made this is only possible to a minor extent for ro b ro bb ro c and ro d due to their origin being the same pressure vessel all ro elements were transported in polyethylene bags from the production site to the university on the day of their removal and stored at 5 c for up to 5 days until autopsy and analysis 2 2 membrane configuration and autopsy procedure the ro membrane itself is structured in a three layer configuration namely a thin polyamide layer 200 nm deposited on top of a polyethersulfone porous layer about 50 Î¼m placed on top of a non woven fabric support sheet see fig 2 b the polyamide top layer is responsible for the permeability of water and rejection of dissolved impurities whereas the other layers give the membrane mechanical strength therefore the concentration of the feed product takes place at the side of the polyamide layer which will be further named as retentate surface side while the bottom support layer represents the permeate surface side when constructing them in the spiral wound elements fig 2a several membrane sheets are laid out alternating their display namely one facing inward while the next membrane faces outward following this arrangement in the whole stack the retentate sides of consecutive membranes end up facing each other and similar sorting happens for the permeate sides the edges of consecutive membranes are glued by sealing their permeate sides together with a fine permeate spacer in between leaving only one side to serve as an exit for the permeate stream the outer sides of the glued membrane envelopes the retentate sides are also separated this time by coarser feed spacers in order to ensure flow of the feed product finally a central tube is attached to the exit side of each of the resulting envelopes and rolled around the tube creating the spiral shape see fig 2a which is further enclosed in a polypropylene hard outer shell for the elements investigated the autopsy was initiated by cutting the polypropylene hard outer shell and exposing the membranes by unrolling all leaves from their connection to the central permeate tube for each ro element two non consecutive envelopes with sufficient distance between each other were investigated next a series of large coupons of 10 10 cm size were cut aseptically along each leaf surface as illustrated in fig 1b and inspected for biofilm presence by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm all coupons were stored at 5 c until the following day when visualized with clsm note that phase i was conducted as an exploratory phase to capture any potential biofilm structure present across the ro membranes thus an extensive sampling pattern was employed in order to capture enough biofilm structure variation and identifying a potential location effect over one membrane surfaces due to different flow profiles 18 phase ii was used as a verification experiment to collect more snap shots as described before of normal production and as demonstration for a relatively fast collection of information on cip and or sip efficiency and residual surface fouling 2 3 isolation sample collection for isolation purposes was done via a scrapping or swabbing procedure a 10 Î¼l plastic sterile loop sigmaaldrich was used to scrape and collect samples from both the retentate and permeate side whenever thicker deposits could be seen on the membrane surface these samples were streaked onto both standard mypg selective agar prepared with 0 01 chloramphenicol and 0 005 chlortetracycline antibiotics for yeast isolation and plate count agar pca plates for heterotrophic bacteria isolation whenever scrapping was not possible due to a lack of a visible residual fouling samples were collected instead via the swab procedure using sterile 10 10 cm compress tissues the swab samples were placed on agar plates at room temperature and then removed after one day all plates scraping and swabbing followed incubation at 25 c until growth and dominant colonies correspondent for both sides retentate and permeate were isolated and sequenced in a separate investigation data not shown 2 4 microbiological analysis on membrane surface standard aerobic plate counting was performed on standard pca substrate by the drop plating technique as described by herigstad et al 19 the microbial population levels were estimated based on 10 10 cm areas using four sampling spots on the retentate side fig 1b note that microbial levels were determined also on the permeate side however using one single spot per inspected leaf and conducted only for membrane samples originating from phase ii fig 1b sample collection was done via a swabbing procedure briefly sterile 10 10 cm compress tissues were first pre hydrated in autoclaved 0 9 saline peptone water spo in a sterile closed container the moisturized tissues were used to swab the assigned area and placed in sterile stomacher bags 50 ml of autoclaved 0 9 spo was added to each bag under sterile conditions followed by homogenization in a stomacher 400 circulator seward limited uk for 1 min the homogenized solution from each bag served as zero dilution for their corresponding sampling next series of tenfold dilution were performed at four levels in 9 ml of 0 9 spo for each sample and plated onto pca agar plates by dispersing five evenly spaced 5 Î¼l drops after the drops on the agar dried 10 20 min the pca plates were inverted and incubated at 25 c for 17 20 h the total colony forming units cfu over all drops at the countable dilution level 30 300 colonies were determined scaled back and expressed as log10 cfu cm 2 2 5 microbiological analysis on ro permeate streams ro permeate samples were collected after 10 h of production hence following the last cip cycle from positions p1 p6 as indicated in fig 1 and transported in the same day to the university s lab during transportation the temperature in containers fluctuated between 7 and 10 c at arrival all samples were stored overnight at 4 c followed by microbial analysis next morning standard aerobic plate counting was conducted in pca agar via the spread plating technique in addition aerobic plate counting was conducted in parallel also on mypg prepared with antibiotics as described before in order to support growth for only yeast species and thus estimate yeast population levels tenfold serial dilutions done in duplicate at three levels were performed for each of the initial samples zero dilutions and spread further onto pca and mypg antibiotics plates during spread plating a volume of 100 Î¼l was taken from each dilution and spread individually over one agar plate following this method a limit of detection lod of 10 cfu ml 1 could be achieved since low cell counts were expected in samples taken from p3 p4 p5 and p6 the spread plating technique has been supplemented with the triple plate method for only the initial sample zero dilution in order to achieve an lod of 1 cfu ml 1 triple plating here means that 1 ml was taken directly from the intended sample and equally distributed in three agar plates approx 0 33 ml per plate at the end of plate incubation the colonies grown on all the three plates were added incubation was done at 25 c for all plates followed for 10 days to ensure that slow growing or injured species e g after uv treatment will get sufficient time to develop due to low cell counts results are shown as cfu ml 1 as opposed to microbiological analysis on membrane surface where counts are expressed in log10 cfu cm 2 2 6 confocal laser scanning microscopy coupons dedicated for confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm were analyzed within two days of their removal from membrane elements using a clsm instrument zeiss lsm 800 carl zeiss inc equipped with an inverted microscope and multiple laser lines note that in the exploratory phase i a total number of 16 coupons for each sampled leaf were inspected whereas in phase ii given the aim of a quick spot check only 2 coupons per leaf were visualized fig 1b each coupon was divided into two sub samples and dedicated to visualize their surface one for the retentate side and the other for the permeate side observations of spatial distribution of microorganisms and extracellular polymeric substances eps potentially present on the membrane samples were achieved by combining three fluorescent dyes selected based on literature 20 21 all fluorochromes were purchased from invitrogen molecular probes eugene or usa briefly nucleic acids were stained with syto 9 live dead biofilm viability kit l10316 the entire biofilm matrix was stained with sypro ruby sypro ruby biofilm matrix stain f10318 labeling all types of proteins whereas concanavalin a cona c860 was chosen to target specifically the glycoproteins within the entire biofilm matrix thus the bacterial eps glycoconjugates the three stains syto 9 sypro ruby and cona were excited at 483 nm 283 nm and 558 nm respectively their detection wavelengths were optimized for minimum cross talk based on pre experiments and from there on applied to all samples this resulted in emission from syto 9 nucleic acids bacterial cells being recorded in the range of 480 520 nm emission from sypro ruby biofilm matrix acquired between 599 and 700 nm and emission from cona eps glycoconjugates was detected at 535 592 nm during one recording an image for each channel was generated with a frame size of 512 512 pixels and a field of view of 101 41 101 41 Î¼m acquired via an oil objective 63 x n a 1 2 a representative example is shown in fig 3 in all other figures in this paper the channel merged image is used the staining procedure involved the preparation of a working solution which contained equal volumes of each stain prepared according to the supplier s instructions a similar method of staining simultaneously with three fluorochromes has been employed by bar zeev et al 2014 20 a 200 Î¼l volume of the final mixture was added on top of the coupon piece on the surface side intended to be imaged the prepared sample was incubated in darkness at room temperature for 30 min followed by rinsing with 15 ml of sterile water in order to remove unbound stain and all loosely adherent cells or thicker deposits of organic matter generally a gentle rinse with a few ml of water is recommended in our study a more intensive washing was chosen to ensure that any remaining microorganisms were attached to the sample surface coupons were then fixed onto a glass slide using a cover glass and transparent nail polish an example of a z stack of the coupons can be seen in fig 2c for a layer of budding yeast cells of approximately 5 Î¼m thickness deposited on the ro b retentate surface in this case z1 represents the top image while z5 captures the bottom layer when reaching the membrane surface similarly fig 2d shows a z stack for a filamentous yeast layer deposited on the ro b permeate surface due to its thickness a fairly larger number of optical sections were needed here in order to capture the entire bulk structure where z7 is the top first image inside the layer and z51 is the optical section in the overall z stack where the membrane surface is reached we can assume that the corresponding yeast layer here reaches about a 47 Î¼m thickness for simplicity all clsm images presented in this paper are the most representative optical section within a particular z stack which could e g be z2 and z18 for measurement series displayed in figs 2c and d respectively 3 results and discussions several ro elements utilized for processing whey uf permeate were screened for their fouling status and the microbial community characterized from a quantitative and morphological perspective based on total viable counts of aerobic microbial cells and microscopic analysis 3 1 visual characteristics of ro elements collected prior to cleaning after flushing element ro a displayed as expected wet yellow colored deposits covering the entire retentate side of each membrane leaf both yeast and bacteria could be observed by microscopy in the correspondent foulant nothing could be seen on the permeate side of ro a the retentate side of all other elements appeared cleaned upon visual inspection the overall appearance of a clean surface suggests the efficiency of the different cip protocols in removing most organic fouling from the retentate side of the membranes on inspection of the permeate surfaces of membranes from ro b ro bb roc and ro d all showed isolated white colored deposits which contained mainly filamentous yeast this foulant was in homogeneously distributed across membrane s surface 3 2 microbiological analysis on membrane surface fig 4 summarizes the counts on the retentate surface of each inspected membrane microbial levels did not vary significantly between the two leaves from the same element as stated before all cleaned ro elements showed evidence of having undergone the cip protocol regardless of their cleaning formulation as most of the organic matter was removed however certain levels of a microbial population still remained on the membrane retentate surface an average microbial count of 4 19 log10 cfu cm 2 was found on ro b ciped retentate side whereas both ro d and ro bb both ciped had a higher microflora level between 5 56 and 5 69 log10 cfu cm 2 which was unexpectedly comparable with an average of 5 94 log10 cfu cm 2 detected on ro a that had only a water flush fig 4 similar levels have been reported before by other researchers on industrial ro membranes where the feed product consisted of whey 22 considering that the inspected ro elements all had been processing whey uf permeate a general lower count would have been expected since the upstream ultrafiltration unit should retain most of the microbial load 3 3 confocal laser scanning microscopy next to the total counts visualizing the status of residual microflora can assist in understanding the extent of surface attachment given the large number of recordings obtained in phase i it was observed that most images display structures that can be classified in four general categories representative examples of these four biofilm structures are presented in fig 5 applying this visual classification it can be determined that most structures identified on ro b show loose bacterial cells surrounded or trapped in a biofilm matrix structures b and d with significantly less recordings that display free cells structure a the microbial community of non ciped element ro a retentate side consisted mainly of streptococci and rod shaped bacteria plus budding and filamentous yeast as isolated from pca and mypg antibiotics selective plates upon inspection of the retentate side of ro a coupons under the confocal microscope it was found that the different isolates were in most cases present as free cells structure a or packed in a dense protein like matrix structure d see fig 6 for a quantitative evaluation based on visual scoring of the clsm recordings it should be noted here that the areas involved approximately 1m2 per leaf see fig 1b in combination with microscopy make quantification challenging moreover in the clsm we actively searched for a contamination spot in each measurement sample coupon hence the results presented should be interpreted as semi quantitative several permeate side ro a coupons selected randomly were investigated by confocal microscopy none of them had evidence of contamination on the permeate surface as a result clsm analysis continued by only evaluating the retentate surface of ro a coupons the structures on ro b ciped retentate consisted mostly of loose yeast cell aggregates structure b see fig 6 mainly budding and filamentous yeast with the same morphology as found on ro a could be isolated from ro b retentate some evidence of remaining bacterial rods was found in the clsm images captured albeit only on one coupon a common characteristic for ro b and all other cleaned ro elements is that the residual microflora present on the retentate surface exhibits cellular membranes stained primarily by cona it is known that microorganisms tend to encapsulating themselves in a self produced extracellular polymeric matrix eps in order to survive stressful conditions such as shear stress competition low nutrients availability etc 23 such structures were not identified in most of the images recorded on the retentate ro a coupons which could suggest that the production of extracellular polysaccharides eps may have been stimulated by the hostile conditions induced by cleaning see figs 7 and 8 an alternative interpretation is that the applied cleaning treatments specifically the alkaline step in the cip recipe may expose the deeper attached layers that contain more eps to fully elucidate the biofouling status of these yeasts is not possible in a closed industrial system the permeate surface of all ro b coupons was found widely covered by multiple layers of exclusively filamentous yeast that displayed the same type of structures fig 7 the individual yeast cells were extremely long with branching hyphae that spread and covered a large area their structures were primarily stained by sypro ruby and cona it was observed in the mypg antibiotics selective agar that the filamentous isolates grew slowly taking between three and four days the combination of slow growth and the relative low number of cells compared with bacterial cells in many cases may have prevented the detection of these yeast previously the present direct microscopically approach indicates that they may have an important role in the biofouling due to the large coverage by each cell when ro bb ro c and ro d originating from same pressure vessel as ro b were sampled several months later during phase ii the same type of previously isolated budding and filamentous yeast were colonizing this time they were seen on both retentate and permeate side of all three elements and rod shaped bacteria could be more easily spotted on each element s retentate surface see fig 8 an additional experimental sanitation step at 78 c for 20 min was applied on ro c in a pilot facility the low viable counts on the ro c retentate side indicated the efficiency of this sanitation step based on n 8 observations for each surface side retentate and permeate for each ro element sampled in phase ii the clsm images suggest that the microbial levels in ro c were comparable with levels found in ro bb and ro d considering that ro d and ro bb had a distinct operating time namely 6 months and 3 4 years respectively one could expect to see differences in their biofouling structure overall similar types of aggregates could however be observed across the retentate surface fig 8 compared to ro b the eps surrounded cells were arranged in more dense clusters also on the permeate surface of all phase ii ro elements filamentous cells were intertwined with budding yeast cells and in some cases without full coverage in an eps matrix as compared to ro b figs 7 and 8 this could indicate the presence of a younger microflora the effective age of use did not seem to have an influence on present microbiota when judging solely on the results from the retentate side and the two operation times investigated on the other hand the clsm images and the total counts detected on the permeate membrane surface suggest that ro d had less microbial contamination here than the older ro bb element although the character of the observations one swab sample and two membrane coupons for each leaf visualized by confocal microscopy makes the comparisons semi quantitative clsm images of the permeate side of the heat sanitized ro c show a fairly contaminated surface but with no viable counts detected upon plating this confirms the efficiency of the extreme heating step in inactivating any residual microorganisms on this membrane on the other hand viable counts were still detected though at considerable lower level on both the retentate and permeate side of ro e element which came from another process function but also had a 78 c sanitation step included in its cleaning protocol little was observed upon confocal microscopy inspection of the sampled membrane coupons but rods cocci pink budding yeast as well as filamentous yeast could be isolated in agar plates with samples from the ro e retentate side while rod shaped bacteria were isolated from the ro e permeate side samples results not shown the hyphal cells may be responsible for an increased strength of the biofilm and show resistance to the shearing effect of the permeate streams a dense filamentous yeast structure as found on ro b fig 7 might cause decreased permeate flux necessitating more pressure this corrective measure is common in an industrial set up and translates directly into increased costs for the production plant our findings indicate that yeast may play an important role in the biofouling process and that biofouling on the ro membranes permeate side should not be overlooked 3 4 microbiological analysis on ro permeate streams in the spiral wound configuration the permeate side is considered a closed space where only clean water is allowed to circulate a cip protocol can only restore the properties of retentate surface efficiently while cleaning agents are not meant to reach the permeate side consequently any opportunity for microorganisms to access the permeate space is undesirable if microorganisms arrive on the permeate side the non woven fabric could act as an excellent type of surface for attachment and it has been observed that the very low nutrient levels are able to create suitable conditions for specific cells to proliferate 24 consequently the development of microorganisms on membrane surface may lead to a permanent source of cross contamination for permeate streams our findings show that the feed product whey uf permeate contained viable microorganisms in the order of 100 cfu ml 1 while the ro permeate streams had levels below or at the detection limit in the final water which in this case had been exposed to two ro treatments as well as uv before and after the buffer tank no microorganisms were detected table 2 this suggests that in spite of evidence of high microbial contamination on membrane permeate surfaces the microbial safety parameters of permeate streams do not necessarily reflect any risks however worse case scenarios can potentially happen in industrial set ups which from a long term perspective requires a strategy and monitoring procedure for reclaimed water suitable to prevent failures in operating such units the foremost issue seems to be the technological implications related to biofouling and flux decline routine checks conducted over time with a strategic sampling for membrane autopsy may be an example of a small compromise that can help industries to adapt and optimize their practices especially when accurate real time monitoring techniques are difficult to implement for such closed high pressure and compact systems even better these types of checks could start with the membrane autopsy of elements that show low performance and are intended for replacement anyway valuable insights can be gained from understanding their particular cause of failure such data bases may help on the one hand to identify if any trends occur within the production plant but also to formulate new specifications for developing membranes with improved properties or configurations based on full scale practice rather than small scale experiments different feed spacers materials or flow regimes may dictate biofilm morphology and potentially influence the type of microbial community thus optimization e g by periodical low frequency heat sanitation should be seen as a continuous process since one adjustment will lead to new issues consequently tuning the process conditions based on results of the autopsy procedure can be a better approach compared to sticking to fixed recipes until significantly low performance arises sampling and achieving true quantitative comparisons for large surface areas is difficult to conduct in an industrial set up a production plant is a system far from the ideal scenario since its operational conditions feed product characteristics and cleaning efficiency are variables that change continuously thereby influencing the overall unit performance and state of the system in spite of this process water recovery is a rapidly growing area and more investigations as hereby presented in full scale production are needed to get a better understanding and a route to further optimization 4 conclusions autopsy was performed on industrial scale reverse osmosis membrane elements that have been used for water recovery from whey separation permeate and their different biofouling structures were characterized via clsm extensive biofouling was seen on membranes after simple flushing but biofouling was also present on membranes after routine cip treatment on the retentate side and more surprisingly on the permeate side a mixed microbial community was generally found on the retentate surface of all inspected membranes visually primarily composed of yeast filamentous yeast with numerous long hyphae were observed on the permeate surfaces and the layer stained primarily by cona labeling glycoconjugates microbiological analysis of the reclaimed double uv treated process water streams showed no detectable microbial activity acknowledgements this work was supported by the reuse of water
