8180,study region united kingdom uk study focus natural flood management nfm schemes are increasingly prominent in the uk studies of nfm have not yet used natural tracers at catchment scale to investigate how interventions influence partitioning during storms between surface rainfall runoff and water already stored in catchments here we investigate how catchment properties particularly plantation forestry influence surface storm rainfall runoff we used hydrograph separation based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 2h 18o and acid neutralising capacity from high flow events to compare three headwater catchments 2 4 3 1 km2 with differences in plantation forest cover picea sitchensis 94 41 1 within a major uk nfm pilot typical of the uk uplands new hydrological insights plantation forest cover reduced the total storm rainfall runoff fraction during all events by up to 11 when comparing two paired catchments with similar soils geology and topography but 50 difference in forest cover however comparison with the third catchment with negligible forest cover but different characteristics suggests that soils and geology were dominant controls on storm rainfall runoff fraction furthermore differences between events were greater than differences between catchments these findings suggest that while plantation forest cover may influence storm rainfall runoff fractions it is not a dominant control in temperate upland uk catchments especially for larger events soils and geology may exert greater influence with implications for planning nfm keywords flooding upland catchments stable isotopes runoff attenuation afforestation hydrograph separation 1 introduction there is increasing interest globally in the use of nature based solutions for flood risk management and disaster risk reduction eea 2017 world bank 2018 in the uk one manifestation of nature based solutions is a new wave of policies and projects in support of natural flood management nfm dadson et al 2017 kay et al 2019 lane 2017 these policies promote a catchment wide approach to flood risk management through interventions aimed at reducing surface runoff e g tree planting and livestock management and slowing the flow of water in rivers e g leaky wooden dams and re meandering during flood events dadson et al 2017 environment agency 2017 there are now over 94 nfm projects in the uk but monitoring and quantitative assessment of these schemes remain low and evidence of effectiveness is limited dadson et al 2017 environment agency 2020 hankin et al 2017 kay et al 2019 nfm network scotland 2020 key challenges surround how to determine the effectiveness of nfm at larger scales 50 km2 as well as understanding the behaviour of nfm schemes under different storm or antecedent conditions dadson et al 2017 addressing these challenges requires considerable understanding of hydrological processes in nfm catchments and the application of techniques such as tracers that can help assess processes at scale and using different measures of catchment response a focal area of nfm policy surrounds the potential for afforestation in catchment headwaters to reduce rapid runoff during storm events through increased interception infiltration and surface roughness ngai et al 2017 however the effects of woodland creation on reducing peak flows are not clear in uk catchments bathurst et al 2020 carrick et al 2018 stratford et al 2017 discerning the impact of afforestation on runoff depends on the ability to detect changes in flood peak magnitude or timing following interventions as well as understanding the underlying processes through which forest cover influences water movement in catchments zégre et al 2010 paired catchment studies have been widely used to detect changes but are subject to challenges such as lack of comparability between treatment and control catchments short time series and small sample sizes alila et al 2009 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 model based change detection provides an alternative approach that has also been widely used however assumptions about the stationarity of catchment processes in pre and post treatment periods have rarely been tested and uncertainties evaluated zégre et al 2010 there are also many challenges involved in parameterisation such as representing surface roughness which is affected by land use and seasonal vegetation changes bond et al 2020 while model based change detection can be applied in ways that allow for the exploration of input parameters seibert and mcdonnell 2010 neither this approach nor paired catchment studies give direct insights into hydrological processes research on how afforestation impacts on hydrological processes complements change detection studies by helping to identify dominant runoff mechanisms and the relative importance of different catchment characteristics in controlling flow paths geris et al 2015 understanding these relationships is particularly important from a management perspective as it may help to identify how and where to locate afforestation within catchments murphy et al 2020 for example the impact of afforestation or forest removal on runoff processes may be highly variable depending on soil type soil depth and bedrock permeability which affect catchment storage pfister et al 2017 as well as forest management practices such as the type of trees planting configuration and drainage archer et al 2013 lunka and patil 2016 robinson 1986 1998 it is also necessary to understand the relative importance of meteorological factors such as the magnitude and duration of rainfall events and antecedent wetness conditions on runoff mechanisms evidence in the uk suggests that nfm is unlikely to be effective during the largest events dadson et al 2017 so how can such process effects of forest cover be detected in natural systems conservative naturally occurring tracers such as 2h and 18o can be used in hydrograph separation as a method for investigating runoff mechanisms kendall and mcdonnell 1998 such tracers can help determine the degree to which event rainfall versus water already stored in the catchment pre event water contributes to storm runoff many studies have demonstrated the dominance of pre event water in runoff which has changed perceptions of runoff mechanisms klaus and mcdonnell 2013 this has shifted the emphasis of catchment process studies towards questions of how stored water can be quickly mobilised during storm events which in turn raises questions about infiltration threshold behaviour and connectivity that could be influenced by catchment management bracken et al 2013 these issues warrant consideration in a nfm context a common perception in current nfm practice as in earlier waves of upland environmental management neal et al 1997 is of event runoff originating primarily as rapid overland flow of event water from saturated variable source areas which does not place enough emphasis on the potentially important role of water already stored in the catchment surprisingly tracers have not been used more in change detection studies despite early work that showed how in land use studies changes in the source components of flow were not revealed by simple hydrograph analysis gremillion et al 2000 to our knowledge nfm projects have not yet been the subject of catchment scale tracer based studies or used tracers to evaluate assumptions about management efficacy based on source components what do we know about source components in catchments like those targeted for nfm pre event water contributions have been found to vary with catchment characteristics in general there is an increase in event water runoff on a rural to urban gradient hasenmueller et al 2017 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 early work showed that event water contributions are inversely related to catchment size brown et al 1999 and that pre event water increases with increasing antecedent wetness muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 forests influence throughfall volumes soil infiltration rates and subsurface connectivity which can result in greater subsurface flow and higher pre event water in streams buttle 1994 grasslands have been shown to have higher event water fractions bonell et al 1990 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 roa garcía and weiler 2010 these land cover effects are influenced by catchment soils and topography catchments with thin soils and steeper slopes often have higher event water fractions suecker et al 2000 here we use hydrograph separation to test the impact of catchment interventions on the source components of peak flows we follow the gremillion et al 2000 idea that tracer based hydrograph separations will reveal possible differences in flow pathways that could be useful for planning and evaluating nfm even if there are no discernible changes to the timing and magnitude of storm hydrographs our work uses additional tracers for hydrograph separation to further unpick the time and geographic based components of runoff sources and pathways while there are some challenges in using tracer based approaches klaus and mcdonnell 2013 there are a number of ways in which this approach could be valuable in planning and monitoring nfm in addition to more standard hydrological methods it can help in understanding the relative importance of shallow subsurface flow within soils which might be influenced by changes to soil management and deeper subsurface flow within bedrock which is more difficult to influence tracer based hydrograph separation has a physical basis that is lacking in most standard hydrometric separation methods klaus and mcdonnell 2013 when applied at high resolution through storm events tracers can reveal not just the proportions of different runoff components during events but the timing of different components during individual event hydrographs e g whether flood peaks are dominated by event rainfall finally tracers can help in evaluating the co benefits and risks of different types of interventions for example by helping to investigate flow paths and residence times of water around interventions such as field buffer strips novara et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2014 we report tracer based hydrograph separation 2h 18o and acid neutralising capacity anc in three neighbouring catchments within a wider 70 km2 pilot nfm project in the uk uplands two of these catchments are paired with similar soils geology and topography but 50 difference in forest cover the third catchment with the lowest forest cover has some differences in underlying characteristics but is representative of the range of conditions in the wider nfm project we test the null hypothesis that plantation forest cover has no influence on the source components of runoff we then further investigate the relative influence of catchment and storm event characteristics on fractions of event and groundwater runoff the main questions addressed in the research were 1 what is the effect of plantation forest cover on the fraction of event water runoff 2 how do other catchment features soils geology and topography impact the source components of runoff 3 how do the event magnitude and intensity impact these differences finally we discuss the implications for nfm in the uk from these process findings 2 methods 2 1 study site and design the research focussed on three small headwater catchments 2 4 3 1 km2 fig 1 table 1 in the scottish borders uk which are typical of many uk upland catchments and are monitored within the wider nfm project the catchments have a large range in forest cover 94 41 and 1 making them ideal for investigating the influence of forest cover on source components of flow comparisons between the neighbouring shiplaw and middle burn catchments enabled a paired catchment approach given their similar catchment characteristics other than percentage forest cover comparisons between these catchments and the longcote catchment allowed for insights into the relative role of other catchment characteristics on runoff components across the wider nfm catchment we used hydrograph separation based on isotopes 2h and 18o and anc to compare time and geographic source components respectively of runoff in the three catchments during four high flow events the wider eddleston water catchment a sub catchment of the river tweed is the focus of one of the uk s largest and long running nfm pilot sites which aims to inform national water policy under the eu water framework directive and eu floods directive tweed forum 2019 werritty et al 2010 forest cover was historically limited in most of the catchment during the 20th century but conifer plantations primarily sitka spruce picea sitchensis were established in the 1960s and 1970s particularly in the west the peaty soils were prepared for planting by deep ploughing to create drainage ditches however it was assumed that these had minimal impact in this study since they have not been maintained since at least the 1990s and have been actively blocked in some cases to follow more recent forest management guidelines approximately 94 of middle burn was conifer forest cover at various growth stages at the time of the study including 25 recently felled forest no new access roads were built during felling and brash mats were used to minimise compaction a series of leaky wooden dams has also been constructed in this catchment as part of the nfm project but these are only active during the largest events black et al 2021 and release water rapidly as storms subside so we assume they have negligible effect on total event water runoff fractions the adjacent shiplaw catchment has 41 conifer forest cover including 10 recent felling 28 improved and semi improved grassland much of which has under field tile drainage that is common in the uk uplands harrison 2012 and 27 fenland the steeper longcote catchment in the east has 1 conifer forest cover 11 improved grassland and 64 rough grassland 30 heathland 22 unimproved acid grassland 12 bracken and 22 fenland most of the catchment is grazed by sheep cattle grazing occurs on the lower slopes and drains exist under the improved grassland areas soils in the western catchments include extensive areas of poorly permeable gleyed soils and peats but also areas of more freely draining brown soils whilst the eastern catchment is dominated by brown soils with some peaty and gleyed soils on hilltops soil median field saturated hydraulic conductivities measured nearby 3 km in the wider catchment in a separate study archer et al 2013 were 0 50 0 94 m d 1 for improved grassland sites 1 m d 1 for 50 year old plantation forest and 2 86 4 18 m d 1 for broadleaf forests 180 years old soils and underlying geology are strongly associated the western catchments are dominated by poorly permeable glacial till aitken et al 1984 with pockets of permeable glacio lacustrine sands and gravels fig 1a the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the glacial till is 0 001 to 1 m d 1 macdonald et al 2012 the eastern catchment is mostly rock head overlying bedrock with smaller areas of glacial till mantling some of the main streams the hydraulic conductivity of the silurian greywacke bedrock was not measured but silurian greywacke aquifers elsewhere in southern scotland have low productivity ó dochartaigh et al 2015 with an estimated average transmissivity of 20 m2 d 1 graham et al 2009 elevation ranges between 250 and 600 masl across the three study catchments at eddleston village mean annual precipitation 2011 2017 is 900 mm falling mainly as rainfall monthly mean air temperatures are 3 13 c and actual daily evapotranspiration ranges from 0 2 mm in winter to 2 5 mm in summer estimated using methods of granger and gray 1989 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 hydrometric monitoring rainfall has been measured since april 2011 at four locations representative of the wider 70 km2 eddleston water catchment using stainless steel octapent storage rain gauges and tipping bucket rain gauges rim8020 recording at 15 min intervals and in increments of 0 2 mm these gauges are situated inside or within 1 km of the study catchments fig 1 air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed and direction have been measured at the same time step over the same period at a weather station campbell cr1000 automatic weather station located at the centre of the catchment fig 1 a and b stream water levels have been measured every 15 min hobo u20 0 3 5 m unvented pressure based water level recorders in each catchment since april 2011 discharge was calculated at the same time step using rating curves derived from applying the mid section method dingman 2014 to velocity area gauging at natural rated sections approximately 8 times a year under a range of conditions peskett 2020 2 2 2 event precipitation sampling event sampling was carried out over a 48 h period in the three catchments for seven events between december 2015 and february 2017 events were targeted based on weather forecasts and predicted precipitation maps from the uk met office and were only considered if total predicted event rainfall was above 15 mm with an average intensity of approximately 2 mm h 1 based on prior knowledge of the responsiveness of the catchment event rainfall was sampled within the longcote and shiplaw catchments fig 1 using sequential rainfall samplers built using a modified version of the method described in kennedy et al 1979 these were deployed a few hours prior to the start of the forecast event rainfall in open field locations the samplers collect rainfall in 6 mm increments for the first three samples 11 mm for the fourth sample and then a bulk sample for the rest of the event the volume increments were converted to time increments by pairing with the cumulative rainfall data from the closest tbr rain gauge bulk rainfall samples for the whole event were also collected from adjacent temporary storage gauges in case of failure of the sequential samplers rainfall samples were collected before any further rainfall and within 12 h of the end of each event with aliquots for isotopic analysis transferred in the field into two 15 ml hdpe bottles filled completely to remove air snow samples were also taken in the february event to test for the influence of snow on separation results see supplementary data s1 1 throughfall was not sampled but a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the effects of throughfall in hydrograph separation using data from the literature s1 1 2 2 3 event stream water sampling stream water sampling for the first event december 2015 used two automatic water samplers isco 6712 teledyne isco nebraska usa programmed for a 2 hly sampling frequency and manual sampling in the third catchment middle burn at lower frequency as an automatic sampler was not available all subsequent events used three automatic samplers sited adjacent to the gauging stations and programmed at a 2 hly sampling frequency giving a sampling window of up to 48 h since each sampler held 24 bottles all samplers were primed with clean dry bottles prior to the event timed to start a few hours before forecast rainfall and programmed to purge the inlet tubing with river water prior to collecting each sample we used a number of approaches to prevent and check for evaporation samples were pumped into bottles with narrow necks within the shaded wind free and pale grey compartment of automatic water samplers samples were collected within 12 h of the sampler programmes finishing samples were transferred directly from the automatic sampler bottles into two 15 ml hdpe bottles in the field and were filled completely to exclude air before sealing and after sample analysis we also checked that there was no systematic deviation on δ2h vs δ18o plots compared to the local meteoric water line the remaining stream water samples were transported to the laboratory in capped automatic sampler bottles where they were refrigerated at 4 c prior to anc analysis and analysed within 48 h of the event ending automatic water samplers failed during two events during the july 2016 event a blocked sampling tube in shiplaw meant that only the first sample was collected and this catchment had to be removed from the analysis of that event an electronic failure in the middle burn automatic sampler during the february 2017 event resulted in some missing data for the first part of the event manually collected samples prior to the event and before the onset of the main flow peak enabled estimation of the event fraction using interpolation and linear regression based on the neighbouring shiplaw catchment data as explained in tables s1 and s2 in total 60 event rainfall samples 4 event snow samples and 395 stream samples were collected across seven events the final event dataset for isotopic and anc analysis reported here is based on four events table 2 three of the events were excluded due to smaller than forecast rainfall or rainfall isotopic composition that was insufficiently different from streams to enable hydrograph separation 2 3 laboratory methods precipitation and stream samples were analysed for h and o isotope compositions using a los gatos research liquid water off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy off axis icos laser absorption spectrometer at the university of saskatchewan canada we used standard analytical methods iaea 2009 and report δ2h and δ18o values relative to v smow precision was 1 0 and 0 2 respectively anc was determined in stream water samples using acidimetric titration with h2so4 in accordance with rounds 2012 to endpoints of ph 4 5 4 1 4 0 and 3 5 within 48 h of returning from the field in natural waters where aluminium concentrations are low this method has been shown to give a good approximation of anc neal 2001 conductivity and ph were not a focus of this study but were determined in stream samples to help characterise water chemistry conductivity was measured using a temperature compensated conductivity meter mettler toledo sg7 and ph was measured during anc titration 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 long term hydrometric and geochemical sampling data to help characterise catchment responses to rainfall hydrometric data were initially analysed for the three catchments using the complete 15 min frequency time series october 2011 september 2017 to generate summary statistics as well as statistics based on a set of 60 events in each catchment the data analysis methods used are detailed in s1 3 these data were used to calculate spearman rank correlation coefficients to highlight any possible relationships between event runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall summary statistics were also derived from routine weekly 2 weekly geochemical sampling data for may 2015 may 2017 encompassing the duration of the storm sampling s1 4 2 4 2 isotope and anc event based hydrograph separation we used isotope and anc based hydrograph separation to calculate the fractions of pre event water and groundwater respectively in stream discharge at the 2 h stream water sampling time step for each event hydrograph separation relies on a number of assumptions and has limitations that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere klaus and mcdonnell 2013 despite these limitations isotope based hydrograph separation is considered more objective than separation methods based on hydrometric data alone and provides a useful first approximation of runoff components operating at the catchment scale klaus and mcdonnell 2013 pre event water fractions were estimated as follows 1 q t q p q e 2 c t q t c p q p c e q e 3 f p c t c e c p c e 4 f e 1 f p where qt is stream discharge qp the discharge contribution from pre event water qe the discharge contribution from event water ct cp and ce are the δ values of stream water pre event water and event water and fp and fe are the fractions of pre event and event water in the stream klaus and mcdonnell 2006 the analysis was conducted using both 18o and 2h both isotopes gave similar results indicating minimal fractionation effects so only the 2h data are presented here to define the pre event endmember for each stream we used the mean of the pre event stream water samples collected on the day prior to the event as in other studies klaus and mcdonnell 2013 for the event endmember we used both the sequential rainfall samples for each event except december 2015 when sequential samples were not available and bulk rainfall samples in order to crosscheck the results fp and fe are presented in the subsequent analysis as values at peak discharge using the sample closest to peak discharge fp qmax or fe qmax and as a total for the storm based on a sampling window defined by the first sample on the rising limb of the hydrograph and the earliest final sample across the three catchments fp qtot or fe qtot time to peak ttp from the start of the rising limb to the peak discharge and the runoff ratio based on the event water fraction rr were also calculated with subscripts p and e denoting pre event and event water respectively we also carried out sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of throughfall and of snow on hydrograph separation s1 1 we used a similar two component mixing model to estimate the groundwater fraction in runoff during each event subject to the same assumptions as the isotope based model 5 f g w a r a s a r a g w q g w q t where fgw is groundwater fraction qt is stream discharge qgw is discharge contribution from groundwater as is anc of stream water ar is anc of surface runoff endmember and agw is anc of groundwater endmember the groundwater endmember was defined as the mean anc of the five lowest flows in each sub catchment for the period september 2015 august 2016 based on weekly sampling as discussed in s1 4 similar to other studies neal et al 1997 soulsby et al 2003 the surface runoff endmember was defined as zero as this approximates the anc of rainfall the stream water endmember was taken as the anc at the time of sampling as for isotope based hydrograph separation fgw is presented in the subsequent analysis as values at peak discharge or total discharge fgw qmax fgw qtot and ttp gw and rr gw are reported for time to peak and runoff ratios based on groundwater components uncertainties in the pre event water and groundwater fractions were estimated using the gaussian error propagation approach of genereaux et al 1998 based on 70 confidence intervals which were considered appropriate for analysis of this size of dataset and the uncertainties involved in hydrograph separation bazemore et al 1994 details of the input parameters for the uncertainty analysis are outlined in s1 5 finally three component hydrograph separation was conducted using a two step approach klaus and mcdonnell 2013 to approximate soil water based on the difference between the pre event water and groundwater fractions these data were used to compare catchment responses during the different events spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to highlight any possible relationships between tracer based event water fractions runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall 3 results 3 1 catchment characteristic controls on runoff components 3 1 1 long term hydrometric and geochemical sampling data analysis of the complete stream discharge time series indicated that the two western catchments middle burn and shiplaw were more responsive to rainfall events than the eastern catchment longcote table 3 the highly forested middle burn catchment was less responsive than the adjacent shiplaw with lower forest cover but much more responsive than longcote with the lowest forest cover large differences were also observed in catchment long term may 2015 may 2017 stream water geochemistry fig 2 fig s1 middle burn was most acidic and had the lowest anc and conductivity compared to the other catchments which may be due to the acidifying effects of the forest shiplaw had intermediate values and longcote had the highest values shiplaw had a wider range of anc and conductivity compared to the other catchments which may reflect its greater responsiveness the median values and range in isotopic composition were similar for middle burn and shiplaw but notably different for longcote reflecting both the proximity of the western catchments and potentially the higher groundwater fraction in longcote 3 1 2 event based hydrograph separation overall despite the responsiveness of the catchments event water runoff was generally limited the total event runoff fraction fe qtot was 0 36 for all catchments and events table 4 the peak runoff fraction fe qmax was higher 0 54 in all catchments and events but with the same relative values as those based on fe qtot groundwater runoff was generally low across the catchments total groundwater runoff fraction fgw qtot was 0 35 for all winter events though much more variable during the summer event in the two catchments sampled 0 25 0 65 fgw qmax showed a similar pattern between catchments and events but estimates were up to 10 lower than fractions based on totals table 4 these low groundwater estimates combined with low event water estimates result in large soil water fraction estimates in the three component hydrograph separations in terms of the differences between catchments the hydrograph separation results show a similar pattern to the results based on long term data with no systematic relationship between forest cover and the fraction of event water runoff runoff ratios based on event water estimates from isotope based hydrograph separation indicate that shiplaw had the highest event water runoff ratios longcote the lowest and middle burn intermediate values despite having the highest forest cover uncertainties in these estimates are large but apparent differences were observed between shiplaw and middle burn for the largest event november 2016 and february 2017 table 4 there is good consistency between the relative order of these runoff ratios for each catchment and runoff ratios calculated using the hydrometric data for events over the longer time period cf tables 2 and 4 groundwater runoff fractions across the catchments followed a different pattern they were lowest in middle burn 0 13 of total runoff during the largest event intermediate in shiplaw and highest in longcote although groundwater still contributed 0 27 of total runoff during the largest event the differences were systematic between catchments and events table 4 despite similar fractions of event water runoff during the intense summer event july 2016 the groundwater contribution was much higher at longcote 0 65 of total runoff than middle burn 0 25 of total runoff 3 1 3 intra event dynamics the intra event isotope anc dynamics fig s2 s5 as well as the associated runoff components within events give additional insights into runoff processes these are best illustrated during the event with the largest discharge peak fig 3 longcote had a double peak hydrograph also observed in the hydrometric data for some other events that were not sampled with an initial rapid discharge of soil water groundwater followed by a slower increase in event water during the second peak that was quickly overwhelmed by soil water groundwater on the falling limb it was the only catchment with an increase in soil water groundwater fraction following the hydrograph peak shiplaw had some similarities to longcote in that the initially high soil water groundwater inputs were rapidly overwhelmed by event water runoff that dominated the peak of the hydrograph but decreased rapidly on the falling limb in middle burn the response was generally more damped with more coincident peaks in event water soil water and groundwater and a greater fraction of event water on the falling limb 3 2 influence of event characteristics on runoff components event water and groundwater fractions appear to vary approximately linearly with maximum discharge in the autumn winter events in all catchments fig 4 the exception was longcote which had a less linear response particularly in the fe qmax values perhaps due to the higher measured rainfall on the eastern side of the catchment for the largest event or to threshold behaviour the switch in direction of anc hysteresis in longcote between the two smallest and largest events may also be indicative of such behaviour fig 5 the differences in estimated event water fraction were higher between events than between catchments suggesting that event characteristics are an important control on runoff partitioning spearman rank correlation coefficients between event water fractions and tracer derived runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall showed some possible associations p 0 07 for correlation of runoff ratio with total event rainfall though it was not possible to determine the main drivers due to the limited number of events sampled correlation analysis based on hydrometric data alone for the events during the longer time period suggested that the only significant correlation p 0 01 was between total runoff and event total rainfall depth 4 discussion the results give insights into the role of rapid surface rainfall runoff versus stored water during storm events in this nfm pilot catchment as we outline below stored water dominates the hydrograph under most conditions and appears to be mediated to some extent by forest cover across the wider nfm catchment as a whole other factors such as soils and geology are a more dominant control however these catchment characteristics appear to be dominated by the event magnitude as we discuss these findings have implications for locating nfm interventions involving land use change and the level of benefits we might expect from these flood risk management approaches they also demonstrate how tracers can complement more traditional hydrometric techniques in the evaluation of nfm 4 1 pre event and subsurface sources of runoff during events pre event water was an important fraction of stream discharge in all sampled events and sub catchments constituting the dominant fraction of total runoff 0 64 this finding is consistent with many other isotope based hydrograph separation studies that have demonstrated the importance of pre event water e g bonell et al 1990 mcdonnell 1990 pearce et al 1986 sklash and farvolden 1979 findings were similar using either 2h or 18o with differences in the event fractions of 7 which were lower than the error propagation estimates nevertheless there was high variability in pre event water fraction between different events suggesting that humid forested catchments may have more variable pre event fractions than many early studies suggested fischer et al 2017 there was also relatively low spatial variability in bulk precipitation isotopic composition for different events across different parts of the catchment in contrast to some studies fischer et al 2017 mcguire et al 2005 suggesting that in this environment isotopic tracers can provide a useful tool for understanding event runoff further research is warranted on the effects of throughfall on isotopic composition assuming the bulk throughfall δ18o and δ2h value differences to storm rainfall reported in kubota and tsuboyama 2003 we estimated that fe qmax ranged from 12 lower to 17 higher than estimates based on the sampled rainfall across the different events in middle burn however this did not alter the relative order of catchments in terms of their event water runoff fractions groundwater was a small fraction of stream discharge during the winter events although variable between catchments and important in longcote where it still constituted 21 of stream discharge during the largest event the small groundwater fraction implies that soil water is an important water source in these temperate upland catchments this is consistent with studies in similar catchments with poorly permeable bedrock or superficial deposits where surface runoff and shallow subsurface runoff in soils tend to dominate tetzlaff et al 2007b groundwater appears to be more important in summer events but testing this hypothesis would require sampling larger and more summer events 4 2 forest cover and management controls on event runoff fractions comparisons between shiplaw and middle burn suggest that forest cover has some influence on event water fraction in these paired catchments the total event water fraction in the forested middle burn catchment was consistently lower across the sampled events and in the largest event it was 11 lower and 17 lower at peak discharge we are not aware of data on event water fractions from similar environments with nfm schemes in the uk but reductions due to forest cover are consistent with other studies generally buttle 1994 although not as high as reductions seen in other areas for instance muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 reported 24 difference in event water contributions between forest and pasture in a tropical environment due mainly to much higher contrasts in infiltration rates between the two land uses and to a lesser extent to canopy interception considering this evidence and the infiltration data we have from the wider eddleston catchment and similar environments in the uk 3 4 0 026 m d 1 a b horizon for grassland versus 8 3 m d 1 for forest marshall et al 2009 we suggest that the reductions in event water in middle burn compared to shiplaw are linked to relative differences in exceedance of rainfall infiltration capacity between forest and grassland areas and resulting reductions in overland flow in the forested areas interception by the forest is also likely to have led to reductions in the event water fraction as reported in other studies roa garcía and weiler 2010 forest management methods particularly drainage in site preparation and compaction during harvesting and under field drainage in improved grassland may introduce uncertainties the effects of drainage systems in similar temperate environments are poorly studied particularly at catchment scale and are highly variable depending on factors such as drain spacing soil type and antecedent conditions dadson et al 2017 open forest drainage ditches and compaction are likely to have increased the fraction of event water runoff compared to undrained forest although as already noted the effects of drainage ditches and compaction are expected to be minimal in the study catchments under field drainage is also likely to have increased event water runoff fraction under the wet antecedent conditions of most of the storms we investigated but less so than increases due to drainage in the forest the net effect of drainage in both the middle burn and shiplaw catchments is a likely decrease in the difference in event water fractions between them though it is unlikely to have changed the results we have reported these relative effects of drainage would benefit from further study in this catchment and elsewhere in the uk given that around 61 of agricultural land in the uk is drained wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 4 3 soil geological and meteorological controls on runoff fractions comparisons between the western shiplaw middle burn catchments and the eastern catchment longcote illustrate the wide variation in response across the wider nfm catchment event water fractions were up to 48 lower in longcote compared to shiplaw whilst up to 33 lower in middle burn longcote responded rapidly to rainfall though with lower peak discharge slow recession rates and double peak hydrographs as well as high groundwater and soil water fractions these findings suggest a dominance of subsurface flow despite the steeper catchment topography and low forest cover given the poorly permeable bedrock in longcote subsurface flow is most likely to occur in the soils superficial deposits and weathered bedrock this is in contrast to some hydrograph separation studies in steep catchments that have reported positive correlations between slope and event water fraction suecker et al 2000 there is some uncertainty in whether the lower event water fractions in the longcote catchment are related to lower levels of disturbance and particularly the acid grassland heathland and bracken land cover with an expected higher roughness and infiltration or to the underlying soils and geology research on catchment disturbance has frequently found evidence of increased runoff and event water fraction in more disturbed catchments e g monteith et al 2006 nainar et al 2018 however the higher groundwater fraction and the nature of the stream response suggest that more permeable soils and superficial deposits are particularly important in controlling event water fractions this corresponds with research in other scottish upland catchments which has demonstrated the importance of freely draining soils and glacial drift deposits in controlling catchment flow paths leading to much longer transit times even on steeper slopes e g soulsby et al 2006 regardless of these uncertainties a conclusion emerging from our results that is relevant to planning nfm interventions more widely is the likely limited effect on flood risk of hillslope afforestation in areas already dominated by deeper subsurface flow the small number of storms sampled make it difficult to test how different meteorological characteristics in terms of total rainfall depth intensity and api control event runoff fractions however given that there were greater differences in event runoff between events than between catchments these characteristics may be more important controls on the fraction of event water in the hydrograph than catchment characteristics fischer et al 2017 reported a similar hierarchy of influences controlling pre event water fraction across multiple storms in pre alpine catchments antecedent conditions may be particularly important as suggested by the large contrast between summer and winter events and in longcote the switch in hysteresis direction which has been linked to the changing inputs of hillslope soil water in streams under different wetness states zuecco et al 2016 4 4 implications for natural flood management policy our study demonstrates the importance of the displacement of pre event water in runoff mechanisms in landscapes subject to nfm interventions implying that saturated overland flow may not be a dominant runoff mechanism even in relatively responsive catchments the results also suggest that upland afforestation can influence the partitioning of runoff at the catchment scale so could be used to manipulate flow paths in nfm however the effects might be minimal for the largest events compared to improved grassland areas which nfm measures frequently target due to the limited effects of forests on infiltration and transient storage soulsby et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2007a and relatively high infiltration rates in improved grasslands in many uk upland environments these findings support suggestions in the nfm literature that climatic conditions and individual storm event characteristics dominate over catchment characteristics in influencing peak flows in the largest events dadson et al 2017 in other regions for example where grasslands are severely degraded forest planting may have a greater effect on reducing event water runoff fractions van meerveld et al 2019 zwartendijk et al 2017 the implication of these results is that in areas of more permeable geology and soils similar to the longcote catchment hillslope afforestation may have limited benefit as a nfm strategy we do not consider the effects of riparian or floodplain planting although woodland may of course bring other benefits therefore hillslope planting for nfm should target other areas in particular areas with compacted soils overlying relatively permeable soils or geology where forest planting may help to connect runoff to streams via the groundwater zone in this case the location of forest cover and the type of trees become important as discussed by neal et al 1997 who suggested long term experiments with more deeply rooting trees to take account of these mechanisms in nfm implementation might require greater consideration of subsurface features flood vulnerability maps used to determine the location of woodland related nfm interventions in the uk consider some proxies for soil and related geological substrate permeability at a coarse resolution environment agency 2018 but should include further consideration of the interaction with factors such as the degree of compaction and depth to groundwater targeted tracer studies could improve such process understanding helping better constrain models to detect change as well as quantify co benefits of nfm interventions involving woodland such as increased biodiversity carbon storage and water quality iacob et al 2014 keesstra et al 2018 of course there are practical challenges given high costs associated with tracer studies but the increasing availability of in situ high frequency sensors for tracers such as conductivity temperature and potentially isotopic tracers berman et al 2009 mean that such approaches could be incorporated into nfm planning and monitoring 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study using natural tracers at the catchment scale to investigate runoff mechanisms in uk based nfm projects it gives insights into the diversity of runoff mechanisms operating during storm events across different upland catchments the results suggest that pre event water is an important fraction of stream discharge during events for the size of catchments 10 km2 and events 20 of the mean annual flood for which there is currently some evidence that forest cover could have an impact on discharge dadson et al 2017 the study also suggests that plantation forest cover reduces the fraction of event water runoff in streams over this range of event magnitudes however the effects of these differences in land cover may be dominated by differences in event characteristics suggesting limited impacts of land cover for the largest events since many nfm measures are designed to target event water this implies a need for careful consideration of the types and locations of nfm interventions to ensure they are effective finally the study demonstrates the potential utility of using tracers in nfm for understanding runoff processes and monitoring co

8180,study region united kingdom uk study focus natural flood management nfm schemes are increasingly prominent in the uk studies of nfm have not yet used natural tracers at catchment scale to investigate how interventions influence partitioning during storms between surface rainfall runoff and water already stored in catchments here we investigate how catchment properties particularly plantation forestry influence surface storm rainfall runoff we used hydrograph separation based on hydrogen and oxygen isotopes 2h 18o and acid neutralising capacity from high flow events to compare three headwater catchments 2 4 3 1 km2 with differences in plantation forest cover picea sitchensis 94 41 1 within a major uk nfm pilot typical of the uk uplands new hydrological insights plantation forest cover reduced the total storm rainfall runoff fraction during all events by up to 11 when comparing two paired catchments with similar soils geology and topography but 50 difference in forest cover however comparison with the third catchment with negligible forest cover but different characteristics suggests that soils and geology were dominant controls on storm rainfall runoff fraction furthermore differences between events were greater than differences between catchments these findings suggest that while plantation forest cover may influence storm rainfall runoff fractions it is not a dominant control in temperate upland uk catchments especially for larger events soils and geology may exert greater influence with implications for planning nfm keywords flooding upland catchments stable isotopes runoff attenuation afforestation hydrograph separation 1 introduction there is increasing interest globally in the use of nature based solutions for flood risk management and disaster risk reduction eea 2017 world bank 2018 in the uk one manifestation of nature based solutions is a new wave of policies and projects in support of natural flood management nfm dadson et al 2017 kay et al 2019 lane 2017 these policies promote a catchment wide approach to flood risk management through interventions aimed at reducing surface runoff e g tree planting and livestock management and slowing the flow of water in rivers e g leaky wooden dams and re meandering during flood events dadson et al 2017 environment agency 2017 there are now over 94 nfm projects in the uk but monitoring and quantitative assessment of these schemes remain low and evidence of effectiveness is limited dadson et al 2017 environment agency 2020 hankin et al 2017 kay et al 2019 nfm network scotland 2020 key challenges surround how to determine the effectiveness of nfm at larger scales 50 km2 as well as understanding the behaviour of nfm schemes under different storm or antecedent conditions dadson et al 2017 addressing these challenges requires considerable understanding of hydrological processes in nfm catchments and the application of techniques such as tracers that can help assess processes at scale and using different measures of catchment response a focal area of nfm policy surrounds the potential for afforestation in catchment headwaters to reduce rapid runoff during storm events through increased interception infiltration and surface roughness ngai et al 2017 however the effects of woodland creation on reducing peak flows are not clear in uk catchments bathurst et al 2020 carrick et al 2018 stratford et al 2017 discerning the impact of afforestation on runoff depends on the ability to detect changes in flood peak magnitude or timing following interventions as well as understanding the underlying processes through which forest cover influences water movement in catchments zégre et al 2010 paired catchment studies have been widely used to detect changes but are subject to challenges such as lack of comparability between treatment and control catchments short time series and small sample sizes alila et al 2009 bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 model based change detection provides an alternative approach that has also been widely used however assumptions about the stationarity of catchment processes in pre and post treatment periods have rarely been tested and uncertainties evaluated zégre et al 2010 there are also many challenges involved in parameterisation such as representing surface roughness which is affected by land use and seasonal vegetation changes bond et al 2020 while model based change detection can be applied in ways that allow for the exploration of input parameters seibert and mcdonnell 2010 neither this approach nor paired catchment studies give direct insights into hydrological processes research on how afforestation impacts on hydrological processes complements change detection studies by helping to identify dominant runoff mechanisms and the relative importance of different catchment characteristics in controlling flow paths geris et al 2015 understanding these relationships is particularly important from a management perspective as it may help to identify how and where to locate afforestation within catchments murphy et al 2020 for example the impact of afforestation or forest removal on runoff processes may be highly variable depending on soil type soil depth and bedrock permeability which affect catchment storage pfister et al 2017 as well as forest management practices such as the type of trees planting configuration and drainage archer et al 2013 lunka and patil 2016 robinson 1986 1998 it is also necessary to understand the relative importance of meteorological factors such as the magnitude and duration of rainfall events and antecedent wetness conditions on runoff mechanisms evidence in the uk suggests that nfm is unlikely to be effective during the largest events dadson et al 2017 so how can such process effects of forest cover be detected in natural systems conservative naturally occurring tracers such as 2h and 18o can be used in hydrograph separation as a method for investigating runoff mechanisms kendall and mcdonnell 1998 such tracers can help determine the degree to which event rainfall versus water already stored in the catchment pre event water contributes to storm runoff many studies have demonstrated the dominance of pre event water in runoff which has changed perceptions of runoff mechanisms klaus and mcdonnell 2013 this has shifted the emphasis of catchment process studies towards questions of how stored water can be quickly mobilised during storm events which in turn raises questions about infiltration threshold behaviour and connectivity that could be influenced by catchment management bracken et al 2013 these issues warrant consideration in a nfm context a common perception in current nfm practice as in earlier waves of upland environmental management neal et al 1997 is of event runoff originating primarily as rapid overland flow of event water from saturated variable source areas which does not place enough emphasis on the potentially important role of water already stored in the catchment surprisingly tracers have not been used more in change detection studies despite early work that showed how in land use studies changes in the source components of flow were not revealed by simple hydrograph analysis gremillion et al 2000 to our knowledge nfm projects have not yet been the subject of catchment scale tracer based studies or used tracers to evaluate assumptions about management efficacy based on source components what do we know about source components in catchments like those targeted for nfm pre event water contributions have been found to vary with catchment characteristics in general there is an increase in event water runoff on a rural to urban gradient hasenmueller et al 2017 klaus and mcdonnell 2013 early work showed that event water contributions are inversely related to catchment size brown et al 1999 and that pre event water increases with increasing antecedent wetness muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2012 forests influence throughfall volumes soil infiltration rates and subsurface connectivity which can result in greater subsurface flow and higher pre event water in streams buttle 1994 grasslands have been shown to have higher event water fractions bonell et al 1990 muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 roa garcía and weiler 2010 these land cover effects are influenced by catchment soils and topography catchments with thin soils and steeper slopes often have higher event water fractions suecker et al 2000 here we use hydrograph separation to test the impact of catchment interventions on the source components of peak flows we follow the gremillion et al 2000 idea that tracer based hydrograph separations will reveal possible differences in flow pathways that could be useful for planning and evaluating nfm even if there are no discernible changes to the timing and magnitude of storm hydrographs our work uses additional tracers for hydrograph separation to further unpick the time and geographic based components of runoff sources and pathways while there are some challenges in using tracer based approaches klaus and mcdonnell 2013 there are a number of ways in which this approach could be valuable in planning and monitoring nfm in addition to more standard hydrological methods it can help in understanding the relative importance of shallow subsurface flow within soils which might be influenced by changes to soil management and deeper subsurface flow within bedrock which is more difficult to influence tracer based hydrograph separation has a physical basis that is lacking in most standard hydrometric separation methods klaus and mcdonnell 2013 when applied at high resolution through storm events tracers can reveal not just the proportions of different runoff components during events but the timing of different components during individual event hydrographs e g whether flood peaks are dominated by event rainfall finally tracers can help in evaluating the co benefits and risks of different types of interventions for example by helping to investigate flow paths and residence times of water around interventions such as field buffer strips novara et al 2013 wilkinson et al 2014 we report tracer based hydrograph separation 2h 18o and acid neutralising capacity anc in three neighbouring catchments within a wider 70 km2 pilot nfm project in the uk uplands two of these catchments are paired with similar soils geology and topography but 50 difference in forest cover the third catchment with the lowest forest cover has some differences in underlying characteristics but is representative of the range of conditions in the wider nfm project we test the null hypothesis that plantation forest cover has no influence on the source components of runoff we then further investigate the relative influence of catchment and storm event characteristics on fractions of event and groundwater runoff the main questions addressed in the research were 1 what is the effect of plantation forest cover on the fraction of event water runoff 2 how do other catchment features soils geology and topography impact the source components of runoff 3 how do the event magnitude and intensity impact these differences finally we discuss the implications for nfm in the uk from these process findings 2 methods 2 1 study site and design the research focussed on three small headwater catchments 2 4 3 1 km2 fig 1 table 1 in the scottish borders uk which are typical of many uk upland catchments and are monitored within the wider nfm project the catchments have a large range in forest cover 94 41 and 1 making them ideal for investigating the influence of forest cover on source components of flow comparisons between the neighbouring shiplaw and middle burn catchments enabled a paired catchment approach given their similar catchment characteristics other than percentage forest cover comparisons between these catchments and the longcote catchment allowed for insights into the relative role of other catchment characteristics on runoff components across the wider nfm catchment we used hydrograph separation based on isotopes 2h and 18o and anc to compare time and geographic source components respectively of runoff in the three catchments during four high flow events the wider eddleston water catchment a sub catchment of the river tweed is the focus of one of the uk s largest and long running nfm pilot sites which aims to inform national water policy under the eu water framework directive and eu floods directive tweed forum 2019 werritty et al 2010 forest cover was historically limited in most of the catchment during the 20th century but conifer plantations primarily sitka spruce picea sitchensis were established in the 1960s and 1970s particularly in the west the peaty soils were prepared for planting by deep ploughing to create drainage ditches however it was assumed that these had minimal impact in this study since they have not been maintained since at least the 1990s and have been actively blocked in some cases to follow more recent forest management guidelines approximately 94 of middle burn was conifer forest cover at various growth stages at the time of the study including 25 recently felled forest no new access roads were built during felling and brash mats were used to minimise compaction a series of leaky wooden dams has also been constructed in this catchment as part of the nfm project but these are only active during the largest events black et al 2021 and release water rapidly as storms subside so we assume they have negligible effect on total event water runoff fractions the adjacent shiplaw catchment has 41 conifer forest cover including 10 recent felling 28 improved and semi improved grassland much of which has under field tile drainage that is common in the uk uplands harrison 2012 and 27 fenland the steeper longcote catchment in the east has 1 conifer forest cover 11 improved grassland and 64 rough grassland 30 heathland 22 unimproved acid grassland 12 bracken and 22 fenland most of the catchment is grazed by sheep cattle grazing occurs on the lower slopes and drains exist under the improved grassland areas soils in the western catchments include extensive areas of poorly permeable gleyed soils and peats but also areas of more freely draining brown soils whilst the eastern catchment is dominated by brown soils with some peaty and gleyed soils on hilltops soil median field saturated hydraulic conductivities measured nearby 3 km in the wider catchment in a separate study archer et al 2013 were 0 50 0 94 m d 1 for improved grassland sites 1 m d 1 for 50 year old plantation forest and 2 86 4 18 m d 1 for broadleaf forests 180 years old soils and underlying geology are strongly associated the western catchments are dominated by poorly permeable glacial till aitken et al 1984 with pockets of permeable glacio lacustrine sands and gravels fig 1a the estimated hydraulic conductivity of the glacial till is 0 001 to 1 m d 1 macdonald et al 2012 the eastern catchment is mostly rock head overlying bedrock with smaller areas of glacial till mantling some of the main streams the hydraulic conductivity of the silurian greywacke bedrock was not measured but silurian greywacke aquifers elsewhere in southern scotland have low productivity ó dochartaigh et al 2015 with an estimated average transmissivity of 20 m2 d 1 graham et al 2009 elevation ranges between 250 and 600 masl across the three study catchments at eddleston village mean annual precipitation 2011 2017 is 900 mm falling mainly as rainfall monthly mean air temperatures are 3 13 c and actual daily evapotranspiration ranges from 0 2 mm in winter to 2 5 mm in summer estimated using methods of granger and gray 1989 2 2 field methods 2 2 1 hydrometric monitoring rainfall has been measured since april 2011 at four locations representative of the wider 70 km2 eddleston water catchment using stainless steel octapent storage rain gauges and tipping bucket rain gauges rim8020 recording at 15 min intervals and in increments of 0 2 mm these gauges are situated inside or within 1 km of the study catchments fig 1 air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed and direction have been measured at the same time step over the same period at a weather station campbell cr1000 automatic weather station located at the centre of the catchment fig 1 a and b stream water levels have been measured every 15 min hobo u20 0 3 5 m unvented pressure based water level recorders in each catchment since april 2011 discharge was calculated at the same time step using rating curves derived from applying the mid section method dingman 2014 to velocity area gauging at natural rated sections approximately 8 times a year under a range of conditions peskett 2020 2 2 2 event precipitation sampling event sampling was carried out over a 48 h period in the three catchments for seven events between december 2015 and february 2017 events were targeted based on weather forecasts and predicted precipitation maps from the uk met office and were only considered if total predicted event rainfall was above 15 mm with an average intensity of approximately 2 mm h 1 based on prior knowledge of the responsiveness of the catchment event rainfall was sampled within the longcote and shiplaw catchments fig 1 using sequential rainfall samplers built using a modified version of the method described in kennedy et al 1979 these were deployed a few hours prior to the start of the forecast event rainfall in open field locations the samplers collect rainfall in 6 mm increments for the first three samples 11 mm for the fourth sample and then a bulk sample for the rest of the event the volume increments were converted to time increments by pairing with the cumulative rainfall data from the closest tbr rain gauge bulk rainfall samples for the whole event were also collected from adjacent temporary storage gauges in case of failure of the sequential samplers rainfall samples were collected before any further rainfall and within 12 h of the end of each event with aliquots for isotopic analysis transferred in the field into two 15 ml hdpe bottles filled completely to remove air snow samples were also taken in the february event to test for the influence of snow on separation results see supplementary data s1 1 throughfall was not sampled but a sensitivity analysis was conducted for the effects of throughfall in hydrograph separation using data from the literature s1 1 2 2 3 event stream water sampling stream water sampling for the first event december 2015 used two automatic water samplers isco 6712 teledyne isco nebraska usa programmed for a 2 hly sampling frequency and manual sampling in the third catchment middle burn at lower frequency as an automatic sampler was not available all subsequent events used three automatic samplers sited adjacent to the gauging stations and programmed at a 2 hly sampling frequency giving a sampling window of up to 48 h since each sampler held 24 bottles all samplers were primed with clean dry bottles prior to the event timed to start a few hours before forecast rainfall and programmed to purge the inlet tubing with river water prior to collecting each sample we used a number of approaches to prevent and check for evaporation samples were pumped into bottles with narrow necks within the shaded wind free and pale grey compartment of automatic water samplers samples were collected within 12 h of the sampler programmes finishing samples were transferred directly from the automatic sampler bottles into two 15 ml hdpe bottles in the field and were filled completely to exclude air before sealing and after sample analysis we also checked that there was no systematic deviation on δ2h vs δ18o plots compared to the local meteoric water line the remaining stream water samples were transported to the laboratory in capped automatic sampler bottles where they were refrigerated at 4 c prior to anc analysis and analysed within 48 h of the event ending automatic water samplers failed during two events during the july 2016 event a blocked sampling tube in shiplaw meant that only the first sample was collected and this catchment had to be removed from the analysis of that event an electronic failure in the middle burn automatic sampler during the february 2017 event resulted in some missing data for the first part of the event manually collected samples prior to the event and before the onset of the main flow peak enabled estimation of the event fraction using interpolation and linear regression based on the neighbouring shiplaw catchment data as explained in tables s1 and s2 in total 60 event rainfall samples 4 event snow samples and 395 stream samples were collected across seven events the final event dataset for isotopic and anc analysis reported here is based on four events table 2 three of the events were excluded due to smaller than forecast rainfall or rainfall isotopic composition that was insufficiently different from streams to enable hydrograph separation 2 3 laboratory methods precipitation and stream samples were analysed for h and o isotope compositions using a los gatos research liquid water off axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy off axis icos laser absorption spectrometer at the university of saskatchewan canada we used standard analytical methods iaea 2009 and report δ2h and δ18o values relative to v smow precision was 1 0 and 0 2 respectively anc was determined in stream water samples using acidimetric titration with h2so4 in accordance with rounds 2012 to endpoints of ph 4 5 4 1 4 0 and 3 5 within 48 h of returning from the field in natural waters where aluminium concentrations are low this method has been shown to give a good approximation of anc neal 2001 conductivity and ph were not a focus of this study but were determined in stream samples to help characterise water chemistry conductivity was measured using a temperature compensated conductivity meter mettler toledo sg7 and ph was measured during anc titration 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 long term hydrometric and geochemical sampling data to help characterise catchment responses to rainfall hydrometric data were initially analysed for the three catchments using the complete 15 min frequency time series october 2011 september 2017 to generate summary statistics as well as statistics based on a set of 60 events in each catchment the data analysis methods used are detailed in s1 3 these data were used to calculate spearman rank correlation coefficients to highlight any possible relationships between event runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall summary statistics were also derived from routine weekly 2 weekly geochemical sampling data for may 2015 may 2017 encompassing the duration of the storm sampling s1 4 2 4 2 isotope and anc event based hydrograph separation we used isotope and anc based hydrograph separation to calculate the fractions of pre event water and groundwater respectively in stream discharge at the 2 h stream water sampling time step for each event hydrograph separation relies on a number of assumptions and has limitations that have been extensively reviewed elsewhere klaus and mcdonnell 2013 despite these limitations isotope based hydrograph separation is considered more objective than separation methods based on hydrometric data alone and provides a useful first approximation of runoff components operating at the catchment scale klaus and mcdonnell 2013 pre event water fractions were estimated as follows 1 q t q p q e 2 c t q t c p q p c e q e 3 f p c t c e c p c e 4 f e 1 f p where qt is stream discharge qp the discharge contribution from pre event water qe the discharge contribution from event water ct cp and ce are the δ values of stream water pre event water and event water and fp and fe are the fractions of pre event and event water in the stream klaus and mcdonnell 2006 the analysis was conducted using both 18o and 2h both isotopes gave similar results indicating minimal fractionation effects so only the 2h data are presented here to define the pre event endmember for each stream we used the mean of the pre event stream water samples collected on the day prior to the event as in other studies klaus and mcdonnell 2013 for the event endmember we used both the sequential rainfall samples for each event except december 2015 when sequential samples were not available and bulk rainfall samples in order to crosscheck the results fp and fe are presented in the subsequent analysis as values at peak discharge using the sample closest to peak discharge fp qmax or fe qmax and as a total for the storm based on a sampling window defined by the first sample on the rising limb of the hydrograph and the earliest final sample across the three catchments fp qtot or fe qtot time to peak ttp from the start of the rising limb to the peak discharge and the runoff ratio based on the event water fraction rr were also calculated with subscripts p and e denoting pre event and event water respectively we also carried out sensitivity analyses to assess the influence of throughfall and of snow on hydrograph separation s1 1 we used a similar two component mixing model to estimate the groundwater fraction in runoff during each event subject to the same assumptions as the isotope based model 5 f g w a r a s a r a g w q g w q t where fgw is groundwater fraction qt is stream discharge qgw is discharge contribution from groundwater as is anc of stream water ar is anc of surface runoff endmember and agw is anc of groundwater endmember the groundwater endmember was defined as the mean anc of the five lowest flows in each sub catchment for the period september 2015 august 2016 based on weekly sampling as discussed in s1 4 similar to other studies neal et al 1997 soulsby et al 2003 the surface runoff endmember was defined as zero as this approximates the anc of rainfall the stream water endmember was taken as the anc at the time of sampling as for isotope based hydrograph separation fgw is presented in the subsequent analysis as values at peak discharge or total discharge fgw qmax fgw qtot and ttp gw and rr gw are reported for time to peak and runoff ratios based on groundwater components uncertainties in the pre event water and groundwater fractions were estimated using the gaussian error propagation approach of genereaux et al 1998 based on 70 confidence intervals which were considered appropriate for analysis of this size of dataset and the uncertainties involved in hydrograph separation bazemore et al 1994 details of the input parameters for the uncertainty analysis are outlined in s1 5 finally three component hydrograph separation was conducted using a two step approach klaus and mcdonnell 2013 to approximate soil water based on the difference between the pre event water and groundwater fractions these data were used to compare catchment responses during the different events spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated to highlight any possible relationships between tracer based event water fractions runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall 3 results 3 1 catchment characteristic controls on runoff components 3 1 1 long term hydrometric and geochemical sampling data analysis of the complete stream discharge time series indicated that the two western catchments middle burn and shiplaw were more responsive to rainfall events than the eastern catchment longcote table 3 the highly forested middle burn catchment was less responsive than the adjacent shiplaw with lower forest cover but much more responsive than longcote with the lowest forest cover large differences were also observed in catchment long term may 2015 may 2017 stream water geochemistry fig 2 fig s1 middle burn was most acidic and had the lowest anc and conductivity compared to the other catchments which may be due to the acidifying effects of the forest shiplaw had intermediate values and longcote had the highest values shiplaw had a wider range of anc and conductivity compared to the other catchments which may reflect its greater responsiveness the median values and range in isotopic composition were similar for middle burn and shiplaw but notably different for longcote reflecting both the proximity of the western catchments and potentially the higher groundwater fraction in longcote 3 1 2 event based hydrograph separation overall despite the responsiveness of the catchments event water runoff was generally limited the total event runoff fraction fe qtot was 0 36 for all catchments and events table 4 the peak runoff fraction fe qmax was higher 0 54 in all catchments and events but with the same relative values as those based on fe qtot groundwater runoff was generally low across the catchments total groundwater runoff fraction fgw qtot was 0 35 for all winter events though much more variable during the summer event in the two catchments sampled 0 25 0 65 fgw qmax showed a similar pattern between catchments and events but estimates were up to 10 lower than fractions based on totals table 4 these low groundwater estimates combined with low event water estimates result in large soil water fraction estimates in the three component hydrograph separations in terms of the differences between catchments the hydrograph separation results show a similar pattern to the results based on long term data with no systematic relationship between forest cover and the fraction of event water runoff runoff ratios based on event water estimates from isotope based hydrograph separation indicate that shiplaw had the highest event water runoff ratios longcote the lowest and middle burn intermediate values despite having the highest forest cover uncertainties in these estimates are large but apparent differences were observed between shiplaw and middle burn for the largest event november 2016 and february 2017 table 4 there is good consistency between the relative order of these runoff ratios for each catchment and runoff ratios calculated using the hydrometric data for events over the longer time period cf tables 2 and 4 groundwater runoff fractions across the catchments followed a different pattern they were lowest in middle burn 0 13 of total runoff during the largest event intermediate in shiplaw and highest in longcote although groundwater still contributed 0 27 of total runoff during the largest event the differences were systematic between catchments and events table 4 despite similar fractions of event water runoff during the intense summer event july 2016 the groundwater contribution was much higher at longcote 0 65 of total runoff than middle burn 0 25 of total runoff 3 1 3 intra event dynamics the intra event isotope anc dynamics fig s2 s5 as well as the associated runoff components within events give additional insights into runoff processes these are best illustrated during the event with the largest discharge peak fig 3 longcote had a double peak hydrograph also observed in the hydrometric data for some other events that were not sampled with an initial rapid discharge of soil water groundwater followed by a slower increase in event water during the second peak that was quickly overwhelmed by soil water groundwater on the falling limb it was the only catchment with an increase in soil water groundwater fraction following the hydrograph peak shiplaw had some similarities to longcote in that the initially high soil water groundwater inputs were rapidly overwhelmed by event water runoff that dominated the peak of the hydrograph but decreased rapidly on the falling limb in middle burn the response was generally more damped with more coincident peaks in event water soil water and groundwater and a greater fraction of event water on the falling limb 3 2 influence of event characteristics on runoff components event water and groundwater fractions appear to vary approximately linearly with maximum discharge in the autumn winter events in all catchments fig 4 the exception was longcote which had a less linear response particularly in the fe qmax values perhaps due to the higher measured rainfall on the eastern side of the catchment for the largest event or to threshold behaviour the switch in direction of anc hysteresis in longcote between the two smallest and largest events may also be indicative of such behaviour fig 5 the differences in estimated event water fraction were higher between events than between catchments suggesting that event characteristics are an important control on runoff partitioning spearman rank correlation coefficients between event water fractions and tracer derived runoff ratios and event total rainfall depth rainfall intensity and antecedent rainfall showed some possible associations p 0 07 for correlation of runoff ratio with total event rainfall though it was not possible to determine the main drivers due to the limited number of events sampled correlation analysis based on hydrometric data alone for the events during the longer time period suggested that the only significant correlation p 0 01 was between total runoff and event total rainfall depth 4 discussion the results give insights into the role of rapid surface rainfall runoff versus stored water during storm events in this nfm pilot catchment as we outline below stored water dominates the hydrograph under most conditions and appears to be mediated to some extent by forest cover across the wider nfm catchment as a whole other factors such as soils and geology are a more dominant control however these catchment characteristics appear to be dominated by the event magnitude as we discuss these findings have implications for locating nfm interventions involving land use change and the level of benefits we might expect from these flood risk management approaches they also demonstrate how tracers can complement more traditional hydrometric techniques in the evaluation of nfm 4 1 pre event and subsurface sources of runoff during events pre event water was an important fraction of stream discharge in all sampled events and sub catchments constituting the dominant fraction of total runoff 0 64 this finding is consistent with many other isotope based hydrograph separation studies that have demonstrated the importance of pre event water e g bonell et al 1990 mcdonnell 1990 pearce et al 1986 sklash and farvolden 1979 findings were similar using either 2h or 18o with differences in the event fractions of 7 which were lower than the error propagation estimates nevertheless there was high variability in pre event water fraction between different events suggesting that humid forested catchments may have more variable pre event fractions than many early studies suggested fischer et al 2017 there was also relatively low spatial variability in bulk precipitation isotopic composition for different events across different parts of the catchment in contrast to some studies fischer et al 2017 mcguire et al 2005 suggesting that in this environment isotopic tracers can provide a useful tool for understanding event runoff further research is warranted on the effects of throughfall on isotopic composition assuming the bulk throughfall δ18o and δ2h value differences to storm rainfall reported in kubota and tsuboyama 2003 we estimated that fe qmax ranged from 12 lower to 17 higher than estimates based on the sampled rainfall across the different events in middle burn however this did not alter the relative order of catchments in terms of their event water runoff fractions groundwater was a small fraction of stream discharge during the winter events although variable between catchments and important in longcote where it still constituted 21 of stream discharge during the largest event the small groundwater fraction implies that soil water is an important water source in these temperate upland catchments this is consistent with studies in similar catchments with poorly permeable bedrock or superficial deposits where surface runoff and shallow subsurface runoff in soils tend to dominate tetzlaff et al 2007b groundwater appears to be more important in summer events but testing this hypothesis would require sampling larger and more summer events 4 2 forest cover and management controls on event runoff fractions comparisons between shiplaw and middle burn suggest that forest cover has some influence on event water fraction in these paired catchments the total event water fraction in the forested middle burn catchment was consistently lower across the sampled events and in the largest event it was 11 lower and 17 lower at peak discharge we are not aware of data on event water fractions from similar environments with nfm schemes in the uk but reductions due to forest cover are consistent with other studies generally buttle 1994 although not as high as reductions seen in other areas for instance muñoz villers and mcdonnell 2013 reported 24 difference in event water contributions between forest and pasture in a tropical environment due mainly to much higher contrasts in infiltration rates between the two land uses and to a lesser extent to canopy interception considering this evidence and the infiltration data we have from the wider eddleston catchment and similar environments in the uk 3 4 0 026 m d 1 a b horizon for grassland versus 8 3 m d 1 for forest marshall et al 2009 we suggest that the reductions in event water in middle burn compared to shiplaw are linked to relative differences in exceedance of rainfall infiltration capacity between forest and grassland areas and resulting reductions in overland flow in the forested areas interception by the forest is also likely to have led to reductions in the event water fraction as reported in other studies roa garcía and weiler 2010 forest management methods particularly drainage in site preparation and compaction during harvesting and under field drainage in improved grassland may introduce uncertainties the effects of drainage systems in similar temperate environments are poorly studied particularly at catchment scale and are highly variable depending on factors such as drain spacing soil type and antecedent conditions dadson et al 2017 open forest drainage ditches and compaction are likely to have increased the fraction of event water runoff compared to undrained forest although as already noted the effects of drainage ditches and compaction are expected to be minimal in the study catchments under field drainage is also likely to have increased event water runoff fraction under the wet antecedent conditions of most of the storms we investigated but less so than increases due to drainage in the forest the net effect of drainage in both the middle burn and shiplaw catchments is a likely decrease in the difference in event water fractions between them though it is unlikely to have changed the results we have reported these relative effects of drainage would benefit from further study in this catchment and elsewhere in the uk given that around 61 of agricultural land in the uk is drained wiskow and van der ploeg 2003 4 3 soil geological and meteorological controls on runoff fractions comparisons between the western shiplaw middle burn catchments and the eastern catchment longcote illustrate the wide variation in response across the wider nfm catchment event water fractions were up to 48 lower in longcote compared to shiplaw whilst up to 33 lower in middle burn longcote responded rapidly to rainfall though with lower peak discharge slow recession rates and double peak hydrographs as well as high groundwater and soil water fractions these findings suggest a dominance of subsurface flow despite the steeper catchment topography and low forest cover given the poorly permeable bedrock in longcote subsurface flow is most likely to occur in the soils superficial deposits and weathered bedrock this is in contrast to some hydrograph separation studies in steep catchments that have reported positive correlations between slope and event water fraction suecker et al 2000 there is some uncertainty in whether the lower event water fractions in the longcote catchment are related to lower levels of disturbance and particularly the acid grassland heathland and bracken land cover with an expected higher roughness and infiltration or to the underlying soils and geology research on catchment disturbance has frequently found evidence of increased runoff and event water fraction in more disturbed catchments e g monteith et al 2006 nainar et al 2018 however the higher groundwater fraction and the nature of the stream response suggest that more permeable soils and superficial deposits are particularly important in controlling event water fractions this corresponds with research in other scottish upland catchments which has demonstrated the importance of freely draining soils and glacial drift deposits in controlling catchment flow paths leading to much longer transit times even on steeper slopes e g soulsby et al 2006 regardless of these uncertainties a conclusion emerging from our results that is relevant to planning nfm interventions more widely is the likely limited effect on flood risk of hillslope afforestation in areas already dominated by deeper subsurface flow the small number of storms sampled make it difficult to test how different meteorological characteristics in terms of total rainfall depth intensity and api control event runoff fractions however given that there were greater differences in event runoff between events than between catchments these characteristics may be more important controls on the fraction of event water in the hydrograph than catchment characteristics fischer et al 2017 reported a similar hierarchy of influences controlling pre event water fraction across multiple storms in pre alpine catchments antecedent conditions may be particularly important as suggested by the large contrast between summer and winter events and in longcote the switch in hysteresis direction which has been linked to the changing inputs of hillslope soil water in streams under different wetness states zuecco et al 2016 4 4 implications for natural flood management policy our study demonstrates the importance of the displacement of pre event water in runoff mechanisms in landscapes subject to nfm interventions implying that saturated overland flow may not be a dominant runoff mechanism even in relatively responsive catchments the results also suggest that upland afforestation can influence the partitioning of runoff at the catchment scale so could be used to manipulate flow paths in nfm however the effects might be minimal for the largest events compared to improved grassland areas which nfm measures frequently target due to the limited effects of forests on infiltration and transient storage soulsby et al 2017 tetzlaff et al 2007a and relatively high infiltration rates in improved grasslands in many uk upland environments these findings support suggestions in the nfm literature that climatic conditions and individual storm event characteristics dominate over catchment characteristics in influencing peak flows in the largest events dadson et al 2017 in other regions for example where grasslands are severely degraded forest planting may have a greater effect on reducing event water runoff fractions van meerveld et al 2019 zwartendijk et al 2017 the implication of these results is that in areas of more permeable geology and soils similar to the longcote catchment hillslope afforestation may have limited benefit as a nfm strategy we do not consider the effects of riparian or floodplain planting although woodland may of course bring other benefits therefore hillslope planting for nfm should target other areas in particular areas with compacted soils overlying relatively permeable soils or geology where forest planting may help to connect runoff to streams via the groundwater zone in this case the location of forest cover and the type of trees become important as discussed by neal et al 1997 who suggested long term experiments with more deeply rooting trees to take account of these mechanisms in nfm implementation might require greater consideration of subsurface features flood vulnerability maps used to determine the location of woodland related nfm interventions in the uk consider some proxies for soil and related geological substrate permeability at a coarse resolution environment agency 2018 but should include further consideration of the interaction with factors such as the degree of compaction and depth to groundwater targeted tracer studies could improve such process understanding helping better constrain models to detect change as well as quantify co benefits of nfm interventions involving woodland such as increased biodiversity carbon storage and water quality iacob et al 2014 keesstra et al 2018 of course there are practical challenges given high costs associated with tracer studies but the increasing availability of in situ high frequency sensors for tracers such as conductivity temperature and potentially isotopic tracers berman et al 2009 mean that such approaches could be incorporated into nfm planning and monitoring 5 conclusions to our knowledge this is the first study using natural tracers at the catchment scale to investigate runoff mechanisms in uk based nfm projects it gives insights into the diversity of runoff mechanisms operating during storm events across different upland catchments the results suggest that pre event water is an important fraction of stream discharge during events for the size of catchments 10 km2 and events 20 of the mean annual flood for which there is currently some evidence that forest cover could have an impact on discharge dadson et al 2017 the study also suggests that plantation forest cover reduces the fraction of event water runoff in streams over this range of event magnitudes however the effects of these differences in land cover may be dominated by differences in event characteristics suggesting limited impacts of land cover for the largest events since many nfm measures are designed to target event water this implies a need for careful consideration of the types and locations of nfm interventions to ensure they are effective finally the study demonstrates the potential utility of using tracers in nfm for understanding runoff processes and monitoring co

8181,study region little kinyasungwe river catchment central semi arid tanzania study focus the structure and hydraulic properties of superficial geology can play a crucial role in controlling groundwater recharge in drylands however the pathways by which groundwater recharge occurs and their sensitivity to environmental change remain poorly resolved geophysical surveys using electrical resistivity tomography ert were conducted in the study region and used to delineate shallow subsurface stratigraphy in conjunction with borehole logs based on these results a series of local scale conceptual hydrogeological models was produced and collated to generate a 3d conceptual model of groundwater recharge to the wellfield new hydrological insights for the region we propose that configurations of superficial geology control groundwater recharge in dryland settings as follows 1 superficial sand deposits act as collectors and stores that slowly feed recharge into zones of active faulting 2 these fault zones provide permeable pathways enabling greater recharge to occur 3 windows within layers of smectitic clay that underlie ephemeral streams may provide pathways for focused recharge via transmission losses and 4 overbank flooding during high intensity precipitation events increases the probability of activating such permeable pathways these conceptual models provide a physical basis to improve numerical models of groundwater recharge in drylands and a conceptual framework to evaluate strategies e g managed aquifer recharge to artificially enhance the

water demands and temperature contrasts cherlet et al 2018 surface water is often seasonally or perennially absent in drylands wheater et al 2008 and groundwater is often the principal and most reliable source of water in these regions macdonald et al 2012 shanafield and cook 2014 owing to their hydrological characteristics drylands are likely to experience increased water stress in the coming decades gleeson et al 2012 taylor 2014 wada et al 2010 due to anthropogenic pressures chen et al 2019 desa 2017 rulli et al 2013 wada et al 2013 and climatic changes abel et al 2020 berdugo et al 2020 huang et al 2017 taylor et al 2013a hence improved understanding and quantification of groundwater recharge in dryland areas is critical to the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the future gleeson et al 2020 head et al 2014 meixner et al 2016 groundwater recharge in drylands often occurs by way of leakage from runoff and surface water sources a process we refer to in this paper as focused recharge simmers 2003 healy and scanlon 2010 cuthbert et al 2016 2019a 2019b yet despite its present and future importance the spatio temporal controls on focused groundwater recharge

climates the geometry and permeability of superficial deposits is known to moderate potential recharge to underlying bedrock aquifers griffiths et al 2011 misstear et al 2009 and local scale configurations of these deposits provide recharge pathways through high permeability layers cuthbert et al 2009 it is also likely that the structure and hydraulic properties of superficial geology play a crucial role in controlling surface groundwater interactions in drylands scanlon et al 2006 wheater et al 2010 for example marked temporal and spatial variability in the hydraulic conductivities of streambed and floodplain deposits can provide controls on surface groundwater interactions in dryland ephemeral stream systems costa et al 2012 dahan et al 2008 flinchum et al 2020 mccallum et al 2014 telvari et al 1998 wang et al 2017 further heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties and structure of superficial deposits have been hypothesised to influence the subsurface dynamics of groundwater recharge to deeper aquifers acworth et al 2020 rau et al 2017 few studies to date have made quantitative detailed observations of superficial geological structure in drylands to better understand the likely flowpaths and processes controlling groundwater recharge the objectives of this paper are thus to explore the potential physical basis for groundwater recharge by determining the geometry and inter relationships between superficial deposits underlying geology and fracture systems in the intensively monitored and pumped groundwater system of the makutapora wellfield in the little kinyasungwe river catchment of central tanzania this system comprises a weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifer system that is overlain in part by low permeability smectitic clays and despite intensive groundwater abstraction is replenished on a decadal timescale by episodic recharge events taylor et al 2013b to accomplish this we conducted a series of geophysical investigations using electrical resistivity tomography ert and in conjunction with borehole data and field observations identified various geoelectrical structures and correlated these with interpreted subsurface lithology based on these findings we present a series of local and basin scale conceptual models that identify multiple potential recharge pathways illustrating how superficial geology may control focused recharge in the little kinyasungwe river catchment although our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the little kinyasungwe river catchment our conceptual models provide a first step in quantifying recharge in the study area in the future and we propose these models will be transferable to other dryland regions globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the makutapora wellfield situated within the little kinyasungwe river catchment fig 1 is underlain by the fractured crystalline basement of the dodoma craton in central tanzania kashaigili et al 2003 and is approximately 20 km north of the capital city dodoma the catchment occupies an area of 698 km2 upstream of the chihanga flow gauge located fig 1 at the catchment outlet and forms the upper section of the river wami basin shindo 1989 the climate is semi arid and characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons average air temperatures are 23 c with highs ranging from 26 5 c to 30 5 c in july october and lows from 13 6 c to 18 8 c in nov june wmo 2020 average annual precipitation is 550 mm at makutapora meteorological station fig 1 99 of which falls in a single wet season from december to april seddon 2019 taylor et al 2013b short lived observations in the catchment suggest that precipitation in the upland areas may be greater than on the floor of the catchment onodera et al 1995 seddon et al 2021 there have been several estimates of potential evapotranspiration in makutapora fawley 1958 kashaigili et al 2003 onodera et al 1995 shindo 1989 1990 the most recent being 2120 mm yr 1 based on 3 non consecutive years of data recorded between 2003 and 2006 at the makutapora meteorological station seddon 2019 the catchment is underlain by basement rocks comprised of precambrian synorogenic granites and migmatite biotite gneiss of the dodoma basement superterrane de pauw et al 1983 kabete et al 2012 ministry of water 1976 with more intrusive ultrabasic complexes of amphibolite and quartzo feldspathic gneisses with biotite outcropping within the wellfield and meya meya regions fig 1 metamorphosed rocks are also present in the region and amphibole schists crop out in a belt of inselbergs surrounding meya meya julian et al 1963 apart from outcrops at the topographic highs of the chenene hills kashaigili 2010 or along channels of ephemeral streams hayashi and chiba 1994 these basement rocks are generally covered by a deeply weathered regolith 50 100 m thick of fractured saprock saprolite and pedolitic products of neogene age at varying stages of chemical decomposition julian et al 1963 regolith composition varies throughout and is related to the mineralogy of the underlying parent rock the regolith is overlain by unconsolidated alluvial material consisting of detrital sands gravels and silts kashaigili et al 2003 nkotagu 1996 in the centre of the catchment and in the lowland areas of the wellfield depression the regolith is overlain by layers of black smectitic mbuga clay onodera et al 1995 such black smectitic clays often exist as valley infill in the rifted basins of central tanzania bianconi and borshoff 1984 these are also typical of other semi arid regions across the world in similar geological contexts oakes and thorp 1951 and have previously been associated with the presence of seasonal freshwater swamps in makutapora wade and oates 1938 tectonic activity associated with the manyara dodoma rift segment a branch of the east african rift system extending south across the dodoma craton dawson 2008 has left a complex network of faults in the study area these faults are expressed as linear features trending sw ne nw se across the topography of the region macheyeki et al 2008 as seen in fig 1 the main faults that cross the study area the mlemu and kitope form a natural nw boundary to the makutapora wellfield which is situated along a distinct fault bounded topographic lowland depression within the wider catchment and there is evidence of further faulting north of the catchment kabete et al 2012 the large scale discontinuities and dense fracture networks associated with faults such as the mlemu are the defining hydrogeological feature of makutapora giving rise to anomalously high transmissivities of 400 to 4000 m2d 1 within the wellfield and producing high well yields in boreholes proximal to the faults maurice et al 2019 rwebugisa 2008 the wellfield is presently the sole source of dodoma s municipal and industrial water supply and in 2016 supplied the city with an average of 50 000 m3 day 1 of freshwater duwasa 2017 groundwater abstraction in the wellfield has increased from 0 1 to 1 5 million m3 per month and despite having exceeded previous estimates of its maximum sustainable yield groundwater levels are currently higher than they were in the 1990s and roughly the same as they were prior to development seddon 2019 long term groundwater level data from the wellfield indicates that intensive groundwater abstraction is replenished on a decadal timescale by episodic recharge events during exceptional seasonal rainfalls associated with el niño events interrupting multi annual recessions in groundwater levels cuthbert et al 2019b kolusu et al 2019 taylor et al 2013b previous research in the catchment suggests that this episodic recharge is focused by way of ephemeral streams flowing over coarse grained soils within alluvial fans at the margins of the wellfield depression onodera et al 1995 shindo 1989 1990 diffuse recharge through the soil matrix or via soil macropores and fractures that bypass the soil matrix is also thought to occur within the catchment shindo 1989 1990 however it is not known what the relative contributions of diffuse and focused recharge are in this area nor is it addressed quantitatively in this study 2 2 geophysical methods 2 2 1 electrical resistance tomography data acquisition processing and inversion geophysical techniques have received increasing attention in recent years due to their non destructive character and ability to provide information on subsurface features over large areas binley et al 2015 parsekian et al 2015 singha 2017 among the available techniques electrical resistivity tomography ert was chosen for this study for its ability to map and characterise superficial deposits for hydrological interpretation e g gourry et al 2003 andersen and acworth 2009 cuthbert et al 2009 clifford and binley 2010 gourdol et al 2018 in this study an agi supersting r8 resistivity meter http www agiusa com was used in dipole dipole configuration this configuration made efficient use of the instrument s multichannel capability and provided good lateral and vertical resolution a 64 electrode array with dipole sizes a of a 6 and a 8 and dipole separations n a with n 1 8 were used and combinations of long 3 m electrode spacings used in areas where penetration depth was important while shorter 2 m electrode spacings used in areas where high resolution targets were to be delineated see table s1 for detailed survey set up parameters areas close to and parallel with roads or overhead power cables were avoided to minimize interference from other electrical signals or man made disturbances of the subsurface dry and hard ground conditions necessitated the use of saltwater to improve electrode contact resistance and scrub vegetation commonly had to be removed to ensure the lines were able to maintain precise straight line orientations start and end points of sections were located using a gps garmin etrex 10 to 5 m uncertainty and orientated by taking a compass bearing the relative elevations of the topographic variations along each line were measured using a leica disto d410 with a vertical accuracy of 1 mm each apparent resistivity measurement was made in normal ρ n and reciprocal ρ r configuration labrecque et al 1996 with the measurement value used defined as the mean of these two measurements ρ m the percentage standard error in this mean referred to here as the reciprocal error e is defined as 1 e 100 ρ r ρ n ρ r ρ m negative apparent resistivity data points were removed and measurements with reciprocal errors greater than 5 were filtered out this filtered dataset was inverted using the res2dinv geotomo software algorithm loke 2001 a least squares data constraint was used that minimizes the error between the observed and calculated apparent resistivity values and a limit of 4 iterations was set to avoid model over fitting a robust model constraint incorporating topographic variations was selected over a least squared inversion constraint since it is known to better resolve sharp geological boundaries expected within the study area loke et al 2003 in this case it was important to delineate the boundaries between the superficial deposits in situ regolith and zones bounded by normal faulting inverted data are presented as geoelectric pseudosections edwards 1977 and used in the intepretation of geoelectric layers and subsurface lithology 2 2 2 intepretation of geoelectrical models due to the smoothing and non uniqueness inherent in fitting 3d geological structure to 2d resistivity models aizebeokhai and singh 2013 dahlin et al 2007 independent data were used to aid interpretation and to assist in identifying layer boundaries in the images boreholes with lithological data proximal to survey lines were collated from the tanzanian ministry of water in dodoma table a2 and superimposed onto these sections to correlate geoelectrical layers and lithological observations in addition field observations were used to constrain the resistivity ranges for superficial deposits observed at the ground surface sharp discontinuities seen in the geoelectrical sections were corroborated with field observations of faulted zones and regions of faulting inferred from analysing topographical data from strm 30 m dem of the study area nasa et al 2019 water content and temperature variations are known to affect subsurface resistivity brunet et al 2010 but these effects were not considered in the interpretation of geological layers since they are greatly outweighed by contrasts in resistivity due to lithological variation which are the focus of this study further geophysical surveys were undertaken in the middle of the dry season june july when variations in soil moisture content and temperature between the dates of individual surveys were minimal forward modelling using the res2dmod software loke 2002 was used to identify and rule out various unexpected features found in some of the inversions to decide whether they should be interpreted as true variations in subsurface resistivity firstly several inversions at the nzuga figs a4 9 12 lk fig a15 17 meya meya fig a18 and chihanga fig a19 sites show low resistivity zones underlying regions of high 250 ω m resistivity at the surface secondly we observe many sections at nzuga figs a9 11 and meya meya sites fig a19 which have decreasing resistivity with depth underlying shallower zones of 40 ω m resistivity see section 3 1 for further discussion using the field site profile characteristics of the nzuga 8 survey fig a10 a simplified two layer synthetic model of the subsurface was developed for the forward modelling exercise the top layer for the model was defined as 0 2 5 m with a resistivity of 40 ω m and the bottom layer from 2 5 to 30 m with a resistivity of 20 ω m fig a20 two regions 10 m wide and 3 m thick with high 1000 ω m resistivities were then added to the model to examine the effects of pockets of high resistivity material fig a21 the synthetic results indicate that these low resistivity features circled in black in fig a21 occur despite the attempts to minimise the number of iterations and are thus anomalous features further synthetic results indicate that sections with decreasing resistivity with depth were indeed true features that cannot be re created without adding decreasing resistivity layers with depth in our forward models 2 3 survey locations a total of 17 ert surveys were conducted in june and july 2019 at four locations within the study area these areas are shown in fig 1 and a map of survey lines at each study site are shown inset within figs 2 5 these locations were chosen to be representative of the various catchment areas that surround the wellfield as described for each site below three sites meya meya lk and chihanga are situated on the little kinyasungwe river which comprises 75 of the catchment area draining into the makutapora wellfield depression meya meya the furthest upstream survey site is located approximately 20 km upstream from the makutapora wellfield this location was chosen for one survey fig 6 and a18 to coincide with the long term stream gauge monitoring taking place at the site seddon et al 2021 this gauge measures the inflow of the little kinyasungwe river into the next downstream study site lk the purpose of surveys in this area is to provide geological context to streamflow patterns recorded here and the geological structure comprising upland pediplain areas that surround the wellfield shindo 1989 the site lk was chosen for 5 surveys figs a13 17 to constrain the geological configuration underneath the little kinyasungwe river as it enters the wellfield depression this site is bounded by the kitope fault to the east and is situated in a lowland area covered by mbuga clay and silts in seasons with particularly high precipitation these lowland regions can experience overland flow and inundation during the wet season fig a2 the chihanga site represents the furthest downstream survey site on the little kinyasungwe river and was chosen for one survey fig 5 and a19 like meya meya it was chosen to constrain the geological conditions as the stream exits the wellfield depression into the downstream hombolo basin the fourth site is in the vicinity of the ephemeral nzuga stream and lies on the north western edge of the wellfield this site was chosen for 10 surveys fig 2 and a3 12 the nzuga stream crosses the zanka and mbuga faults before terminating in the wellfield depression forming an alluvial fan spot gauging within the stream has shown that ephemeral streamflow does not always reach the depression and is instead thought to be lost by leakage from the stream channel into underlying and surrounding superficial deposits shindo 1990 such headwater channels sutfin et al 2014 are common throughout the region in the transition slopes between upland and lowland areas and comprises approximately 25 of the catchment area flowing into the catchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 geoelectric units integrating the results of the 17 ert surveys figs a3 19 with interpreted borehole log information table a2 and outcrop field observations fig a1 we defined five main geoelectrical units in the catchment and associated inferred lithologic properties and depositional settings as follows a deposits of coarse sand 250 ω m and

interpret due to local variations in rock type and structure topography and rates of sediment erosion and deposition the topmost layer a comprises sand of variable grain sizes ranging from coarse to fine see fig a1 3c with resistivities 250 ω m set amongst silts with resistivities of 20 160 ω m sand is 0 5 4 m thick and is present but often discontinuous at all the study sites continuous 0 5 m thick layers of sand were directly observed within the dry streambeds of the nzuga figs a6 9 12 and little kinyasungwe river at meya meya fig a18 lk figs a15 17 and chihanga fig a19 thicker layers of sand are particularly prominent at the nzuga site where they exist as 1 4 m thick deposits in and around the banks of the nzuga figs a5 9 12 and smaller 1 2 m thick deposits in little kinyasungwe figs a15 17 owing to their channel like morphology we interpret these sand deposits as abandoned ephemeral stream channel alluvial deposits silts often surround these pockets of coarser alluvium and are most commonly present as 0 5 m thin layers in the soil profile surrounding the nzuga stream and little kinyasungwe river however thicker layers 1 2 m of these silts are particularly prominent in the alluvial fan of the nzuga figs 3 a3 4 and in the floodplain areas surrounding the little kinyasungwe river at the lk site figs 4 a13 15 17 and see fig a1 5 we interpret these as overbank deposits from the existing or previous ephemeral stream network very low resistivity layers 10 ω m b are present in every study area and in outcrops that correspond with layers of black smectitic mbuga clay see fig a1 4 this clay layer is 30 m thick in the downstream reaches of the nzuga stream where it meets the wellfield depression figs 3 and a3 5 and is also present as a 10 25 m thick layer below the little kinyasungwe river in the lk site figs 4 and a15 17 at the meya meya site this low resistivity clay exists only as an isolated 0 5 m thick layer 40 m away from the little kinyasungwe river fig a19 more prominent 0 5 1 m thick deposits of this clay can be seen surrounding but not underlying the little kinyasungwe river at the chihanga site figs 5 and a19 we interpret these clay layers to be transported basin infill deposits in the downthrown side of mlemu and kitope faults at the nzuga and lk sites respectively however at chihanga it is unclear whether these deposits are previous basin infill that has subsequently been cut through by the little kinyasungwe or more recent over bank deposits underlying these transported sediments we observe a zone of approximately 80 ω m c that crops out within the nzuga streambed see fig a1 3b but only upstream of the mlemu fault figs 3 and a11 12 as well as within the streambed of the little kinyasungwe river at both the meya meya see fig a1 1a and chihanga sites this comprises quartz grains 1 4 mm interbedded in a yellow to white fine sandy clay matrix see fig a1 3a at the nzuga figs 3 and a9 12 and meya meya fig a18 sites the resistivity of this zone further decreases with depth from approximately 80 to 30 ω m comprising the uppermost in situ cemented layer of our profile we interpret this layer as a pedolith or mottled zone with a decrease in resistivity with depth suggesting a transition from 1 1 pedogenic clays to increasing proportion of 2 1 clays as the weathering profile moves below the water table and approaches the saprolite pal et al 1989 this transition is common in tropical profiles and in the partial weathering of mafic materials where 2 1 clays typically persist below the water table where less intense weathering processes in the saturated zone inhibits weathering of 2 1 clays to kaolinite taylor and howard 1999 at shallower depths above the water table variable saturation can lead to micro weathering environments that create lower ph and higher complexing agent concentrations that accelerate weathering to kaolinite dennis et al 2009 taylor and howard 1999 at the nzuga and meya meya sites there is a continuous geoelectric gradient with depth as resistivities further decrease to 10 30 ω m figs a9 11 a18 based on interpretation of borehole data we interpret this as a gradual transition from lower pedolith to upper saprolite zone d with a resistivity of 10 30 ω m typical of saprolites of smectitic composition seen in similar geological provinces e g pal et al 1989 taboada and garcia 1999 robineau et al 2007 anudu et al 2014 this continuous decrease of resistivity is indicative of the boundary between the saprolite and pedolith known as the pedoplasmatic front which is characterized by a change in composition from pedogenic clays to more less weathered lithic material stoops et al 2018 however this 10 30 ω m saprolitic layer is non existent in the geoelectric sections at the lk and chihanga sites figs 4 and 5 instead zones of 60 80 ω m interpreted as indicative of 1 1 pedolitic clays described earlier are immediately underlain by higher resistivity zones of 110 450 ω m increasing with depth this higher resistivity zone has been interpreted as zones of fractured bedrock or saprock e and distinguished from 250 ω m zones of coarse sand seen at the surface or saprolite composed of more 1 1 clays using borehole lithological interpretations this wide resistivity range of 110 450 ω m is common in the saprock of crystalline basement systems because of the fractured nature of the saprock fractures filled with water or decomposed clays from the saprolite create inherent inhomogeneities in the subsurface resistivity dewandel et al 2006 robineau et al 2007 sharp discontinuities in resistivity seen at the nzuga figs 3 and a11 12 and lk site figs 4 and a13 are interpreted as zones of normal faulting and correspond to the mlemu and kitope faults respectively these discontinuities also correspond with zones of faulting identified from the dem see section 2 2 3 and are typically bounded on the downthrown side with infill of transported clays i e layer b in figs 3 and 4 3 2 conceptual models based on the results and interpretation of the geoelectric data collected in the study area a series of local scale conceptual hydrogeological models of focused recharge at the nzuga lk chihanga and meya meya sites have been produced these are shown schematically in figs 2 5 respectively with interpreted borehole lithological data superimposed in black where available and focused pathways highlighted in dark blue these local scale models were then collated and in conjunction with borehole log information used to produce a 3d conceptual model of the recharge processes including diffuse processes in the makutapora wellfield shown in fig 6 based on these models we propose that the superficial transported deposits control recharge to the deeper bedrock aquifer system as follows f focused recharge pathways f1 ephemeral streams lose water into the underlying aquifer via sufficiently permeable intervening superficial deposits and or weathered bedrock material this potentially occurs at all study sites rates of recharge are likely controlled by the hydraulic properties of the underlying geology in addition to the stream flow frequency and the depth to the water table quichimbo et al 2020 the lithological characteristics of smectitic mbuga clays fig 4 and fig a1 4 suggest these have low matrix hydraulic conductivities of the order of 1e 10 ms 1 although that could be enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude if preferential flow pathways are prevalent crane et al 2015 timms et al 2018 conversely streams on the nzuga chihanga and meya meya sites figs 2 4 and 5 respectively directly overlie pedolitic soils which are assumed to be more hydraulically conductive the presence of thick layers of smectite clay rich saprolite underlying this pedolith at the nzuga and meya meya sites however would restrict flow f2 shallow permeable alluvial deposits collect ephemeral stream losses and runoff but due to the variable permeability of underlying materials this water is stored and slowly redistributed in the subsurface these shallow stores of water form local perched aquifer systems upstream of the mlemu fault in the nzuga site shindo 1990 and within pockets of thick alluvium in the overbank regions of the little kinyasungwe river at lk observed in the field by the authors such groundwater may flow slowly longitudinally downslope via connected alluvial ribbons to o et discharge back to the atmosphere via evaporation either directly where shallow enough or through transpiration from riparian vegetation o f2 a flow into the deeper bedrock aquifer via more permeable windows in the underlying superficial deposits or o f2 b flow into the deeper bedrock aquifer via highly permeable fractures or fault zones interconnected to the underlying aquifer system bense et al 2013 f3 overbank ephemeral stream flows find permeable recharge pathways long term stream stage and groundwater relationships suggest that anomalously large rainfall events and as such stream discharges associated with el niño events provide significant recharge to the makutapora wellfield seddon et al 2021 the little kingusygwe river the main ephemeral stream that channels surface runoff to the wellfield is often underlain by impermeable smectitic clays fig 3 however stream stage data indicate these large rainfall events lead to overbank flows and these flows may locate permeable pathways and faulted zones that bypass this impermeable clay and lead to greater groundwater recharge seddon et al 2021 this recharge pathway is similar to the results of lange 2005 who also found greater transmission losses with higher flow events attributed mainly to enhanced water losses in flooded overbank areas d diffuse recharge d1 rainfall sourced direct diffuse recharge occurs when soil moisture deficits are overcome or preferential flow pathways are activated through sufficiently permeable superficial deposits one previously described mechanism which may be prevalent on the interfluve areas is enhanced recharge in the vicinity of abundant abandoned termite mounds shindo 1990 d2 vertical leakage through smectite clay deposits may be induced or increased by pumping in the underlying aquifer although the matrix hydraulic conductivity of the smectite clays are likely to be very low see pathway f1 biological and weathering processes may compromise the hydraulic integrity of such deposits and allow more permeable syn depositional macropores to accumulate deep into the formation and act as preferential flow networks crane et al 2015 timms et al 2018 this recharge flux via the lowland mbuga clay may be low but should not be discounted as a potential pathway for diffuse recharge into the bedrock aquifer system as it may occur over substantial areas g redistribution of groundwater from recharge zones to the wellfield high transmissivities in the faulted bedrock allow for quick redistribution of groundwater within the fractured aquifer system capturing recharge from a wide range from the above pathways across the catchment pumping tests in the makutapora wellfield indicate transmissivities of 400 to 4000 m2 d 1 much greater than typical weathered crystalline rock aquifer systems that commonly range from 1 to 10 m2 d 1 bianchi et al 2020 these anomalously high transmissivities arise from extensive faulting within the saprock maurice et al 2019 nkotagu 1996 these fault systems in essence act as collectors for groundwater recharged and stored in the regolith and weathered zone from both focused and diffuse sources as described 3 3 discussion and implications in our study the use of ert has enabled a range of geometrical relationships to be defined among different geoelectric layers the use of outcrop observations and borehole log information has then enabled lithological interpretations to be made from the geoelectric layers at the meya meya site borehole information was not available and robust lithological interpretations from the ert data were only possible through the resistivity ranges of subsurface layers ascertained from the other study sites in the catchment together with outcrop observations within the streambed of the little kinyusungwe river at meya meya fig a1 as such the borehole logs and outcrop observations were critical to reducing the uncertainty in the conceptual models developed and caution should be applied when interpreting ert data in isolation in such environments our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the study site but to identify potential recharge typologies our conceptual models reveal several potential focused recharge pathways that are consistent with previous studies where residence time indicators have suggested local recharge at makutapora has a strong component of preferential flow following high intensity rainfall events hayashi and chiba 1994 maurice et al 2019 onodera et al 1995 senguji 1999 shindo 1990 and with the findings of taylor et al 2013a 2013b and cuthbert et al 2019b which demonstrated that recharge at makutapora occurs episodically following intensive precipitation on average two or three times each decade over the last 60 years this bias of recharge towards intensive precipitation has previously been indicated in hydrometric cuthbert et al 2019b taylor et al 2013b stable isotope banks et al 2020 jasechko and taylor 2015 vogel and van urk 1975 and modelling eilers et al 2007 studies in other semi arid areas as such as projected decreases in mean annual precipitation are thought to lead to decreases in groundwater recharge in drylands jiménez cisneros et al 2014 increases in episodic recharge from more intensive precipitation events may offset these projections however caution is needed in such interpretations in the absence of local data on the exact nature of the recharge mechanisms since local geological heterogeneity can in some cases lead to results that are contrary to this general expectation acworth et al 2020 the nzuga study site was specifically chosen to represent smaller headwater streams that drain upper pediplain regions into the wellfield depression although these streams drain only 25 of the catchment area into the wellfield depression our conceptual model from the nzuga site fig 3 indicates that these streams may activate a greater proportion of recharge pathways than even the larger little kinyasungwe river which is hypothesized to generate substantial recharge only in large precipitation events that lead to overbank flows see section 3 2 therefore while the little kinyasungwe river may be important in facilitating large recharge events it may be possible that smaller streams provide a proportion of recharge in years between larger events by slowly drip feeding recharge into the fault system as the population of dodoma and other cities in drylands are set to increase the demand for freshwater in the coming decades un 2017 it is possible that this increased abstraction may lead to increased recharge in the study area this may occur as increased pumping and subsequent drawdown leads to increased capture bredehoeft 2002 theis 1940 as the cone of depression reaches further out for example this may increase the subsurface storage available in areas of previously shallow water table thus activating new recharge pathways to collect recharge from an even wider area that may have otherwise been rejected this increased recharge is difficult to quantify however and future groundwater level monitoring at a wider range of distances from the wellfield may further elucidate the relative magnitude of diffuse recharge processes in our study site and its uncertain relationship to focused recharge we propose that our study site acts as an analogue for the geological and climatological conditions in many other parts of sub saharan africa 40 of which are also underlain by weathered crystalline aquifers macdonald et al 2012 these aquifers provide a vital source of reliable freshwater to over a quarter of a billion people in sub saharan africa macdonald et al 2008 taylor and tindimugaya 2011 and groundwater abstraction to supply domestic water is expected to increase dramatically in the region braune and xu 2010 taylor et al 2009 furthermore indirect recharge from ephemeral streams e g pathways f1 f2 a and f2 b described in section 3 2 are likely prevalent in dryland alluvial settings of large global extent where ephemeral streams comprise 80 of the dryland river network levick et al 2008 sabater and tockner 2009 and there is a growing body of literature using near surface geophysics to that highlight the importance transmission losses and groundwater recharge in such dryland systems e g callegary et al 2007 shanafield et al 2020 our study sites were chosen to represent a range of ephemeral stream geomorphologies observed in dryland regions sutfin et al 2014 excluding bedrock headwater channels which were difficult to access in our study region moreover our models are directly applicable to dryland areas dominated by smectite clay acworth and timms 2003 crane et al 2015 timms et al 2019 the presence of which is typical of dryland regions across the world in mafic geological contexts oakes and thorp 1951 accurate quantification of recharge in dryland settings remains a challenge with no widely applicable method currently available that can directly and accurately quantify the volume of rainwater that reaches the water table healy and scanlon 2010 scanlon et al 2002 shanafield and cook 2014 despite multiple lines of evidence villeneuve et al 2015 we believe our models provide a first step towards the quantification of recharge in drylands by shedding light on potential focused recharge pathways in the region which could be tested in the future using a variety of hydrogeological techniques for example soil moisture profiles placed proximal to areas of potential recharge have enabled the tracking of deeper infiltration through multiple layers of varying geological characteristics in hyper arid settings dahan et al 2008 temperature tracing has also been used with great success to quantify shallow surface groundwater interactions beneath ephemeral streams rau et al 2017 our models provide an informed physical basis for future 3d numerical modelling of groundwater flow by incorporating superficial geological structure turner et al 2015 and predicting responses to groundwater systems with variable geology to anthropogenic pressures and environmental change acworth et al 2020 further our study provides a basis for improved understanding and management of the groundwater system in the makutapora wellfield and opens the door for improved efficacy and implementation of managed aquifer recharge mar in the future by providing a physical basis for recharge in the region dillon et al 2019 4 conclusions few studies have made detailed observations of superficial geological structure in dryland regions the use of the ert method in conjunction with borehole logs and outcrop observations has enabled delineation of a variety of geometries and inter relationships of superficial geology at four sites in the makutapora wellfield tanzania these data have revealed lithologies and weathering profiles typical of tropical soils underlain by crystalline basement and permitted development of conceptual models that outline the role of superficial deposits in providing multiple potential pathways for focused groundwater recharge that bypass the low permeability smectite clay deposits that cover the wellfield these can be summarized as follows 1 superficial sand deposits act as collectors and stores that slowly feed recharge into zones of active faulting 2 these fault zones provide permeable pathways enabling greater recharge to occur and rapid redistribution of recharge 3 windows within layers of smectitic clay underlying ephemeral streams may provide pathways for focused recharge via transmission losses 4 overbank flooding during high intensity precipitation events that inundate a greater area of the catchment increases the probability of activating such permeable pathways our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the study site but does inform future monitoring at a more diverse range of locations within and peripheral to the makutapora wellfield that may further elucidate the relative magnitude of diffuse and focused recharge processes specifically further monitoring of smaller streams such is expected to understand better and estimate the overall water balance the conceptual models we have developed provide a first step for improved understanding of groundwater recharge in drylands by providing a physical basis for how superficial geology controls recharge pathways and processes these are critical to further understand and quantify for the purpose of improving groundwater management in response to climate and anthropogenic changes

conceptual hydrogeological models was produced and collated to generate a 3d conceptual model of groundwater recharge to the wellfield new hydrological insights for the region we propose that

climates the geometry and permeability of superficial deposits is known to moderate potential recharge to underlying bedrock aquifers griffiths et al 2011 misstear et al 2009 and local scale configurations of these deposits provide recharge pathways through high permeability layers cuthbert et al 2009 it is also likely that the structure and hydraulic properties of superficial geology play a crucial role in controlling surface groundwater interactions in drylands scanlon et al 2006 wheater et al 2010 for example marked temporal and spatial variability in the hydraulic conductivities of streambed and floodplain deposits can provide controls on surface groundwater interactions in dryland ephemeral stream systems costa et al 2012 dahan et al 2008 flinchum et al 2020 mccallum et al 2014 telvari et al 1998 wang et al 2017 further heterogeneities in the hydraulic properties and structure of superficial deposits have been hypothesised to influence the subsurface dynamics of groundwater recharge to deeper aquifers acworth et al 2020 rau et al 2017 few studies to date have made quantitative detailed observations of superficial geological structure in drylands to better understand the likely flowpaths and processes controlling groundwater recharge the objectives of this paper are thus to explore the potential physical basis for groundwater recharge by determining the geometry and inter relationships between superficial deposits underlying geology and fracture systems in the intensively monitored and pumped groundwater system of the makutapora wellfield in the little kinyasungwe river catchment of central tanzania this system comprises a weathered and fractured crystalline basement aquifer system that is overlain in part by low permeability smectitic clays and despite intensive groundwater abstraction is replenished on a decadal timescale by episodic recharge events taylor et al 2013b to accomplish this we conducted a series of geophysical investigations using electrical resistivity tomography ert and in conjunction with borehole data and field observations identified various geoelectrical structures and correlated these with interpreted subsurface lithology based on these findings we present a series of local and basin scale conceptual models that identify multiple potential recharge pathways illustrating how superficial geology may control focused recharge in the little kinyasungwe river catchment although our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the little kinyasungwe river catchment our conceptual models provide a first step in quantifying recharge in the study area in the future and we propose these models will be transferable to other dryland regions globally 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the makutapora wellfield situated within the little kinyasungwe river catchment fig 1 is underlain by the fractured crystalline basement of the dodoma craton in central tanzania kashaigili et al 2003 and is approximately 20 km north of the capital city dodoma the catchment occupies an area of 698 km2 upstream of the chihanga flow gauge located fig 1 at the catchment outlet and forms the upper section of the river wami basin shindo 1989 the climate is semi arid and characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons average air temperatures are 23 c with highs ranging from 26 5 c to 30 5 c in july october and lows from 13 6 c to 18 8 c in nov june wmo 2020 average annual precipitation is 550 mm at makutapora meteorological station fig 1 99 of which falls in a single wet season from december to april seddon 2019 taylor et al 2013b short lived observations in the catchment suggest that precipitation in the upland areas may be greater than on the floor of the catchment onodera et al 1995 seddon et al 2021 there have been several estimates of potential evapotranspiration in makutapora fawley 1958 kashaigili et al 2003 onodera et al 1995 shindo 1989 1990 the most recent being 2120 mm yr 1 based on 3 non consecutive years of data recorded between 2003 and 2006 at the makutapora meteorological station seddon 2019 the catchment is underlain by basement rocks comprised of precambrian synorogenic granites and migmatite biotite gneiss of the dodoma basement superterrane de pauw et al 1983 kabete et al 2012 ministry of water 1976 with more intrusive ultrabasic complexes of amphibolite and quartzo feldspathic gneisses with biotite outcropping within the wellfield and meya meya regions fig 1 metamorphosed rocks are also present in the region and amphibole schists crop out in a belt of inselbergs surrounding meya meya julian et al 1963 apart from outcrops at the topographic highs of the chenene hills kashaigili 2010 or along channels of ephemeral streams hayashi and chiba 1994 these basement rocks are generally covered by a deeply weathered regolith 50 100 m thick of fractured saprock saprolite and pedolitic products of neogene age at varying stages of chemical decomposition julian et al 1963 regolith composition varies throughout and is related to the mineralogy of the underlying parent rock the regolith is overlain by unconsolidated alluvial material consisting of detrital sands gravels and silts kashaigili et al 2003 nkotagu 1996 in the centre of the catchment and in the lowland areas of the wellfield depression the regolith is overlain by layers of black smectitic mbuga clay onodera et al 1995 such black smectitic clays often exist as valley infill in the rifted basins of central tanzania bianconi and borshoff 1984 these are also typical of other semi arid regions across the world in similar geological contexts oakes and thorp 1951 and have previously been associated with the presence of seasonal freshwater swamps in makutapora wade and oates 1938 tectonic activity associated with the manyara dodoma rift segment a branch of the east african rift system extending south across the dodoma craton dawson 2008 has left a complex network of faults in the study area these faults are expressed as linear features trending sw ne nw se across the topography of the region macheyeki et al 2008 as seen in fig 1 the main faults that cross the study area the mlemu and kitope form a natural nw boundary to the makutapora wellfield which is situated along a distinct fault bounded topographic lowland depression within the wider catchment and there is evidence of further faulting north of the catchment kabete et al 2012 the large scale discontinuities and dense fracture networks associated with faults such as the mlemu are the defining hydrogeological feature of makutapora giving rise to anomalously high transmissivities of 400 to 4000 m2d 1 within the wellfield and producing high well yields in boreholes proximal to the faults maurice et al 2019 rwebugisa 2008 the wellfield is presently the sole source of dodoma s municipal and industrial water supply and in 2016 supplied the city with an average of 50 000 m3 day 1 of freshwater duwasa 2017 groundwater abstraction in the wellfield has increased from 0 1 to 1 5 million m3 per month and despite having exceeded previous estimates of its maximum sustainable yield groundwater levels are currently higher than they were in the 1990s and roughly the same as they were prior to development seddon 2019 long term groundwater level data from the wellfield indicates that intensive groundwater abstraction is replenished on a decadal timescale by episodic recharge events during exceptional seasonal rainfalls associated with el niño events interrupting multi annual recessions in groundwater levels cuthbert et al 2019b kolusu et al 2019 taylor et al 2013b previous research in the catchment suggests that this episodic recharge is focused by way of ephemeral streams flowing over coarse grained soils within alluvial fans at the margins of the wellfield depression onodera et al 1995 shindo 1989 1990 diffuse recharge through the soil matrix or via soil macropores and fractures that bypass the soil matrix is also thought to occur within the catchment shindo 1989 1990 however it is not known what the relative contributions of diffuse and focused recharge are in this area nor is it addressed quantitatively in this study 2 2 geophysical methods 2 2 1 electrical resistance tomography data acquisition processing and inversion geophysical techniques have received increasing attention in recent years due to their non destructive character and ability to provide

e is defined as 1 e 100 ρ r ρ n ρ r ρ m negative apparent resistivity data points were removed and measurements with reciprocal errors greater than 5 were filtered out this filtered dataset was inverted using the res2dinv geotomo software algorithm loke 2001 a least squares data constraint was used that minimizes the error between the observed and calculated apparent resistivity values and a limit of 4 iterations was set to avoid model over fitting a robust model constraint incorporating topographic variations was selected over a least squared inversion constraint since it is known to better resolve sharp geological boundaries expected within the study area loke et al 2003 in this case it was important to delineate the boundaries between the superficial deposits in situ regolith and zones bounded by normal faulting inverted data are presented as geoelectric pseudosections edwards 1977 and used in the intepretation of geoelectric layers and subsurface lithology 2 2 2 intepretation of geoelectrical models due to the smoothing and non uniqueness inherent in fitting 3d geological structure to 2d resistivity models aizebeokhai and singh 2013 dahlin et al 2007 independent data were used to aid interpretation and to assist in identifying layer boundaries in the images boreholes with lithological data proximal to survey lines were collated from the tanzanian ministry of water in dodoma table a2 and superimposed onto these sections to correlate geoelectrical layers and lithological observations in addition field observations were used to constrain the resistivity ranges for superficial deposits observed at the ground surface sharp discontinuities seen in the geoelectrical sections were corroborated with field observations of faulted zones and regions of faulting inferred from analysing topographical data from strm 30 m dem of the study area nasa et al 2019 water content and temperature variations are known to affect subsurface resistivity brunet et al 2010 but these effects were not considered in the interpretation of geological layers since they are greatly outweighed by contrasts in resistivity due to lithological variation which are the focus of this study further geophysical surveys were undertaken in the middle of the dry season june july when variations in soil moisture content and temperature between the dates of individual surveys were minimal forward modelling using the res2dmod software loke 2002 was used to identify and rule out various unexpected features found in some of the inversions to decide whether they should be interpreted as true variations in subsurface resistivity firstly several inversions at the nzuga figs a4 9 12 lk fig a15 17 meya meya fig a18 and chihanga fig a19 sites show low resistivity zones underlying regions of high 250 ω m resistivity at the surface secondly we observe many sections at nzuga figs a9 11 and meya meya sites fig a19 which have decreasing resistivity with depth underlying shallower zones of 40 ω m resistivity see section 3 1 for further discussion using the field site profile characteristics of the nzuga 8 survey fig a10 a simplified two layer synthetic model of the subsurface was developed for the forward modelling exercise the top layer for the model was defined as 0 2 5 m with a resistivity of 40 ω m and the bottom layer from 2 5 to 30 m with a resistivity of 20 ω m fig a20 two regions 10 m wide and 3 m thick with high 1000 ω m resistivities were then added to the model to examine the effects of pockets of high resistivity material fig a21 the synthetic results indicate that these low resistivity features circled in black in fig a21 occur despite the attempts to minimise the number of iterations and are thus anomalous features further synthetic results indicate that sections with decreasing resistivity with depth were indeed true features that cannot be re created without adding decreasing resistivity layers with depth in our forward models 2 3 survey locations a total of 17 ert surveys were conducted in june and july 2019 at four locations within the study area these areas are shown in fig 1 and a map of survey lines at each study site are shown inset within figs 2 5 these locations were chosen to be representative of the various catchment areas that surround the wellfield as described for each site below three sites meya meya lk and chihanga are situated on the little kinyasungwe river which comprises 75 of the catchment area draining into the makutapora wellfield depression meya meya the furthest upstream survey site is located approximately 20 km upstream from the makutapora wellfield this location was chosen for one survey fig 6 and a18 to coincide with the long term stream gauge monitoring taking place at the site seddon et al 2021 this gauge measures the inflow of the little kinyasungwe river into the next downstream study site lk the purpose of surveys in this area is to provide geological context to streamflow patterns recorded here and the geological structure comprising upland pediplain areas that surround the wellfield shindo 1989 the site lk was chosen for 5 surveys figs a13 17 to constrain the geological configuration underneath the little kinyasungwe river as it enters the wellfield depression this site is bounded by the kitope fault to the east and is situated in a lowland area covered by mbuga clay and silts in seasons with particularly high precipitation these lowland regions can experience overland flow and inundation during the wet season fig a2 the chihanga site represents the furthest downstream survey site on the little kinyasungwe river and was chosen for one survey fig 5 and a19 like meya meya it was chosen to constrain the geological conditions as the stream exits the wellfield depression into the downstream hombolo basin the fourth site is in the vicinity of the ephemeral nzuga stream and lies on the north western edge of the wellfield this site was chosen for 10 surveys fig 2 and a3 12 the nzuga stream crosses the zanka and mbuga faults before terminating in the wellfield depression forming an alluvial fan spot gauging within the stream has shown that ephemeral streamflow does not always reach the depression and is instead thought to be lost by leakage from the stream channel into underlying and surrounding superficial deposits shindo 1990 such headwater channels sutfin et al 2014 are common throughout the region in the transition slopes between upland and lowland areas and comprises approximately 25 of the catchment area flowing into the catchment 3 results and discussion 3 1 geoelectric units integrating the results of the 17 ert surveys figs a3 19 with interpreted borehole log information table a2 and outcrop field observations fig a1 we defined five main geoelectrical units in the catchment and associated inferred lithologic properties and depositional settings as follows a deposits of coarse sand 250 ω m and silts 20 160 ω m b transported smectitic clays 10 ω m c cemented pedolitic soils 30 80 ω m d smectite rich saprolite 15 30 ω m e weathered saprock 110 450 ω m these layers correspond to the idealised weathering profile of tropical soils above crystalline basement rocks described in the literature dewandel et al 2006 fookes 1997 taylor and eggleton 2001 taylor and howard 1999 wright and burgess 1992 and fall within a corresponding range of resistivies for weathered products of mafic origin containing 2 1 clays established for similar geological provinces anudu et al 2014 barongo and palacky 1991 beauvais et al 1999 belle et al 2019 ritz et al 1999 robineau et al 2007 the presence or absence of the different layers in the profile varies from location to location in the study area which we interpret due to local variations in rock type and structure topography and rates of sediment erosion and deposition the topmost layer a comprises sand of variable grain sizes ranging from coarse to fine see fig a1 3c with resistivities 250 ω m set amongst silts with resistivities of 20 160 ω m sand is 0 5 4 m thick and is present but often discontinuous at all the study sites continuous 0 5 m thick layers of sand were directly observed within the dry streambeds of the nzuga figs a6 9 12 and little kinyasungwe river at meya meya fig a18 lk figs a15 17 and chihanga fig a19 thicker layers of sand are particularly prominent at the nzuga site where they exist as 1 4 m thick deposits in and around the banks of the nzuga figs a5 9 12 and smaller 1 2 m thick deposits in little kinyasungwe figs a15 17 owing to their channel like morphology we interpret these sand deposits as abandoned ephemeral stream channel alluvial deposits silts often surround these pockets of coarser alluvium and are most commonly present as 0 5 m thin layers in the soil profile surrounding the nzuga stream and little kinyasungwe river however thicker layers 1 2 m of these silts are particularly prominent in the alluvial fan of the nzuga figs 3 a3 4 and in the floodplain areas surrounding the little kinyasungwe river at the lk site figs 4 a13 15 17 and see fig a1 5 we interpret these as overbank deposits from the existing or previous ephemeral stream network very low resistivity layers 10 ω m b are present in every study area and in outcrops that correspond with layers of black smectitic mbuga clay see fig a1 4 this clay layer is 30 m thick in the downstream reaches of the nzuga stream where it meets the wellfield depression figs 3 and a3 5 and is also present as a 10 25 m thick layer below the little kinyasungwe river in the lk site figs 4 and a15 17 at the meya meya site this low resistivity clay exists only as an isolated 0 5 m thick layer 40 m away from the little kinyasungwe river fig a19 more prominent 0 5 1 m thick deposits of this clay can be seen surrounding but not underlying the little kinyasungwe river at the chihanga site figs 5 and a19 we interpret these clay layers to be transported basin infill deposits in the downthrown side of mlemu and kitope faults at the nzuga and lk sites respectively however at chihanga it is unclear whether these deposits are previous basin infill that has subsequently been cut through by the little kinyasungwe or more recent over bank deposits underlying these transported sediments we observe a zone of approximately 80 ω m c that crops out within the nzuga streambed see fig a1 3b but only upstream of the mlemu fault figs 3 and a11 12 as well as within the streambed of the little kinyasungwe river at both the meya meya see fig a1 1a and chihanga sites this comprises quartz grains 1 4 mm interbedded in a yellow to white fine sandy clay matrix see fig a1 3a at the nzuga figs 3 and a9 12 and meya meya fig a18 sites the resistivity of this zone further decreases with depth from approximately 80 to 30 ω m comprising the uppermost in situ cemented layer of our profile we interpret this layer as a pedolith or mottled zone with a decrease in resistivity with depth suggesting a transition from 1 1 pedogenic clays to increasing proportion of 2 1 clays as the weathering profile moves below the water table and approaches the saprolite pal et al 1989 this transition is common in tropical profiles and in the partial weathering of mafic materials where 2 1 clays typically persist below the water table where less intense weathering processes in the saturated zone inhibits weathering of 2 1 clays to kaolinite taylor and howard 1999 at shallower depths above the water table variable saturation can lead to micro weathering environments that create lower ph and higher complexing agent concentrations that accelerate weathering to kaolinite dennis et al 2009 taylor and howard 1999 at the nzuga and meya meya sites there is a continuous geoelectric gradient with depth as resistivities further decrease to 10 30 ω m figs a9 11 a18 based on interpretation of borehole data we interpret this as a gradual transition from lower pedolith to upper saprolite zone d with a resistivity of 10 30 ω m typical of saprolites of smectitic composition seen in similar geological provinces e g pal et al 1989 taboada and garcia 1999 robineau et al 2007 anudu et al 2014 this continuous decrease of resistivity is indicative of the boundary between the saprolite and pedolith known as the pedoplasmatic front which is characterized by a change in composition from pedogenic clays to more less weathered lithic material stoops et al 2018 however this 10 30 ω m saprolitic layer is non existent in the geoelectric sections at the lk and chihanga sites figs 4 and 5 instead zones of 60 80 ω m interpreted as indicative of 1 1 pedolitic clays described earlier are immediately underlain by higher resistivity zones of 110 450 ω m increasing with depth this higher resistivity zone has been interpreted as zones of fractured bedrock or saprock e and distinguished from 250 ω m zones of coarse sand seen at the surface or saprolite composed of more 1 1 clays using borehole lithological interpretations this wide resistivity range of 110 450 ω m is common in the saprock of crystalline basement systems because of the fractured nature of the saprock fractures filled with water or decomposed clays from the saprolite create inherent inhomogeneities in the subsurface resistivity dewandel et al 2006 robineau et al 2007 sharp discontinuities in resistivity seen at the nzuga figs 3 and a11 12 and lk site figs 4 and a13 are interpreted as zones of normal faulting and correspond to the mlemu and kitope faults respectively these discontinuities also correspond with zones of faulting identified from the dem see section 2 2 3 and are typically bounded on the downthrown side with infill of transported clays i e layer b in figs 3 and 4 3 2 conceptual models based on the results and interpretation of the geoelectric data collected in the study area a series of local scale conceptual hydrogeological models of focused recharge at the nzuga lk chihanga and meya meya sites have been produced these are shown schematically in figs 2 5 respectively with interpreted borehole lithological data superimposed in black where available and focused pathways highlighted in dark blue these local scale models were then collated and in conjunction with borehole log information used to produce a 3d conceptual model of the recharge processes including diffuse processes in the makutapora wellfield shown in fig 6 based on these models we propose that the superficial transported deposits control recharge to the deeper bedrock aquifer system as follows f focused recharge pathways f1 ephemeral streams lose water into the underlying aquifer via sufficiently permeable intervening superficial deposits and or weathered bedrock material this potentially occurs at all study sites rates of recharge are likely controlled by the hydraulic properties of the underlying geology in addition to the stream flow frequency and the depth to the water table quichimbo et al 2020 the lithological characteristics of smectitic mbuga clays fig 4 and fig a1 4 suggest these have low matrix hydraulic conductivities of the order of 1e 10 ms 1 although that could be enhanced by one or two orders of magnitude if preferential flow pathways are prevalent crane et al 2015 timms et al 2018 conversely streams on the nzuga chihanga and meya meya sites figs 2 4 and 5 respectively directly overlie pedolitic soils which are assumed to be more hydraulically conductive the presence of thick layers of smectite clay rich saprolite underlying this pedolith at the nzuga and meya meya sites however would restrict flow f2 shallow permeable alluvial deposits collect ephemeral stream losses and runoff but due to the variable permeability of underlying materials this water is stored and slowly redistributed in the subsurface these shallow stores of water form local perched aquifer systems upstream of the mlemu fault in the nzuga site shindo 1990 and within pockets of thick alluvium in the overbank regions of the little kinyasungwe river at lk observed in the field by the authors such groundwater may flow slowly longitudinally downslope via connected alluvial ribbons to o et discharge back to the atmosphere via evaporation either directly where shallow enough or through transpiration from riparian vegetation o f2 a flow into the deeper bedrock aquifer via more permeable windows in the underlying superficial deposits or o f2 b flow into the deeper bedrock aquifer via highly permeable fractures or fault zones interconnected to the underlying aquifer system bense et al 2013 f3 overbank ephemeral stream flows find permeable recharge pathways long term stream stage and groundwater relationships suggest that anomalously large rainfall events and as such stream discharges associated with el niño events provide significant recharge to the makutapora wellfield seddon et al 2021 the little kingusygwe river the main ephemeral stream that channels surface runoff to the wellfield is often underlain by impermeable smectitic clays fig 3 however stream stage data indicate these large rainfall events lead to overbank flows and these flows may locate permeable pathways and faulted zones that bypass this impermeable clay and lead to greater groundwater recharge seddon et al 2021 this recharge pathway is similar to the results of lange 2005 who also found greater transmission losses with higher flow events attributed mainly to enhanced water losses in flooded overbank areas d diffuse recharge d1 rainfall sourced direct diffuse recharge occurs when soil moisture deficits are overcome or preferential flow pathways are activated through sufficiently permeable superficial deposits one previously described mechanism which may be prevalent on the interfluve areas is enhanced recharge in the vicinity of abundant abandoned termite mounds shindo 1990 d2 vertical leakage through smectite clay deposits may be induced or increased by pumping in the underlying aquifer although the matrix hydraulic conductivity of the smectite clays are likely to be very low see pathway f1 biological and weathering processes may compromise the hydraulic integrity of such deposits and allow more permeable syn depositional macropores to accumulate deep into the formation and act as preferential flow networks crane et al 2015 timms et al 2018 this recharge flux via the lowland mbuga clay may be low but should not be discounted as a potential pathway for diffuse recharge into the bedrock aquifer system as it may occur over substantial areas g redistribution of groundwater from recharge zones to the wellfield high transmissivities in the faulted bedrock allow for quick redistribution of groundwater within the fractured aquifer system capturing recharge from a wide range from the above pathways across the catchment pumping tests in the makutapora wellfield indicate transmissivities of 400 to 4000 m2 d 1 much greater than typical weathered crystalline rock aquifer systems that commonly range from 1 to 10 m2 d 1 bianchi et al 2020 these anomalously high transmissivities arise from extensive faulting within the saprock maurice et al 2019 nkotagu 1996 these fault systems in essence act as collectors for groundwater recharged and stored in the regolith and weathered zone from both focused and diffuse sources as described 3 3 discussion and implications in our study the use of ert has enabled a range of geometrical relationships to be defined among different geoelectric layers the use of outcrop observations and borehole log information has then enabled lithological interpretations to be made from the geoelectric layers at the meya meya site borehole information was not available and robust lithological interpretations from the ert data were only possible through the resistivity ranges of subsurface layers ascertained from the other study sites in the catchment together with outcrop observations within the streambed of the little kinyusungwe river at meya meya fig a1 as such the borehole logs and outcrop observations were critical to reducing the uncertainty in the conceptual models developed and caution should be applied when interpreting ert data in isolation in such environments our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the study site but to identify potential recharge typologies our conceptual models reveal several potential focused recharge pathways that are consistent with previous studies where residence time indicators have suggested local recharge at makutapora has a strong component of preferential flow following high intensity rainfall events hayashi and chiba 1994 maurice et al 2019 onodera et al 1995 senguji 1999 shindo 1990 and with the findings of taylor et al 2013a 2013b and cuthbert et al 2019b which demonstrated that recharge at makutapora occurs episodically following intensive precipitation on average two or three times each decade over the last 60 years this bias of recharge towards intensive precipitation has previously been indicated in hydrometric cuthbert et al 2019b taylor et al 2013b stable isotope banks et al 2020 jasechko and taylor 2015 vogel and van urk 1975 and modelling eilers et al 2007 studies in other semi arid areas as such as projected decreases in mean annual precipitation are thought to lead to decreases in groundwater recharge in drylands jiménez cisneros et al 2014 increases in episodic recharge from more intensive precipitation events may offset these projections however caution is needed in such interpretations in the absence of local data on the exact nature of the recharge mechanisms since local geological heterogeneity can in some cases lead to results that are contrary to this general expectation acworth et al 2020 the nzuga study site was specifically chosen to represent smaller headwater streams that drain upper pediplain regions into the wellfield depression although these streams drain only 25 of the catchment area into the wellfield depression our conceptual model from the nzuga site fig 3 indicates that these streams may activate a greater proportion of recharge pathways than even the larger little kinyasungwe river which is hypothesized to generate substantial recharge only in large precipitation events that lead to overbank flows see section 3 2 therefore while the little kinyasungwe river may be important in facilitating large recharge events it may be possible that smaller streams provide a proportion of recharge in years between larger events by slowly drip feeding recharge into the fault system as the population of dodoma and other cities in drylands are set to increase the demand for freshwater in the coming decades un 2017 it is possible that this increased abstraction may lead to increased recharge in the study area this may occur as increased pumping and subsequent drawdown leads to increased capture bredehoeft 2002 theis 1940 as the cone of depression reaches further out for example this may increase the subsurface storage available in areas of previously shallow water table thus activating new recharge pathways to collect recharge from an even wider area that may have otherwise been rejected this increased recharge is difficult to quantify however and future groundwater level monitoring at a wider range of distances from the wellfield may further elucidate the relative magnitude of diffuse recharge processes in our study site and its uncertain relationship to focused recharge we propose that our study site acts as an analogue for the geological and climatological conditions in many other parts of sub saharan africa 40 of which are also underlain by weathered crystalline aquifers macdonald et al 2012 these aquifers provide a vital source of reliable freshwater to over a quarter of a billion people in sub saharan africa macdonald et al 2008 taylor and tindimugaya 2011 and groundwater abstraction to supply domestic water is expected to increase dramatically in the region braune and xu 2010 taylor et al 2009 furthermore indirect recharge from ephemeral streams e g pathways f1 f2 a and f2 b described in section 3 2 are likely prevalent in dryland alluvial settings of large global extent where ephemeral streams comprise 80 of the dryland river network levick et al 2008 sabater and tockner 2009 and there is a growing body of literature using near surface geophysics to that highlight the importance transmission losses and groundwater recharge in such dryland systems e g callegary et al 2007 shanafield et al 2020 our study sites were chosen to represent a range of ephemeral stream geomorphologies observed in dryland regions sutfin et al 2014 excluding bedrock headwater channels which were difficult to access in our study region moreover our models are directly applicable to dryland areas dominated by smectite clay acworth and timms 2003 crane et al 2015 timms et al 2019 the presence of which is typical of dryland regions across the world in mafic geological contexts oakes and thorp 1951 accurate quantification of recharge in dryland settings remains a challenge with no widely applicable method currently available that can directly and accurately quantify the volume of rainwater that reaches the water table healy and scanlon 2010 scanlon et al 2002 shanafield and cook 2014 despite multiple lines of evidence villeneuve et al 2015 we believe our models provide a first step towards the quantification of recharge in drylands by shedding light on potential focused recharge pathways in the region which could be tested in the future using a variety of hydrogeological techniques for example soil moisture profiles placed proximal to areas of potential recharge have enabled the tracking of deeper infiltration through multiple layers of varying geological characteristics in hyper arid settings dahan et al 2008 temperature tracing has also been used with great success to quantify shallow surface groundwater interactions beneath ephemeral streams rau et al 2017 our models provide an informed physical basis for future 3d numerical modelling of groundwater flow by incorporating superficial geological structure turner et al 2015 and predicting responses to groundwater systems with variable geology to anthropogenic pressures and environmental change acworth et al 2020 further our study provides a basis for improved understanding and management of the groundwater system in the makutapora wellfield and opens the door for improved efficacy and implementation of managed aquifer recharge mar in the future by providing a physical basis for recharge in the region dillon et al 2019 4 conclusions few studies have made detailed observations of superficial geological structure in dryland regions the use of the ert method in conjunction with borehole logs and outcrop observations has enabled delineation of a variety of geometries and inter relationships of superficial geology at four sites in the makutapora wellfield tanzania these data have revealed lithologies and weathering profiles typical of tropical soils underlain by crystalline basement and permitted development of conceptual models that outline the role of superficial deposits in providing multiple potential pathways for focused groundwater recharge that bypass the low permeability smectite clay deposits that cover the wellfield these can be summarized as follows 1 superficial sand deposits act as collectors and stores that slowly feed recharge into zones of active faulting 2 these fault zones provide permeable pathways enabling greater recharge to occur and rapid redistribution of recharge 3 windows within layers of smectitic clay underlying ephemeral streams may provide pathways for focused recharge via transmission losses 4 overbank flooding during high intensity precipitation events that inundate a greater area of the catchment increases the probability of activating such permeable pathways our study was not designed to quantitatively determine the relative proportions of diffuse and focused recharge in the study site but does inform future monitoring at a more diverse range of locations within and peripheral to the makutapora wellfield that may further elucidate the relative magnitude of diffuse and focused recharge processes specifically further monitoring of smaller streams such is expected to understand better and estimate the overall water balance the conceptual models we have developed provide a first step for improved understanding of groundwater recharge in drylands by providing a physical basis for how superficial geology controls recharge pathways and processes these are critical to further understand and quantify for the purpose of improving groundwater management in response to climate and anthropogenic changes

8182,study region denmark study focus artificial drainage systems can significantly improve water management in agricultural fields nonetheless they transport contaminants originating from fertilizers and pesticides threatening aquatic ecosystems determining the quantity of drainage discharge is an important factor for implementing constructed wetlands and other mitigation techniques in denmark tile drainage systems are present in more than 50 of the total agricultural area and the main objectives of this study were to i estimate the annual tile drainage discharge using machine learning algorithms and ii to assess the importance of predictor variables for the models data from 53 drainage stations and 25 predictor variables including precipitation percolation and geographic variables such as clay contents and elevation were used four machine learning models were used to predict annual drainage discharge new hydrological insights for the region random forest and cubist models demonstrated the best performance and the results highlighted the importance of cross validation predictor variable importance analysis showed that after precipitation percolation elevation and clay content had the largest effect on tile drainage discharge this work opens up for a better understanding of the effects of topographical and geological characteristics on tile drainage discharge proving that machine learning algorithms could be utilized as strong predictive models with a low complexity in the specific concept the developed models could be used for mapping tile drainage discharge in geographic space keywords drainage water modelling cross validation variable importance denmark 1 introduction artificial subsurface drainage has a huge impact on the hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment dynamics of agricultural systems blann et al 2009 in temperate climates with fine textured soils and semi arid regions with irrigated fields ayars et al 2006 tile drainage is a crucial water management system to control runoff prevent waterlogging and to increase water use efficiency on the other hand tile drainage affects both the quantity and the quality of water resources schilling et al 2012 nutrient losses and chemical remnants can either be transported through tile drains directly to surface water bodies such as lakes and rivers stenberg et al 2012 or be leached to the groundwater this fresh water contamination can threaten both human and ecosystem health kuzmanovski et al 2015 constructed wetlands are a means to eliminate excessive amounts of nitrogen from drainage water which makes use of natural nitrate reducing processes in a controlled environment messer et al 2017 these systems are mainly installed to reduce pollution from tile drainage water from agricultural fields or run off from industrial areas magmedov et al 1996 in order to design constructed wetlands with appropriate sizes it is necessary to quantify artificial drainage discharge physically based hydrological models have been developed either to estimate the drainage discharge or to include it as a component de schepper et al 2017 these models have a common use in academic research and may as well be used to evaluate various scenarios zia et al 2015 however they depend on numerous parameters and require calibration to individual areas basha et al 2008 which makes their application over large areas complicated and time consuming another disadvantage of these models is their foundation on conceptualization which leads to invalid predictions when new empirical data are introduced bredehoeft 2005 beside physically based models statistical approaches have been used to model and to predict state variables but there are only few studies specifically predicting tile drainage discharge by machine learning algorithms kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 this type of data driven modelling requires fewer parameters and can perform as an accurate estimation technique in the same way these models have proved to be flexible and robust enough for many regression applications park et al 2016 machine learning is related to computational statistics and is commonly used for predictions based on learning from historical relationships and trends in the data classification and regression trees cart are a frequently used form of machine learning models they work by searching through the predictor variables of a dataset to find the best split creating two groups of data the process is repeated for the resulting groups until a decision tree forms zia et al 2015 predicted drainage discharge using m5 decision trees on a 17 ha drained farmland in southern ireland predictions were carried out on a daily basis for a 12 month period they validated the suitability of a simplified discharge prediction model for implementation on a system with limited resources kuzmanovski et al 2015 evaluated machine learning models in predicting tile drainage discharge and surface runoff on an experimental site in la jaillière france using daily data from eleven fields including a reference field the dataset was based on meteorological measurements agricultural practices and crop management by comparing the results from these models with the performance of two physically based models they found an improvement in the tile drainage discharge predictions although machine learning models proved to be functional for the prediction of drainage discharge in the aforementioned studies the applicability and scalability of these models to larger areas and to different catchments was not investigated furthermore the parameter sets of both studies zia et al 2015 kuzmanovski et al 2015 were limited to the local management practices and hydrological time series lastly none of the studies assessed the importance of different resampling methods and how they could affect the predictions in the present study the performance of four machine learning algorithms were assessed for the prediction of annual tile drainage discharge random forest rf breiman 2001 cubist cb quinlan 1993 neural networks nn mcculloch and pitts 1943 and support vector machines svm cortes and vapnik 1995 machine learning algorithms have been widely used in different disciplines for the upscaling of the spatial predications xu et al 2021 luan et al 2020 shaeri karimi et al 2019 xu et al 2018 curry et al 2018 noi et al 2017 therefore we aim to assess two different resampling methods to test if the predictions could be extended to a larger scale with catchments of different sizes distributed in different regions furthermore we aim to compare their accuracy and to analyze and rank the importance of the predictor variables we expect that our results can be used for mapping of tile drainage discharge in geographic space 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area denmark is located in northern europe with a total area of 42 895 km2 of which 66 are used for agricultural purposes statistics denmark n d the climate is temperate with an approximate mean annual precipitation p of 770 mm the mean temperature is 7 7 c ranging from 1 5 c in january to 16 3 c in july the mean elevation is 31 m above sea level and the landscape is generally flat the geology divides denmark into two main areas an eastern part with loamy weichselian moraines and a western part with sandy glacial outwash plains and saalian moraines according to historical maps wetlands originally covered more than over 20 of the country but drainage activities during the 19th and 20th centuries have reduced their extent it has been estimated that about 50 of agricultural land in denmark is artificially drained mainly with tile drains møller et al 2018 2 2 hydrological data data from 53 drainage stations in different regions of denmark were used in this study fig 1 the stations included 18 newer stations established between 2012 and 2016 and 35 older stations established between 1971 and 2009 some of which are still running while others have been shut down hansen and pedersen 1975 hansen 1981 simmelsgaard 1994 grant et al 2010 kjær et al 2011 kjærgaard et al 2016 some data originates from ongoing unpublished drainage stations which have been established in relation to the monitoring of constructed wetlands other stations belong to the project idræn www idraen dk 2011 where data for some of the stations have been published hansen et al 2019a b varvaris et al 2018 2019 for 36 stations 68 drainage discharge q was measured on a daily basis but for 17 stations 32 data for q was only available on an annual basis considering that the main purpose of this study was to cover and represent the main geological regions in denmark and to generate models that could predict the q in the country scale at an annual resolution inclusion of the 17 stations with annual data only was essential therefore data from the other 36 stations were converted to annual values and the predictions were carried out on an annual basis based on the drain catchment area annual values were converted to a water height per year mm y 1 based on the period from july 1 to june 30 to incorporate a full hydrological year most of the old stations had available data for a range of 19 23 years whereas some of the new stations had data for only 1 5 years limiting the data to the stations with identical running years would have been ideal however this would have forced us to omit data from some areas as we aim to train models that can predict q over large areas it is important to include a large number of different locations therefore it was decided to use all historical data from the available stations q varied from zero to more than 1000 mm y 1 depending on the specific year or site the average q for all the stations was 165 mm y 1 the catchment sizes varied from 1 to 164 ha with a mean of 7 ha delineation of the individual catchments was based on the existing information of the position of the tile drains topography or a combination of both daily meteorological data air temperature global radiation relative humidity wind speed and precipitation p were measured either at the stations or the nearest available meteorological station daily p values were corrected using the correction factors from allerup and madsen 1979 and then summed up for the full hydrological year annual p varied from around 300 mm and up to 1500 mm depending on the specific year of the specific site fig 2 a shows the linear relationship between the annual values of q and p showing an r2 of 0 49 summer precipitation events are the major uncertainty in the relation between p and q although large precipitation events may occur throughout the year q dominates mainly during the winter half year precipitation events during the summer half year may not necessarily contribute to q due to the high evapotranspiration as well as the high storage capacity of the soil during this period considering this uncertainty and the fact that daily meteorological values were available for all sites it was decided to model the percolation out of the root zone db net precipitation based on the simple water balance model evacrop olesen and heidmann 1990 this relatively simple tipping bucket model is driven by input of daily p and reference evapotranspiration et0 and is parameterized according to the given crop and soil type db was modelled on a daily basis and was summed up for the entire hydrological year as annual values because the information regarding the management and crops at all catchments was not available all calculations of transpiration in the evacrop model were made for winter wheat as this is the most commonly sown crop in denmark none of the catchments used in this study were irrigated using evacrop modelled db instead of p as a predictor will disregard any possible discharge during the summer where large precipitation events seldom trigger any significant discharge events since most of the precipitation is lost to evapotranspiration fig 2b shows the relation between p and db a fairly good relation between the two parameters exist showing an r2 of 0 71 the linear relationship between the annual values of q and db shows an r2 of 0 46 fig 2c fig 3 gives an overview of the average relations between q and db for the individual drained catchments used in our analysis for some catchments q is much larger than the actual amount of water generated within the drained catchment db for other catchments only a small fragment of db contributes to q fig 4 demonstrates the contribution of daily db to daily q over a 2 year period from 1990 to 1992 fig 4a and from 2006 to 2008 fig 4b for one of the long term running stations with available daily data 2 3 topographical and geological data in addition to p and db 25 different variables were used to predict q table 1 considering the interdependency of db and p fig 2 these two were used separately as predictors in combinations with the remaining predictors this resulted in two scenarios scenario 1 where p was used in combination with the other predictor variables and scenario 2 where db was used instead of p in combination with the other 25 predictor variables table 1 twenty of the predictor variables were extracted from existing national maps topographical variables were all calculated by møller et al 2018 based on a digital elevation model dem fig 5 a with a 30 4 meter grid size aggregated from a dem with a 1 6 meter resolution adhikari et al 2013 mapped clay contents for the upper two meters of the soil in seven depth intervals at a resolution of 30 4 m these were aggregated by møller et al 2018 producing maps of clay contents in four depth intervals clay a clay b clay c clay d table 1 fig 5b in addition to the values extracted from the maps clay contents in the a b and c horizons were obtained from a national soil profile database ddjd using values from the nearest excavated soil profile in the database ddjd ler a ddjd ler b ddjd ler c table 1 depth to groundwater gwd model table 1 fig 5c was first calculated based on a hydrological model at a 500 meter resolution henriksen et al 2012 and then the groundwater table was resampled to a 30 4 meter resolution using bilinear interpolation møller et al 2018 the topographic wetness index twi table 1 fig 5d that quantifies topographic controls of basic hydrological processes schillaci et al 2015 was derived through interactions of fine scale landform coupled to the up gradient contributing land surface area by møller et al 2018 in order to assess the relationship between all 25 predictor variables spearman s rank correlation test was carried out between all the variables in the form of a correlogram and the results are presented in the supplementary material supplementary fig 1 2 4 models and measures of accuracy in the present study the performance of four machine learning algorithms were assessed for the prediction of annual tile drainage discharge random forest rf breiman 2001 cubist cb quinlan 1993 neural networks nn mcculloch and pitts 1943 and support vector machines svm cortes and vapnik 1995 rf is an ensemble approach based on cart breiman 2001 it trains a number of regression trees from bootstrap samples drawn from the original dataset and averages the results from each tree for the final prediction the algorithm furthermore introduces randomness into the splitting process by selecting the optimal split from a random subset of the predictor variables in each split cb is a rule based regression technique which does not retrieve one final model like rf but a set of rules related to multivariate models walton 2008 a specific set of predictor variables will choose an actual prediction model based on the rule that best fits the predictors as a commercial and proprietary product cb has less documentation than rf however kuhn et al 2013 ported it into r which increased its applications and it is currently widely used as a regression method chen et al 2019 shortridge et al 2016 worland et al 2018 an nn model is similar to a non linear regression with the exception that nn can handle large numbers of variables an nn consists nodes organized in several layers including an input layer containing the predictor variables an output layer containing the target variable and one or more hidden layers the nodes in each layer receive information from the previous layer transform it and send it to the next layer an svm is a supervised machine learning algorithms for two group classification problems svms work by finding the combinations of variables including pseudo variables obtained by transforming the other variables which optimally split a pair of classes svms can also be used as a regression method maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm maximal margin in addition to the four machine learning algorithms we also tested the accuracies of models based on stepwise multiple linear regression to benchmark the machine learning models against a conventional statistical method we used the train function from the r package caret for training models and adjusting the hyperparameters of each model kuhn 2008 for rf train adjusts the parameter mtry which controls the number of randomly selected predictor variables available for each split for cb train adjusts the number of boosting iterations used by the algorithm and the number of neighbours used for nearest neighbour corrections to the rules model for svm the function adjusts the cost of constraints violation and for nn it adjusts the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the parameter for weight decay for all models we tested only the default parameter combinations provided by the train function we used cross validation to adjust the parameters of the models and to assess their predictive accuracy cross validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a given dataset for both algorithms two different cross validation schemes were applied in order to assess the ability of each model to predict q at a new location leave station out lso cross validation was performed in this procedure all the measurements from one station were removed from the training data and a model was trained to predict q for the excluded case this process was repeated for all stations and the resulting accuracy was calculated the stations used in this study are highly clustered in geographic space fig 1 spatial autocorrelation may therefore affect the accuracy estimated with lso as stations may show similar patterns only because they are located close to each other therefore another cross validation procedure leave cluster out lco was used as well in which clusters of stations were left out instead of individual stations to achieve this clusters were generated based on the distances between the stations stations located less than 10 km from each other were grouped into clusters this procedure resulted in 23 clusters with 1 10 stations each these clusters were used for cross validation in total eight models were trained for scenario 1 and 2 respectively as all four algorithms cb rf nn and svm were trained with leave station out lso and leave cluster out lco cross validation the predictive accuracies of the models were calculated as the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pearson s r2 1 r m s e i 1 n q m i q o i 2 n where qmi is the predicted value of annual tile drain discharge for the i th instance qoi is the observed or measured value of annual tile drain discharge for the i th instance and n is the total number of instances 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed tile drain discharges 3 r 2 1 r s s t s s where rss is the sum of squares of residuals and tss is the total sum of squares furthermore to analyze the effect of the predictor variables in each model the predictor variable importance was extracted from all models variable importance for rf was calculated as the increase in the mean squared error mse of predictions as a result of one variable being permuted 4 m s e 1 n i 1 n f i y i 2 where n is the number of data points fi is the value returned by the model and yi is the actual value for the data point i the function varimp in the r package caret kuhn 2008 was used to calculate variable importance for all models for rf variable importance is measured as the increase in mse caused by perturbing that variable for cb nn and svm variable importance is a linear combination of the usage of each variable in the rule conditions and the linear regression models the measures were scaled to 100 for the most important predictor variable in each model 3 results 3 1 model accuracy for both scenarios cb and rf demonstrated the best performance among all eight models table 2 figs 6 and 7 between the two cross validation methods lso resulted in higher accuracies than lco for all the models table 2 figs 6 and 7 however the difference was generally smaller for the cb and rf models the accuracies of the models in the two scenarios were generally similar except for nn table 2 figs 6 and 7 the highest accuracies were achieved with lso for cb in scenario 1 with an rmse of 66 mm and nse of 0 77 table 2 considering the small differences between the performance of rf and cb pillai s trace test was carried out between the predictions to determine if the difference is significant results indicated that the predictions achieved with rf and cb in lso cross validation are significantly different and therefore performance of the cb lso could be considered as the best among all models on the other hand there was no significant difference measured between the lco predictions of cb and rf meanwhile svm lso model demonstrated a higher accuracy than the nn models and the svm lco models benchmarking showed that for lso only cb and rf yielded higher accuracies than the linear model table 3 however for lco all models except svm had a higher accuracy than the linear model this shows that the machine learning models had their largest advantage over linear models when accuracies were measured by lco cross validation the purpose of using two different cross validation schemes was to test how useful the models would be for predicting q across larger areas lso is likely to represent the predictive accuracies for the models at new locations without previous measurements however due to the highly clustered locations of the stations it is also likely that lso best represents predictive accuracy within a relatively short distance 10 km from the nearest station with measurements lco is more likely to represent accuracies for areas more than 10 km from the nearest station the results therefore show that predictive accuracy decreases as the distance from the nearest station increases based on the assessments on the performance of the four algorithms in both scenarios cb and rf were selected for further evaluations of the predictor variable importance 3 2 predictor variable importance of cb and rf models results of cb and rf models trained for scenario 1 indicated that p had the largest effect on the prediction of q fig 8 similarly in the cb and rf models trained for scenario 2 percolation db had the largest effect on the predicted q fig 9 for all models in both scenarios the analyses showed that elevation dem followed p and db as the second most important predictor variable and that the clay contents in the depth interval 100 200 cm were the third most important variable the multi resolution index of valley bottom flatness mrvbf was in most cases the fourth most important variable with the only exception of the cb models in scenario 2 where it was the 16th most important variable instead in this case the clay contents in the depth interval 0 30 cm ddjd ler a were the fourth most important variable in all cases the most important variables in the rf models were generally much more important than the other variables however for the cb models the differences between the most important variables and the other variables were smaller in the most accurate model for both scenarios cb lso a small range of dem values within a small sample size could cause a clustering bias this effect might replace other relevant patterns therefore to assess the effect of excluding dem the cb lso models in both scenarios were run without elevation and results were compared the accuracy of the models did not indicate of any change and similar measures to the previous runs were obtained table 4 with elevation excluded from the models the most important predictor variables after p and db were clay d for scenario 1 fig 10 a and horizontal distance to the channel hdtochn for scenario 2 fig 10b both of these predictor variables also had a high importance in the models using elevation as a predictor variable figs 8 and 9 the results mainly show the adaptive behavior of machine learning models when an important predictor variable is missing the algorithms can to some extent use other correlated predictor variables to act as proxies for example valley depth and vertical distance to channel can in some cases act as proxies for elevation due to the correlation between the variables supplementary fig 1 4 discussion similar studies predicting discharge with machine learning models developed their models at catchment scale for time series using daily meteorological data agricultural practices and crop management as predictor variables kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 these studies used 10 fold cross validation to evaluate the robustness of their predictions however in our study we used two different cross validation methods to test if the predictions could be extended to a larger scale with catchments of different sizes distributed in different regions along with precipitation p percolation of the root zone db was modelled using a simple water balance model evacrop i this way we were able to make comparisons between two different scenarios the first scenario 1 used measured p in combination with the other variables the second scenario 2 used modelled db instead in combination with the other variables taking advantage of the existing information on daily precipitation for all sites focusing on the relation between the climatic inputs p or db important information can be obtained for the relation between p and q fig 2a the regression line intercepts the x axis at a value of 449 mm this value can be regarded as a general offset value from where q is initiated in general the annual p value must exceed this number before any q is generated at the outlet for a given catchment for the relation between db and q fig 2c the regression line intercepts the origin since db is a measure of the amount of water leaving the root zone going directly into the tile drains or contributing to the groundwater recharge as seen modelled db is in general closely related to measured p and q fig 2b and c taking into account only the amount of water flowing directly toward the drains or continuing as groundwater recharge db we expected that the correlation between annual values of db and q compared to p and q would perform better however the two correlations performed almost equally r2 0 49 and 0 46 respectively fig 2a and c the effect of using modelled db to predict q is expected to be especially pronounced during the summer half year since only a minor part of p will infiltrate out of the root zone due to a high evapotranspiration fig 4 on the other hand during the winter half year where the evapotranspiration is low we expected that most p would contribute to q or to the groundwater recharge instead of being lost to evapotranspiration fig 4 our relatively simple point based model concept does not take into account more regional groundwater flow processes as also pointed out by hansen et al 2019a 2019b the generation of tile drain discharge may to a high degree also be controlled by the deeper geology and therefore also to the more regional groundwater flow processes tile drain discharge is therefore not necessary only based on local water generated from the precipitation generated above the tile drained catchment only but may also be generated by a contribution of regional groundwater coming from outside the catchment this could somewhat explain the outliers in the predictions of rf and cb models where the predicted q is much lower than the measured q for specific years at some stations which is not explained by p or db figs 6 and 7 this is also supported by the ratio between q and db fig 3 ratios of q db larger than one for some stations is probably a reflection of a major contribution of regional groundwater adding to the locally generated tile drain discharge on the other hand q db lower than one probably indicates that the tile drain water is mainly generated locally with only a minor fraction coming from regionally generated groundwater fig 3 showing the distribution of q db for the studied catchment is therefore an indication of the complex flow processes within the individual catchments also illustrating the variable nature of tile drainage flow the relatively poor performance of the relation between db and q might be related to the weakness of the relatively simple evacrop tipping bucket model which does not account for the extraction of water from deeper soil layers due to a rising groundwater table also the transition from the relatively dry summer half year to the wetter winter half year might be difficult to simulate using a simple model where water transport basically is driven by gravitational forces only the poor performance of the relation between db or p and q may also be caused by other factors such as uncertainties in the determination of the tile drained catchments inactive drain pipes in the field or uncertainties in the meteorological inputs and the measurement of q a number of different spatial variables were used as predictors to test if it is possible to predict q based on spatially variable geophysical characteristics of the different sites in the few similar studies kuzmanovski et al 2015 rasouli et al 2012 zia et al 2015 the study area was either one specific catchment or few fields or catchments very close to each other this means that the spatial characteristics were relatively similar being able to train machine learning models on different catchments in different locations enabled us to make use of different geographical characteristics as predictor variables the accuracy of the models and the importance of predictor variables were compared for both scenarios the accuracies of rf and cb were quite similar and substantially higher than the accuracies of nn and svm the lack of accuracy for nn algorithms is most likely due to the inclusion of one or more redundant predictor variables unlike decision tree algorithms nn algorithms can be vulnerable to redundancies for example beucher et al 2017 showed that nn models yielded higher accuracies after the removal of redundant predictor variables in a similar way identification and elimination of redundant variables could increase the accuracy of nn models in this study the advantage of svm models is that they require only minimal parameter adjustment while the disadvantages include the requirements of a gaussian function for each instance of the training set which increases training time and results in performance degradation on very large datasets with thousands of instances as in this case on the other hand the accuracies obtained with lso cross validation were higher than the accuracies obtained with lco highest accuracies were achieved by leave station out cross validated cubist model cb lso in both scenarios this shows that the models reliably predict discharge for locations close to existing drainage stations benchmarking against a linear model for lso cb and rf yielded higher accuracies while for lco all models except svm had a higher accuracy than the linear model some of the disadvantages of linear regression relative to machine learning are that i they are only applicable to linear solutions which are rare in real life scenarios ii they rely on the assumption that the input residuals are always normal distributed and iii their application requires that the input features are mutually independent furthermore with increased distances between the drainage stations the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables decreases significantly this could explain the poor performance of the lco linear model which has the second lowest accuracy among all the trained models decision tree models rf and cb support non linearity and complex interactions and they are generally robust towards correlated predictor variables and redundancies therefore the higher accuracies achieved by rf and cb in both cross validation techniques compared to lm is expected the overall results achieved with lco showed that the models are less reliable for predicting q for locations that are far from the nearest drainage station the comparison of result from the two scenarios showed slightly higher accuracies in scenario 1 which indicates that using p as the main hydrological parameter would suffice for achieving accurate predictions and the db did not improve the model performance this was also observed in the correlation between the raw data fig 2 the main reason for this is probably the uncertainty in parameterizing the evacrop model furthermore the present study considered q for an entire hydrological year and the influence of individual precipitation events may therefore have minor importance relative to overall trends on an annual basis logically both p and db were the most important predictor variable in each scenario hereafter dem was the second most important predictor where q was directly related to p or db fig 2a and b the relation between q and the dem was more ambiguous fig 11 despite the scattering of the data lowest values of q was seen for elevations at around 30 40 m increasing up to an elevation of 80 m however the data also showed a tendency of increasing values of q at elevation lower than 30 m this showed that topography can have an effect on discharge which p or db do not account for the observed pattern is most likely a combination of several effects firstly higher elevations even in a relatively flat country as denmark receive more precipitation which would increase q also the highest elevated areas of denmark normally relate to morainic loamy soils which typically have typically dense clay illuviated b horizons at drain depth generating a secondary groundwater table enforcing q in addition to this evacrop does not account for surface flow lower elevations are likely to receive additional water from upslope positions although in a minor extent this could increase the q considering that the 1 dimensional evacrop was used to model db this predictor variable does not account for topography the position of the tile drained field in the landscape will definitely have an effect on the division of q in locally or regionally generated tile drain water as discussed earlier it was expected that dem derived indices such as twi or sagawi table 1 would describe the contribution of water in the tile drains more accurately and therefore supposed to be important predictor variables both indices aim to describe the hydrological flow paths in the landscape and should be able to identify areas with a high contribution of water flowing to the drains however the two variables were only amongst the 10 most important variables in the rf models in rf lco in scenario 2 twi was one of the 10 most important variables and in the other rf models sagawi was one of the top 10 most important variables on the other hand the elevation was the second most important predictor variable for all models this indicates that the position in the landscape has an effect on q the low importance of the derived topographical indices might be related to the fact that the indices can vary considerably within the individual drained catchments or that other factors such a heterogeneous underlying geology has a high impact on the overall flow pattern on the other hand other dem derived variables such as valley depth valldepth vertical distance to the nearest waterbody vdtochn horizontal distance to the nearest waterbody hdtochn and downhill gradient to the nearest waterbody slptochn were all amongst the 10 most important variables it was also expected that the clay content in the soil especially the clay content in the lower horizons below tile drain depths would have an effect on q a high clay content in the subsoil below the drainage depth can favor the formation of a secondary groundwater table which contributes to the q during winter consequently the clay contents in the subsoil are logically an important predictor variable in nearly all the models inputs from a detailed geological groundwater model would most likely have improved the performance of our models however such a detailed model does not exist for denmark although the groundwater is an important resource for drinking water the danish national water resource model the dk model højberg et al 2013 is a spatially distributed groundwater surface water model that quantifies water fluxes at a national scale however the dk model is aggregated to a relatively coarse 500 500 m grid which is insufficient for describing the complex water flow path ways in the relatively small tile drained catchments in this study furthermore a detailed description of the subsurface geology does not exists at this scale this probably also explains why the depth to the groundwater from the dk model gwd model was not amongst the 10 most important predictor variables in any of the models figs 8 9 and 10 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool which could estimate annual tile drainage discharge q on a large scale with a relatively low complexity four different machine learning models random forest rf and cubist cb neural networks nn and support vector machines svm were applied on a relatively big dataset containing measured q and 25 predictor variables the predictive models were trained on multiple years of data from 53 drainage stations distributed all over denmark and cross validated with two different methods to analyze which hydrological parameters provided the most accurate prediction two scenarios were defined using precipitation p scenario 1 and percolation db scenario 2 in combination with 25 other predictor variables the best results were achieved by leave station out lso cross validated cb in scenario 1 where p was used as the hydrological parameter r2 rmse and nse of both cb and rf models benchmarked against a linear model indicated a good predictive accuracy based on the hydrological modelling standards the poorest results were achieved by nn models in both scenarios the lso svm model showed a higher accuracy than the lco svm however also much lower than the cb and rf models instead of physically based models that require numerous parameters machine learning models could perform as strong predictive tools to quantify q and to understand its relationship to topographical and geological characteristics following p elevation and clay contents below tile drain depth were the most important predictor variables furthermore considering the distribution of stations the cross validation method has a large effect on estimates of model accuracies in this study we aimed at incorporating the most important predictors available as spatial data however we believe that a future study should use a different model conceptualization to fully integrate the variation of the predictors at the drainage catchment scale we have considered this point for the soil profile properties but a new study should take an approach that systematically considers variation within the catchment for all predictor variables this would guarantee that the spatial variability in a larger area is accounted for thereby providing a higher modelling accuracy finally despite a few shortcomings in the model especially related to the interaction between locally and regionally generated groundwater in the tile drains it could be used for mapping annual tile drainage

8182,study region denmark study focus artificial drainage systems can significantly improve water management in agricultural fields nonetheless they transport contaminants originating from fertilizers and pesticides threatening aquatic ecosystems determining the quantity of drainage discharge is an important factor for implementing constructed wetlands and other mitigation techniques in denmark tile drainage systems are present in more than 50 of the total agricultural area and the main objectives of this study were to i estimate the annual tile drainage discharge using machine learning algorithms and ii to assess the importance of predictor variables for the models data from 53 drainage stations and 25 predictor variables including precipitation percolation and geographic variables such as clay contents and elevation were used four machine learning models were used to predict annual drainage discharge new hydrological insights for the region random forest and cubist models demonstrated the best performance and the results highlighted the importance of cross validation predictor variable importance analysis showed that after precipitation percolation elevation and clay content had the largest effect on tile drainage discharge this work opens up for a better understanding of the effects of topographical and geological characteristics on tile drainage discharge proving that machine learning algorithms could be utilized as strong predictive models with a low complexity in the specific concept the developed models could be used for mapping tile drainage discharge in geographic space keywords drainage water modelling cross validation variable importance denmark 1 introduction artificial subsurface drainage has a huge impact on the hydrology nutrient cycling and sediment dynamics of agricultural systems blann et al 2009 in temperate climates with fine textured soils and semi arid regions with irrigated fields ayars et al 2006 tile drainage is a crucial water management system to control runoff prevent waterlogging and to increase water use efficiency on the other hand tile drainage affects both the quantity and the quality of water resources schilling et al 2012 nutrient losses and chemical remnants can either be transported through tile drains directly to surface water bodies such as lakes and rivers stenberg et al 2012 or be leached to the groundwater this fresh water contamination can threaten both human and ecosystem health kuzmanovski et al 2015 constructed wetlands are a means to eliminate excessive amounts of nitrogen from drainage water which makes use of natural nitrate reducing processes in a controlled environment messer et al 2017 these systems are mainly installed to reduce pollution from tile drainage water from agricultural fields or run off from industrial areas magmedov et al 1996 in order to design constructed wetlands with appropriate sizes it is necessary to quantify artificial drainage discharge physically based hydrological models have been developed either to estimate the drainage discharge or to include it as a component de schepper et al 2017 these models have a common use in academic research and may as well be used to evaluate various scenarios zia et al 2015 however they depend on numerous parameters and require calibration to individual areas basha et al 2008 which makes their application over large areas complicated and time consuming another disadvantage of these models is their foundation on conceptualization which leads to invalid predictions when new empirical data are introduced bredehoeft 2005 beside physically based models statistical approaches have been used to model and to predict state variables but there are only few studies specifically predicting tile drainage discharge by machine learning algorithms kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 this type of data driven modelling requires fewer parameters and can perform as an accurate estimation technique in the same way these models have proved to be flexible and robust enough for many regression applications park et al 2016 machine learning is related to computational statistics and is commonly used for predictions based on learning from historical relationships and trends in the data classification and regression trees cart are a frequently used form of machine learning models they work by searching through the predictor variables of a dataset to find the best split creating two groups of data the process is repeated for the resulting groups until a decision tree forms zia et al 2015 predicted drainage discharge using m5 decision trees on a 17 ha drained farmland in southern ireland predictions were carried out on a daily basis for a 12 month period they validated the suitability of a simplified discharge prediction model for implementation on a system with limited resources kuzmanovski et al 2015 evaluated machine learning models in predicting tile drainage discharge and surface runoff on an experimental site in la jaillière france using daily data from eleven fields including a reference field the dataset was based on meteorological measurements agricultural practices and crop management by comparing the results from these models with the performance of two physically based models they found an improvement in the tile drainage discharge predictions although machine learning models proved to be functional for the prediction of drainage discharge in the aforementioned studies the applicability and scalability of these models to larger areas and to different catchments was not investigated furthermore the parameter sets of both studies zia et al 2015 kuzmanovski et al 2015 were limited to the local management practices and hydrological time series lastly none of the studies assessed the importance of different resampling methods and how they could affect the predictions in the present study the performance of four machine learning algorithms were assessed for the prediction of annual tile drainage discharge random forest rf breiman 2001 cubist cb quinlan 1993 neural networks nn mcculloch and pitts 1943 and support vector

et al 2019 xu et al 2018 curry et al 2018 noi et al 2017 therefore we aim to assess two different resampling methods to test if the predictions could be extended to a larger scale with catchments of different sizes distributed in different regions furthermore we aim to compare their accuracy and to analyze and rank the importance of the predictor variables we expect that our results can be used for mapping of tile drainage discharge in geographic space 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area denmark is located in northern europe with a total area of 42 895 km2 of which 66 are used for agricultural purposes statistics denmark n d the climate is temperate with an approximate mean annual precipitation p of 770 mm the mean temperature is 7 7 c ranging from 1 5 c in january to 16 3 c in july the mean elevation is 31 m above sea level and the landscape is generally flat the geology divides denmark into two main areas an eastern part with loamy weichselian moraines and a western part with sandy glacial outwash plains and saalian moraines according to historical maps wetlands originally covered more than over 20 of the country but drainage activities during the 19th and 20th centuries have reduced their extent it has been estimated that about 50 of agricultural land in denmark is artificially drained mainly with tile drains møller et al 2018 2 2 hydrological data data from 53 drainage stations in different regions of denmark were used in this study fig 1 the stations included 18 newer stations established between 2012 and 2016 and 35 older stations established between 1971 and 2009 some of which are still running while others have been shut down hansen and pedersen 1975 hansen 1981 simmelsgaard 1994 grant et al 2010 kjær et al 2011 kjærgaard et al 2016 some data originates from ongoing unpublished drainage stations which have been established in relation to the monitoring of constructed wetlands other stations belong to the project idræn www idraen dk 2011 where data for some of the stations have been published hansen et al 2019a b varvaris et al 2018 2019 for 36 stations 68 drainage discharge q was measured on a daily basis but for 17 stations 32 data for q was only available on an annual basis considering that the main purpose of this study was to cover and represent the main geological regions in denmark and to generate models that could predict the q in the country scale at an annual resolution inclusion of the 17 stations with annual data only was essential therefore data from the other 36 stations were converted to annual values and the predictions were carried out on an annual basis based on the drain catchment area annual values were converted to a water height per year mm y 1 based on the period from july 1 to june 30 to incorporate a full hydrological year most of the old stations had available data for a range of 19 23 years whereas some of the new stations had data for only 1 5 years limiting the data to the stations with identical running years would have been ideal however this would have forced us to omit data from some areas as we aim to train models that can predict q over large areas it is important to include a large number of different locations therefore it was decided to use all historical data from the available stations q varied from zero to more than 1000 mm y 1 depending on the specific year or site the average q for all the stations was 165 mm y 1 the catchment sizes varied from 1 to 164 ha with a mean of 7 ha delineation of the individual catchments was based on the existing information of the position of the tile drains topography or a combination of both daily meteorological data air temperature global radiation relative humidity wind speed and precipitation p were measured either at the stations or the nearest available meteorological station daily p values were corrected using the correction factors from allerup and madsen 1979 and then summed up for the full hydrological year annual p varied from around 300 mm and up to 1500 mm depending on the specific year of the specific site fig 2 a shows the linear relationship between the annual values of q and p showing an r2 of 0 49 summer precipitation events are the major uncertainty in the relation between p and q although large precipitation events may occur throughout the year q dominates mainly during the winter half year precipitation events during the summer half year may not necessarily contribute to q due to the high evapotranspiration as well as the high storage capacity of the soil during this period considering this uncertainty and the fact that daily meteorological values were available for all sites it was decided to model the percolation out of the root zone db net precipitation based on the simple water balance model evacrop olesen and heidmann 1990 this relatively simple tipping bucket model is driven by input of daily p and reference evapotranspiration et0 and is parameterized according to the given crop and soil type db was modelled on a daily basis and was summed up for the entire hydrological year as annual values because the information regarding the management and crops at all catchments was not available all calculations of transpiration in the evacrop model were made for winter wheat as this is the most commonly sown crop in denmark none of the catchments used in this study were irrigated using evacrop modelled db instead of p as a predictor will disregard any possible discharge during the summer where large precipitation events seldom trigger any significant discharge events since most of the precipitation is lost to evapotranspiration fig 2b shows the relation between p and db a fairly good relation between the two parameters exist showing an r2 of 0 71 the linear relationship between the annual values of q and db shows an r2 of 0 46 fig 2c fig 3 gives an overview of the average relations between q and db for the individual drained catchments used in our analysis for some catchments q is much larger than the actual amount of water generated within the drained catchment db for other catchments only a small fragment of db contributes to q fig 4 demonstrates the contribution of daily db to daily q over a 2 year period from 1990 to 1992 fig 4a and from 2006 to 2008 fig 4b for one of the long term running stations with available daily data 2 3 topographical and geological data in addition to p and db 25 different variables were used to predict q table 1 considering the interdependency of db and p fig 2 these two were used separately as predictors in combinations with the remaining predictors this resulted in two scenarios scenario 1 where p was used in combination with the other predictor variables and scenario 2 where db was used instead of p in combination with the other 25 predictor variables table 1 twenty of the predictor variables were extracted from existing national maps topographical variables were all calculated by møller et al 2018 based on a digital elevation model dem fig 5 a with a 30 4 meter grid size aggregated from a dem with a 1 6 meter resolution adhikari et al 2013 mapped clay contents for the upper two meters of the soil in seven depth intervals at a resolution of 30 4 m these were aggregated by møller et al 2018 producing maps of clay contents in four depth intervals clay a clay b clay c clay d table 1 fig 5b in addition to the values extracted from the maps clay contents in the a b and c horizons were obtained from a national soil profile database ddjd using values from the nearest excavated soil profile in the database ddjd ler a ddjd ler b ddjd ler c table 1 depth to groundwater gwd model table 1 fig 5c was first calculated based on a hydrological model at a 500 meter resolution henriksen et al 2012 and then the groundwater table was resampled to a 30 4 meter resolution using bilinear interpolation møller et al 2018 the topographic wetness index twi table 1 fig 5d that quantifies topographic controls of basic hydrological processes schillaci et al 2015 was derived through interactions of fine scale landform coupled to the up gradient contributing land surface area by møller et al 2018 in order to assess the relationship between all 25 predictor variables spearman s rank correlation test was carried out between all the variables in the form of a correlogram and the results are presented in the supplementary material supplementary fig 1 2 4 models and measures of accuracy in the present study the performance of four machine learning algorithms were assessed for the prediction of annual tile drainage discharge random forest rf breiman 2001 cubist cb quinlan 1993 neural networks nn mcculloch and pitts 1943 and support vector machines svm cortes and vapnik 1995 rf is an ensemble approach based on cart breiman 2001 it trains a number of regression trees from bootstrap samples drawn from the original dataset and averages the results from each tree for the final prediction the algorithm furthermore introduces randomness into the splitting process by selecting the optimal split from a random subset of the predictor variables in each split cb is a rule based regression technique which does not retrieve one final model like rf but a set of rules related to multivariate models walton 2008 a specific set of predictor variables will choose an actual prediction model based on the rule that best fits the predictors as a commercial and proprietary product cb has less documentation than rf however kuhn et al 2013 ported it into r which increased its applications and it is currently widely used as a regression method chen et al 2019 shortridge et al 2016 worland et al 2018 an nn model is similar to a non linear regression with the exception that nn can handle large numbers of variables an nn consists nodes organized in several layers including an input layer containing the predictor variables an output layer containing the target variable and one or more hidden layers the nodes in each layer receive information from the previous layer transform it and send it to the next layer an svm is a supervised machine learning algorithms for two group classification problems svms work by finding the combinations of variables including pseudo variables obtained by transforming the other variables which optimally split a pair of classes svms can also be used as a regression method maintaining all the main features that characterize the algorithm maximal margin in addition to the four machine learning algorithms we also tested the accuracies of models based on stepwise multiple linear regression to benchmark the machine learning models against a conventional statistical method we used the train function from the r package caret for training models and adjusting the hyperparameters of each model kuhn 2008 for rf train adjusts the parameter mtry which controls the number of randomly selected predictor variables available for each split for cb train adjusts the number of boosting iterations used by the algorithm and the number of neighbours used for nearest neighbour corrections to the rules model for svm the function adjusts the cost of constraints violation and for nn it adjusts the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the parameter for weight decay for all models we tested only the default parameter combinations provided by the train function we used cross validation to adjust the parameters of the models and to assess their predictive accuracy cross validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a given dataset for both algorithms two different cross validation schemes were applied in order to assess the ability of each model to predict q at a new location leave station out lso cross validation was performed in this procedure all the measurements from one station were removed from the training data and a model was trained to predict q for the excluded case this process was repeated for all stations and the resulting accuracy was calculated the stations used in this study are highly clustered in geographic space fig 1 spatial autocorrelation may therefore affect the accuracy estimated with lso as stations may show similar patterns only because they are located close to each other therefore another cross validation procedure leave cluster out lco was used as well in which clusters of stations were left out instead of individual stations to achieve this clusters were generated based on the distances between the stations stations located less than 10 km from each other were grouped into clusters this procedure resulted in 23 clusters with 1 10 stations each these clusters were used for cross validation in total eight models were trained for scenario 1 and 2 respectively as all four algorithms cb rf nn and svm were trained with leave station out lso and leave cluster out lco cross validation the predictive accuracies of the models were calculated as the root mean square error rmse the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pearson s r2 1 r m s e i 1 n q m i q o i 2 n where qmi is the predicted value of annual tile drain discharge for the i th instance qoi is the observed or measured value of annual tile drain discharge for the i th instance and n is the total number of instances 2 n s e 1 i 1 n q m i q o i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where q o is the mean of observed tile drain discharges 3 r 2 1 r s s t s s where rss is the sum of squares of residuals and tss is the total sum of squares furthermore to analyze the effect of the predictor variables in each model the predictor variable importance was extracted from all models variable importance for rf was calculated as the increase in the mean squared error mse of predictions as a result of one variable being permuted 4 m s e 1 n i 1 n f i y i 2 where n is the number of data points fi is the value returned by the model and yi is the actual value for the data point i the function varimp in the r package caret kuhn 2008 was used to calculate variable importance for all models for rf variable importance is measured as the increase in mse caused by perturbing that variable for cb nn and svm variable importance is a linear combination of the usage of each variable in the rule conditions and the linear regression models the measures were scaled to 100 for the most important predictor variable in each model 3 results 3 1 model accuracy for both scenarios cb and rf demonstrated the best performance among all eight models table 2 figs 6 and 7 between the two cross validation methods lso resulted in higher accuracies than lco for all the models table 2 figs 6 and 7 however the difference was generally smaller for the cb and rf models the accuracies of the models in the two scenarios were generally similar except for nn table 2 figs 6 and 7 the highest accuracies were achieved with lso for cb in scenario 1 with an rmse of 66 mm and nse of 0 77 table 2 considering the small differences between the performance of rf and cb pillai s trace test was carried out between the predictions to determine if the difference is significant results indicated that the predictions achieved with rf and cb in lso cross validation are significantly different and therefore performance of the cb lso could be considered as the best among all models on the other hand there was no significant difference measured between the lco predictions of cb and rf meanwhile svm lso model demonstrated a higher accuracy than the nn models and the svm lco models benchmarking showed that for lso only cb and rf yielded higher accuracies than the linear model table 3 however for lco all models except svm had a higher accuracy than the linear model this shows that the machine learning models had their largest advantage over linear models when accuracies were measured by lco cross validation the purpose of using two different cross validation schemes was to test how useful the models would be for predicting q across larger areas lso is likely to represent the predictive accuracies for the models at new locations without previous measurements however due to the highly clustered locations of the stations it is also likely that lso best represents predictive accuracy within a relatively short distance 10 km from the nearest station with measurements lco is more likely to represent accuracies for areas more than 10 km from the nearest station the results therefore show that predictive accuracy decreases as the distance from the nearest station increases based on the assessments on the performance of the four algorithms in both scenarios cb and rf were selected for further evaluations of the predictor variable importance 3 2 predictor variable importance of cb and rf models results of cb and rf models trained for scenario 1 indicated that p had the largest effect on the prediction of q fig 8 similarly in the cb and rf models trained for scenario 2 percolation db had the largest effect on the predicted q fig 9 for all models in both scenarios the analyses showed that elevation dem followed p and db as the second most important predictor variable and that the clay contents in the depth interval 100 200 cm were the third most important variable the multi resolution index of valley bottom flatness mrvbf was in most cases the fourth most important variable with the only exception of the cb models in scenario 2 where it was the 16th most important variable instead in this case the clay contents in the depth interval 0 30 cm ddjd ler a were the fourth most important variable in all cases the most important variables in the rf models were generally much more important than the other variables however for the cb models the differences between the most important variables and the other variables were smaller in the most accurate model for both scenarios cb lso a small range of dem values within a small sample size could cause a clustering bias this effect might replace other relevant patterns therefore to assess the effect of excluding dem the cb lso models in both scenarios were run without elevation and results were compared the accuracy of the models did not indicate of any change and similar measures to the previous runs were obtained table 4 with elevation excluded from the models the most important predictor variables after p and db were clay d for scenario 1 fig 10 a and horizontal distance to the channel hdtochn for scenario 2 fig 10b both of these predictor variables also had a high importance in the models using elevation as a predictor variable figs 8 and 9 the results mainly show the adaptive behavior of machine learning models when an important predictor variable is missing the algorithms can to some extent use other correlated predictor variables to act as proxies for example valley depth and vertical distance to channel can in some cases act as proxies for elevation due to the correlation between the variables supplementary fig 1 4 discussion similar studies predicting discharge with machine learning models developed their models at catchment scale for time series using daily meteorological data agricultural practices and crop management as predictor variables kuzmanovski et al 2015 zia et al 2015 these studies used 10 fold cross validation to evaluate the robustness of their predictions however in our study we used two different cross validation methods to test if the predictions could be extended to a larger scale with catchments of different sizes distributed in different regions along with precipitation p percolation of the root zone db was modelled using a simple water balance model evacrop i this way we were able to make comparisons between two different scenarios the first scenario 1 used measured p in combination with the other variables the second scenario 2 used modelled db instead in combination with the other variables taking advantage of the existing information on daily precipitation for all sites focusing on the relation between the climatic inputs p or db important information can be obtained for the relation between p and q fig 2a the regression line intercepts the x axis at a value of 449 mm this value can be regarded as a general offset value from where q is initiated in general the annual p value must exceed this number before any q is generated at the outlet for a given catchment for the relation between db and q fig 2c the regression line intercepts the origin since db is a measure of the amount of water leaving the root zone going directly into the tile drains or contributing to the groundwater recharge as seen modelled db is in general closely related to measured p and q fig 2b and c taking into account only the amount of water flowing directly toward the drains or continuing as groundwater recharge db we expected that the correlation between annual values of db and q compared to p and q would perform better however the two correlations performed almost equally r2 0 49 and 0 46 respectively fig 2a and c the effect of using modelled db to predict q is expected to be especially pronounced during the summer half year since only a minor part of p will infiltrate out of the root zone due to a high evapotranspiration fig 4 on the other hand during the winter half year where the evapotranspiration is low we expected that most p would contribute to q or to the groundwater recharge instead of being lost to evapotranspiration fig 4 our relatively simple point based model concept does not take into account more regional groundwater flow processes as also pointed out by hansen et al 2019a 2019b the generation of tile drain discharge may to a high degree also be controlled by the deeper geology and therefore also to the more regional groundwater flow processes tile drain discharge is therefore not necessary only based on local water generated from the precipitation generated above the tile drained catchment only but may also be generated by a contribution of regional groundwater coming from outside the catchment this could somewhat explain the outliers in the predictions of rf and cb models where the predicted q is much lower than the measured q for specific years at some stations which is not explained by p or db figs 6 and 7 this is also supported by the ratio between q and db fig 3 ratios of q db larger than one for some stations is probably a reflection of a major contribution of regional groundwater adding to the locally generated tile drain discharge on the other hand q db lower than one probably indicates that the tile drain water is mainly generated locally with only a minor fraction coming from regionally generated groundwater fig 3 showing the distribution of q db for the studied catchment is therefore an indication of the complex flow processes within the individual catchments also illustrating the variable nature of tile drainage flow the relatively poor performance of the relation between db and q might be related to the weakness of the relatively simple evacrop tipping bucket model which does not account for the extraction of water from deeper soil layers due to a rising groundwater table also the transition from the relatively dry summer half year to the wetter winter half year might be difficult to simulate using a simple model where water transport basically is driven by gravitational forces only the poor performance of the relation between db or p and q may also be caused by other factors such as uncertainties in the determination of the tile drained catchments inactive drain pipes in the field or uncertainties in the meteorological inputs and the measurement of q a number of different spatial variables were used as predictors to test if it is possible to predict q based on spatially variable geophysical characteristics of the different sites in the few similar studies kuzmanovski et al 2015 rasouli et al 2012 zia et al 2015 the study area was either one specific catchment or few fields or catchments very close to each other this means that the spatial characteristics were relatively similar being able to train machine learning models on different catchments in different locations enabled us to make use of different geographical characteristics as predictor variables the accuracy of the models and the importance of predictor variables were compared for both scenarios the accuracies of rf and cb were quite similar and substantially higher than the accuracies of nn and svm the lack of accuracy for nn algorithms is most likely due to the inclusion of one or more redundant predictor variables unlike decision tree algorithms nn algorithms can be vulnerable to redundancies for example beucher et al 2017 showed that nn models yielded higher accuracies after the removal of redundant predictor variables in a similar way identification and elimination of redundant variables could increase the accuracy of nn models in this study the advantage of svm models is that they require only minimal parameter adjustment while the disadvantages include the requirements of a gaussian function for each instance of the training set which increases training time and results in performance degradation on very large datasets with thousands of instances as in this case on the other hand the accuracies obtained with lso cross validation were higher than the accuracies obtained with lco highest accuracies were achieved by leave station out cross validated cubist model cb lso in both scenarios this shows that the models reliably predict discharge for locations close to existing drainage stations benchmarking against a linear model for lso cb and rf yielded higher accuracies while for lco all models except svm had a higher accuracy than the linear model some of the disadvantages of linear regression relative to machine learning are that i they are only applicable to linear solutions which are rare in real life scenarios ii they rely on the assumption that the input residuals are always normal distributed and iii their application requires that the input features are mutually independent furthermore with increased distances between the drainage stations the linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables decreases significantly this could explain the poor performance of the lco linear model which has the second lowest accuracy among all the trained models decision tree models rf and cb support non linearity and complex interactions and they are generally robust towards correlated predictor variables and redundancies therefore the higher accuracies achieved by rf and cb in both cross validation techniques compared to lm is expected the overall results achieved with lco showed that the models are less reliable for predicting q for locations that are far from the nearest drainage station the comparison of result from the two scenarios showed slightly higher accuracies in scenario 1 which indicates that using p as the main hydrological parameter would suffice for achieving accurate predictions and the db did not improve the model performance this was also observed in the correlation between the raw data fig 2 the main reason for this is probably the uncertainty in parameterizing the evacrop model furthermore the present study considered q for an entire hydrological year and the influence of individual precipitation events may therefore have minor importance relative to overall trends on an annual basis logically both p and db were the most important predictor variable in each scenario hereafter dem was the second most important predictor where q was directly related to p or db fig 2a and b the relation between q and the dem was more ambiguous fig 11 despite the scattering of the data lowest values of q was seen for elevations at around 30 40 m increasing up to an elevation of 80 m however the data also showed a tendency of increasing values of q at elevation lower than 30 m this showed that topography can have an effect on discharge which p or db do not account for the observed pattern is most likely a combination of several effects firstly higher elevations even in a relatively flat country as denmark receive more precipitation which would increase q also the highest elevated areas of denmark normally relate to morainic loamy soils which typically have typically dense clay illuviated b horizons at drain depth generating a secondary groundwater table enforcing q in addition to this evacrop does not account for surface flow lower elevations are likely to receive additional water from upslope positions although in a minor extent this could increase the q considering that the 1 dimensional evacrop was used to model db this predictor variable does not account for topography the position of the tile drained field in the landscape will definitely have an effect on the division of q in locally or regionally generated tile drain water as discussed earlier it was expected that dem derived indices such as twi or sagawi table 1 would describe the contribution of water in the tile drains more accurately and therefore supposed to be important predictor variables both indices aim to describe the hydrological flow paths in the landscape and should be able to identify areas with a high contribution of water flowing to the drains however the two variables were only amongst the 10 most important variables in the rf models in rf lco in scenario 2 twi was one of the 10 most important variables and in the other rf models sagawi was one of the top 10 most important variables on the other hand the elevation was the second most important predictor variable for all models this indicates that the position in the landscape has an effect on q the low importance of the derived topographical indices might be related to the fact that the indices can vary considerably within the individual drained catchments or that other factors such a heterogeneous underlying geology has a high impact on the overall flow pattern on the other hand other dem derived variables such as valley depth valldepth vertical distance to the nearest waterbody vdtochn horizontal distance to the nearest waterbody hdtochn and downhill gradient to the nearest waterbody slptochn were all amongst the 10 most important variables it was also expected that the clay content in the soil especially the clay content in the lower horizons below tile drain depths would have an effect on q a high clay content in the subsoil below the drainage depth can favor the formation of a secondary groundwater table which contributes to the q during winter consequently the clay contents in the subsoil are logically an important predictor variable in nearly all the models inputs from a detailed geological groundwater model would most likely have improved the performance of our models however such a detailed model does not exist for denmark although the groundwater is an important resource for drinking water the danish national water resource model the dk model højberg et al 2013 is a spatially distributed groundwater surface water model that quantifies water fluxes at a national scale however the dk model is aggregated to a relatively coarse 500 500 m grid which is insufficient for describing the complex water flow path ways in the relatively small tile drained catchments in this study furthermore a detailed description of the subsurface geology does not exists at this scale this probably also explains why the depth to the groundwater from the dk model gwd model was not amongst the 10 most important predictor variables in any of the models figs 8 9 and 10 5 conclusions the main objective of this study was to develop a predictive tool which could estimate annual tile drainage discharge q on a large scale with a relatively low complexity four different machine learning models random forest rf and cubist cb neural networks nn and support vector machines svm were applied on a relatively big dataset containing measured q and 25 predictor variables the predictive models were trained on multiple years of data from 53 drainage stations distributed all over denmark and cross validated with two different methods to analyze which hydrological parameters provided the most accurate prediction two scenarios were defined using precipitation p scenario 1 and percolation db scenario 2 in combination with 25 other predictor variables the best results were achieved by leave station out lso cross validated cb in scenario 1 where p was used as the hydrological parameter r2 rmse and nse of both cb and rf models benchmarked against a linear model indicated a good predictive accuracy based on the hydrological modelling standards the poorest results were achieved by nn models in both scenarios the lso svm model showed a higher accuracy than the lco svm however also much lower than the cb and rf models instead of physically based models that require numerous parameters machine learning models could perform as strong predictive tools to quantify q and to understand its relationship to topographical and geological characteristics following p elevation and clay contents below tile drain depth were the most important predictor variables furthermore considering the distribution of stations the cross validation method has a large effect on estimates of model accuracies in this study we aimed at incorporating the most important predictors available as spatial data however we believe that a future study should use a different model conceptualization to fully integrate the variation of the predictors at the drainage catchment scale we have considered this point for the soil profile properties but a new study should take an approach that systematically considers variation within the catchment for all predictor variables this would guarantee that the spatial variability in a larger area is accounted for thereby providing a higher modelling accuracy finally despite a few shortcomings in the model especially related to the interaction between locally and regionally generated groundwater in the tile drains it could be used for mapping annual tile drainage

fulfilling the huge demand of vegetable oils tapia et al 2021 lulc plays a vital role in earth atmosphere interactions that affecting water balance such as evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater within a river basin system therefore it is essential to quantify the effect of lulc changes on water balance so that a better water resources management plan can be formulated mapping of lulc pattern from time to time is essential as one of the major inputs in hydrological model to evaluate the lulc impacts on water balance at basin scale nilawar and waikar 2018 tamm et al 2018 tan et

cci lc map manually based on the field survey and google earth satellite images before applying into swat to simulate streamflow and fecal contamination of the selangor river basin nevertheless the authors didn t validate the modified map to the best of our knowledge an improvement of the esa cci lc maps for tropical basins that dominated with oil palm and rubber is missing and therefore this study is conducted to tackle this issue swat has been proven to be a reliable hydrological model to study the impacts of lulc changes on water balance in different river basins around the world gassman et al 2014 gassman and wang 2015 tan et al 2019a for instance schilling et al 2008 quantified the water balance changes of the raccoon river watershed in the west central iowa under several agricultural expansion scenarios for adaptive agricultural management decisions making tan et al 2015 reported the conversion of forest to oil palm in the johor river basin that located in the southern peninsular malaysia increased surface runoff and lateral flow significantly while decreased groundwater and percolation the muda river basin mrb is a transboundary tropical basin situated in the northern peninsular malaysia that supplies freshwater for irrigation industry and domestic usage to three northern states of pulau pinang kedah and perlis any dramatic lulc changes within the basin can affect the freshwater supply however quantification of the lulc changes on water balance of the mrb is still limited and need to be assessed annual oil palm dataset aopd from 2001 to 2016 generated by multiple satellite datasets xu et al 2020 can be potentially used to integrate with the esa cci lc maps so that the oil palm distribution can be better displayed hence we proposed a framework to improve the esa cci lc maps by merging with the aopd dataset this improvement procedure does not require much remote sensing knowledge from the hydrology modeler this study aims to evaluate the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the muda river basin mrb malaysia using the improved esa cci lc maps and swat three specific objectives of this study are 1 to improve and validate the esa cci lc maps over the mrb 2 to assess the spatio temporal lulc changes of the mrb 3 to evaluate the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the mrb the novelty of this study is generation of a higher level lulc classification from the esa cci lc products in oil palm dominated tropical regions the framework can be applied in other tropical basins particularly in indonesia and malaysia 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the mrb has a drainage area of 4119 76 km2 with the mean elevation of 245 95 m fig 1 the total river length of muda river is about 180 km during the 1985 2015 period mean maximum temperature of the mrb varied from 30 9 34 5 c and mean minimum temperature of 21 21 35 c tan et al 2019b besides that the basin receives around 2500 mm year annual precipitation with higher monthly precipitation amount from april to may and august to november mostly more than 250 mm month tan et al 2019b whereas a relative lower monthly precipitation amount less than 100 mm month is normally found in january and february sometime the drier condition may be extended to april or may due to the el niño effect tangang et al 2017 for example the mrb experienced a long dry spell from january to june in 2020 which resulted the water level of few dams within and surrounding of the basin hit their history lowest level there are two dams within the mrb the muda dam that located in the northern part of the basin and the beris dam in the middle part as shown in fig 1 the muda dam has the capacity of 160 million m3 and is mainly used for paddy irrigation purposes due to the low capacity water from muda dam is transferred to a larger dam called the pedu dam 1073 million m3 through the 6 8 km long saiong tunnel mada 2020 muda agricultural development authority mada is the authority involves in the management and operation of the muda dam the beris dam that completed in 2004 is managed by the department of irrigation and drainage did of malaysia with the capacity of 114 million m3 it has similar functions as the muda dam 2 2 swat inputs basic data for the swat setup include daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperature a digital elevation model dem a land use map and a soil map daily climate data from eleven well distributed climate stations for the period of 1995 2019 were collected from the malaysian meteorological department mmd fig 1 out of these stations only the muda dam butterworth and pusat pertanian charok padang stations contain daily maximum and minimum temperature data a 30 m dem was collected from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm while the food and agriculture organization fao soil map was used as the soil input in the swat modelling as mentioned earlier this study adopted the land use maps from the esa cci lc products where the details information will be described in the next section monthly streamflow data for the 2000 2019 period were obtained from did to calibrate and validate the swat model lastly major river networks within the mrb were digitized from the google earth pro satellite images to generate better river networks during the dem based river network formation produce 2 3 integration of the esa cci lc and aopd products the esa cci lc products were created for the purposes of climate modelling multiple satellite sensors such as medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar asar advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr project for on board autonomy vegetation proba v and satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt esa 2017 were used as the raw datasets in the products development the globcover unsupervised classification approach was used to classify 37 lulc classes based on the fao standard plummer et al 2017 the overall accuracy of the esa cci lc 2015 map is 75 4 when comparing to the globcover data esa 2017 the aopd dataset was developed to evaluate the oil palm expansion in indonesia and malaysia it is available at 100 m spatial resolution from 2001 to 2016 numerous satellite sensors including advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar alos 2 palsar 2 and modis data were used in the aopd formation xu et al 2020 basically the aopd development involves two major steps 1 oil palm expansion mapping using palsar and palsar 2 for the 2007 2010 and 2015 2016 periods and 2 updating the maps for the missing period of palsar from 2001 to 2006 and 2011 2014 using modis ndvi data with the break for additive season and trend bfast algorithm the overall accuracy of the aopd maps is 86 61 for the 2007 2010 and 2015 2016 and is 75 54 for the remaining periods xu et al 2020 we proposed a framework to integrate the esa cci lc and aopd products which required only some basic gis knowledge from the modeller since it can be done solely with the arcmap or qgis tool fig 2 shows the research process flowchart of this study the improved esa cci lc framework consists of seven major steps as follows step 1 download both the esa cci lc and aopd products from their webpage at http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php esa 2017 and https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3467071 xu et al 2020 respectively step 2 extract study area from both the products in this case the products were clipped with the mrb boundary delineated via the watershed delineation function within swat step 3 resample of aopd to the same spatial resolution of the esa cci lc maps step 4 reclass the esa cci lc classes based on the major lulc types that available in the study area for mrb 13 lulc classes from the original esa cci lc maps were reclassed to forest agricultural water urban and paddy step 5 check the spatial distribution of each lulc class with local maps or google earth pro satellite images particularly for agricultural and forest this step is essential to check whether the classes are correctly representing the actual situation based on our field survey and land use maps generated by the department of agricultural malaysia rubber and oil palm are the major crops in the mrb therefore the esa cci lc agricultural classes are mostly treated as oil palm and rubber step 6 apply the con tool under spatial analyst of arcmap to integrate both the products the raster pixel values of the esa cci lc maps that overlay with the oil palm distribution extracted from the aopd maps were reclassed as oil palm meanwhile the remaining agricultural pixels were reclassed as rubber step 7 validation of the improved esa cci lc maps using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient approaches with the samples extracted from the reference maps high resolution satellite images from google earth pro and or field survey accuracy assessment is a process of validating the classification effectiveness to represent the actual lulc foody 2010 lyons et al 2018 the accuracy assessment of the improved esa cci land cover maps is done by first selecting the training samples cross validating with the lulc maps and compute the error matrix as suggested by olofsson et al 2014 the first step in accuracy assessment is identifying major errors in the classification result through a rough visualization before a detailed planning of sampling designs a major constraint of the original esa cci lc maps in the mrb is hard to differentiate agricultural crops the classification system adopted in the esa cci land cover product followed the vegetation definitions established by food and agriculture fao that is challenging in terms of extracting more details tropical agricultural crops such as oil palm and rubber fig 3 referring to the fao vegetation glossary that we found in the website http www fao org 3 x0596e x0596e01n htm permanent rainfed crops herbaceous rainfed crops and mosaic cropland are different in terms of planting management however in our study area mrb these land cover class had mixed up with oil palm and rubber independent samples collected from ground observations are commonly used as the training and test set input for sampling designs wulder et al 2006 suggested that the sample size selection is dependent on the accepted minimum accuracy often determined based on probability theory of the binomial distribution a total of 60 random samples are selected for each class from the high resolution google earth satellite images for validating the improved esa cci lc maps of 2009 and 2016 while the 2002 lulc map produced by the department of agricultural malaysia was used to validate the 2001 map google earth historical satellite data is a least cost reliable source for ground truth sample collection as it can be zoomed into the ground view extent where it is almost similar to the in situ field observations with the local knowledge of the studied basin we managed to generate more accurate sampling points for the accuracy assessment accuracy assessment of the lulc products is done with the confusion matrix approach where a cross tabulation of the class label from the land cover product with the samples collected is computed foody 2015 from the confusion matrix the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient of the lulc products can be computed post hoc this method is commonly practiced for classification results as the processes can be conducted with excel and gis software the two indicators are derived as overall accuracy n o o f c o r r e c t l y m a t c h e d p i x e l s t o t a l n u m m b e r o f p i x e l s kappa coefficient κ p o p e 1 p e where p o is the relative observed agreement among the raters and p e is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement for each randomly observation cohen 1960 ĸ ranges between 0 1 where the value can be interpreted by poor agreement ĸ 0 20 fair agreement 0 20 ĸ 0 40 moderate agreement 0 40 ĸ 0 60 good agreement 0 60 ĸ 0 80 very good agreement 0 80 ĸ 1 00 thus the overall accuracy of above 70 and ĸ value of above 0 60 is considered as an acceptable result 2 4 swat model swat is a semi distributed model developed by the united states department of agricultural usda and the texas a m university via the routing outputs to the outlet and integration of the simulator for water resources in rural basins models arnold et al 1998 the model was designed to evaluate the impact of different management practices and human activities on water balance and river quality a continuous model improvement since 1990s made it as one of the most powerful tools to analyze soil water waste nexus mannschatz et al 2016 in addition the model has been proven to be reliable in representing water balance especially streamflow in different types of river basins around the world bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 tan et al 2020 2019a van griensven et al 2012 swat divides a basin into multiple sub basins and the sub basins are further divided into smaller hydrological response units which run all the calculations in this study the minimum value of threshold for dem based stream definition was set to 100 km2 which resulted a total of 27 sub basins then the slope classes were divided into five major classes of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and more than 40 the hru threshold for land use soil and slope was set to 10 which created a total of 326 hrus basic information of the muda and beris dams inserted to the swat model were obtained from the mada mada 2020 website and did respectively in addition average monthly water usage of mrb that collected from the national water balance management system nawabs did 2020 and a report prepared by van kalken 2017 were also added to the swat model during the swat simulation a five year warm up period from 1995 to 1999 was given to initiate the soil water condition then the remaining simulation was divided into the calibration 2000 2009 and validation 2010 2019 to evaluate the model performance before applying for the lulc impact assessment monthly streamflow data as mentioned in the section 2 2 were used for model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 within the swat cup tool was used to calibrate the swat model with 500 different parameters combinations abbaspour et al 2018 the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the capability of swat in simulating monthly streamflow in mrb the r2 and nse values range from 0 to 1 and to 1 respectively with 1 as the optimal value negative nse values indicate an unacceptable performance of the swat model based on the moriasi et al 2015 a very good model should obtain more than 0 85 for r2 and 0 8 for nse meanwhile the r2 and nse values for good model should be more than 0 75 and 0 65 respectively 2 5 land use scenario analysis we generated three historical lulc maps of 2001 2009 and 2016 using the improved esa cci lc framework that described in the section 2 3 although the esa cci lc maps are available every year from 1992 to 2018 but only three historical maps were generated due to the limited historical reference lulc maps for the accuracy assessment in addition lulc usually does not have significant changes within few years unless there are some land use policies that can cause abrupt the sudden changes furthermore land use maps at decadal intervals are commonly used in the lulc impact assessment chen et al 2020 githui et al 2009 therefore the improved 2001 2009 and 2016 maps should be sufficient for the assessment of lulc impact on water balance in the mrb table 1 lists five lulc scenarios generated from the improved esa cci lc maps these lulc scenarios consists of a baseline map that used to compare with the other four different lulc scenarios s1 scenario represents the actual lulc changes in mrb while the other three lulc scenarios indicate the oil palm expansion urban expansion and reforestation the swat landuse update tool swat lut developed by moriasi et al 2019 was used to update the land use changes module within swat swat lut is an improved version of swat2009 luc pai and saraswat 2011 which can only be used to activate the land use module of the swat 2009 version the swat lut tool is compatible with the swat 2012 revision 635 that used in this study moriasi et al 2019 recommended to activate the land use module for updating the lulc changes within swat using the swat lut before the calibration and validation fig 2 hence the swat model for the mrb was initially created using the baseline land use map then the lulc maps for the other four scenarios were incorporated into swat via the swat lut and stored to the respective swat project files next the baseline swat model was used in the calibration and validation once the swat performance reached to a certain acceptable level the same calibrated parameters were then transferred to other swat projects that have been activated with different lulc scenarios using the same calibrated parameters for all lulc scenarios swat projects is essential to minimize the parameter uncertainty in the modelling outputs 3 results 3 1 lulc analysis the accuracy assessment of all the three improved lulc maps are presented in table 2 in general the improved esa cci lc maps performed well with the overall accuracy values of 56 81 and 70 for 2001 2009 and 2016 respectively this may be caused by the limitations of the vegetation definitions in representing vegetation covers in a tropical region where the vegetation characteristics under the tropical climate may be different from other countries besides that the kappa coefficient of the original dataset is relatively low where the statistical test shown that the dataset is at fair agreement for its classification system the confusion matrix of the improved lulc map for 2016 is tabulated in table 3 based on the constructed confusion matrix the omission and commission errors for each of the designed land cover class are relatively high especially for urban class one of the reasons behind may be the dataset resolution factor that shall be considered during the sampling design the urban areas covered a relatively small portion of the mrb approximately 0 8 thus the samples collected from high resolution satellite data might fall onto the neighbouring pixels in the esa cci lc product basically about 50 of the mrb is covered with forest followed by rubber oil palm paddy water and urban fig 3 indicates some photos of the major land use types within the basin that taken during our field trip spatio temporal changes of lulc over the mrb for the periods of 2001 2009 and 2016 are shown in figs 4 and 5 there has been an increment in the oil palm plantations in the downstream mrb from 7 10 17 36 of the total basin size between 2001 and 2016 by contrast rubber that dominated in the western and southern parts of mrb were reduced from 34 93 in 2001 to 26 8 in 2016 paddy is distributed mainly near to the basin s outlet ranging from 2 04 to 3 03 meanwhile forest within mrb is mainly found in the northern and southeastern parts with a slight decrease in coverage area from 54 23 52 80 3 2 swat calibration and validation the swat calibration parameters adopted by zhang et al 2020a who tested the reliability of different climate data on swat outputs of the same basin were used in this study a recalibration of swat was conducted since the authors ran the model for a shorter period of 2009 2014 by contrast this study calibrated and validated swat for the periods of 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively table 4 indicates the ranges and optimal values of the swat calibration parameters for the mrb similarly scs runoff curve number f cn2 soil evaporation compensation factor esco and groundwater revap coefficient gw revap are among the most sensitive parameters in the mrb zhang et al 2020a the performance of swat in simulating monthly streamflow at four different streamflow gauges is presented in fig 6 overall swat had a good performance during the calibration as the r2 and nse values were above 0 7 at three streamflow gauges the only not satisfactory performance was found in the sg muda at jeniang station which may be due to the reservoir effects but it is still under an acceptable performance as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 during the validation period a very good swat performance can be found in the sg muda at ladang victoria station that nearest to the basin s outlet with the r2 and nse values of 0 83 and 0 86 respectively another outstanding performance of swat can be observed in the sg muda at jambatan syed omar station r2 0 84 and nse 0 72 swat performed better during the validation period in the sg muda at jeniang station r2 0 63 and nse 0 47 than the calibration period in contrast a poorer performance was at the sg ketil at kuala pegang station for the validation period which may be due to the underestimation of peak flows 3 3 streamflow changes under different lulc scenarios the effect of different lulc scenarios on the annual and monthly streamflow pattern at four streamflow stations and the basin s outlet for the period of 2000 2019 is shown in fig 7 the actual lulc oil palm expansion and urban expansion led to slightly changes of annual streamflow from 0 06 to 0 25 0 59 to 0 03 and 0 32 to 0 93 respectively table 5 shows only the oil palm expansion scenario resulted a reduction in annual streamflow whereas the other three scenarios increased the annual streamflow the reforestation scenario showed the largest increment in annual streamflow by 1 35 followed by the urban expansion 0 87 and actual 0 11 scenarios during the low flow period in january february and march monthly streamflow at the basin s outlet mostly decreased under all the evaluated lulc scenarios with the urban expansion scenario had the greatest reduction rate fig 7 e shows that monthly streamflow in january and february under the urban expansion scenario decreased by 8 45 6 72 m3s 1 and 8 24 5 52 m3s 1 respectively reforestation is the only scenario increased monthly streamflow during the swm season from may to september by 1 00 3 12 during the high flow or flood period the urban expansion scenario caused the highest increment in monthly streamflow of august september october and november by 4 42 7 27 5 64 and 3 77 respectively a similar situation can be found at the sg muda at jambatan syed omar and sg muda at ladang victoria stations this indicates that rapid urbanization could increase the flood risk in the downstream part of mrb 3 4 water balance changes under different lulc scenarios the response of annual surface runoff lateral flow groundwater evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield as simulated using the calibrated swat under four land use scenarios from 2000 2019 in the mrb is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 and table 5 that lulc had a larger impact on annual surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater as compared to evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield in this tropical basin annual surface runoff increased significantly by 34 51 when all oil palm plantations changed to urban area average monthly surface runoff also increased dramatically under the urban expansion scenario by 25 08 59 76 whereas the reforestation scenario reduced monthly surface runoff from 7 04 10 20 fig 9 a the findings indicated that forest plays an important role in mitigating the flood impact in the mrb on the other hand the actual lulc and agricultural expansion scenarios only have a minor impact on monthly surface runoff simulation which is less than 1 78 annual lateral flow decreased by 0 90 4 17 under all the lulc scenarios except for the reforestation scenario which had an opposite direction of increment around 15 24 table 5 fig 9 b shows monthly lateral flow under the reforestation scenario increased from 12 75 to 17 00 respectively meanwhile the urban expansion scenario caused a reduction in monthly lateral flow between 2 90 and 5 38 overall the findings indicated that water movement within soil is largely affected by the types of lulc decreases of annual lateral flow under the actual lulc and oil palm expansion scenarios could be due to the water consumption of oil palm is higher than rubber hardanto et al 2017 oil palm absorbs more water within soil since its fibrous root system can spread over 25 m horizontally and 6 m vertically jourdan et al 2000 in contrast the root system of rubber trees only able to extend about 13 m horizontally and 3 m vertically the swat simulated average annual groundwater of mrb is about 157 49 mm year which is consistent with the fact of 6 of the total rainfall can be considered as the groundwater recharge rate in malaysia fomca 2009 annual groundwater had the greatest reduction rate under the urban expansion 18 84 scenario followed by the actual lulc 5 80 and oil palm expansion 2 78 scenarios table 5 shows that reforestation managed to increase annual groundwater of the mrb by 6 38 fig 9 c indicates that a higher monthly groundwater reduction is mainly found in the dry period such as march and june urban expansion is still causing the greatest reduction in monthly groundwater this might be explained by the fact of expansion in concrete surfaces pavements and buildings increased surface runoff as shown in fig 9 a the impervious surfaces reduced the infiltration rate dramatically in the middle part of the mrb 4 discussion the esa cci lc products have undergone some validation works but mainly on global scale with 75 1 accuracy for 2015 esa 2017 reinhart et al 2021 in fact some differences of lulc information can be still observed when comparing to other types of lulc products for example the esa cci lc product estimated the global total forest area in 2000 as 30 01 million km2 li et al 2016 which is lower than the values reported by hansen et al 2010 32 million km2 and fao 2010 40 85 million km2 in the initial stage of this study we noticed that the distribution of the original croplands from the esa cci lc products matches quite well with the actual cropland distribution within mrb however it is difficult to differentiate the oil palm and rubber accurately several attempts have been tried to reclass the cropland categories based on the major crops and their characteristic in mrb but the results showed that the esa cci lc products mixed up the oil palm and rubber trees this shows the esa cci lc products unable to provide a higher level lulc classification that required for a local scale analysis a possible explanation for this might be that low number of observations over malaysia in the meris archive esa 2017 the improved esa cci lulc maps are useful to reduce the cropland mismatch issue that normally occurred in tropical regions the swat calibration and validation indicated that it could capture the streamflow variability within an acceptable range in the mrb however lacking of observed data for surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration resulted difficulty in identifying the swat performance on these water balance components based on the national water resources report prepared by did 2011 the estimated annual groundwater recharge for the northern peninsular malaysia ranging from 120 to 130 mm year which is about 20 30 mm year lower than the swat simulation a larger difference 55 245 mm year between the swat simulated groundwater nazri ebrahim et al 2020 and the national water resources report was found for the kelantan river basin that located in northeastern peninsular malaysia a similar situation can be seen for the surface runoff and evapotranspiration components as well in fact streamflow is still regarded the only and most reliable source to test the performance of swat therefore it is urgently need to install sensors that able to capture more water balance components for future validation work also application of satellite based evapotranspiration data for hydrological model calibration and validation is getting popular recently particularly in ungauged or data sparse basin jiang et al 2020 odusanya et al 2019 this study emphasizes the need of developing a more comprehensive accuracy assessment of swat for other water balance components as mentioned early the lulc scenarios doesn t have much impact on evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield of the mrb fig 8 all the four lulc scenarios changed annual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield by 0 64 to 0 57 0 13 to 0 14 and 0 99 to 0 07 respectively a similar situation was found at the monthly scale assessment with the changes mostly within 1 2 a possible explanation by this might be that the lulc scenarios that set in this study is not significant enough to make significant changes in these three water balance components in addition since mrb is a tropical basin with high amount of precipitation a reduction of few mm in these water balance components actually does not impact much on the overall amount a similar finding was reported by zhang et al 2020b in a tropical catchment of australia where the response of annual evapotranspiration to different lulc scenarios is within 0 3 santos et al 2018 also reported less significant changes in water components of a basin in amazon due to the lulc changes except surface runoff 5 conclusion to obtain better lulc maps for tropical water balance analysis this study proposed a framework to improve the esa cci lc products by integrating with freely available annual oil palm distribution images called aopd xu et al 2020 the framework is suitable for hydrologists with little or no experience in satellite images processing the improved lulc products have been used to generate the lulc maps for five different scenarios before incorporating into swat to study the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the mrb malaysia in general the improved esa cci lc product can better represent the oil palm and rubber of the mrb compared to the original version this indicates that a more comprehensive validation of global lulc products at local scale with more accurate ground truths should be conducted particularly for the region with variety of lulc during the 200 2016 period the mrb experienced an oil palm expansion and a rubber reduction in the downstream region whereas forest in the northern and southeastern regions decreased slightly from 54 23 52 80 consistent with previous studies tan et al 2019a zhang et al 2020a swat performed well in monthly streamflow simulations in the mrb with better performance can be found at the streamflow stations near to the basin outlets cn2 esco and gw revap are among the most sensitive parameters in the mrb that identified during the swat calibration this study has shown that lulc changes have a larger impact on surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater than actual evaporation potential evapotranspiration water yield and streamflow in the mrb basically urban expansion will lead a significant increasing in surface runoff which may result more serious floods by contrast reforestation is an effective strategy to reduce surface runoff and increase lateral flow and groundwater recharge to the rivers oil palm expansion may lead to a reduction in lateral flow and groundwater due to the high soil water absorption capability as compared to rubber future studies need to be carried out in order to validate more global lulc products in tropical regions besides that improvement of these lulc products with other more specific datasets should be conducted and tested to produce more accurate lulc maps further research might explore the application of swat bieger et al 2017 a newer swat version in streamflow simulations of tropical region it would be interesting to see the performance of swat

8183,study region the muda river basin mrb malaysia study focus this study proposed a framework to improve the european space agency climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc products through the integration with the annual oil palm dataset aopd the improved land use land cover lulc maps were then used to produce five lulc scenarios as input maps into the soil and water assessment tool swat model for analyzing the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the mrb new hydrological insights for the region the improved lulc maps have good performance in representing rubber and oil palm with an overall accuracy up to 81 in addition swat simulated monthly streamflow well for the mrb with the highest r2 and nse values of 0 84 and 0 86 respectively during the 2001 2016 period the mrb experienced an expansion of oil palm from 7 10 17 36 a reduction of rubber from 34 93 to 26 38 and a slight decrease in forest from 54 23 52 80 the urban expansion scenario showed significant increment in surface runoff while the reforestation scenario helped to reduce surface runoff while increase lateral flow and groundwater oil palm expansion led to a higher reduction in lateral flow and groundwater than rubber trees due to the higher soil water absorption rate the proposed framework can be duplicated and applied in other tropical basins particularly in indonesia and malaysia

another 2 billion people in the next 30 years un 2020 in the long run the population growth leads to increasing of global demand for urban land and agricultural products which dramatic change the lulc patterns an extensive deforestation was observed in tropical region in the past few decades malingreau et al 1989 stibig et al 2014 for instance tropical forests have been logged to oil palm for fulfilling the huge demand of vegetable oils tapia et al 2021 lulc plays a vital role in earth atmosphere interactions that affecting water balance such as evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater within a river basin system therefore it is essential to quantify the effect of lulc changes on water balance so that a better water resources management plan can be formulated mapping of lulc pattern from time to time is essential as one of the major inputs in hydrological model to evaluate the lulc impacts on water balance at basin scale nilawar and waikar 2018 tamm et al 2018 tan et al 2015 lulc maps are commonly prepared and released by local government but sometime these maps are not available to the public due to the data restriction policy lacking of infrastructure and expertise with advances in the satellite and computer technologies historical lulc maps can now be produced easily without relying on the government lulc data however modelers need to have a considerable knowledge and experience in satellite images processing in order to produce reliable lulc maps for those with little or zero knowledge in remote sensing readily available global lulc products such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover type product mcd12q1 sulla menashe and friedl 2018 the global land cover 2000 glc2000 bartholomé and belward 2005 and european space agency climate change initiative land cover esa cci lc defourny et al 2016 can be an alternative choice of getting lulc maps the esa cci lc products with 300 m spatial resolution and 27 year temporal data 1992 2018 have been widely used to monitor the global lulc changes mousivand and arsanjani 2019 nowosad et al 2019 at the basin scale chirachawala et al 2020 compared several global lulc maps for simulating streamflow of the upper yom river basin using the soil and water assessment tool swat and found that the esa cci lc product performed well in the annual flow seasonal flow and baseflow simulations however reinhart et al 2021 noticed that the esa cci lc products unable to identify some lulc classes over eastern europe in malaysia kondo et al 2021 reclassed the esa cci lc map manually based on the field survey and google earth satellite images before applying into swat to simulate streamflow and fecal contamination of the selangor river basin nevertheless the authors didn t validate the modified map to the best of our knowledge an improvement of the esa cci lc maps for tropical basins that dominated with oil palm and rubber is missing and therefore this study is conducted to tackle this issue swat has been proven to be a reliable hydrological model to study the impacts of lulc changes on water balance in different river basins around the world gassman et al 2014 gassman and wang 2015 tan et al 2019a for instance schilling et al 2008 quantified the water balance changes of the raccoon river watershed in the west central iowa under several agricultural expansion scenarios for adaptive agricultural management decisions making tan et al 2015 reported the conversion of forest to oil palm in the johor river basin that located in the southern peninsular malaysia increased surface runoff and lateral flow significantly while decreased groundwater and percolation the muda river basin mrb is a transboundary tropical basin situated in the northern peninsular malaysia that supplies freshwater for irrigation industry and domestic usage to three northern states of pulau pinang kedah and perlis any dramatic lulc changes within the basin can affect the freshwater supply however quantification of the lulc changes on water balance of the mrb is still limited and need to be assessed annual oil palm dataset aopd from 2001 to 2016 generated by multiple satellite datasets xu et al 2020 can be potentially used to integrate with the esa cci lc maps so that the oil palm distribution can be better displayed hence we proposed a framework to improve the esa cci lc maps by merging with the aopd dataset this improvement procedure does not require much remote sensing knowledge from the hydrology modeler this study aims to evaluate the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the muda river basin mrb malaysia using the improved esa cci lc maps and swat three specific objectives of this study are 1 to improve and validate the esa cci lc maps over the mrb 2 to assess the spatio temporal lulc changes of the mrb 3 to evaluate the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the mrb the novelty of this study is generation of a higher level lulc classification from the esa cci lc products in oil palm dominated tropical regions the framework can be applied in other tropical basins particularly in indonesia and malaysia 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the mrb has a drainage area of 4119 76 km2 with the mean elevation of 245 95 m fig 1 the total river length of muda river is about 180 km during the 1985 2015 period mean maximum temperature of the mrb varied from 30 9 34 5 c and mean minimum temperature of 21 21 35 c tan et al 2019b besides that the basin receives around 2500 mm year annual precipitation with higher monthly precipitation amount from april to may and august to november mostly more than 250 mm month tan et al 2019b whereas a relative lower monthly precipitation amount less than 100 mm month is normally found in january and february sometime the drier condition may be extended to april or may due to the el niño effect tangang et al 2017 for example the mrb experienced a long dry spell from january to june in 2020 which resulted the water level of few dams within and surrounding of the basin hit their history lowest level there are two dams within the mrb the muda dam that located in the northern part of the basin and the beris dam in the middle part as shown in fig 1 the muda dam has the capacity of 160 million m3 and is mainly used for paddy irrigation purposes due to the low capacity water from muda dam is transferred to a larger dam called the pedu dam 1073 million m3 through the 6 8 km long saiong tunnel mada 2020 muda agricultural development authority mada is the authority involves in the management and operation of the muda dam the beris dam that completed in 2004 is managed by the department of irrigation and drainage did of malaysia with the capacity of 114 million m3 it has similar functions as the muda dam 2 2 swat inputs basic data for the swat setup include daily precipitation daily maximum and minimum temperature a digital elevation model dem a land use map and a soil map daily climate data from eleven well distributed climate stations for the period of 1995 2019 were collected from the malaysian meteorological department mmd fig 1 out of these stations only the muda dam butterworth and pusat pertanian charok padang stations contain daily maximum and minimum temperature data a 30 m dem was collected from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm while the food and agriculture organization fao soil map was used as the soil input in the swat modelling as mentioned earlier this study adopted the land use maps from the esa cci lc products where the details information will be described in the next section monthly streamflow data for the 2000 2019 period were obtained from did to calibrate and validate the swat model lastly major river networks within the mrb were digitized from the google earth pro satellite images to generate better river networks during the dem based river network formation produce 2 3 integration of the esa cci lc and aopd products the esa cci lc products were created for the purposes of climate modelling multiple satellite sensors such as medium resolution imaging spectrometer meris envisat advanced synthetic aperture radar asar advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr project for on board autonomy vegetation proba v and satellite pour l observation de la terre vegetation spot vgt esa 2017 were used as the raw datasets in the products development the globcover unsupervised classification approach was used to classify 37 lulc classes based on the fao standard plummer et al 2017 the overall accuracy of the esa cci lc 2015 map is 75 4 when comparing to the globcover data esa 2017 the aopd dataset was developed to evaluate the oil palm expansion in indonesia and malaysia it is available at 100 m spatial resolution from 2001 to 2016 numerous satellite sensors including advanced land observing satellite alos phased array type l band synthetic aperture radar palsar alos 2 palsar 2 and modis data were used in the aopd formation xu et al 2020 basically the aopd development involves two major steps 1 oil palm expansion mapping using palsar and palsar 2 for the 2007 2010 and 2015 2016 periods and 2 updating the maps for the missing period of palsar from 2001 to 2006 and 2011 2014 using modis ndvi data with the break for additive season and trend bfast algorithm the overall accuracy of the aopd maps is 86 61 for the 2007 2010 and 2015 2016 and is 75 54 for the remaining periods xu et al 2020 we proposed a framework to integrate the esa cci lc and aopd products which required only some basic gis knowledge from the modeller since it can be done solely with the arcmap or qgis tool fig 2 shows the research process flowchart of this study the improved esa cci lc framework consists of seven major steps as follows step 1 download both the esa cci lc and aopd products from their webpage at http maps elie ucl ac be cci viewer download php esa 2017 and https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 3467071 xu et al 2020 respectively step 2 extract study area from both the products in this case the products were clipped with the mrb boundary delineated via the watershed delineation function within swat step 3 resample of aopd to the same spatial resolution of the esa cci lc maps step 4 reclass the esa cci lc classes based on the major lulc types that available in the study area for mrb 13 lulc classes from the original esa cci lc maps were reclassed to forest agricultural water urban and paddy step 5 check the spatial distribution of each lulc class with local maps or google earth pro satellite images particularly for agricultural and forest this step is essential to check whether the classes are correctly representing the actual situation based on our field survey and land use maps generated by the department of agricultural malaysia rubber and oil palm are the major crops in the mrb therefore the esa cci lc agricultural classes are mostly treated as oil palm and rubber step 6 apply the con tool under spatial analyst of arcmap to integrate both the products the raster pixel values of the esa cci lc maps that overlay with the oil palm distribution extracted from the aopd maps were reclassed as oil palm meanwhile the remaining agricultural pixels were reclassed as rubber step 7 validation of the improved esa cci lc maps using the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient approaches with the samples extracted from the reference maps high resolution satellite images from google earth pro and or field survey accuracy assessment is a process of validating the classification effectiveness to represent the actual lulc foody 2010 lyons et al 2018 the accuracy assessment of the improved esa cci land cover maps is done by first selecting the training samples cross validating with the lulc maps and compute the error matrix as suggested by olofsson et al 2014 the first step in accuracy assessment is identifying major errors in the classification result through a rough visualization before a detailed planning of sampling designs a major constraint of the original esa cci lc maps in the mrb is hard to differentiate agricultural crops the classification system adopted in the esa cci land cover product followed the vegetation definitions established by food and agriculture fao that is challenging in terms of extracting more details tropical agricultural crops such as oil palm and rubber fig 3 referring to the fao vegetation glossary that we found in the website http www fao org 3 x0596e x0596e01n htm permanent rainfed crops herbaceous rainfed crops and mosaic cropland are different in terms of planting management however in our study area mrb these land cover class had mixed up with oil palm and rubber independent samples collected from ground observations are commonly used as the training and test set input for sampling designs wulder et al 2006 suggested that the sample size selection is dependent on the accepted minimum accuracy often determined based on probability theory of the binomial distribution a total of 60 random samples are selected for each class from the high resolution google earth satellite images for validating the improved esa cci lc maps of 2009 and 2016 while the 2002 lulc map produced by the department of agricultural malaysia was used to validate the 2001 map google earth historical satellite data is a least cost reliable source for ground truth sample collection as it can be zoomed into the ground view extent where it is almost similar to the in situ field observations with the local knowledge of the studied basin we managed to generate more accurate sampling points for the accuracy assessment accuracy assessment of the lulc products is done with the confusion matrix approach where a cross tabulation of the class label from the land cover product with the samples collected is computed foody 2015 from the confusion matrix the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient of the lulc products can be computed post hoc this method is commonly practiced for classification results as the processes can be conducted with excel and gis software the two indicators are derived as overall accuracy n o o f c o r r e c t l y m a t c h e d p i x e l s t o t a l n u m m b e r o f p i x e l s kappa coefficient κ p o p e 1 p e where p o is the relative observed agreement among the raters and p e is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement for each randomly observation cohen 1960 ĸ ranges between 0 1 where the value can be interpreted by poor agreement ĸ 0 20 fair agreement 0 20 ĸ 0 40 moderate agreement 0 40 ĸ 0 60 good agreement 0 60 ĸ 0 80 very good agreement 0 80 ĸ 1 00 thus the overall accuracy of above 70 and ĸ value of above 0 60 is considered as an acceptable result 2 4 swat model swat is a semi distributed model developed by the united states department of agricultural usda and the texas a m university via the routing outputs to the outlet and integration of the simulator for water resources in rural basins models arnold et al 1998 the model was designed to evaluate the impact of different management practices and human activities on water balance and river quality a continuous model improvement since 1990s made it as one of the most powerful tools to analyze soil water waste nexus mannschatz et al 2016 in addition the model has been proven to be reliable in representing water balance especially streamflow in different types of river basins around the world bressiani et al 2015 gassman et al 2007 tan et al 2020 2019a van griensven et al 2012 swat divides a basin into multiple sub basins and the sub basins are further divided into smaller hydrological response units which run all the calculations in this study the minimum value of threshold for dem based stream definition was set to 100 km2 which resulted a total of 27 sub basins then the slope classes were divided into five major classes of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 and more than 40 the hru threshold for land use soil and slope was set to 10 which created a total of 326 hrus basic information of the muda and beris dams inserted to the swat model were obtained from the mada mada 2020 website and did respectively in addition average monthly water usage of mrb that collected from the national water balance management system nawabs did 2020 and a report prepared by van kalken 2017 were also added to the swat model during the swat simulation a five year warm up period from 1995 to 1999 was given to initiate the soil water condition then the remaining simulation was divided into the calibration 2000 2009 and validation 2010 2019 to evaluate the model performance before applying for the lulc impact assessment monthly streamflow data as mentioned in the section 2 2 were used for model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 within the swat cup tool was used to calibrate the swat model with 500 different parameters combinations abbaspour et al 2018 the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse were used to evaluate the capability of swat in simulating monthly streamflow in mrb the r2 and nse values range from 0 to 1 and to 1 respectively with 1 as the optimal value negative nse values indicate an unacceptable performance of the swat model based on the moriasi et al 2015 a very good model should obtain more than 0 85 for r2 and 0 8 for nse meanwhile the r2 and nse values for good model should be more than 0 75 and 0 65 respectively 2 5 land use scenario analysis we generated three historical lulc maps of 2001 2009 and 2016 using the improved esa cci lc framework that described in the section 2 3 although the esa cci lc maps are available every year from 1992 to 2018 but only three historical maps were generated due to the limited historical reference lulc maps for the accuracy assessment in addition lulc usually does not have significant changes within few years unless there are some land use policies that can cause abrupt the sudden changes furthermore land use maps at decadal intervals are commonly used in the lulc impact assessment chen et al 2020 githui et al 2009 therefore the improved 2001 2009 and 2016 maps should be sufficient for the assessment of lulc impact on water balance in the mrb table 1 lists five lulc scenarios generated from the improved esa cci lc maps these lulc scenarios consists of a baseline map that used to compare with the other four different lulc scenarios s1 scenario represents the actual lulc changes in mrb while the other three lulc scenarios indicate the oil palm expansion urban expansion and reforestation the swat landuse update tool swat lut developed by moriasi et al 2019 was used to update the land use changes module within swat swat lut is an improved version of swat2009 luc pai and saraswat 2011 which can only be used to activate the land use module of the swat 2009 version the swat lut tool is compatible with the swat 2012 revision 635 that used in this study moriasi et al 2019 recommended to activate the land use module for updating the lulc changes within swat using the swat lut before the calibration and validation fig 2 hence the swat model for the mrb was initially created using the baseline land use map then the lulc maps for the other four scenarios were incorporated into swat via the swat lut and stored to the respective swat project files next the baseline swat model was used in the calibration and validation once the swat performance reached to a certain acceptable level the same calibrated parameters were then transferred to other swat projects that have been activated with different lulc scenarios using the same calibrated parameters for all lulc scenarios swat projects is essential to minimize the parameter uncertainty in the modelling outputs 3 results 3 1 lulc analysis the accuracy assessment of all the three improved lulc maps are presented in table 2 in general the improved esa cci lc maps performed well with the overall accuracy values of 56 81 and 70 for 2001 2009 and 2016 respectively this may be caused by the limitations of the vegetation definitions in representing vegetation covers in a tropical region where the vegetation characteristics under the tropical climate may be different from other countries besides that the kappa coefficient of the original dataset is relatively low where the statistical test shown that the dataset is at fair agreement for its classification system the confusion matrix of the improved lulc map for 2016 is tabulated in table 3 based on the constructed confusion matrix the omission and commission errors for each of the designed land cover class are relatively high especially for urban class one of the reasons behind may be the dataset resolution factor that shall be considered during the sampling design the urban areas covered a relatively small portion of the mrb approximately 0 8 thus the samples collected from high resolution satellite data might fall onto the neighbouring pixels in the esa cci lc product basically about 50 of the mrb is covered with forest followed by rubber oil palm paddy water and urban fig 3 indicates some photos of the major land use types within the basin that taken during our field trip spatio temporal changes of lulc over the mrb for the periods of 2001 2009 and 2016 are shown in figs 4 and 5 there has been an increment in the oil palm plantations in the downstream mrb from 7 10 17 36 of the total basin size between 2001 and 2016 by contrast rubber that dominated in the western and southern parts of mrb were reduced from 34 93 in 2001 to 26 8 in 2016 paddy is distributed mainly near to the basin s outlet ranging from 2 04 to 3 03 meanwhile forest within mrb is mainly found in the northern and southeastern parts with a slight decrease in coverage area from 54 23 52 80 3 2 swat calibration and validation the swat calibration parameters adopted by zhang et al 2020a who tested the reliability of different climate data on swat outputs of the same basin were used in this study a recalibration of swat was conducted since the authors ran the model for a shorter period of 2009 2014 by contrast this study calibrated and validated swat for the periods of 2000 2009 and 2010 2019 respectively table 4 indicates the ranges and optimal values of the swat calibration parameters for the mrb similarly scs runoff curve number f cn2 soil evaporation compensation factor esco and groundwater revap coefficient gw revap are among the most sensitive parameters in the mrb zhang et al 2020a the performance of swat in simulating monthly streamflow at four different streamflow gauges is presented in fig 6 overall swat had a good performance during the calibration as the r2 and nse values were above 0 7 at three streamflow gauges the only not satisfactory performance was found in the sg muda at jeniang station which may be due to the reservoir effects but it is still under an acceptable performance as suggested by moriasi et al 2015 during the validation period a very good swat performance can be found in the sg muda at ladang victoria station that nearest to the basin s outlet with the r2 and nse values of 0 83 and 0 86 respectively another outstanding performance of swat can be observed in the sg muda at jambatan syed omar station r2 0 84 and nse 0 72 swat performed better during the validation period in the sg muda at jeniang station r2 0 63 and nse 0 47 than the calibration period in contrast a poorer performance was at the sg ketil at kuala pegang station for the validation period which may be due to the underestimation of peak flows 3 3 streamflow changes under different lulc scenarios the effect of different lulc scenarios on the annual and monthly streamflow pattern at four streamflow stations and the basin s outlet for the period of 2000 2019 is shown in fig 7 the actual lulc oil palm expansion and urban expansion led to slightly changes of annual streamflow from 0 06 to 0 25 0 59 to 0 03 and 0 32 to 0 93 respectively table 5 shows only the oil palm expansion scenario resulted a reduction in annual streamflow whereas the other three scenarios increased the annual streamflow the reforestation scenario showed the largest increment in annual streamflow by 1 35 followed by the urban expansion 0 87 and actual 0 11 scenarios during the low flow period in january february and march monthly streamflow at the basin s outlet mostly decreased under all the evaluated lulc scenarios with the urban expansion scenario had the greatest reduction rate fig 7 e shows that monthly streamflow in january and february under the urban expansion scenario decreased by 8 45 6 72 m3s 1 and 8 24 5 52 m3s 1 respectively reforestation is the only scenario increased monthly streamflow during the swm season from may to september by 1 00 3 12 during the high flow or flood period the urban expansion scenario caused the highest increment in monthly streamflow of august september october and november by 4 42 7 27 5 64 and 3 77 respectively a similar situation can be found at the sg muda at jambatan syed omar and sg muda at ladang victoria stations this indicates that rapid urbanization could increase the flood risk in the downstream part of mrb 3 4 water balance changes under different lulc scenarios the response of annual surface runoff lateral flow groundwater evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield as simulated using the calibrated swat under four land use scenarios from 2000 2019 in the mrb is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from fig 8 and table 5 that lulc had a larger impact on annual surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater as compared to evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield in this tropical basin annual surface runoff increased significantly by 34 51 when all oil palm plantations changed to urban area average monthly surface runoff also increased dramatically under the urban expansion scenario by 25 08 59 76 whereas the reforestation scenario reduced monthly surface runoff from 7 04 10 20 fig 9 a the findings indicated that forest plays an important role in mitigating the flood impact in the mrb on the other hand the actual lulc and agricultural expansion scenarios only have a minor impact on monthly surface runoff simulation which is less than 1 78 annual lateral flow decreased by 0 90 4 17 under all the lulc scenarios except for the reforestation scenario which had an opposite direction of increment around 15 24 table 5 fig 9 b shows monthly lateral flow under the reforestation scenario increased from 12 75 to 17 00 respectively meanwhile the urban expansion scenario caused a reduction in monthly lateral flow between 2 90 and 5 38 overall the findings indicated that water movement within soil is largely affected by the types of lulc decreases of annual lateral flow under the actual lulc and oil palm expansion scenarios could be due to the water consumption of oil palm is higher than rubber hardanto et al 2017 oil palm absorbs more water within soil since its fibrous root system can spread over 25 m horizontally and 6 m vertically jourdan et al 2000 in contrast the root system of rubber trees only able to extend about 13 m horizontally and 3 m vertically the swat simulated average annual groundwater of mrb is about 157 49 mm year which is consistent with the fact of 6 of the total rainfall can be considered as the groundwater recharge rate in malaysia fomca 2009 annual groundwater had the greatest reduction rate under the urban expansion 18 84 scenario followed by the actual lulc 5 80 and oil palm expansion 2 78 scenarios table 5 shows that reforestation managed to increase annual groundwater of the mrb by 6 38 fig 9 c indicates that a higher monthly groundwater reduction is mainly found in the dry period such as march and june urban expansion is still causing the greatest reduction in monthly groundwater this might be explained by the fact of expansion in concrete surfaces pavements and buildings increased surface runoff as shown in fig 9 a the impervious surfaces reduced the infiltration rate dramatically in the middle part of the mrb 4 discussion the esa cci lc products have undergone some validation works but mainly on global scale with 75 1 accuracy for 2015 esa 2017 reinhart et al 2021 in fact some differences of lulc information can be still observed when comparing to other types of lulc products for example the esa cci lc product estimated the global total forest area in 2000 as 30 01 million km2 li et al 2016 which is lower than the values reported by hansen et al 2010 32 million km2 and fao 2010 40 85 million km2 in the initial stage of this study we noticed that the distribution of the original croplands from the esa cci lc products matches quite well with the actual cropland distribution within mrb however it is difficult to differentiate the oil palm and rubber accurately several attempts have been tried to reclass the cropland categories based on the major crops and their characteristic in mrb but the results showed that the esa cci lc products mixed up the oil palm and rubber trees this shows the esa cci lc products unable to provide a higher level lulc classification that required for a local scale analysis a possible explanation for this might be that low number of observations over malaysia in the meris archive esa 2017 the improved esa cci lulc maps are useful to reduce the cropland mismatch issue that normally occurred in tropical regions the swat calibration and validation indicated that it could capture the streamflow variability within an acceptable range in the mrb however lacking of observed data for surface runoff groundwater and evapotranspiration resulted difficulty in identifying the swat performance on these water balance components based on the national water resources report prepared by did 2011 the estimated annual groundwater recharge for the northern peninsular malaysia ranging from 120 to 130 mm year which is about 20 30 mm year lower than the swat simulation a larger difference 55 245 mm year between the swat simulated groundwater nazri ebrahim et al 2020 and the national water resources report was found for the kelantan river basin that located in northeastern peninsular malaysia a similar situation can be seen for the surface runoff and evapotranspiration components as well in fact streamflow is still regarded the only and most reliable source to test the performance of swat therefore it is urgently need to install sensors that able to capture more water balance components for future validation work also application of satellite based evapotranspiration data for hydrological model calibration and validation is getting popular recently particularly in ungauged or data sparse basin jiang et al 2020 odusanya et al 2019 this study emphasizes the need of developing a more comprehensive accuracy assessment of swat for other water balance components as mentioned early the lulc scenarios doesn t have much impact on evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield of the mrb fig 8 all the four lulc scenarios changed annual evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration and water yield by 0 64 to 0 57 0 13 to 0 14 and 0 99 to 0 07 respectively a similar situation was found at the monthly scale assessment with the changes mostly within 1 2 a possible explanation by this might be that the lulc scenarios that set in this study is not significant enough to make significant changes in these three water balance components in addition since mrb is a tropical basin with high amount of precipitation a reduction of few mm in these water balance components actually does not impact much on the overall amount a similar finding was reported by zhang et al 2020b in a tropical catchment of australia where the response of annual evapotranspiration to different lulc scenarios is within 0 3 santos et al 2018 also reported less significant changes in water components of a basin in amazon due to the lulc changes except surface runoff 5 conclusion to obtain better lulc maps for tropical water balance analysis this study proposed a framework to improve the esa cci lc products by integrating with freely available annual oil palm distribution images called aopd xu et al 2020 the framework is suitable for hydrologists with little or no experience in satellite images processing the improved lulc products have been used to generate the lulc maps for five different scenarios before incorporating into swat to study the impact of lulc changes on water balance in the mrb malaysia in general the improved esa cci lc product can better represent the oil palm and rubber of the mrb compared to the original version this indicates that a more comprehensive validation of global lulc products at local scale with more accurate ground truths should be conducted particularly for the region with variety of lulc during the 200 2016 period the mrb experienced an oil palm expansion and a rubber reduction in the downstream region whereas forest in the northern and southeastern regions decreased slightly from 54 23 52 80 consistent with previous studies tan et al 2019a zhang et al 2020a swat performed well in monthly streamflow simulations in the mrb with better performance can be found at the streamflow stations near to the basin outlets cn2 esco and gw revap are among the most sensitive parameters in the mrb that identified during the swat calibration this study has shown that lulc changes have a larger impact on surface runoff lateral flow and groundwater than actual evaporation potential evapotranspiration water yield and streamflow in the mrb basically urban expansion will lead a significant increasing in surface runoff which may result more serious floods by contrast reforestation is an effective strategy to reduce surface runoff and increase lateral flow and groundwater recharge to the rivers oil palm expansion may lead to a reduction in lateral flow and groundwater due to the high soil water absorption capability as compared to rubber future studies need to be carried out in order to validate more global lulc products in tropical regions besides that improvement of these lulc products with other more specific datasets should be conducted and tested to produce more accurate lulc maps further research might explore the application of swat bieger et al 2017 a newer swat version in streamflow simulations of tropical region it would be interesting to see the performance of swat compared to the swat model particularly in extreme flows simulations tan et al 2020 credit authorship contribution statement mou leong tan conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding

8184,study region the balkhab river basin in northern afghanistan study focus snowmelt is a primary water resource in mountainous regions of the world remotely sensed snow cover products are useful for obtaining spatial snow information but have unsolved cloud cover issues thus this study demonstrates 1 a spatiotemporal combination approach for reducing cloud cover and improving the accuracy in snow cover extent sce estimation from 2010 to 2018 using the modis daily snow cover product version 6 and 2 the sensitivity of snowmelt runoff modelling to sce inputs with different levels of cloud cover from 2012 to 2014 using a snowmelt runoff model srm new hydrological insights for the region the average cloud coverages of the original modis aqua and terra daily products for the study region and period were reduced from 37 66 and 31 88 to 25 9 after the spatial combination and to 14 28 and 8 94 respectively after the temporal combination the temporal combination with previous and following days yielded a substantial improvement in cloud removal the sensitivity of the srm results to the different levels of clouds clearly depicts the gradual improvement in the simulated snowmelt runoffs with a cloud cover reduction in the sce input interestingly the srm performances with the direct sce input from aqua or terra products are degraded in some cases compared to those without sce input in the srm thus careful attention is needed when directly applying remotely sensed snow cover products as input variables in snow hydrological modelling the simulated snowmelt runoffs are improved substantially in the melting season in march may the snowmelt runoff peaks in may are due to the temperature increase and are mainly responsible for extreme floods in the arid study region this study contributes further to agricultural water resource management for crop cultivation during the dry season from june to september and to flood protection during the snowmelt runoff peaks in may with a potential hydraulic engineering solution keywords snow cover cloud cover ndsi snowmelt runoff model snow hydrological modelling water resource management afghanistan 1 introduction snow cover which is a vital component of the cryosphere has a crucial role in the earth s climatic system via its effect on the surface energy balance water cycle primary productivity land surface gas exchange sea level etc stocker et al 2013 in particular snow accumulation and ablation processes dominate the surface water cycle over a substantial global land area poleward of approximately 40 latitude in continental interiors and mountainous regions adam et al 2009 snowmelt is a primary source of water in the mountainous regions of the world and has a far reaching influence on areas that rely on meltwater to fill streams and reservoirs and replenish aquifers in developing countries and very remote regions with high terrain mountains ground based snow measurements are very limited because of complex topography inaccessibility and financial constraints vuyovich and jacobs 2011 therefore assessing the snow cover and volume of meltwater can be very difficult but is important for sustainable water resource management in mountainous regions information on snow cover and meltwater volume is also crucial for flooding and drought management with broad influences on political and economic implications remotely sensed satellite data can be particularly useful for obtaining inexpensive and spatially distributed and continuous snow information if the issue of accuracy in the regions can be addressed the most widely employed remote sensing products for snow are snow extent datasets from visible band sensors and snow mass retrieved as snow depth and commonly referred to as snow water equivalent swe in land surface models from microwave radiometers as reviewed by clifford 2010 many snow cover extent sce datasets are available for example the near real time ice and snow extent nise daily and global dataset by the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis sensor armstrong and brodzik 2001 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the terra and aqua snow cover dataset hall et al 2002 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr snow cover dataset fernandes and zhao 2008 wang and key 2005 nasa s visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs snow cover dataset riggs et al 2017 the landsat thematic mapper tm enhanced thematic mapper etm snow cover product selkowitz and forster 2016 and the european remote sensing synthetic aperture radar ers sar snow cover products baghdadi et al 1997 mahmoodzada et al 2020 nagler and rott 1997 shi and dozier 1997 among them modis terra snow products have been applied in snow hydrology science and many hydrological modelling applications since 2000 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 crawford 2015 frei et al 2012 hall et al 2012 homan et al 2011 mcguire et al 2006 including as input to snowmelt runoff modelling for water resource management butt and bilal 2011 a variety of snow and ice products are produced from modis sensors and the products are available at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions the modis snow product suite begins with a 500 m resolution as a 2330 km swath snow cover map which is then gridded to a sinusoidal grid the standard modis daily global fractional snow cover fsc climate modelling grid cmg map product is generated at 0 05 resolution approximately 5 km at the equator wmo 2012 p 26 modis snow cover products have been reported to have high accuracy maurer et al 2003 parajka and blöschl 2006 according to wang et al 2008 modis snow cover products showed 94 accuracy for snow and 99 accuracy for land in the northern xingjian region china under clear sky conditions however cloud cover in satellite snow products remains a major issue that adversely affects the extraction of daily snow extent and limits the direct use of products in environmental and hydrological studies abudu et al 2012 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 to overcome the cloud cover in modis snow cover products attempts were successfully made to remove cloud covered pixels by applying a spatiotemporal combination approach gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 as described snowmelt water is crucial for planning management and water resource assessment in mountainous terrain and basins thus snowmelt modelling is a significant element for predicting runoff from high elevation snow covered and or glaciated regions in general snowmelt and subsequent runoff modelling are calculated using two approaches the energy balance method and the temperature degree day method the former method can be employed when sufficient field data are available to solve physical governing equations whereas the latter method can be more useful in the absence of sufficient data tayal senzeba et al 2015 the snowmelt runoff model srm which was developed by martinec 1975 is a conceptual semi distributed and temperature degree day method for simulating and predicting daily runoff from snowmelt and rainfall in mountain basins the srm has been broadly applied to over 112 basins at various geographical locations and spatial ranges in 29 countries martinec et al 2008 among other countries boudhar et al 2009 fuladipanah and jorabloo 2012 ma et al 2013 panday et al 2014 riggs and hall 2004 sharma et al 2012 these applications revealed that srm simulations enable adequate accuracy with satellite snow cover data and even incomplete or fragmented ground data tayal senzeba et al 2015 thus remote sensing snow cover products are particularly useful for providing spatially distributed snow cover input data for snowmelt runoff modelling boudhar et al 2009 afghanistan is a landlocked developing country that is dominated by a dry climate where most of the region is represented by arid land and is highly reliant on the agricultural sector 18 6 of the gross domestic product gdp was derived from the agricultural sector in 2018 hussainzada and lee 2021 atefi and miura 2021 nsia 2019 a large fraction of the surface and underground water in afghanistan is influenced by the snow accumulated in the highlands and glaciers although snowmelt and glaciers have a key role in the country s water resources few studies have been conducted in gafurov and bárdossy 2009 the six step combination technique was used for cloud removal from the modis snow cover datasets for 2003 in vuyovich and jacobs 2011 a study in the upper helmand watershed in afghanistan was conducted using advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e passive microwave datasets and station data for snow water equivalent estimation from 2003 to 2009 during the winter seasons snowmelt runoff modelling was conducted to estimate the river discharge in the salang river basin and upper kabul river basin by directly using modis snow cover datasets and metrological data for 2 years from 2009 to 2011 arian et al 2015 rasouli et al 2016 however no snow hydrological modelling for water resource management has been reported in northern afghanistan in this study we apply the spatiotemporal combination approach to improve the accuracy of sce estimation with modis snow cover product version c6 for 9 years from january 2010 to december 2018 which substantially improved the cloud removal and estimation accuracy of the sce in the balkhab river basin in northern afghanistan the estimated sce is then applied as the input variable to the srm with ground based temperature and rainfall data to simulate the daily river discharge in the balkhab river the resulting srm runoff is compared to daily discharge records to determine if the srm simulation is useful for water resource management we also illustrate the sensitivity of srm results to snow cover extent inputs before and after the spatiotemporal combination is applied by considering the varying levels of cloud removal this research addresses the following issues for this study region 1 the need for increased awareness of the importance of snow cover data and ground measurement 2 how to produce sce data with publicly available data sources and how to improve their quality with remote sensing skills 3 the importance and usefulness of long term snow hydrological modelling for water resource management and 4 a preferred example srm case study for data scarce regions moreover the findings in this study can contribute to the improvement of hydrological modelling for water resource management and flood protection with remotely sensed sce in mountainous regions with arid to semiarid climates where field observations of snow cover are expensive and difficult in addition the results demonstrate the hydrological model performance using direct satellite sce as input compared to those without sce inputs thus careful consideration of the level of cloud presence in optical satellite products must be taken when hydrological models are applied to similar climatic regions 2 materials 2 1 study area the balkhab river basin brb is located in the northern water basin of afghanistan the northern water basin is divided into four main rivers the balkhab river khulm river sar i pul river and shirin tagab river all the water in the northern basin is consumed within the watershed the rivers in the northern basin dry up in the irrigation canals or desert sands before reaching the afghanistan border the balkhab river flows north starting from a chain of six lapis lazuli lakes in band i amir in the central highlands fig 1 the largest lake covers 490 ha and the smallest lake has a diameter of 100 m mail atlas 2004 the brb is situated from latitude 34 0 n to 37 4 n and from longitude 66 0 e to 68 0 e the brb elevation ranges from 241 4621 m and has an area of 28 846 km2 with a semiarid climate and erratic precipitation mostly between november and march with an average precipitation of 200 400 mm year reddy 2019 importantly no precipitation occurs during the summer seasons the water source for the remainder of the year is snowmelt from snow accumulated in the highlands of central afghanistan in the winter season the annual average temperature varies from 7 56 c in the highlands in the south to 18 93 c in the flatlands in the north based on the data from 2010 to 2018 provided by the ministry of energy and water islamic republic of afghanistan 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 modis data in this study the modis snow cover daily products version collection 6 c6 onboard terra mod10a1 and aqua myd10a1 with 500 m spatial resolution from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2018 were retrieved and used in the c6 product for the modis aqua snow cover detection algorithm the quantitative image restoration qir algorithm gladkova et al 2012 was integrated with the level 2 algorithm the qir restores the aqua modis band 6 to scientifically usable data for the snow algorithm whereas in c5 aqua band 7 was used instead of band 6 because of the nonfunctional detectors in band 6 this dataset contains gridded snow cover and albedo derived from radiance data acquired by modis the snow cover was identified using the normalized difference snow index ndsi and a series of screens that are designed to alleviate errors and flag uncertain snow cover detections to minimize the snow cover detection error the snow conversion approach which detects snow based on the reflectance and then screens false snow detection was applied riggs et al 2016 of the 3287 days in 9 years the records for 14 days in terra snow cover products and 5 days in aqua snow cover products were missed in the land process distribution active archive centre lp daac the modis aqua and terra snow cover products were reclassified for further analysis table 1 shows the key values for land cover classification and new classifications made in the current study including the ndsi threshold value for differentiating snow and non snow covered pixels an ndsi threshold value of 0 1 was applied such that those pixels with ndsi values 0 1 are considered non snow because of the large uncertainty in snow detection for low ndsi values 2 2 2 hydrometeorological data dem and zonation at least three decades of wars started in the 1970s in afghanistan these wars caused the interruption of water resource data collection in the country although older hydrological records were destroyed 169 stream gauges were installed nationwide under the us international cooperation administration which was the ancestor institution of the us geological survey usgs shroder and ahmadzai 2016 five hydrometeorological stations rabat i bala r i b pul i baraq p i b delmarogh delm doshqadam dosh and nazdik i nayak n i n operate in the brb recording water resource data table 2 in the runoff modelling setup the minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitations were obtained daily from the five observations to validate the runoff modelling results the daily river discharge at the r i b station which is the most downstream station is used the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dataset was employed as a digital elevation model dem in this study with a pixel resolution of 30 m and a vertical accuracy of 15 m farr and kobrick 2000 salerno et al 2003 because the study area the brb basin is large and starts from the highlands in the south and transitions to the flatlands in the north fig 1 the variations in precipitation temperature model parameters and hydrological regime with elevation can affect the srm results thus the brb catchment which ranges from 241 m to 4621 m in elevation was divided into nine elevation zones with an approximately 500 m range in elevation in each zone as suggested for snowmelt runoff modelling in martinec et al 2008 the average hypsometric elevation for each zone was determined from the regional elevation curve retrieved from the dem of the study area table 3 shows the minimum and maximum elevations mean hypsometric elevation average elevation and area of each elevation zone 2 2 3 landsat 8 data landsat 8 collection 1 and level 1 data were retrieved over the study area for the period of 21 may 2013 to 13 december 2018 for the comparison of the resulting sce from modis data the data with less than 20 land surface cloud coverage for the entire period were selected the entire study area was covered by six tiles 154034 154035 154036 155034 155035 and 155036 but based on availability two or three tiles were downloaded on 82 different days for comparison 3 methodology in this study modis snow cover data were processed to minimize cloud abstraction and provide an acceptable sce for the study area to overcome data scarcity modis snow cover products were subjected to three combinations with the aim of decreasing cloud cover and the resulting sce was employed as input in snowmelt runoff modelling to reconstruct the hydrograph for the 2012 2014 period to examine the quality of the generated data fig 2 shows the general flow of the methodology 3 1 snow cover mapping 3 1 1 combination of aqau and terra products the satellite data derived from mod10a1 terra and myd10a1 aqua capture different cloud obstructions because of different orbits modis aqua and terra capture the earth s surface condition three hours apart to optimize the cloud free surface view and provide the opportunity for sub daily time scale investigations nsidc 2020 this difference creates the opportunity to replace the cloud pixels with land or snow after merging the aqua and terra snow covers on the same day in this combination the cloud pixels in terra images were replaced with the same pixels in aqua where land or snow was captured a complete explanation of the aqua and terra combination procedure is given by eq 1 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 1 s x y n min s x y n a s x y n t where x and y are the spatial coordinates in longitude and latitude respectively n is the day index of pixel s and s a and s t show pixels of aqua and terra respectively in this combination the pixels that are marked as clouds in terra but marked as land snow no decision missing data or water in aqua will be automatically replaced by the same pixel from the aqua image the m i n function replaces the cloud pixels with any other class by comparing the flag of cloud pixels with that of other pixels because the newly assigned flag of clouds is the highest value table 1 3 1 2 temporal combinations the temporal combination follows the same concept for further reduction of the cloud cover as the aqua and terra combination in the temporal combination step the images were subjected to two additional combinations first the combined aqua and terra products were combined with their proceeding day image to replace only the cloud pixels with non cloud pixels if any existed in the second step the outputs of step one were combined with those of previous days to minimize the cloud pixels in the images the temporal combinations were represented by eq 2 based on the assumption that snowmelt on cloudy days can be disregarded because the main source of snowmelt is solar radiation a vast proportion of which will be reflected by clouds on snow pixels gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 2 s x y n min s x y n 1 s x y n 1 in these combinations the cloud pixels will be replaced with other classes only if the pixel catches clouds during the day but catches any other classes during the proceeding day s x y n 1 or the previous day s x y n 1 3 1 3 landsat 8 ndsi and validation of the modis snow cover product the landsat 8 data with less than 20 land surface cloud cover were retrieved and assumed to be the ground truth for comparison with the modis snow cover datasets the study area was covered by six tiles where three tiles covered the eastern part and three additional tiles covered the western part with different temporal resolutions the tiles on the same date with less than 20 cloud coverage were mosaiced to a single file bands 3 and 6 of landsat 8 were processed to the ndsi as explained in section 2 2 1 the landsat 8 ndsi products classified the entire study area into snow areas or non snow areas the modis snow cover products were clipped for the same date and area where the landsat 8 ndsi snow cover was processed for the comparison between both products the confusion matrix is a summary of the prediction result on a classification problem to describe the prediction model performance cabrera and lee 2019 cabrera and lee 2020 because no ground observation of the snow cover and depth in the brb is available the landsat 8 ndsi products were used as the foundation for validating modis snow cover the landsat 8 ndsi products were resampled to the same resolution of 500 m as modis and the areas with elevations higher than 1500 m were clipped for comparison for the sces from both satellites the confusion matrix and measures were estimated based on the 2 2 matrix in table 4 in comparison all classes other than snow in the modis snow cover map were considered snow free the correctly predicted snow and snow free pixels are indicated by true positives tps and false positives fps while the misclassified pixels are indicated by false positives fps and false negatives fns the measures of positive predictivity value ppv negative predictivity value npv overall accuracy oa specificity and sensitivity were estimated for 51 days 3 2 snowmelt runoff modelling the srm was developed for modelling small watersheds in europe martinec et al 2008 based on eq 3 3 q n 1 c s n a n t n δ t n s n c r n p n a 10 000 86 400 1 k n 1 q n k n 1 where q is the mean daily discharge m3 s c is the runoff coefficient that states the losses as the ratio of runoff precipitation with c s assigned to snowmelt and c r assigned to rain a is the degree day factor cm c 1 d 1 which shows the snowmelt depth from 1 degree day t is the number of degree days c 1 d 1 δ t is the adjustment by the temperature lapse rate when extrapolating the temperature from the station to the average hypsometric elevation of the basin or zone c d s is the ratio of the snow covered area to the total area and p is the precipitation contribution of runoff cm a preselected threshold temperature t c r i t decides whether this contribution is rainfall and is reflected promptly in the discharge if precipitation is decided by t c r i t to be new snow it will be stored over the formerly snow free area until melting circumstances occur a in eq 3 is the area of the basin or zone km2 k is the recession coefficient that shows the decrease in discharge in a phase without snowmelt or rainfall k q n 1 q n n n 1 are the string of days during a true recession flow period n is the string of days during the discharge estimation period and 10000 86400 is the conversion factor from cm km2 d 1 to m3 s 1 the recorded mean daily temperature at the five hydrometeorological stations was used as the input for snowmelt runoff modelling the daily mean temperatures for each zone were extrapolated using the temperature lapse rate the closest station in terms of elevation and the average hypsometric elevation of the zones using eq 4 4 δ t γ h s t h 1 100 where δ t is the adjusted temperature c h s t is the elevation of the station m h is the average hypsometric altitude of each zone m and γ is the temperature lapse rate c per 100 m precipitation is one of the most important components of snowmelt runoff modelling abudu et al 2016 the recorded precipitation at the stations is in rain or snow form new snowmelt water will affect the streamflow while melt conditions occur when the temperature is sufficiently warm vice versa rainfall will immediately affect the streamflow the sce for each zone was extracted as the percentage of the zone total area on a daily basis from the modis products with different levels of cloud coverage 3 3 srm model setup seven parameters viz the temperature lapse rate critical temperature degree day factor runoff coefficient lag time recession coefficient and rainfall contribution rca were employed to run the srm the parameters were calibrated for 2014 and then applied to estimate the daily discharge from 2012 to 2013 the parameter values of the srm for each zone are shown in table 5 because the variation in temperature is an important factor that helps us assess snowmelt in high mountains this variation in temperature with elevation is a crucial factor for hydrological modelling tayal senzeba et al 2015 the temperature lapse rate was obtained from historical nine year daily average observations at the brb stations at different altitudes the precipitation was determined as rainfall or snow based on the critical temperature t c r i t t c r i t was determined based on the historical records of snowfall and mean daily temperature the snowmelt contribution to the surface runoff was estimated using eq 5 5 m a t where m is the daily snowmelt depth cm a is the degree day factor cm c 1 d 1 and t is the number of degree days c d the daily mean temperature is assigned to the degree day and when the degree day becomes negative it will automatically be set to zero the degree day factor a ranges from 0 35 0 6 martinec and rango 1986 and lower values are recommended for new snow no up to date record is available for the snowmelt characteristics in the study region therefore the minimum values for a were selected to estimate the snowmelt depth the time lag shows the time by which the increasing discharge lags behind the increase in temperature martinec et al 2008 the time lag can be indicated from the past year hydrograph the runoff coefficient is responsible for runoff losses for example the disparity among available water rainfall snowmelt and outflow water rca has two options in the srm rca 0 or rca 1 if zero the rainfall will be retained by the snowpack and if switched to 1 the rainfall throughout the area will contribute to the streamflow the user should decide when to switch the option the recession coefficient k is a crucial parameter of srm because 1 k in eq 1 is the amount of daily meltwater that is instantly reflected in the streamflow the recession coefficient k also varies along the streamflow with the topographical conditions presence of subsurface flow such as springs or other hydrological processes along the streamflow therefore the existing historical discharge record is applied to determine the optimal value of k the values of q and q n 1 are plotted against each other using the following linear regression 6 k n 1 q n 1 q n x c q n y c where x c is a constant with the same units m3 s of q and y c is a dimensionless constant that must be determined by solving the following equations the results are shown in table 5 7 k 1 x c q 1 y c 8 k 2 x c q 2 y c 9 log k 1 log x c y c log q 1 10 log k 2 log x c y c log q 2 the climate data and snow cover area inputs for the srm are the minimum and maximum precipitation the average temperature and the percentage of snow cover for each elevation zone the five station observations were used as the climate data input into the srm the temperatures were adjusted based on the temperature lapse rate and mean elevation of the zones the sces were extracted from the snow cover products separately for each elevation zone as the ratio of sce to the total area of the elevation zone the snow depletion curves for the nine elevation zones are summarized in fig 3 3 4 performance evaluation to assess the performance of the srm with and without estimated sces statistical indices were used for validation such as the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient n s e and volume difference d v as shown in eq 11 13 11 r 2 i 1 n q i q p i p i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 12 n s e 1 i 1 n q i p i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where q i is the measured discharge m 3 s p i is the estimated discharge m 3 s q is the average observed discharge m 3 s p is the average estimated discharge m 3 s and n is the number of days 13 d v v r v r v r 100 where v r and v r are the observed and estimated yearly runoff volume respectively 4 results 4 1 snow cover maps in this study the modis snow cover aqua and terra combination and temporal combination of snow cover products contributed to a reduction in cloud coverage over the brb for example fig 4 a and b show the original spatial distribution of the aqua and terra snow cover products the aqua and terra combination fig 4c and two temporal combinations fig 4 d and e for 24 april 2010 cloud coverage mostly occurs at higher altitudes and because snowpack also occurs at higher altitudes cloud abstraction reduces the snow cover visibility in the aqua and terra snow cover maps fig 4 c shows the aqua and terra combination in which a substantial percentage of the cloud cover was removed in fig 4 d and e the temporal combinations removed most of the cloud pixels in the southern highlands however a few no decision pixels were added from 25 april 2010 to the product as a result the annual snow cover averages were 5 06 and 6 64 for aqua and terra respectively after the spatial combination of terra and aqua t a the annual average snow cover improved to 7 97 after the spatial combination of aqua and terra with the proceeding day t a 1day the annual average snow cover increased to 11 08 and 13 02 respectively the cloud removal techniques significantly affect the sce because the cloud free final product shows 1 96 fold more annual average snow cover with respect to the original terra images fig 5 shows the cloud coverage percentage vs the number of cloudy days during 2010 over the brb for the aqua terra aqua and terra combinations t a temporal combinations with proceeding days t a 1day and temporal combinations with previous days t a 1day as shown in fig 5 the aqua images and terra images contain remarkable cloud coverage of 147 days and 176 days respectively with cloud coverage of 0 10 the aqua and terra combination improves the snow cover product by replacing the cloud pixels and increases the number of days with 0 10 cloud cover from 176 days and 147 days respectively to 200 days in 2010 the temporal combinations improved the snow cover product more substantially and the number of days with 0 10 cloud cover increased considerably in the final products the number of cloudy days with more than 30 cloud coverage is 19 days which is almost negligible the number of days with less than 10 cloud coverage increased to 262 days which is remarkable with respect to those of aqua and terra without cloud reduction the average cloud coverages of aqua and terra over the brb during the nine year period from 2010 to 2018 were 37 66 and 31 88 respectively after the aqua and terra combination the average cloud coverage decreased to 25 9 after temporal combinations with proceeding days and previous days the average cloud coverage substantially decreased to 14 28 and 8 94 respectively because snow cover is mostly present at high altitudes where cloud coverage is also high over land cover cloud removal techniques increased the snow amount detection in the modis sce after three combinations the monthly snow cover percentage for 2010 is shown in fig 6 the snow cover products gradually improved after each combination was applied the aqua snow cover maps captured lower sces than those of terra the snow cover products gradually improved after each combination was applied the improvement in the products shows a substantial increase in sce in the winter and march during the early melting season as an example the mean sces for january 2010 in the original aqua products and original terra products are less than 10 and 15 respectively after the aqua and terra combination the mean shows a slight increase the first temporal combination with the proceeding day increases the mean sce to more than 20 and the temporal combination with the previous day increases the sce to approximately 25 of the total area the minimum and maximum sces show slight increases after the aqua and terra combination and a substantial increase is noticeable after the temporal combinations in all months as shown in fig 6 4 2 snow cover extent validation because of data scarcity in the brb regarding snow depth and snow cover the landsat 8 snow cover was selected as the baseline of accuracy determination for comparison with the modis snow cover product the landsat 8 tiles with less than 20 land surface cloud coverage were retrieved and the ndsi process was applied to classify the land and snow over the study area for 82 different days the modis snow cover product was clipped with landsat 8 images on the same day the sces on landsat 8 and modis on the same recorded days were compared using linear regression fig 7 the comparison between modis and landsat 8 shows significant agreement with an r 2 of 0 924 to find a better understanding of the classification agreement between landsat 8 and modis snow products a confusion matrix was adopted the modis and landsat 8 sces at elevations higher than 1500 m were matched and subjected to pixel by pixel examination the result of the confusion matrix is presented in table a1 the modis and landsat 8 sce show good agreement in march april may and june where long lasting snow is present the classification accuracy shows a decrease during winter in december january and february however the modis sce shows an overestimation with respect to landsat 8 the overestimation can be attributed to the coarser resolution 500 m of modis than that of landsat 8 30 m and snow cloud confusion from the misclassification of clouds with ice content clouds that were shaded by other clouds and clouds with reflection characteristics similar to that of snow crawford 2015 presented systematic overestimation results for modis terra snow cover c6 with respect to landsat the present study reports strong spatial and temporal linear agreement and a root mean square error rmse between modis terra and landsat sces that was always less than 10 hall et al 2001 also used a limited number of field measurements and landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm data when available for the validation of the modis snow cover product this study discovered that modis snow mapping is very sensitive to mapping snow but snow maps often show more snow than reality hall et al 2001 more studies performed in mountainous regions parajka and blöschl 2008 tang et al 2013 have shown that sce estimated by modis is overestimated compared with landsat derived sce this overestimation of sce may be the result of the lower accuracy of snow classification of modis in mountainous regions induced by various factors such as slope aspect shadow and snow density with respect to the ndsi threshold value zhang et al 2019 showed that a constant value of 0 1 for this threshold is more reasonable in china and da ronco et al 2020 found that 0 2 is optimal in italian alpine catchments tong et al 2020 demonstrated that the optimal ndsi threshold values seasonally vary depending on the elevation and land cover rather than remain fixed in these recent studies many ground snow depth observations were used to determine the optimal values for the ndsi threshold however as described no ground snow depth observations are available for our study region thus the constant ndsi threshold value of 0 1 was applied to differentiate snow and non snow covered pixels for the study region regardless of season elevation and land cover this fixed ndsi threshold value might also affect the overestimation of modis sce and should be investigated for the effect of varying ndsi thresholds on snow cover in future work 4 3 snowmelt runoff the srm was employed to estimate the daily discharge over the brb using the remote sensing data for sce and hydrometeorological data as input fig 8 the simulation was run over the brb for three years from 2012 to 2014 the simulation was run with five sce input data a t t a t a 1 day and t a 1 day and without the intervention of snow in the daily discharge the observed daily discharge at the most downstream station r i b as shown in fig 8 was used to validate the estimated srm daily discharges the six simulation results are shown in fig 9 and the simulated discharges show agreement with the recorded daily discharge at the station the simulation reflects the extreme event relatively well however the model could not capture the small variations in the discharge during the steady runoff flow in the dry season from june to september the effect of cloud removal on the daily discharge is more noticeable during the snowfall and rapid snowmelt period between december and may for the maximum snow cover each year the model captured the seasonal variation in the discharge well and shows agreement with the observed discharge with r 2 values of 0 60 0 63 and n s e values of 0 48 0 62 for the final sce product the simulations were run with and without the intervention of snow to determine the contribution of snow to the discharge and examine the applicability of the modis cloud removal techniques for snow cover mapping except for the year 2012 the model statistics declined noticeably after aqua and terra sces were applied as inputs for the srm with more than 10 r2 and 15 r2 for aqua and terra sces respectively compared with the simulation without snowmelt contribution the model statistics gradually improved after the processed sce data were applied as input to the srm and the volume difference percentage improved significantly from 2012 to 2014 5 discussion 5 1 cloud removal modis satellite sces are potentially appealing for hydrological studies because of their high temporal and spatial resolutions and the use of two parallel satellite observations with a few hours difference in orbits however cloud obstruction is a crucial issue preventing the effective use of optical satellite remotely sensed sces many scholars have focused on cloud removal techniques to improve the sce quality of modis satellites hall et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008 2006 parajka and blöschl 2008 reported 63 annual average cloud cover for aqua images which was reduced to 52 after the terra and aqua combination 46 after the spatial filter 34 after the 1 day temporal filter and 4 after the 7 day temporal filter applications in gafurov and bárdossy 2009 a six step combination was used for cloud removal from modis aqua and terra for example as a result for 12 february 2003 the cloud covers for aqua terra spatial combination 1 day temporal combination 2 day temporal combination of previous days 2 day temporal combination of proceeding days elevation filter for maximum elevation and elevation filter for minimum elevations are 66 9 91 8 65 2 40 1 29 27 7 22 9 and 0 0 respectively moreover the current study reports cloud coverages of 37 66 31 88 25 9 14 28 and 8 94 for aqua terra spatial combination temporal combination of proceeding days and temporal combination of previous days respectively comparing the current study result with previous works emphasizes that the cloud reduction rate is more efficient and higher for temporal combinations than for spatial combinations after applying the modis adaptive spatiotemporal weighted method astwm li et al 2017 also reported that after each combination the cloudiness decreased gradually and the sces and land surface observations were improved additionally li et al 2017 investigated the two indices of snow cover days scd and snow fraction over the hengduan mountains and showed an improved scd and a decreased coefficient of variation cv with elevation because clouds tend to accumulate at high elevations where seasonal snow accumulations occur cloud removal improves the performance of remotely sensed snow cover data in hydrological modelling many studies improved areal snow depletion curves using cloud removal techniques for remotely sensed snow cover data gao et al 2010 li et al 2017 the main aim of all these studies is to reduce cloud obstruction using different filters and techniques by merging data and different filters the cloud obstruction was reduced but so was the accuracy parajka and blöschl 2008 therefore using fewer combinations is more desirable to reduce cloud coverage and maintain good agreement with actual on site conditions in a case study in the elaho river basin nitin 2004 modis 8 day sce with less cloud coverage was retrieved and used the same values for all days of the months as the input to the srm in conclusion the simulation showed that the srm can roughly predict seasonal and yearly trends but not daily fluctuations nitin 2004 however few other studies have reported satisfactory simulation results on a daily basis using modis 8 day sce hayat et al 2019 li and williams 2008 importantly li and williams 2008 reported underestimations and poor depiction of the peak flows in the simulation period in previous studies cloud obstruction in modis sce products was emphasized as a major reason for omitting harmonic and consistent sce inputs from the model on the other hand the occurrence of high cloud coverage days in the early melting season in a mountainous region is unavoidable in optical satellites 5 2 sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to cloud cover the snowmelt season in the brb starts in march when the temperature begins increasing most of the accumulated snow will be melted by early june the simulation results of the srm in fig 9 show the estimated discharge with and without snowmelt contribution in the streamflow no significant difference between these two conditions was observed from june to september the snowmelt contribution to the daily discharge is noticeable during the melting season especially during late march and may when extreme flood events and peak discharges occurred because of the increase in the temperature and rainfall which contributed to rapid snow melting the snowmelt contribution to daily discharge is reflected in the estimated discharge hydrograph noticeably where extreme discharge has been recorded at the observation stations fig 10 shows the statistics and volume difference from the sensitivity tests of the srm to the input sces for the model performance evaluation from 2012 to 2014 in terms of r2 the results without snowmelt input are almost identical to or even better than those with combined snowmelt input in 2012 however in 2013 and 2014 the results with combined snowmelt input depict clear improvements in terms of nse in all years from 2012 to 2014 the srm results with combined snowmelt input are clearly improved compared to those without snowmelt input in terms of the volume differences in river discharge the srm performances with combined snowmelt input for 2012 and 2014 are substantially improved compared to those without snowmelt in 2013 the volume difference with snowmelt presented negative values while that without snowmelt showed positive values however the magnitudes of the final results are almost identical based on the statistics the srm performances in terms of the simulated discharges are gradually improved as the cloud cover is reduced in the estimated sce input interestingly the srm performances with direct sce from the modis aqua or terra product are degraded compared to those without snowmelt input thus careful attention is needed when applying the modis snow cover products directly to snowmelt runoff modelling as an input variable 5 3 effects of the recession coefficient the recession coefficient k is an important parameter in the srm because 1 k determines the portion of daily snowmelt water that contributes to the daily discharge immediately in the first term of the governing equation eq 1 and k shows the decrease in discharge with respect to the previous day in the second term of the equation usually analysing the historical daily discharge is a desirable way to determine the k value accurate estimation of the k value highly affects the srm output result because it shows the decrease in discharge without the effect of rainfall and snowmelt on the daily discharge the hydrological regime of the river can vary with the seasonality in the study area because of the difference in the discharge amount in each season however seasonality refers not to the four seasons but to the hydrological condition of the site in this study the seasonality was determined based on the historical discharge precipitation temperature and sce shown in fig 8 the hydrological regime was split into three seasons the rainy season melting season and dry season in the rainy season from november to february most of the precipitation occurs and snow accumulation occurs in the highlands in the melting season from march to june a large sce will disappear and meltwater will join the streamflow in the dry season from july to october the sce will almost disappear and the streamflow will be charged from the reservoirs and springs that are located upstream and alongside the river another important variable that can significantly affect k is the topographic condition and subsurface flow condition of the study area in mountainous basins the brb starts from highlands in the south and flows through flatlands in the north and the topographic condition is not homogenous along the river from upstream to downstream therefore k was determined for each zone in the srm based on the historical data of the observation station nearest the zones 6 conclusions the spatiotemporal combination technique was successfully applied to the modis aqua and terra snow cover products to reduce cloud cover and improve accuracy in the daily sce estimate in the brb of northern afghanistan for more than 9 years from january 2010 to december 2018 the cloud coverage in the satellite images is gradually reduced as the step by step combination proceeds the average cloud coverage of the resulting combined images for nine years was substantially reduced to 8 9 from 37 6 and 31 8 of the original aqua products and terra products respectively the modis snow cover products are also compared for validation with the landsat 8 satellite images which shows acceptable agreement with r 2 0 924 snowmelt runoff modelling with the srm was then performed with the estimated sce using the spatiotemporal combination as input variables with observed temperature and rainfall datasets the srm simulated runoff is compared with the observed daily river discharges in the balkhab river which shows agreement with r 2 0 60 n s e 0 484 and a volume difference of d v 12 57 moreover the sensitivity of different cloud covers in the sce input values to the srm was tested to investigate the effects of varying sces produced at each step of the spatiotemporal combinations for simulated runoff the test results clearly indicate that the accuracy of the simulated runoff from the srm by the spatiotemporal combination approach gradually increases as the cloud cover in the sce input gradually decreases interestingly the srm performances with the sce input directly from the modis aqua or terra product without any combination processes are degraded compared to those without snow cover input thus caution is needed when directly applying the modis snow cover products to snowmelt runoff modelling as an input variable the estimated sces from remote sensing data are valuable input sources for snowmelt runoff modelling in the absence of ground based snow measurements in afghanistan and other data scarce mountainous regions this study also illustrates 1 the importance of long term snow cover data and ground measurements 2 how important and useful long term snow hydrological modelling is for sustainable water resource management and 3 a preferred example srm case study for data scarce regions as the forecast of water availability and discharge peaks depend largely on snow and snowmelt conditions in high mountainous regions this study illustrates that accurate and up to date

8184,study region the balkhab river basin in northern afghanistan study focus snowmelt is a primary water resource in mountainous regions of the world remotely sensed snow cover products are useful for obtaining spatial snow information but have unsolved cloud cover issues thus this study demonstrates 1 a spatiotemporal combination approach for reducing cloud cover and improving the accuracy in snow cover extent sce estimation from 2010 to 2018 using the modis daily snow cover product version 6 and 2 the sensitivity of snowmelt runoff modelling to sce inputs with different levels of cloud cover from 2012 to 2014 using a snowmelt runoff model srm new hydrological insights for the region the average cloud coverages of the original modis aqua and terra daily products for the study region and period were reduced from 37 66 and 31 88 to 25 9 after the spatial combination and to 14 28 and 8 94 respectively after the temporal combination the temporal combination with previous and following days yielded a substantial improvement in cloud removal the sensitivity of the srm results to the different levels of clouds clearly depicts the gradual improvement in the simulated snowmelt runoffs with a cloud cover reduction in the sce input interestingly the srm performances with the direct sce input from aqua or terra products are degraded in some cases compared to those without sce input in the srm thus careful attention is needed when directly applying remotely sensed snow cover products as input variables in snow hydrological modelling the simulated snowmelt runoffs are improved substantially in the melting season in march may the snowmelt runoff peaks in may are due to the temperature increase and are mainly responsible for extreme floods in the arid study region this study contributes further to agricultural water resource management for crop cultivation during the dry season from june to september and to flood protection during the snowmelt runoff peaks in may with a potential hydraulic engineering solution keywords snow cover cloud cover ndsi snowmelt runoff model snow hydrological modelling water resource management afghanistan 1 introduction snow cover which is a vital component of the cryosphere has a crucial role in the earth s climatic system via its effect on the surface energy balance water cycle primary productivity land surface gas exchange sea level etc stocker et al 2013 in particular snow accumulation and ablation processes dominate the surface water cycle over a substantial global land area poleward of approximately 40 latitude in continental interiors and mountainous regions adam et al 2009 snowmelt is a primary source of water in the mountainous regions of the world and has a far reaching influence on areas that rely on meltwater to fill streams and reservoirs and replenish aquifers in developing countries and very remote regions with high terrain mountains ground based snow measurements are very limited because of complex topography inaccessibility and financial constraints vuyovich and jacobs 2011 therefore assessing the snow cover and volume of meltwater can be very difficult but is important for sustainable water resource management in mountainous regions information on snow cover and meltwater volume is also crucial for flooding and drought management with broad influences on political and economic implications remotely sensed satellite data can be particularly useful for obtaining inexpensive and spatially distributed and continuous snow information if the issue of accuracy in the regions can be addressed the most widely employed remote sensing products for snow are snow extent datasets from visible band sensors and snow mass retrieved as snow depth and commonly referred to as snow water equivalent swe in land surface models from microwave radiometers as reviewed by clifford 2010 many snow cover extent sce datasets are available for example the near real time ice and snow extent nise daily and global dataset by the special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis sensor armstrong and brodzik 2001 the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis onboard the terra

forster 2016 and the european remote sensing synthetic aperture radar ers sar snow cover products baghdadi et al 1997 mahmoodzada et al 2020 nagler and rott 1997 shi and dozier 1997 among them modis terra snow products have been applied in snow hydrology science and many hydrological modelling applications since 2000 andreadis and lettenmaier 2006 crawford 2015 frei et al 2012 hall et al 2012 homan et al 2011 mcguire et al 2006 including as input to snowmelt runoff modelling for water resource management butt and bilal 2011 a variety of snow and ice products are produced from modis sensors and the products are available at a variety of spatial and temporal resolutions the modis snow product suite begins with a 500 m resolution as a 2330 km swath snow cover map which is then gridded to a sinusoidal grid the standard modis daily global fractional snow cover fsc climate modelling grid cmg map product is generated at 0 05 resolution approximately 5 km at the equator wmo 2012 p 26 modis snow cover products have been reported to have high accuracy maurer et al 2003 parajka and blöschl 2006 according to wang et al 2008 modis snow cover products showed 94 accuracy for snow and 99 accuracy for land in the northern xingjian region china under clear sky conditions however cloud cover in satellite snow products remains a major issue that adversely affects the extraction of daily snow extent and limits the direct use of products in environmental and hydrological studies abudu et al 2012 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 to overcome the cloud cover in modis snow cover products attempts were successfully made to remove cloud covered pixels by applying a spatiotemporal combination approach gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 as described snowmelt water is crucial for planning management and water resource assessment in mountainous terrain and basins thus snowmelt modelling is a significant element for predicting runoff from high elevation snow covered and or glaciated regions in general snowmelt and subsequent runoff modelling are calculated using two approaches the energy balance method and the temperature degree day method the former method can be employed when sufficient field data are available to solve physical governing equations whereas the latter method can be more useful in the absence of sufficient data tayal senzeba et al 2015 the snowmelt runoff model srm which was developed by martinec 1975 is a conceptual semi distributed and temperature degree day method for simulating and predicting daily runoff from snowmelt and rainfall in mountain basins the srm has been broadly applied to over 112 basins at various geographical locations and spatial ranges in 29 countries martinec et al 2008 among other countries boudhar et al 2009 fuladipanah and jorabloo 2012 ma et al 2013 panday et al 2014 riggs and hall 2004 sharma et al 2012 these applications revealed that srm simulations enable adequate accuracy with satellite snow cover data and even incomplete or fragmented ground data tayal senzeba et al 2015 thus remote sensing snow cover products are particularly useful for providing spatially distributed snow cover input data for snowmelt runoff modelling boudhar et al 2009 afghanistan is a landlocked developing country that is dominated by a dry climate where most of the region is represented by arid land and is highly reliant on the agricultural sector 18 6 of the gross domestic product gdp was derived from the agricultural sector in 2018 hussainzada and lee 2021 atefi and miura 2021 nsia 2019 a large fraction of the surface and underground water in afghanistan is influenced by the snow accumulated in the highlands and glaciers although snowmelt and glaciers have a key role in the country s water resources few studies have been conducted in gafurov and bárdossy 2009 the six step combination technique was used for cloud removal from the modis snow cover datasets for 2003 in vuyovich and jacobs 2011 a study in the upper helmand watershed in afghanistan was conducted using advanced microwave scanning radiometer for eos amsr e passive microwave datasets and station data for snow water equivalent estimation from 2003 to 2009 during the winter seasons snowmelt runoff modelling was conducted to estimate the river discharge in the salang river basin and upper kabul river basin by directly using modis snow cover datasets and metrological data for 2 years from 2009 to 2011 arian et al 2015 rasouli et al 2016 however no snow hydrological modelling for water resource management has been reported in northern afghanistan in this study we apply the spatiotemporal combination approach to improve the accuracy of sce estimation with modis snow cover product version c6 for 9 years from january 2010 to december 2018 which substantially improved the cloud removal and estimation accuracy of the sce in the balkhab river basin in northern afghanistan the estimated sce is then applied as the input variable to the srm with ground based temperature and rainfall data to simulate the daily river discharge in the balkhab river the resulting srm runoff is compared to daily discharge records to determine if the srm simulation is useful for water resource management we also illustrate the sensitivity of srm results to snow cover extent inputs before and after the spatiotemporal combination is applied by considering the varying levels of cloud removal this research addresses the following issues for this study region 1 the need for increased awareness of the importance of snow cover data and ground measurement 2 how to produce sce data with publicly available data sources and how to improve their quality with remote sensing skills 3 the importance and usefulness of long term snow hydrological modelling for water resource management and 4 a preferred example srm case study for data scarce regions moreover the findings in this study can contribute to the improvement of hydrological modelling for water resource management and flood protection with remotely sensed sce in mountainous regions with arid to semiarid climates where field observations of snow cover are expensive and difficult in addition the results demonstrate the hydrological model performance using direct satellite sce as input compared to those without sce inputs thus careful consideration of the level of cloud presence in optical satellite products must be taken when hydrological models are applied to similar climatic regions 2 materials 2 1 study area the balkhab river basin brb is located in the northern water basin of afghanistan the northern water basin is divided into four main rivers the balkhab river khulm river sar i pul river and shirin tagab river all the water in the northern basin is consumed within the watershed the rivers in the northern basin dry up in the irrigation canals or desert sands before reaching the afghanistan border the balkhab river flows north starting from a chain of six lapis lazuli lakes in band i amir in the central highlands fig 1 the largest lake covers 490 ha and the smallest lake has a diameter of 100 m mail atlas 2004 the brb is situated from latitude 34 0 n to 37 4 n and from longitude 66 0 e to 68 0 e the brb elevation ranges from 241 4621 m and has an area of 28 846 km2 with a semiarid climate and erratic precipitation mostly between november and march with an average precipitation of 200 400 mm year reddy 2019 importantly no precipitation occurs during the summer seasons the water source for the remainder of the year is snowmelt from snow accumulated in the highlands of central afghanistan in the winter season the annual average temperature varies from 7 56 c in the highlands in the south to 18 93 c in the flatlands in the north based on the data from 2010 to 2018 provided by the ministry of energy and water islamic republic of afghanistan 2 2 dataset 2 2 1 modis data in this study the modis snow cover daily products version collection 6 c6 onboard terra mod10a1 and aqua myd10a1 with 500 m spatial resolution from 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2018 were retrieved and used in the c6 product for the modis aqua snow cover detection algorithm the quantitative image restoration qir algorithm gladkova et al 2012 was integrated with the level 2 algorithm the qir restores the aqua modis band 6 to scientifically usable data for the snow algorithm whereas in c5 aqua band 7 was used instead of band 6 because of the nonfunctional detectors in band 6 this dataset contains gridded snow cover and albedo derived from radiance data acquired by modis the snow cover was identified using the normalized difference snow index ndsi and a series of screens that are designed to alleviate errors and flag uncertain snow cover detections to minimize the snow cover detection error the snow conversion approach which detects snow based on the reflectance and then screens false snow detection was applied riggs et al 2016 of the 3287 days in 9 years the records for 14 days in terra snow cover products and 5 days in aqua snow cover products were missed in the land process distribution active archive centre lp daac the modis aqua and terra snow cover products were reclassified for further analysis table 1 shows the key values for land cover classification and new classifications made in the current study including the ndsi threshold value for differentiating snow and non snow covered pixels an ndsi threshold value of 0 1 was applied such that those pixels with ndsi values 0 1 are considered non snow because of the large uncertainty in snow detection for low ndsi values 2 2 2 hydrometeorological data dem and zonation at least three decades of wars started in the 1970s in afghanistan these wars caused the interruption of water resource data collection in the country although older hydrological records were destroyed 169 stream gauges were installed nationwide under the us international cooperation administration which was the ancestor institution of the us geological survey usgs shroder and ahmadzai 2016 five hydrometeorological stations rabat i bala r i b pul i baraq p i b delmarogh delm doshqadam dosh and nazdik i nayak n i n operate in the brb recording water resource data table 2 in the runoff modelling setup the minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitations were obtained daily from the five observations to validate the runoff modelling results the daily river discharge at the r i b station which is the most downstream station is used the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dataset was employed as a digital elevation model dem in this study with a pixel resolution of 30 m and a vertical accuracy of 15 m farr and kobrick 2000 salerno et al 2003 because the study area the brb basin is large and starts from the highlands in the south and transitions to the flatlands in the north fig 1 the variations in precipitation temperature model parameters and hydrological regime with elevation can affect the srm results thus the brb catchment which ranges from 241 m to 4621 m in elevation was divided into nine elevation zones with an approximately 500 m range in elevation in each zone as suggested for snowmelt runoff modelling in martinec et al 2008 the average hypsometric elevation for each zone was determined from the regional elevation curve retrieved from the dem of the study area table 3 shows the minimum and maximum elevations mean hypsometric elevation average elevation and area of each elevation zone 2 2 3 landsat 8 data landsat 8 collection 1 and level 1 data were retrieved over the study area for the period of 21 may 2013 to 13 december 2018 for the comparison of the resulting sce from modis data the data with less than 20 land surface cloud coverage for the entire period were selected the entire study area was covered by six tiles 154034 154035 154036 155034 155035 and 155036 but based on availability two or three tiles were downloaded on 82 different days for comparison 3 methodology in this study modis snow cover data were processed to minimize cloud abstraction and provide an acceptable sce for the study area to overcome data scarcity modis snow cover products were subjected to three combinations with the aim of decreasing cloud cover and the resulting sce was employed as input in snowmelt runoff modelling to reconstruct the hydrograph for the 2012 2014 period to examine the quality of the generated data fig 2 shows the general flow of the methodology 3 1 snow cover mapping 3 1 1 combination of aqau and terra products the satellite data derived from mod10a1 terra and myd10a1 aqua capture different cloud obstructions because of different orbits modis aqua and terra capture the earth s surface condition three hours apart to optimize the cloud free surface view and provide the opportunity for sub daily time scale investigations nsidc 2020 this difference creates the opportunity to replace the cloud pixels with land or snow after merging the aqua and terra snow covers on the same day in this combination the cloud pixels in terra images were replaced with the same pixels in aqua where land or snow was captured a complete explanation of the aqua and terra combination procedure is given by eq 1 gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 1 s x y n min s x y n a s x y n t where x and y are the spatial coordinates in longitude and latitude respectively n is the day index of pixel s and s a and s t show pixels of aqua and terra respectively in this combination the pixels that are marked as clouds in terra but marked as land snow no decision missing data or water in aqua will be automatically replaced by the same pixel from the aqua image the m i n function replaces the cloud pixels with any other class by comparing the flag of cloud pixels with that of other pixels because the newly assigned flag of clouds is the highest value table 1 3 1 2 temporal combinations the temporal combination follows the same concept for further reduction of the cloud cover as the aqua and terra combination in the temporal combination step the images were subjected to two additional combinations first the combined aqua and terra products were combined with their proceeding day image to replace only the cloud pixels with non cloud pixels if any existed in the second step the outputs of step one were combined with those of previous days to minimize the cloud pixels in the images the temporal combinations were represented by eq 2 based on the assumption that snowmelt on cloudy days can be disregarded because the main source of snowmelt is solar radiation a vast proportion of which will be reflected by clouds on snow pixels gafurov and bárdossy 2009 parajka and blöschl 2008 2 s x y n min s x y n 1 s x y n 1 in these combinations the cloud pixels will be replaced with other classes only if the pixel catches clouds during the day but catches any other classes during the proceeding day s x y n 1 or the previous day s x y n 1 3 1 3 landsat 8 ndsi and validation of the modis snow cover product the landsat 8 data with less than 20 land surface cloud cover were retrieved and assumed to be the ground truth for comparison with the modis snow cover datasets the study area was covered by six tiles where three tiles covered the eastern part and three additional tiles covered the western part with different temporal resolutions the tiles on the same date with less than 20 cloud coverage were mosaiced to a single file bands 3 and 6 of landsat 8 were processed to the ndsi as explained in section 2 2 1 the landsat 8 ndsi products classified the entire study area into snow areas or non snow areas the modis snow cover products were clipped for the same date and area where the landsat 8 ndsi snow cover was processed for the comparison between both products the confusion matrix is a summary of the prediction result on a classification problem to describe the prediction model performance cabrera and lee 2019 cabrera and lee 2020 because no ground observation of the snow cover and depth in the brb is available the landsat 8 ndsi products were used as the foundation for validating modis snow cover the landsat 8 ndsi products were resampled to the same resolution of 500 m as modis and the areas with elevations higher than 1500 m were clipped for comparison for the sces from both satellites the confusion matrix and measures were estimated based on the 2 2 matrix in table 4 in comparison all classes other than snow in the modis snow cover map were considered snow free the correctly predicted snow and snow free pixels are indicated by true positives tps and false positives fps while the misclassified pixels are indicated by false positives fps and false negatives fns the measures of positive predictivity value ppv negative predictivity value npv overall accuracy oa specificity and sensitivity were estimated for 51 days 3 2 snowmelt runoff modelling the srm was developed for modelling small watersheds in europe martinec et al 2008 based on eq 3 3 q n 1 c s n a n t n δ t n s n c r n p n a 10 000

water will affect the streamflow while melt conditions occur when the temperature is sufficiently warm vice versa rainfall will immediately affect the streamflow the sce for each zone was extracted as the percentage of the zone total area on a daily basis from the modis products with different levels of cloud coverage 3 3 srm model setup seven parameters viz the temperature lapse rate critical temperature degree day factor runoff coefficient lag time recession coefficient and rainfall contribution rca were employed to run the srm the parameters were calibrated for 2014 and then applied to estimate the daily discharge from 2012 to 2013 the parameter values of the srm for each zone are shown in table 5 because the variation in temperature is an important factor that helps us assess snowmelt in high mountains this variation in temperature with elevation is a crucial factor for hydrological modelling tayal senzeba et al 2015 the temperature lapse rate was obtained from historical nine year daily average observations at the brb stations at different altitudes the precipitation was determined as rainfall or snow based on the critical temperature t c r i t t c r i t was determined based on the historical records of snowfall and mean daily temperature the snowmelt contribution to the surface runoff was estimated using eq 5 5 m a t where m is the daily snowmelt depth cm a is the degree day factor cm c 1 d 1 and t is the number of degree days c d the daily mean temperature is assigned to the degree day and when the degree day becomes negative it will automatically be set to zero the degree day factor a ranges from 0 35 0 6 martinec and rango 1986 and lower values are recommended for new snow no up to date record is available for the snowmelt characteristics in the study region therefore the minimum values for a were selected to estimate the snowmelt depth the time lag shows the time by which the increasing discharge lags behind the increase in temperature martinec et al 2008 the time lag can be indicated from the past year hydrograph the runoff coefficient is responsible for runoff losses for example the disparity among available water rainfall snowmelt and outflow water rca has two options in the srm rca 0 or rca 1 if zero the rainfall will be retained by the snowpack and if switched to 1 the rainfall throughout the area will contribute to the streamflow the user should decide when to switch the option the recession coefficient k is a crucial parameter of srm because 1 k in eq 1 is the amount of daily meltwater that is instantly reflected in the streamflow the recession coefficient k also varies along the streamflow with the topographical conditions presence of subsurface flow such as springs or other hydrological processes along the streamflow therefore the existing historical discharge record is applied to determine the optimal value of k the values of q and q n 1 are plotted against each other using the following linear regression 6 k n 1 q n 1 q n x c q n y c where x c is a constant with the same units m3 s of q and y c is a dimensionless constant that must be determined by solving the following equations the results are shown in table 5 7 k 1 x c q 1 y c 8 k 2 x c q 2 y c 9 log k 1 log x c y c log q 1 10 log k 2 log x c y c log q 2 the climate data and snow cover area inputs for the srm are the minimum and maximum precipitation the average temperature and the percentage of snow cover for each elevation zone the five station observations were used as the climate data input into the srm the temperatures were adjusted based on the temperature lapse rate and mean elevation of the zones the sces were extracted from the snow cover products separately for each elevation zone as the ratio of sce to the total area of the elevation zone the snow depletion curves for the nine elevation zones are summarized in fig 3 3 4 performance evaluation to assess the performance of the srm with and without estimated sces statistical indices were used for validation such as the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient n s e and volume difference d v as shown in eq 11 13 11 r 2 i 1 n q i q p i p i 1 n q i q 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 12 n s e 1 i 1 n q i p i 2 i 1 n q i q 2 where q i is the measured discharge m 3 s p i is the estimated discharge m 3 s q is the average

respectively 4 results 4 1 snow cover maps in this study the modis snow cover aqua and terra combination and temporal combination of snow cover products contributed to a reduction in cloud coverage over the brb for example fig 4 a and b show the original spatial distribution of the aqua and terra snow cover products the aqua and terra combination fig 4c and two temporal combinations fig 4 d and e for 24 april 2010 cloud coverage mostly occurs at higher altitudes and because snowpack also occurs at higher altitudes cloud abstraction reduces the snow cover visibility in the aqua and terra snow cover maps fig 4 c shows the aqua and terra combination in which a substantial percentage of the cloud cover was removed in fig 4 d and e the temporal combinations removed most of the cloud pixels in the southern highlands however a few no decision pixels were added from 25 april 2010 to the product as a result the annual snow cover averages were 5 06 and 6 64 for aqua and terra respectively after the spatial combination of terra and aqua t a the annual average snow cover improved to 7 97 after the spatial combination of aqua and terra with the proceeding day t a 1day the annual average snow cover increased to 11 08 and 13 02 respectively the cloud removal techniques significantly affect the sce because the cloud free final product shows 1 96 fold more annual average snow cover with respect to the original terra images fig 5 shows the cloud coverage percentage vs the number of cloudy days during 2010 over the brb for the aqua terra aqua and terra combinations t a temporal combinations with proceeding days t a 1day and temporal combinations with previous days t a 1day as shown in fig 5 the aqua images and terra images contain remarkable cloud coverage of 147 days and 176 days respectively with cloud coverage of 0 10 the aqua and terra combination improves the snow cover product by replacing the cloud pixels and increases the number of days with 0 10 cloud cover from 176 days and 147 days respectively to 200 days in 2010 the temporal combinations improved the snow cover product more substantially and the number of days with 0 10 cloud cover increased considerably in the final products the number of cloudy days with more than 30 cloud coverage is 19 days which is almost negligible the number of days with less than 10 cloud coverage increased to 262 days which is remarkable with respect to those of aqua and terra without cloud reduction the average cloud coverages of aqua and terra over the brb during the nine year period from 2010 to 2018 were 37 66 and 31 88 respectively after the aqua and terra combination the average cloud coverage decreased to 25 9 after temporal combinations with proceeding days and previous days the average cloud coverage substantially decreased to 14 28 and 8 94 respectively because snow cover is mostly present at high altitudes where cloud coverage is also high over land cover cloud removal techniques increased the snow amount detection in the modis sce after three combinations the monthly snow cover percentage for 2010 is shown in fig 6 the snow cover products gradually improved after each combination was applied the aqua snow cover maps captured lower sces than those of terra the snow cover products gradually improved after each combination was applied the improvement in the products shows a substantial increase in sce in the winter and march during the early melting season as an example the mean sces for january 2010 in the original aqua products and original terra products are less than 10 and 15 respectively after the aqua and terra combination the mean shows a slight increase the first temporal combination with the proceeding day increases the mean sce to more than 20 and the temporal combination with the previous day increases the sce to approximately 25 of the total area the minimum and maximum sces show slight increases after the aqua and terra combination and a substantial increase is noticeable after the temporal combinations in all months as shown in fig 6 4 2 snow cover extent validation because of data scarcity in the brb regarding snow depth and snow cover the landsat 8 snow cover was selected as the baseline of accuracy determination for comparison with the modis snow cover product the landsat 8 tiles with less than 20 land surface cloud coverage were retrieved and the ndsi process was applied to classify the land and snow over the study area for 82 different days the modis snow cover product was clipped with landsat 8 images on the same day the sces on landsat 8 and modis on the same recorded days were compared using linear regression fig 7 the comparison between modis and landsat 8 shows significant agreement with an r 2 of 0 924 to find a better understanding of the classification agreement between landsat 8 and modis snow products a confusion matrix was adopted the modis and landsat 8 sces at elevations higher than 1500 m were matched and subjected to pixel by pixel examination the result of the confusion matrix is presented in table a1 the modis and landsat 8 sce show good agreement in march april may and june where long lasting snow is present the classification accuracy shows a decrease during winter in december january and february however the modis sce shows an overestimation with respect to landsat 8 the overestimation can be attributed to the coarser resolution 500 m of modis than that of landsat 8 30 m and snow cloud confusion from the misclassification of clouds with ice content clouds that were shaded by other clouds and clouds with reflection characteristics similar to that of snow crawford 2015 presented systematic overestimation results for modis terra snow cover c6 with respect to landsat the present study reports strong spatial and temporal linear agreement and a root mean square error rmse between modis terra and landsat sces that was always less than 10 hall et al 2001 also used a limited number of field measurements and landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus etm data when available for the validation of the modis snow cover product this study discovered that modis snow mapping is very sensitive to mapping snow but snow maps often show more snow than reality hall et al 2001 more studies performed in mountainous regions parajka and blöschl 2008 tang et al 2013 have shown that sce estimated by modis is overestimated compared with landsat derived sce this overestimation of sce may be the result of the lower accuracy of snow classification of modis in mountainous regions induced by various factors such as slope aspect shadow and snow density with respect to the ndsi threshold value zhang et al 2019 showed that a constant value of 0 1 for this threshold is more reasonable in china and da ronco et al 2020 found that 0 2 is optimal in italian alpine catchments tong et al 2020 demonstrated that the optimal ndsi threshold values seasonally vary depending on the elevation and land cover rather than remain fixed in these recent studies many ground snow depth observations were used to determine the optimal values for the ndsi threshold however as described no ground snow depth observations are available for our study region thus the constant ndsi threshold value of 0 1 was applied to differentiate snow and non snow covered pixels for the study region regardless of season elevation and land cover this fixed ndsi threshold value might also affect the overestimation of modis sce and should be investigated for the effect of varying ndsi thresholds on snow cover in future work 4 3 snowmelt runoff the srm was employed to estimate the daily discharge over the brb using the remote sensing data for sce and hydrometeorological data as input fig 8 the simulation was run over the brb for three years from 2012 to 2014 the simulation was run with five sce input data a t t a t a 1 day and t a 1 day and without the intervention of snow in the daily discharge the observed daily discharge at the most downstream station r i b as shown in fig 8 was used to validate the estimated srm daily discharges the six simulation results are shown in fig 9 and the simulated discharges show agreement with the recorded daily discharge at the station the simulation reflects the extreme event relatively well however the model could not capture the small variations in the discharge during the steady runoff flow in the dry season from june to september the effect of cloud removal on the daily discharge is more noticeable during the snowfall and rapid snowmelt period between december and may for the maximum snow cover each year the model captured the seasonal variation in the discharge well and shows agreement with the observed discharge with r 2 values of 0 60 0 63 and n s e values of 0 48 0 62 for the final sce product the simulations were run with and without the intervention of snow to determine the contribution of snow to the discharge and examine the applicability of the modis cloud removal techniques for snow cover mapping except for the year 2012 the model statistics declined noticeably after aqua and terra sces were applied as inputs for the srm with more than 10 r2 and 15 r2 for aqua and terra sces respectively compared with the simulation without snowmelt contribution the model statistics gradually improved after the processed sce data were applied as input to the srm and the volume difference percentage improved significantly from 2012 to 2014 5 discussion 5 1 cloud removal modis satellite sces are potentially appealing for hydrological studies because of their high temporal and spatial resolutions and the use of two parallel satellite observations with a few hours difference in orbits however cloud obstruction is a crucial issue preventing the effective use of optical satellite remotely sensed sces many scholars have focused on cloud removal techniques to improve the sce quality of modis satellites hall et al 2010 parajka and blöschl 2008 2006 parajka and blöschl 2008 reported 63 annual average cloud cover for aqua images which was reduced to 52 after the terra and aqua combination 46 after the spatial filter 34 after the 1 day temporal filter and 4 after the 7 day temporal filter applications in gafurov and bárdossy 2009 a six step combination was used for cloud removal from modis aqua and terra for example as a result for 12 february 2003 the cloud covers for aqua terra spatial combination 1 day temporal combination 2 day temporal combination of previous days 2 day temporal combination of proceeding days elevation filter for maximum elevation and elevation filter for minimum elevations are 66 9 91 8 65 2 40 1 29 27 7 22 9 and 0 0 respectively moreover the current study reports cloud coverages of 37 66 31 88 25 9 14 28 and 8 94 for aqua terra spatial combination temporal combination of proceeding days and temporal combination of previous days respectively comparing the current study result with previous works emphasizes that the cloud reduction rate is more efficient and higher for temporal combinations than for spatial combinations after applying the modis adaptive spatiotemporal weighted method astwm li et al 2017 also reported that after each combination the cloudiness decreased gradually and the sces and land surface observations were improved additionally li et al 2017 investigated the two indices of snow cover days scd and snow fraction over the hengduan mountains and showed an improved scd and a decreased coefficient of variation cv with elevation because clouds tend to accumulate at high elevations where seasonal snow accumulations occur cloud removal improves the performance of remotely sensed snow cover data in hydrological modelling many studies improved areal snow depletion curves using cloud removal techniques for remotely sensed snow cover data gao et al 2010 li et al 2017 the main aim of all these studies is to reduce cloud obstruction using different filters and techniques by merging data and different filters the cloud obstruction was reduced but so was the accuracy parajka and blöschl 2008 therefore using fewer combinations is more desirable to reduce cloud coverage and maintain good agreement with actual on site conditions in a case study in the elaho river basin nitin 2004 modis 8 day sce with less cloud coverage was retrieved and used the same values for all days of the months as the input to the srm in conclusion the simulation showed that the srm can roughly predict seasonal and yearly trends but not daily fluctuations nitin 2004 however few other studies have reported satisfactory simulation results on a daily basis using modis 8 day sce hayat et al 2019 li and williams 2008 importantly li and williams 2008 reported underestimations and poor depiction of the peak flows in the simulation period in previous studies cloud obstruction in modis sce products was emphasized as a major reason for omitting harmonic and consistent sce inputs from the model on the other hand the occurrence of high cloud coverage days in the early melting season in a mountainous region is unavoidable in optical satellites 5 2 sensitivity of snowmelt runoff to cloud cover the snowmelt season in the brb starts in march when the temperature begins increasing most of the accumulated snow will be melted by early june the simulation results of the srm in fig 9 show the estimated discharge with and without snowmelt contribution in the streamflow no significant difference between these two conditions was observed from june to september the snowmelt contribution to the daily discharge is noticeable during the melting season especially during late march and may when extreme flood events and peak discharges occurred because of the increase in the temperature and rainfall which contributed to rapid snow melting the snowmelt contribution to daily discharge is reflected in the estimated discharge hydrograph noticeably where extreme discharge has been recorded at the observation stations fig 10 shows the statistics and volume difference from the sensitivity tests of the srm to the input sces for the model performance evaluation from 2012 to 2014 in terms of r2 the results without snowmelt input are almost identical to or even better than those with combined snowmelt input in 2012 however in 2013 and 2014 the results with combined snowmelt input depict clear improvements in terms of nse in all years from 2012 to 2014 the srm results with combined snowmelt input are clearly improved compared to those without snowmelt input in terms of the volume differences in river discharge the srm performances with combined snowmelt input for 2012 and 2014 are substantially improved compared to those without snowmelt in 2013 the volume difference with snowmelt presented negative values while that without snowmelt showed positive values however the magnitudes of the final results are almost identical based on the statistics the srm performances in terms of the simulated discharges are gradually improved as the cloud cover is reduced in the estimated sce input interestingly the srm performances with direct sce from the modis aqua or terra product are degraded compared to those without snowmelt input thus careful attention is needed when applying the modis snow cover products directly to snowmelt runoff modelling as an input variable 5 3 effects of the recession coefficient the recession coefficient k is an important parameter in the srm because 1 k determines the portion of daily snowmelt water that contributes to the daily discharge immediately in the first term of the governing equation eq 1 and k shows the decrease in discharge with respect to the previous day in the second term of the equation usually analysing the historical daily discharge is a desirable way to determine the k value accurate estimation of the k value highly affects the srm output result because it shows the decrease in discharge without the effect of rainfall and snowmelt on the daily discharge the hydrological regime of the river can vary with the seasonality in the study area because of the difference in the discharge amount in each season however seasonality refers not to the four seasons but to the hydrological condition of the site in this study the seasonality was determined based on the historical discharge precipitation temperature and sce shown in fig 8 the hydrological regime was split into three seasons the rainy season melting season and dry season in the rainy season from november to february most of the precipitation occurs and snow accumulation occurs in the highlands in the melting season from march to june a large sce will disappear and meltwater will join the streamflow in the dry season from july to october the sce will almost disappear and the streamflow will be charged from the reservoirs and springs that are located upstream and alongside the river another important variable that can significantly affect k is the topographic condition and subsurface flow condition of the study area in mountainous basins the brb starts from highlands in the south and flows through flatlands in the north and the topographic condition is not homogenous along the river from upstream to downstream therefore k was determined for each zone in the srm based on the historical data of the observation station nearest the zones 6 conclusions the spatiotemporal combination technique was successfully applied to the modis aqua and terra snow cover products to reduce cloud cover and improve accuracy in the daily sce estimate in the brb of northern afghanistan for more than 9 years from january 2010 to december 2018 the cloud coverage in the satellite images is gradually reduced as the step by step combination proceeds the average cloud coverage of the resulting combined images for nine years was substantially reduced to 8 9 from 37 6 and 31 8 of the original aqua products and terra products respectively the modis snow cover products are also compared for validation with the landsat 8 satellite images which shows acceptable agreement with r 2 0 924 snowmelt runoff modelling with the srm was then performed with the estimated sce using the spatiotemporal combination as input variables with observed temperature and rainfall datasets the srm simulated runoff is compared with the observed daily river discharges in the balkhab river which shows agreement with r 2 0 60 n s e 0 484 and a volume difference of d v 12 57 moreover the sensitivity of different cloud covers in the sce input values to the srm was tested to investigate the effects of varying sces produced at each step of the spatiotemporal combinations for simulated runoff the test results clearly indicate that the accuracy of the simulated runoff from the srm by the spatiotemporal combination approach gradually increases as the cloud cover in the sce input gradually decreases interestingly the srm performances with the sce input directly from the modis aqua or terra product without any combination processes are degraded compared to those without snow cover input thus caution is needed when directly applying the modis snow cover products to snowmelt runoff modelling as an input variable the estimated sces from remote sensing data are valuable input sources for snowmelt runoff modelling in the absence of ground based snow measurements in afghanistan and other data scarce mountainous regions this study also illustrates 1 the importance of long term snow cover data and ground measurements 2 how important and useful long term snow hydrological modelling is for sustainable water resource management and 3 a preferred example srm case study for data scarce regions as the forecast of water availability and discharge peaks depend largely on snow and snowmelt conditions in high mountainous regions this study illustrates that accurate and up to date
