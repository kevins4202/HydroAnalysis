dried and sieved 2 mm and the soil tn content was determined using the kjeldahl method and soc content using the potassium dichromate outside heating method lu 2000 in addition the soil bulk density was determined by cutting ring method and soil tn and soc storage were calculated with eqs 1 and 2 the soil c n ratio was calculated by dividing the soc content by the soil tn content 1 tn storage tn

that than si w100 by 10 and 9 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively fig s1 fig s2 a compared with ck si w100 significantly p 0 001 increased soil tn content by 9 and 10 in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively in addition si w100 also significantly increased soil tn content than si w90 by 9 and 11 in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively fig 2 the soil tn content of 0 40 cm soil layer in 2019 was 13 significantly p 0 001 decreased than that in 2018 fig s1 compared with ck si w100 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soc contents by 17 and 12 and soc storages by 19 and 13 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively in addition si w90 significantly p 0 001 decreased soc content and storage of 0 40 cm soil layer than si w100 by 8 only in 2018 fig s1 fig s2 a si w100 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soc contents than ck by 15 and 13 in the 0 20 cm and by 20 and 10 in the 20 40 cm soil layers respectively besides si w190 also significantly decreased soc content than si w100 by 6 only in 2018 and 8 in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively fig 2 the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer in 2019 was 17 significantly p 0 001 decreased than that in 2018 fig s1 si w100 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio of 0 40 cm soil layer than ck by 9 only in 2018 and 13 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 decreased that than si w100 by 9 only in 2019 respectively fig s1 fig s2 a compared with ck si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio by 13 both in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively however si w100 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio of 20 40 cm soil layer by 6 only in 2019 fig 2 in addition there was no significantly p 0 05 difference between si w90 and si w100 the soil tn content of 0 40 cm soil layer in 2019 was 4 much p 0 05 decreased than that in 2018 fig s1 3 2 soil bacterial community the distribution of soil rhizosphere bacterial communities varied with treatments fig 3a based on the distribution of bacterial community the first two principal components pc 1 and pc 2 explained 76 and 18 in 2018 and 52 and 24 in 2019 respectively the ck si w100 and si w90 samples three replicates per treatment were quite distinct from each other the four dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 34 46 actinobacteria 15 18 chloroflexi 10 13 acidobacteria 6 13 compared with ck si w100 significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes by 10 40 and 37 but decreased that of firmicutes by 45 respectively si w90 significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes by 8 and 37 but decreased significantly p 0 05 that of actinobacteria and firmicutes by 13 and 47 respectively compared to ck furthermore si w100 and si w90 significantly increased the relative abundance of nitrospirae than ck by 48 and 20 only in 2018 and si w90 significantly decreased the relative abundance of rokubacteria by 65 only in 2019 respectively notably si w90 significantly p 0 05 decreased that of actinobacteria and acidobacteria than si w100 by 11 and 22 respectively fig 3b the rda showed that the coordinate from the first two ordination axes explained 89 29 and 63 53 of variances in 2018 and 2019 respectively in addition the sharp angle among the vector lines showed that soc content in 0 40 cm soil layer had the most important influence on the bacterial community fig s3 the correlation heatmap revealed that the relative abundances of proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were positively p 0 05 related to the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer while that of firmicutes showed a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation fig 4 3 3 correlations among soil fertility soil bacterial community and the yield of sunflower there was significant p 0 05 difference of sunflower yield between 2018 and 2019 heatmap of pearson s correlation coefficients showed that there was no significant correlation among sunflower yield and soil fertility and soil bacterial community in 2018 but there was significant correlation among sunflower yield and soc content of 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 01 r 0 813 n 9 and the relative abundance of proteobacteria p 0 05 r 0 707 n 9 and firmicutes p 0 05 r 0 698 n 9 in 2019 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soil tn content and storage our results indicated that straw interlayer si w100 increased soil tn content and storage in the 0 40 cm soil layer which were similar to many existing studies zhang et al 2015 memon et al 2018 the main reasons were that straw deep returning could be converted into soil nitrogen which directly increased soil tn content zhang et al 2015 and it also promoted the growth of crops and made more root residues return to the soil further increasing the soil tn content and storage hyvönen et al 2008 in addition straw deep returning reduced the leaching of nitrogen thereby minimized its loss it also increased soil tn content and storage xu et al 2017 however the straw interlayer under 90 irrigation had less soil tn content than that under 100 irrigation this might be related to the significant correlation between soil tn content and relative abundance of acidobacteria found in our study fig 4 acidobacteria could promote the decay and n cycle of soil animal and plant residues in soil börjesson et al 2012 while si w90 treatment significantly reduced its relative abundance it indicated that straw interlayer was an effective management to improve soil tn content and storage but under irrigation water reduction the effect of straw interlayer might be reduced by making an influence on the relative abundance of bacterial community 4 2 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soc content and storage straw returning is an economic management to improve global agricultural carbon storage gupta et al 2014 our study showed that straw interlayer si w100 and si w90 increased soc content and storage of 0 40 cm soil layer in the third and fourth years the reasons could be attributed to the following points firstly the straw increased the input of soil organic matter and also acted as a primer in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter from a dormant to an active state bernal et al 2016 secondly our study found that straw interlayer significantly increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and the high relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes could promote essential nutrients cycle torsvik and øvreås 2002 which was also supported by the positive correlation between the relative abundance of two bacteria and soc content fig 4 thirdly straw returning to field promoted the formation of soil aggregates and improved soil aggregates stability thus playing a physical protective role on soc liu et al 2014 we found that the soc content and storage under si w90 were still significantly increased than ck it indicated that the combination of straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction by 10 was recommended for improving soc content and storage 4 3 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soil c n ratio the soil c n ratio reflects the stability of soil organic matter tong et al 2009 and the increase of soil c n ratio can effectively improve soc sequestration ability laird and chang 2013 in this study soil c n ratio was improved by burying straw interlayer which was consistent with the result of tian et al 2019 it indicated that straw interlayer had a positive effect on soc sequestration potential laird and chang 2013 the soil c n ratio of irrigation reduction by 10 was higher than that of normal irrigation under straw interlayer the main reasons were that si w100 significantly increased soil tn content in the other hand the relative abundance of rokubacteria was decreased significantly under si w90 which was closely related to soil n cycle liao et al 2021 meanwhile we also found that soil c n ratio had a significantly negative correlation with rokubacteria in our study fig 4 it indicated that straw interlayer and 10 reduction of irrigation may had more potential for soc sequestration the contents and storages of soil tn and soc as well as soil c n ratio were higher in 2018 than that in 2019 it may because that straw interlayer promoted the priming effect and the degradation of soc by adding the exogenous substance ye et al 2015 in addition crop growth consumed the soil tn and soc which due to the straw interlayer was buried once in the first year of the experiment and the soil nutrients loss was increased by irrigation leaching mc dowell et al 2011 4 4 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on bacterial community proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria were the four bacterial phyla with the highest relative abundance in all treatments which was similar to the result of li et al 2021 it indicated that buried straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction by 10 did not influence the species of soil dominant bacteria at phylum level however straw interlayer treatments caused the variation of the relative abundance of bacteria in rhizosphere soil si w100 and si w90 significantly increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae and significantly decreased the relative abundance of firmicutes this was mainly because the straw as an electron donor to produce energy for bacteria to grow lennon and jones 2011 in addition proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae had important effect on c and n cycles of straw in the soil cong et al 2020 our study also showed that proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were positively correlated with the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer while firmicutes was negatively correlated with the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer the results indicated that straw interlayer promoted the cycles of essential nutrients by increasing the relative abundance of certain dominant bacteria at phylum level therefore straw interlayer treatments improved soil fertility and sustainable utilization 4 5 relationships among soil fertility soil bacterial community and sunflower yield there was no significant difference in sunflower yields between irrigation water reduction by 10 and conventional irrigation the main reasons were that the straw interlayer promoted the formation of the soil macro aggregate which increased soil water retention capacity which reduced the demand for irrigation amount appropriately xia et al 2018 even though no significant changes in sunflower yields among treatments there was great variation between the two years our results also confirmed that the sunflower yield significantly correlated with soc and soil bacterial community only in the 2019 year with relative high yield which was consisted with liang et al 2021 the improvement and maintenance of soc is necessary for increasing crop yield li et al 2009 hu et al 2021 and the proteobacteria is a plant growth promoting bacteria which could inhibit the growth harmful organisms and enhance the absorption and utilization of mineral nutrients thus reducing the damage of salt stress to plant growth lalande et al 1989 sessitsch et al 2018 etesami and maheshwari 2018 compared with 2019 the sunflower yield in 2018 was lower it may due to the salt was accumulated in the surface soil with high groundwater level by the heavy rainfall in 2018 fig 1 zhao et al 2019 in addition there was no significant correlation among soil fertility bacterial community and sunflower yield in 2018 which resulted from less carbon deposition in the roots and thus affected microorganisms leptin et al 2021 hence straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction could maintain sunflower yield by boosting soil fertility and regulating bacterial community in arid and saline areas 5 conclusions legacy effects of straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction was investigated in the third and fourth years after application compared with ck si w90 increased soc content and soil c n ratio by 12 and 13 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively however si w90 decreased soil tn and soc contents by 10 and 8 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively but increased soil c n ratio by 9 compared to si w100 straw interlayer increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae while irrigation water reduction decreased the relative abundance of acidobacteria these bacterial phyla may associate with c and n cycles and supported by the significant correlations between them and soc and soil tn contents notably no relationships were detected between crop yield and soil parameters in 2018 with the relatively low yield while crop yield was related with soil fertility and the relative abundance of rhizosphere soil bacteria in 2019 with relatively high yield indicating that both soil fertility and certain bacterial phyla may contribute to yield variation therefore si w90 maintained crop yield in the two years in conclusion the combination of straw interlayer and 10 irrigation water may be recommendable for saline soil amelioration and utilization considering the limited irrigation water

dried and sieved 2 mm and the soil tn content was determined using the kjeldahl method and soc content using the potassium dichromate outside heating method lu 2000 in addition the soil bulk density was determined by cutting ring method and soil tn and soc storage were calculated with eqs 1 and 2 the soil c n ratio was calculated by dividing the soc content by the soil tn content 1 tn storage tn

amplified using primers 515 f 907 r and its1f its2r primers respectively biddle et al 2008 bellemain et al 2010 amplification conditions were 95 c for 5 min followed by 30 cycles including 95 c for 1 min 63 c for 1 min 72 c for 1 min and then 72 c for 5 min pcr products were mixed and purified by agarose gel dna purification kit the specific pcr process was described in liu et al 2020 sequencing was completed on the hiseq 2500 platform illumina sandigo usa beijing china 2 3 3 yield of sunflower sunflower yield was measured after harvest specifically all the sunflower plates in micro plot were cut off and threshed and they were air dried until reached a constant weight then all the grain weight in each micro plot were measured 2 4 statistical analyses a two way analysis of variance anova in combination with fisher s least significant difference lsd was performed to compare the effects of treatment and year on the contents and storages of soil tn and soc as well as soil c n ratio in the 0 40 cm soil layer rhizosphere soil bacterial community and the sunflower yield three way anova was used when considering the effects of soil layers on the contents and storages of soil tn and soc the

19 and 13 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively in addition si w90 significantly p 0 001 decreased soc content and storage of 0 40 cm soil layer than si w100 by 8 only in 2018 fig s1 fig s2 a si w100 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soc contents than ck by 15 and 13 in the 0 20 cm and by 20 and 10 in the 20 40 cm soil layers respectively besides si w190 also significantly decreased soc content than si w100 by 6 only in 2018 and 8 in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively fig 2 the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer in 2019 was 17 significantly p 0 001 decreased than that in 2018 fig s1 si w100 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio of 0 40 cm soil layer than ck by 9 only in 2018 and 13 and si w90 significantly p 0 001 decreased that than si w100 by 9 only in 2019 respectively fig s1 fig s2 a compared with ck si w90 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio by 13 both in the 0 20 cm and 20 40 cm soil layers respectively however si w100 significantly p 0 001 increased soil c n ratio of 20 40 cm soil layer by 6 only in 2019 fig 2 in addition there was no significantly p 0 05 difference between si w90 and si w100 the soil tn content of 0 40 cm soil layer in 2019 was 4 much p 0 05 decreased than that in 2018 fig s1 3 2 soil bacterial community the distribution of soil rhizosphere bacterial communities varied with treatments fig 3a based on the distribution of bacterial community the first two principal components pc 1 and pc 2 explained 76 and 18 in 2018 and 52 and 24 in 2019 respectively the ck si w100 and si w90 samples three replicates per treatment were quite distinct from each other the four dominant bacterial phyla were proteobacteria 34 46 actinobacteria 15 18 chloroflexi 10 13 acidobacteria 6 13 compared with ck si w100 significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria acidobacteria and bacteroidetes by 10 40 and 37 but decreased that of firmicutes by 45 respectively si w90 significantly p 0 05 increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes by 8 and 37 but decreased significantly p 0 05 that of actinobacteria and firmicutes by 13 and 47 respectively compared to ck furthermore si w100 and si w90 significantly increased the relative abundance of nitrospirae than ck by 48 and 20 only in 2018 and si w90 significantly decreased the relative abundance of rokubacteria by 65 only in 2019 respectively notably si w90 significantly p 0 05 decreased that of actinobacteria and acidobacteria than si w100 by 11 and 22 respectively fig 3b the rda showed that the coordinate from the first two ordination axes explained 89 29 and 63 53 of variances in 2018 and 2019 respectively in addition the sharp angle among the vector lines showed that soc content in 0 40 cm soil layer had the most important influence on the bacterial community fig s3 the correlation heatmap revealed that the relative abundances of proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were positively p 0 05 related to the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer while that of firmicutes showed a significantly p 0 05 negative correlation fig 4 3 3 correlations among soil fertility soil bacterial community and the yield of sunflower there was significant p 0 05 difference of sunflower yield between 2018 and 2019 heatmap of pearson s correlation coefficients showed that there was no significant correlation among sunflower yield and soil fertility and soil bacterial community in 2018 but there was significant correlation among sunflower yield and soc content of 0 20 cm soil layer p 0 01 r 0 813 n 9 and the relative abundance of proteobacteria p 0 05 r 0 707 n 9 and firmicutes p 0 05 r 0 698 n 9 in 2019 fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soil tn content and storage our results indicated that straw interlayer si w100 increased soil tn content and storage in the 0 40 cm soil layer which were similar to many existing studies zhang et al 2015 memon et al 2018 the main reasons were that straw deep returning could be converted into soil nitrogen which directly increased soil tn content zhang et al 2015 and it also promoted the growth of crops and made more root residues return to the soil further increasing the soil tn content and storage hyvönen et al 2008 in addition straw deep returning reduced the leaching of nitrogen thereby minimized its loss it also increased soil tn content and storage xu et al 2017 however the straw interlayer under 90 irrigation had less soil tn content than that under 100 irrigation this might be related to the significant correlation between soil tn content and relative abundance of acidobacteria found in our study fig 4 acidobacteria could promote the decay and n cycle of soil animal and plant residues in soil börjesson et al 2012 while si w90 treatment significantly reduced its relative abundance it indicated that straw interlayer was an effective management to improve soil tn content and storage but under irrigation water reduction the effect of straw interlayer might be reduced by making an influence on the relative abundance of bacterial community 4 2 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soc content and storage straw returning is an economic management to improve global agricultural carbon storage gupta et al 2014 our study showed that straw interlayer si w100 and si w90 increased soc content and storage of 0 40 cm soil layer in the third and fourth years the reasons could be attributed to the following points firstly the straw increased the input of soil organic matter and also acted as a primer in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter from a dormant to an active state bernal et al 2016 secondly our study found that straw interlayer significantly increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes and the high relative abundances of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes could promote essential nutrients cycle torsvik and øvreås 2002 which was also supported by the positive correlation between the relative abundance of two bacteria and soc content fig 4 thirdly straw returning to field promoted the formation of soil aggregates and improved soil aggregates stability thus playing a physical protective role on soc liu et al 2014 we found that the soc content and storage under si w90 were still significantly increased than ck it indicated that the combination of straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction by 10 was recommended for improving soc content and storage 4 3 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on soil c n ratio the soil c n ratio reflects the stability of soil organic matter tong et al 2009 and the increase of soil c n ratio can effectively improve soc sequestration ability laird and chang 2013 in this study soil c n ratio was improved by burying straw interlayer which was consistent with the result of tian et al 2019 it indicated that straw interlayer had a positive effect on soc sequestration potential laird and chang 2013 the soil c n ratio of irrigation reduction by 10 was higher than that of normal irrigation under straw interlayer the main reasons were that si w100 significantly increased soil tn content in the other hand the relative abundance of rokubacteria was decreased significantly under si w90 which was closely related to soil n cycle liao et al 2021 meanwhile we also found that soil c n ratio had a significantly negative correlation with rokubacteria in our study fig 4 it indicated that straw interlayer and 10 reduction of irrigation may had more potential for soc sequestration the contents and storages of soil tn and soc as well as soil c n ratio were higher in 2018 than that in 2019 it may because that straw interlayer promoted the priming effect and the degradation of soc by adding the exogenous substance ye et al 2015 in addition crop growth consumed the soil tn and soc which due to the straw interlayer was buried once in the first year of the experiment and the soil nutrients loss was increased by irrigation leaching mc dowell et al 2011 4 4 straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction effect on bacterial community proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi and acidobacteria were the four bacterial phyla with the highest relative abundance in all treatments which was similar to the result of li et al 2021 it indicated that buried straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction by 10 did not influence the species of soil dominant bacteria at phylum level however straw interlayer treatments caused the variation of the relative abundance of bacteria in rhizosphere soil si w100 and si w90 significantly increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae and significantly decreased the relative abundance of firmicutes this was mainly because the straw as an electron donor to produce energy for bacteria to grow lennon and jones 2011 in addition proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae had important effect on c and n cycles of straw in the soil cong et al 2020 our study also showed that proteobacteria acidobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were positively correlated with the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer while firmicutes was negatively correlated with the soc content of 0 40 cm soil layer the results indicated that straw interlayer promoted the cycles of essential nutrients by increasing the relative abundance of certain dominant bacteria at phylum level therefore straw interlayer treatments improved soil fertility and sustainable utilization 4 5 relationships among soil fertility soil bacterial community and sunflower yield there was no significant difference in sunflower yields between irrigation water reduction by 10 and conventional irrigation the main reasons were that the straw interlayer promoted the formation of the soil macro aggregate which increased soil water retention capacity which reduced the demand for irrigation amount appropriately xia et al 2018 even though no significant changes in sunflower yields among treatments there was great variation between the two years our results also confirmed that the sunflower yield significantly correlated with soc and soil bacterial community only in the 2019 year with relative high yield which was consisted with liang et al 2021 the improvement and maintenance of soc is necessary for increasing crop yield li et al 2009 hu et al 2021 and the proteobacteria is a plant growth promoting bacteria which could inhibit the growth harmful organisms and enhance the absorption and utilization of mineral nutrients thus reducing the damage of salt stress to plant growth lalande et al 1989 sessitsch et al 2018 etesami and maheshwari 2018 compared with 2019 the sunflower yield in 2018 was lower it may due to the salt was accumulated in the surface soil with high groundwater level by the heavy rainfall in 2018 fig 1 zhao et al 2019 in addition there was no significant correlation among soil fertility bacterial community and sunflower yield in 2018 which resulted from less carbon deposition in the roots and thus affected microorganisms leptin et al 2021 hence straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction could maintain sunflower yield by boosting soil fertility and regulating bacterial community in arid and saline areas 5 conclusions legacy effects of straw interlayer and irrigation water reduction was investigated in the third and fourth years after application compared with ck si w90 increased soc content and soil c n ratio by 12 and 13 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively however si w90 decreased soil tn and soc contents by 10 and 8 in the 0 40 cm soil layer respectively but increased soil c n ratio by 9 compared to si w100 straw interlayer increased the relative abundance of proteobacteria bacteroidetes and nitrospirae while irrigation water reduction decreased the relative abundance of acidobacteria these bacterial phyla may associate with c and n cycles and supported by the significant correlations between them and soc and soil tn contents notably no relationships were detected between crop yield and soil parameters in 2018 with the relatively low yield while crop yield was related with soil fertility and the relative abundance of rhizosphere soil bacteria in 2019 with relatively high yield indicating that both soil fertility and certain bacterial phyla may contribute to yield variation therefore si w90 maintained crop yield in the two years in conclusion the combination of straw interlayer and 10 irrigation water may be recommendable for saline soil amelioration and utilization considering the limited irrigation water

9696,in arid and semi arid regions evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs can be a significant source of water loss since groundwater is a major source of water supply for irrigation evaporation losses from irrigation water reservoirs represent a challenging aspect in aquifers governance in such limited water areas estimating these losses is crucial for water resource managers to regulate irrigation reservoirs development and to implement appropriate mitigation measures several practical challenges make the individual inventory and monitoring of small irrigation reservoirs unfeasible especially in large irrigation perimeters with dynamic irrigated surfaces thus significant uncertainty is generally associated with the determinist estimation of evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs this study is an attempt to develop remote sensing and monte carlo simulation mcs based framework to estimate the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs used for storing groundwater pumped from the berrechid aquifer in morocco to that end remote sensing datasets were validated using data of 49 known reservoirs to identify small reservoirs and their surface area over the growing season an exploratory data analysis eda of the remotely sensed results was conducted to process the outlier values meanwhile mcs was implemented using 20000 iterations for developing a probabilistic model to estimate the annual evaporation loss associated with exceedance probabilities the results showed that for an exceedance probability of 90 the associated annual evaporation loss is about 1 50 mm3 yr 1 with a median of about 1 84 mm3 yr 1 a sensitivity analysis sa of the model was conducted which revealed that the model is more sensitive to the pan coefficient cp followed by reservoir area and pan evaporation evp for dry months as for wet months the sa showed that the model is more sensitive to the daily evp overall the study provides a new insight for forecasting evaporation loss from small reservoirs and therefore will help decision makers to consider the uncertainty in evaluating the economic viability of mitigation measures furthermore the methodology developed could be valuable in estimating the evaporation loss from the reservoirs in poorly monitored zones keywords berrechid aquifer sensitivity analysis uncertainty exceedance probability remote sensing 1 introduction groundwater is considered the main water resource for agriculture in the world grafton et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 however the population growth industrial development climate change effects anthropogenic factors and the trend towards irrigated agriculture have led to significant depletion of the groundwater level gwl and water salinization particularly in semi arid regions el bilali et al 2021c 2021b pool et al 2021 therefore to improve the aquifer planning and management processes advances on knowledge on water loss is needed to implement the best practice strategies for sustainable groundwater governance in semi arid environments water losses include reservoir sedimentations evaporation losses from the water bodies as well as the use of inefficient practices el bilali et al 2020b ma et al 2018 martínez alvarez et al 2008 indeed most studies focused on sedimentation and groundwater depletion rather than evaporation loss issue however for two decades the evaporation loss from reservoirs has become a challenging issue in water resources management for instance martínez alvarez et al 2008 assessed the magnitude of evaporation loss from agricultural water reservoirs using aerial orthophoto pan evaporation and climate data in the segura river basin spain they found that the annual evaporation loss can reach 58 5 mm3 yr 1 which is 8 3 of the irrigation water demand in the studied area wurbs and ayala 2014 evaluated the evaporation loss from the water reservoirs in texas state and found that the annual evaporation loss equivalents to 61 of total water irrigation demand also in similar climatic conditions craig et al 2005 reported that the annual evaporation loss from on farm storages was about of one billion m3 for a total capacity of 2 50 billion m3 in queensland australia other similar situations have been observed with an annual evaporation loss about of 14 00 billion m3 from 916 large reservoirs across china tian et al 2021 furthermore the evaporation loss can have socio economic impacts on farmers especially in semi arid regions maestre valero and martínez alvarez 2011 maestre valero et al 2013 such research results demonstrate that there is a need to accurately assess the evaporation loss at different scales and to analyze the associated uncertainty similarly storage of groundwater in small irrigation water reservoirs could be a source of the water loss from aquifers evaporation suppression measures may be useful to conserve water bodies and reservoirs particularly in arid environments to reduce the evaporation loss from reservoirs several techniques and methods have been evaluated and appeared to be efficient ranging from chemical biological to physical methods these methods include floating aquatic plants wind breakers counterweighted spheres floating photovoltaic system to save water and produce energy and others han et al 2020 ock kim et al 2020 padilha campos lopes et al 2020 waheeb youssef and khodzinskaya 2019 interestingly as reviewed by shalaby et al 2021 physical methods have the potential efficiency to inhibit evaporation loss from reservoirs as considerable attention had been addressed to these methods in the last few years however field applications and efficiency of these methods depend on many criteria related to environmental climatic factors and funding issues maestre valero et al 2011 martínez alvarez et al 2009 mozafari et al 2019 the uncertainty surrounding the water to be recovered contributes to the overall initial investment risk which should be disclosed in the decision making additionally the economic viability of the aforementioned techniques highly depends on the water price cost of the investment and maintenance cost on the other hand the uncertainty associated with evaluation methods of the evaporation loss from reservoirs is a keystone for a hydrologist or water resources manager to decide on investing for controlling the evaporation losses for instance mcjannet et al 2013 have concluded that uncertainty is still significant in all methods of estimating the evaporation loss from reservoirs and needs further research besides lowe et al 2009 have assessed the uncertainty generated by using pan coefficient cp and found out that the evaporation from the reservoir is as large as 40 of the real estimate consequently it is important to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the evaporation loss from reservoirs mainly in poorly monitored zones evaluating the evaporation loss from reservoirs requires reliable measured data of evaporation rate and area of the reservoirs indeed the evaporation rate can be measured by several methods such as eddy covariance tower scientillometer beam and water surface temperature based approach at local and regional scales respectively mcgloin et al 2014 phillips et al 2016 nevertheless pan evaporation remains the most outstanding method to evaluate the evaporation at reservoirs and water bodies despite uncertain sources related to the regional transposition and its sensitivity to climate data lowe et al 2009 phillips et al 2016 regarding reservoir area the area elevation relationship is commonly applied to evaluate reservoir fluctuation over time indeed this method is limited only to large reservoirs as generally the area elevation curve is not available for small irrigation reservoirs however for few decades water body wb mapping using satellite imagery dataset has been well developed and appeared to be a powerful tool in detecting and monitoring wbs at regional and local scales herndon et al 2020 kaplan and avdan 2017 mishra et al 2020 watson et al 2018 most of the outstanding applied methods in mapping wbs rely on multi band spectral indices including normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 enhanced or modified ndwi mndwi xu 2006 normalized difference pond index ndpi lacaux et al 2007 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and normalized difference moisture index ndmi gao 1996 in the recent years remote sensing based frameworks have been developed and considered as a powerful tool to evaluate the evaporation loss from the reservoir in several regions in the world chen and liu 2020 li et al 2019 ma et al 2018 wurbs and ayala 2014 for instance zhao and gao 2019 combined remote sensing and modeling approach to estimate annual evaporation loss from 721 reservoirs in the usa and showed the strengths of the applied method also combining remote sensing methods and cloud computing seemed to be efficient tools in evaluating the evaporation loss from large reservoirs in texas zhang et al 2017 importantly all studies showed that remote sensing methods are suggested to assess the surface areas of the reservoirs however the literature showed that most studies focused on large and permanent lakes or reservoirs small reservoirs less than 1 ha in semi arid regions are highly dynamic in spatiotemporal scales leading to their discontinuous appearance or sudden appearance in extreme hydrological events zhang et al 2020 2018 therefore using a coarse or medium spatial resolution based imagery dataset in this instance could generate dramatic errors not only in evaluating the surface area but in detecting water bodies too huang et al 2018 to overcome this issue remote sensing with the high spatial resolution is suggested to detect wbs and their surface areas for instance mishra et al 2020 found that the use of the high resolution planet scope dataset 3 m was able to detect 95 of ephemeral wbs whereas the landsat dataset was able to detect 32 of the same wbs in the arid environment in west africa as for the small irrigation water reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture it is not easy to carry out neither an inventory in the field nor a topographical survey for all reservoirs because they are localized in private areas and these operations need time besides the non simultaneous between water storage and pumping processes leads to high variability in surface areas that render their detecting not easy consequently estimating the evaporation loss from such reservoirs is an important issue for agricultural water management particularly in semi arid regions to address this issue developing a probabilistic based approach based on high resolution imagery datasets could be valuable to assess the evaporation loss from small reservoirs to deal with the uncertainties in morocco as a semi arid country groundwater based agriculture plays an important role in rural development by supplying irrigation water and livestock production to save these water resources the government has supported several measures such as modernization of the irrigation techniques and participative management the conversion from flood to drip irrigation techniques received high support from the moroccan government in water resource governance plans despite being an efficient irrigation method drip irrigation decreases groundwater recharge in semi arid region pool et al 2021 besides this conversion encouraged the farmers to intensify the irrigated area with an impact on the sustainability of the aquifers opposite to what is expected molle and tanouti 2017 additionally the water storage using artificial small reservoirs for groundwater storage could generate potential evaporation loss in the arid environment under climate change effects therefore assessment of the evaporation loss is crucially important in infrastructure design for irrigation water storage and to reduce the evaporation loss however there is no attempt to evaluate the evaporation loss from small reservoirs applied to groundwater based agriculture the literature showed that most studies focused on the deterministic calculation to estimate the evaporation loss from reservoirs by using average values of reservoir area and pan evaporation the sensitivity analysis to the input variables in estimating the evaporation loss from small reservoirs is not studied enough however overlooking the uncertainty can lead to making wrong decisions in inhibiting the evaporation from the reservoir in terms of an economically appropriate method daily fluctuation of the small reservoir area is highly important and therefore an amplification of the errors when using deterministic estimation of the evaporation therefore assessment of the uncertainty generated by reservoir area and pan evaporation should be carried out to provide risk levels related to investment for decision makers in reducing the evaporation loss this study attempts to develop a framework based on remote sensing datasets and monte carlo simulation mcs to provide a methodology to decide on the implementation of the measures against the evaporation loss from small reservoirs based on the risk investment benefit in this study the berrechid aquifer morocco was selected as a real case study area for estimating the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs to assess the proposed framework to do this we combined the remote sensing datasets extracted from high resolution imagery 0 5 m as pixel resolution and mcs to evaluate the evaporation loss associated with an exceedance probability also the sensitivity analysis of the developed probabilistic model was carried out 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description berrechid aquifer is among the main groundwater resources in morocco it is located in the northwest of the country between casablanca and settat cities as presented in fig 1 it is a semi arid environment with precipitation ranging from 280 mm to 320 mm per year where more than 90 of the rainfall occurring during the rainy seasons from october to april while the temperature ranges from 6 5 c to 38 c in january and august respectively this aquifer covers a surface of about 1500 km2 characterized by fertile soils leading to continuous water withdrawal and therefore to the groundwater depletion and water quality salinization where today it is unsuitable for drinking purposes el bouqdaoui et al 2010 el ghali et al 2020 elfarrak et al 2014 indeed it plays an important role in socio economic development by supplying water for irrigation and livestock production purposes to improve irrigation water management in this area several studies have been conducted for instance el bilali et al 2020a proposed a forecasting model to manage the water salinity for irrigation purposes as it is under continuous salinization with regard to quantity management ouassissou et al 2019 studied the rivalries and arrangements between different categories of farmers more importantly fao 2020 estimated that the irrigation water for the carrot ranges from 5000 m3 to 15 000 m3 not due to the production but the storage of the carrot in the soil with continuous irrigation for more than seven months waiting for a better market price besides using several irrigation water reservoirs to regulate the pressure for drip irrigation and to ensure enough water quantity can lead to significant evaporation losses also the water reservoirs allow the farmers to practice solar pumping to reduce the cost of energy to that end this study aims to evaluate the magnitude of water evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs associated with an exceedance probability 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 identification of the small reservoirs the inventory and surface area of the small reservoirs can be evaluated by extraction of the water bodies from the satellite imagery dataset with high resolution to achieve this goal the mosaic of the daily images provided by mohammed vi b satellite with a 0 5 m resolution during october 2019 march 2020 june 2020 july 2020 and september 2020 months covering the aquifer and corresponding to the whole the 2019 2020 s growing season was used to identify all water bodies in this area fig 2 the remotely sensed datasets were provided by the royal center for remote sensing crts within collaboration with the river basin agency of bouregreg and chaouia abhbc to improve the agricultural water management in the flood plain of berrechid the image bands were treated to automatically delineate wbs using supervised classification method through erdas software these data include water bodies and irrigated areas since these datasets include all water bodies rather than only small irrigation water reservoirs they were considered as raw datasets therefore the validation and exploratory data analysis of these data are required before their use in estimating the evaporation loss cox 2017 to carry out the validation process of remote sensing datasets provided by the crts a topographic survey of 49 reservoirs during the same periods of the imagery dataset was conducted table 1 presents the statistical characteristics of these reservoir capacities namely maximum max minimum min mean and standard deviation sd the validation was carried out with regard to the performances in detecting the small reservoir numbers and evaluating their surface areas besides statistical analysis to detect the outlier values of the surface areas was carried out to separate the small reservoir from the other bodies max maximum of the reservoir areas min minimum of the reservoir areas sd standard deviation of the reservoir areas 2 2 2 evaporation measurements this study used the evaporation datasets provided by the abhbc recorded through the colorado pan at the hydro climatic station installed at the himer dam to manage its reservoir this station was selected as it is the nearest station to the study area fig 1 fig 3 presents the daily evaporation measurements recorded from january 1 2010 to december 31 2020 this figure shows that the pan evaporation trend highly fluctuated over the seasons during this period 2 3 monte carlo simulation mcs monte carlo simulation mcs is one of the most applied approaches for probabilistic modeling in several fields under uncertainty conditions for instance water quality modeling groundwater level modeling flood risk assessment and others charalambous et al 2013 el bilali et al 2021a it is a useful method to evaluate the variability and uncertainty of the variables of the deterministic models since the inaccuracy or insufficiency of the datasets of the pan evaporation uncertainty of the variables should be analyzed and employed before assessing the evaporation loss from the reservoir however for a deterministic calculation the volume of the evaporation loss v evp in m3 is given by eq 1 1 v evp evp c p s while the percentage loss loss compared to the groundwater pumped and stored in the reservoirs can be given by eq 2 2 loss evp c p h 100 where evp is the pan evaporation in m c p is the pan coefficient and was used to account the scale factors from the pan evaporation measurement to reservoir scale while s is the reservoir area in m2 and h is the reservoir height in m the uncertainty is described as any deviation from an unachieved ideal of a deterministic model of a given system walker et al 2003 indeed the evp was not measured at all reservoirs particularly for the small reservoirs that are built for storage of the water for irrigation purposes hence the uncertainty associated with the pan evaporation includes the measurement uncertainty climatic factor uncertainties and pan coefficient uncertainty kirono and jones 2007 lowe et al 2009 indeed for great reservoirs and lakes the uncertainty associate with the reservoir area fluctuation is small compared to those of the pan evaporation meanwhile the high fluctuation of the small reservoir level over time due to the water non simultaneous withdrawal storage process and small dimensions leads to an important uncertainty related to the reservoir area although the remote sensing methods appeared to be an efficient tool to assess the reservoir area their applications to monitor small reservoirs over time are laborious and need time for processing because the extent of such water bodies is highly variable over time therefore the use of the determinist estimation of the evaporation loss needs to update the surface area of the reservoirs in this instance the probabilistic modeling could be valuable to complement the remote sensing datasets for evaluating evaporation loss to that end the probability distributions of all months evp were constructed using the measurement data of the period from january 1 2010 to december 30 2020 fig 2 the distribution laws were selected based on the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and akaîke information criterion aic akaike 1974 where the lower values indicate a good fitted distribution meanwhile for the c p and s variables where there are a few measurements the probability distribution can be considered uniform based on expert opinion cain 2001 considering a month j with m j days the monthly water evaporation v mj is given by the following equation 3 v mj i 1 m j evp i c pi s i where evp i c pi and s i are the pan evaporation in m pan coefficient and reservoir area in m2 for a particular day i respectively the mcs was carried out using the probability distribution of the variables and generating randomly n iterations of the evp cp and s hence the mean values of all realization of the output monthly evaporation v mj can be given by the following equation 4 v mj µ mcj 1 n k 1 n i 1 m j evp ik c pik s ik where µ mc is mean of mcs of the output while the variance of mcs estimation is given by eq 5 5 σ mcj 2 1 n k 1 n i 1 m j evp ik c pik s ik µ mc 2 the annual evaporation loss loss is given by the sum of the monthly evaporation losses v mj and multiplying by 10 6 to convert m3 to million m3 mm3 yr 1 according to the eq 6 6 loss 10 6 j 1 12 v mj using the same method and eqs 3 5 the statistical characteristics of the annual evaporation loss such as mean value variance and probability distribution were evaluated however the proposed methodology can be summarized according to the following steps step 1 processing of remote sensing datasets to evaluate the area of the small reservoirs and tanks installed on the aquifer used for irrigation water storage step 2 statistical analysis this step includes the determination of the probability distribution of the variables such as pan evaporation pan coefficient and reservoir area step 3 developing the deterministic model for calculating the water evaporation according to eq 1 and initialization of the input variables step 4 assigning the probability distribution to input variables and generating n iterations step 5 simulation of the water evaporation for each month using n random variables to determine the probabilistic model to forecast the annual evaporation loss then carry out the sa of the model 3 results 3 1 remotely sensed dataset s processing 3 1 1 validation of the remote sensing method the extracted water bodies and irrigated areas from the satellite imagery dataset were prepared using a computer i7 6700hq in the arcmap environment of arcgis 10 2 which is a geographical information system gis software developed by environmental systems research institute esri then the results were exported to csv files for the processing process fig 4 presents the map of the water bodies and irrigated areas on the berrechid aquifer for different seasons it was observed that the spatial distribution of the remotely sensed water bodies was in accordance with the irrigated areas indicating that most farmers use small reservoirs to store water after the groundwater withdrawal however the validation process through more accurate data is crucial to evaluate remote sensing performances with regard to water body inventories and surface area evaluations of the reservoirs the validation of the remote sensing method to monitor and evaluate the area of the irrigation water reservoirs was carried out by comparing remotely sensed and topographically surveyed data assumed real reservoir area of known 49 small reservoirs to that end the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias were used as statistical indices to evaluate the performances of the remote sensing method importantly all known reservoirs were remotely sensed as water bodies with a percentage of 100 besides the results showed that the r 2 nse and pbias of the remote sensing performances in monitoring the small agricultural reservoirs and tanks were 0 70 0 66 and 10 20 respectively it was observed that even though the percentage of the water body s detections reached 100 the accuracy for evaluating surface areas of the 49 reservoirs was not 100 this may be due to the uncertainties that resulted in the buffering polygon of survived wbs however validation results showed that remote sensing is a powerful method to evaluate the small reservoir areas both in terms of trend and magnitude interestingly according to the suggestions of moriasi et al 2007 in evaluating the forecasting hydrological models these results demonstrated the robustness of the remote sensing method in evaluating small reservoir areas except for pbias these results are in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2017 indeed the authors applied the remote sensing method to evaluate the area of large reservoirs and found that the pbias was about 3 97 3 16 however for large reservoirs the area fluctuation was small compared to the reservoir area and therefore the pbias decreased as its denominator had a high value compared to the discrepancies as nominator as for detecting the small water bodies the percentage of our study 100 is in agreement with mishra et al 2020 results in detecting wbs in an arid region using a high resolution satellite imagery dataset besides fig 5 presents the graphical comparison of the topographically and remotely sensed reservoir areas s using the superimposed data fig 5a and scatter plot fig 5b this figure shows that the remotely sensed reservoir areas were fairly in agreement with topographical ones except for some values thus fig 5c illustrates the fitted normal distribution of the discrepancies error between the remotely sensed and topographically survived areas this figure shows that the error distribution was fairly gaussian with a mean mu and standard deviation sigma were about 75 7 m2 and 242 8 m2 respectively and as a result acceptable performances in evaluating reservoir surface areas overall the graphical comparison confirms the satisfactory performances of the remote sensing method in evaluating the surface area of the small irrigation water reservoirs 3 1 2 exploratory data analysis eda the remote sensing datasets mainly included water bodies and irrigation areas to manage the agricultural water in the berrechid aquifer this study aims at evaluating the area of the small reservoirs to estimate the evaporation loss however the wetlands lagoons of wastewater treatment plants some examples in fig 1 and flood irrigation based methods can be remotely sensed and inventoried as water bodies which can lead to abnormal and unexplained datasets orimoloye et al 2019 ozesmi and bauer 2002 rebelo et al 2009 therefore eda is crucial to improve the reliability of the dataset before its use in the evaluation of the reservoir areas and evaporation losses fig 6 presents the box plot fig 6a and histogram fig 6b of the remote sensing results of the water body areas recorded during october 2019 march 2020 june 2020 july 2020 and september 2020 months overall fig 6b shows that the distribution of the remotely sensed water bodies was peaked for areas less than 2000 m2 with low counts for the high surface areas indicating an imbalance in the distribution due to some extreme values besides the box plots clearly showed some outlier values in the remotely sensed data accordingly the high areas can be explained either by the wetlands or lagoons of the wastewater treatment plants that existed in the study area meanwhile the extreme lower values of the surface areas less than 1 m2 as example can be explained by the anomalies that have occurred at the sub pixel level duan and bastiaanssen 2013 ji et al 2009 mouret et al 2021 tan et al 2019 although the lower values did not impact the estimation of the evaporation loss they significantly affected the data distribution and visualization however the outlier values can be treated and removed using several techniques such as the quantile based method z score method and interquartile range iqr to do this pandas library and quantile function using jupyter notebook in anaconda platform for implementation were applied with a percentage of 5 to determine the minimum threshold of the lower values and a percentage of 95 to determine the maximum threshold of the extreme values indeed these quantile percentages were selected using trial error procedures based on the field knowledge on the reservoir dimensions where most irrigation water reservoirs areas are ranging from 20 m2 to 3000 m2 then the outlier values were removed from the dataset fig 7 presents the distribution of the remotely sensed dataset of the reservoir area s after outliers removal fig 7 shows that the cleaned data was well distributed compared to that illustrated in fig 6 besides table 2 presents the statistical characteristics and distribution law of the remotely sensed reservoir area it was observed that the mean of reservoir area slightly varied over seasons and ranged from 312 m2 to 338 m2 per reservoir however the reservoir number nr varied from one season to another this can be explained by the installation of new reservoirs and or by the fact that the empty reservoir cannot be remotely sensed as a water body besides it was found that the global area of the reservoirs sum was highly correlated with reservoir numbers r2 0 92 indeed it varied from 68 ha to 104 ha over seasons during the agricultural year of 2019 2020 such variation in reservoir areas and numbers is due to the water withdrawal reservoir scales and the practice of the farmers in addition to the high variability of the climatic conditions in the region these variations can render the deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss an inaccurate approach nr reservoir number max maximum of the reservoir areas min minimum of the reservoir areas sd standard deviation of the reservoir areas si total of the reservoir areas 3 2 uncertainties and probability distributions statistical analysis of the daily pan evaporation for the period from january 1 2010 to december 31 2020 was carried out using a significance level of 5 to select the best fitted probability distribution table 3 presents the corresponding parameters to these distributions however it was observed that 50 of the months obeyed log normal distribution followed by beta weibull and gamma distributions for the pan coefficient we were based on the previous studies to determine the probability distribution interestingly winter 1981 found that this parameter ranged from 0 40 to 2 in the united states lakes meanwhile alvarez et al 2007 found that the monthly cp ranged from 0 80 to 1 20 for irrigation water reservoirs in spain indeed a cp of more than 1 can be explained by the heat transfer from the reservoir bottom to the water body which contributes to the evaporation process during the cold periods less than 0 c therefore the evaporation from reservoirs is higher than the measured pan evaporation since the minimum temperature in the study area is about 6 5 c we assumed that the cp ranged from 0 80 to 1 and considered as uniform distribution also as for the global reservoir area we considered uniformly distributed through the year with a maximum of 105 ha and minimum of 68 ha 3 3 simulation results monte carlo simulation was carried out through the generation of 20000 iterations according to probability distributions of the explanatory variables for each month such as reservoir area pan evaporation and pan coefficient the forecasting model was run to compute the annual evaporation loss from reservoirs table 4 presents descriptive statistical characteristics of the 20000 simulated annual evaporation losses such as the maximum minimum mean median sd and coefficient of variance cv besides fig 8 presents the exceedance probability distribution associated with the annual evaporation loss fig 8a and percentage loss fig 8b it was shown that the annual evaporation losses from the reservoirs associated with exceedance probabilities of 90 75 50 25 and 10 were about 1 50 mm3 yr 1 1 70 mm3 yr 1 1 90 mm3 yr 1 2 14 mm3 yr 1 and 2 34 mm3 yr 1 respectively globally compared to the water availability in berrechid province and aquifer status the minimum evaporation loss is considered important meanwhile the deterministic calculation using average values of the evaporation and reservoir areas provided an average annual evaporation loss about 2 60 mm3 yr 1 according to the mcs results fig 8a the exceedance probability associated with this loss value was less than 4 from this result it was observed that the deterministic approach overestimated the evaporation loss in the studied area circumstances to compare our results with the previously published study results we used a ratio defined as evaporation loss per year divided by reservoir areas maximum value in mm3 ha 1 yr 1 the ratios associated with mean values of the evaporation loss provided by the probabilistic model table 3 and deterministic estimation were about 0 017 and 0 024 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively it was observed that the ratio provided by mcs was close to the finding of the martínez alvarez et al 2008 study where the calculated ratio was 0 012 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 for estimating the evaporation loss from 14 145 irrigation water reservoirs in the semi arid region using a dataset of 74 meteorological stations in spain regarding the large reservoirs the calculated ratio from the results of the wurbs and ayala 2014 study was 0 014 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 the observed differences in these ratios were acceptable and can be explained by the variation in pan evaporation and the dimensions of the reservoirs these comparisons supported the reliability of the developed probabilistic model as these areas were fairly monitored in terms of evaporation measurements compared to the studied zone regarding the percentage loss loss we used the deterministic model presented in the eq 2 to run the mcs considering uniform distribution of reservoir heights this assumption can be justified by the fact that the minimum height is 1 50 m while the maximum height is 3 m and each farmer manages its small reservoir independently that renders all intervals of the same length included in the law support have the same probability however fig 8b illustrates the probability distribution of the simulated loss it was observed that the loss ranged from 2 20 to 6 30 as for exceedance probabilities of 90 and 75 the percentage losses loss were about 2 90 and 3 20 of the annual groundwater withdrawn and stored in irrigation water reservoirs respectively by combining the annual evaporation loss and percentage loss for exceedance probabilities of 90 and 75 the annual water withdrawn and stored in the reservoirs were 51 50 mm3 yr 1 and 52 60 mm3 yr 1 respectively however according to the abhbc the estimated annual water withdrawal from the berrechid aquifer was estimated at 72 mm3 yr 1 indeed this estimation included water for irrigation with reservoirs and without reservoirs livestock production and others 3 4 sensitivity analysis monte carlo simulation was carried out and appeared to be a flexible framework to deal with an uncertainty of the stochastic nature of the input variables the water evaporation from small reservoirs by providing a probabilistic forecasting model however the sensitivity of this model to the input variables is crucial to determine the importance of each variable in this study the sensitivity analysis was carried out using the contribution to variance based approach the sensitivity analysis results of the probabilistic model are presented in fig 9 this figure shows that the contributions of the pan evaporation evp pan coefficient cp and reservoir area s to the variance of the evaporation loss output varied from one month to another interestingly for the dry months from june to october the probabilistic model was more sensitive to cp compared to the other variables with a contribution to variance reaching 0 56 meanwhile for the other month it was observed that the model was sensitive to evp with a contribution reaching 0 70 for november which can be justified by the uncertainty associated with precipitation measurement during the wet months which impacts the evaporation estimation consequently the evaporation measurement and pan coefficient should be prioritized in the monitoring process for all months while for the dry months the surface area s appeared to be important compared to the other months 4 discussion 4 1 reproducibility of the methodology the evaporation loss from irrigation water reservoirs impacts water resource availability and farmers incomes particularly in arid and semi arid areas maestre valero et al 2013 sampaio et al 2020 the estimation of these losses is under different uncertainty sources particularly for the small reservoirs in the regions in which the limiting factors highly vary high resolution remote sensing method and mcs can play an important role in estimating the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs in this study the validation results showed that remote sensing with high resolution satellite imagery datasets is suggested to detect small reservoirs furthermore the comparison of mcs results with determinist estimations of the evaporation loss in fairly monitored semi arid environments demonstrated the robustness of the developed framework consequently the developed approach is seemed to capture all uncertainties in the estimation of the evaporation from small irrigation water reservoirs rather than using deterministic calculation besides the developed methodology is not only valuable for small reservoirs but for all other water surfaces too such as irrigation channels and derivation channels since the surface area of these hydro infrastructures are highly dynamic over time in poorly monitored regions the application of this methodology will be a powerful tool to overcome the lack of the measurements 4 2 practical implication in agricultural water management for two decades worldwide research has investigated the efficiency of many methods to reduce evaporation loss from reservoirs however the implementation of the evaporation suppression measures is valuable in agricultural water management if they are economically viable martínez alvarez et al 2009 indeed the economic viability depends highly on the water price the maintenance costs and the water quantity to be saved more importantly the accuracy in estimating the evaporation loss plays a crucial role in evaluating the economic viability as there is a high daily fluctuation in small reservoir areas the deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss requires continuous monitoring with high frequency meanwhile the developed probabilistic forecasting model is useful to overcome the overlooked uncertainty sources in the deterministic approach because in the probabilistic model all uncertainty sources are embedded by simulating many variable combination scenarios this model provides an exceedance probability for each evaporation loss quantity this information allows the decision makers to disclose the investment related risk and avoiding wrong decisions in other words the economic viability of installing the evaporation reduction measures in reservoirs is determined by a threshold of the water quantity to be recovered but the exceedance probability corresponding to this quantity is a keystone for deciding accordingly an important evaporation loss as a threshold of the economic viability associated with a high exceedance probability can justify investing to install evaporation suppression measures in contrast for a low exceedance probability associated with a threshold of economic viability indicates that the investment to install the selected mitigation measure against the evaporation loss is at high risk concerning the studied area the moroccan water policy fixed the price of groundwater for irrigation purposes at 0 002 per m3 to mitigate the social inequality issue between the rural and urban zones according to martínez alvarez et al 2009 this price cannot cover installing any measures to reduce the evaporation loss by the farmers for example to save groundwater quantity associated with an exceedance probability of 90 1 50 mm3 yr 1 equivalents to 0 003 million per year the farmers need to invest 7 8 million to install suspended shade cloth covers in reservoirs water quantity of 1 5 mm3 yr 1 can allow the irrigation of 300 ha yr 1 of carrot production in this area fao 2020 hence using other indices in evaluating the economic viability of the evaporation measures in similar regions may be valuable such as water productivity and aquifer sustainability however installing floating photovoltaic covers for irrigation water reservoirs could be an economical alternative for both groundwater pumping cost and evaporation reductions particularly in developing countries padilha campos lopes et al 2020 redón santafé et al 2014 taboada et al 2017 furthermore interpretation of the water scarcity cost can change the economic viability of the measures against evaporation loss vallino et al 2020 zetland 2021 therefore measuring the water scarcity and evaluating the impacts of the water re pricing on the farmer incomes are suggested to be studied in future research to improve the policy of agricultural water management to ensure the sustainability of the water resources particularly in developing countries furthermore developing new low cost methods to reduce the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs could bottom up approaches that should be investigated 5 conclusions the evaporation loss from small reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture leads to water scarcity aggravation particularly in arid environments with aquifers under depletion and continuous salinization the main aim of this study was to develop a probabilistic approach based on high resolution satellite imagery datasets and mcs to forecast the evaporation loss from small reservoirs in a semi arid region more importantly the main findings of this study are as follow 1 the applied approach has an advantage that can overcome the limitations of determinist estimation by embedding all uncertainty sources in the mcs 2 mcs is a valuable alternative to solve the constraint related to the high fluctuation of the surface areas of the reservoirs over time in applying deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss 3 the comparison of the evaporation results with those of the published studies about well monitored zones and similar climates demonstrated the robustness of the applied approach 4 the evaporation from small agricultural reservoirs is significant compared to the water resource availability in the studied area to sum up the application of the developed framework could be useful for evaluating the economic viability of evaporation suppression measures and designing optimal irrigation water reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture furthermore the developed methodology could be valuable to estimate evaporation losses not only for small irrigation water reservoirs but it could be a powerful tool for the large reservoirs particularly in poorly monitored zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9696,in arid and semi arid regions evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs can be a significant source of water loss since groundwater is a major source of water supply for irrigation evaporation losses from irrigation water reservoirs represent a challenging aspect in aquifers governance in such limited water areas estimating these losses is crucial for water resource managers to regulate irrigation reservoirs development and to implement appropriate mitigation measures several practical challenges make the individual inventory and monitoring of small irrigation reservoirs unfeasible especially in large irrigation perimeters with dynamic irrigated surfaces thus significant uncertainty is generally associated with the determinist estimation of evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs this study is an attempt to develop remote sensing and monte carlo simulation mcs based framework to estimate the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs used for storing groundwater pumped from the berrechid aquifer in morocco to that end remote sensing datasets were validated using data of 49 known reservoirs to identify small reservoirs and their surface area over the growing season an exploratory data analysis eda of the remotely sensed results was conducted to process the outlier values meanwhile mcs was implemented using 20000 iterations for developing a probabilistic model to estimate the annual evaporation loss associated with exceedance probabilities the results showed that for an exceedance probability of 90 the associated annual evaporation loss is about 1 50 mm3 yr 1 with a median of about 1 84 mm3 yr 1 a sensitivity analysis sa of the model was conducted which revealed that the model is more sensitive to the pan coefficient cp followed by reservoir area and pan evaporation evp for dry months as for wet months the sa showed that the model is more sensitive to the daily evp overall the study provides a new insight for forecasting evaporation loss from small reservoirs and therefore will help decision makers to consider the uncertainty in evaluating the economic viability of mitigation measures furthermore the methodology developed could be valuable in estimating the evaporation loss from the reservoirs in poorly monitored zones keywords berrechid aquifer sensitivity analysis uncertainty exceedance probability remote sensing 1 introduction groundwater is considered the main water resource for agriculture in the world grafton et al 2017 siebert et al 2010 however the population growth industrial development climate change effects anthropogenic factors and the trend towards irrigated agriculture have led to significant depletion of the groundwater level gwl and water salinization particularly in semi arid regions el bilali et al 2021c 2021b pool et al 2021 therefore to improve the aquifer planning and management processes advances on knowledge on water loss is needed to implement the best practice strategies for sustainable groundwater governance in semi arid environments water losses include reservoir sedimentations evaporation losses from the water bodies as well as the use of inefficient practices el bilali et al 2020b ma et al 2018 martínez alvarez et al 2008 indeed most studies focused on sedimentation and groundwater depletion rather than evaporation loss issue however for two decades the evaporation loss from reservoirs has become a challenging issue in water resources management for instance martínez alvarez et al 2008 assessed the magnitude of evaporation loss from agricultural water reservoirs using aerial orthophoto pan evaporation and climate data in the segura river basin spain they found that the annual evaporation loss can reach 58 5 mm3 yr 1 which is 8 3 of the irrigation water demand in the studied area wurbs and ayala 2014 evaluated the evaporation loss from the water reservoirs in texas state and found that the annual evaporation loss equivalents to 61 of total water irrigation demand also in similar climatic conditions craig et al 2005 reported that the annual evaporation loss from on farm storages was about of one billion m3 for a total capacity of 2 50 billion m3 in queensland australia other similar situations have been observed with an annual evaporation loss about of 14 00 billion m3 from 916 large reservoirs across china tian et al 2021 furthermore the evaporation loss can have socio economic impacts on farmers especially in semi arid regions maestre valero and martínez alvarez 2011 maestre valero et al 2013 such research results demonstrate that there is a need to accurately assess the evaporation loss at different scales and to analyze the associated uncertainty similarly storage of groundwater in small irrigation water reservoirs could be a source of the water loss from aquifers evaporation suppression measures may be useful to conserve water bodies and reservoirs particularly in arid environments to reduce the evaporation loss from reservoirs several techniques and methods have been evaluated and appeared to be efficient ranging from chemical biological to physical methods these methods include floating aquatic plants wind breakers counterweighted spheres floating photovoltaic system to save water and produce energy and others han et al 2020 ock kim et al 2020 padilha campos lopes et al 2020 waheeb youssef and khodzinskaya 2019 interestingly as reviewed by shalaby et al 2021 physical methods have the potential efficiency to inhibit evaporation loss from reservoirs as considerable attention had been addressed to these methods in the last few years however field applications and efficiency of these methods depend on many criteria related to environmental climatic factors and funding issues maestre valero et al 2011 martínez alvarez et al 2009 mozafari et al 2019 the uncertainty surrounding the water to be recovered contributes to the overall initial investment risk which should be disclosed in the decision making additionally the economic viability of the aforementioned techniques highly depends on the water price cost of the investment and maintenance cost on the other hand the uncertainty associated with evaluation methods of the evaporation loss from reservoirs is a keystone for a hydrologist or water resources manager to decide on investing for controlling the evaporation losses for instance mcjannet et al 2013 have concluded that uncertainty is still significant in all methods of estimating the evaporation loss from reservoirs and needs further research besides lowe et al 2009 have assessed the uncertainty generated by using pan coefficient cp and found out that the evaporation from the reservoir is as large as 40 of the real estimate consequently it is important to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the evaporation loss from reservoirs mainly in poorly monitored zones evaluating the evaporation loss from reservoirs requires reliable measured data of evaporation rate and area of the reservoirs indeed the evaporation rate can be measured by several methods such as eddy covariance tower scientillometer beam and water surface temperature based approach at local and regional scales respectively mcgloin et al 2014 phillips et al 2016 nevertheless pan evaporation remains the most outstanding method to evaluate the evaporation at reservoirs and water bodies despite uncertain sources related to the regional transposition and its sensitivity to climate data lowe et al 2009 phillips et al 2016 regarding reservoir area the area elevation relationship is commonly applied to evaluate reservoir fluctuation over time indeed this method is limited only to large reservoirs as generally the area elevation curve is not available for small irrigation reservoirs however for few decades water body wb mapping using satellite imagery dataset has been well developed and appeared to be a powerful tool in detecting and monitoring wbs at regional and local scales herndon et al 2020 kaplan and avdan 2017 mishra et al 2020 watson et al 2018 most of the outstanding applied methods in mapping wbs rely on multi band spectral indices including normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 enhanced or modified ndwi mndwi xu 2006 normalized difference pond index ndpi lacaux et al 2007 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi tucker 1979 and normalized difference moisture index ndmi gao 1996 in the recent years remote sensing based frameworks have been developed and considered as a powerful tool to evaluate the evaporation loss from the reservoir in several regions in the world chen and liu 2020 li et al 2019 ma et al 2018 wurbs and ayala 2014 for instance zhao and gao 2019 combined remote sensing and modeling approach to estimate annual evaporation loss from 721 reservoirs in the usa and showed the strengths of the applied method also combining remote sensing methods and cloud computing seemed to be efficient tools in evaluating the evaporation loss from large reservoirs in texas zhang et al 2017 importantly all studies showed that remote sensing methods are suggested to assess the surface areas of the reservoirs however the literature showed that most studies focused on large and permanent lakes or reservoirs small reservoirs less than 1 ha in semi arid regions are highly dynamic in spatiotemporal scales leading to their discontinuous appearance or sudden appearance in extreme hydrological events zhang et al 2020 2018 therefore using a coarse or medium spatial resolution based imagery dataset in this instance could generate dramatic errors not only in evaluating the surface area but in detecting water bodies too huang et al 2018 to overcome this issue remote sensing with the high spatial resolution is suggested to detect wbs and their surface areas for instance mishra et al 2020 found that the use of the high resolution planet scope dataset 3 m was able to detect 95 of ephemeral wbs whereas the landsat dataset was able to detect 32 of the same wbs in the arid environment in west africa as for the small irrigation water reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture it is not easy to carry out neither an inventory in the field nor a topographical survey for all reservoirs because they are localized in private areas and these operations need time besides the non simultaneous between water storage and pumping processes leads to high variability in surface areas that render their detecting not easy consequently estimating the evaporation loss from such reservoirs is an important issue for agricultural water management particularly in semi arid regions to address this issue developing a probabilistic based approach based on high resolution imagery datasets could be valuable to assess the evaporation loss from small reservoirs to deal with the uncertainties in morocco as a semi arid country groundwater based agriculture plays an important role in rural development by supplying irrigation water and livestock production to save these water resources the government has supported several measures such as modernization of the irrigation techniques and participative management the conversion from flood to drip irrigation techniques received high support from the moroccan government in water resource governance plans despite being an efficient irrigation method drip irrigation decreases groundwater recharge in semi arid region pool et al 2021 besides this conversion encouraged the farmers to intensify the irrigated area with an impact on the sustainability of the aquifers opposite to what is expected molle and tanouti 2017 additionally the water storage using artificial small reservoirs for groundwater storage could generate potential evaporation loss in the arid environment under climate change effects therefore assessment of the evaporation loss is crucially important in infrastructure design for irrigation water storage and to reduce the evaporation loss however there is no attempt to evaluate the evaporation loss from small reservoirs applied to groundwater based agriculture the literature showed that most studies focused on the deterministic calculation to estimate the evaporation loss from reservoirs by using average values of reservoir area and pan evaporation the sensitivity analysis to the input variables in estimating the evaporation loss from small reservoirs is not studied enough however overlooking the uncertainty can lead to making wrong decisions in inhibiting the evaporation from the reservoir in terms of an economically appropriate method daily fluctuation of the small reservoir area is highly important and therefore an amplification of the errors when using deterministic estimation of the evaporation therefore assessment of the uncertainty generated by reservoir area and pan evaporation should be carried out to provide risk levels related to investment for decision makers in reducing the evaporation loss this study attempts to develop a framework based on remote sensing datasets and monte carlo simulation mcs to provide a methodology to decide on the implementation of the measures against the evaporation loss from small reservoirs based on the risk investment benefit in this study the berrechid aquifer morocco was selected as a real case study area for estimating the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs to assess the proposed framework to do this we combined the remote sensing datasets extracted from high resolution imagery 0 5 m as pixel resolution and mcs to evaluate the evaporation loss associated with an exceedance probability also the sensitivity analysis of the developed probabilistic model was carried out 2 material and methods 2 1 study area description berrechid aquifer is among the main groundwater resources in morocco it is located in the northwest of the country between casablanca and settat cities as presented in fig 1 it is a semi arid environment with precipitation ranging from 280 mm to 320 mm per year where more than 90 of the rainfall occurring during the rainy seasons from october to april while the temperature ranges from 6 5 c to 38 c in january and august respectively this aquifer covers a surface of about 1500 km2 characterized by fertile soils leading to continuous water withdrawal and therefore to the groundwater depletion and water quality salinization where today it is unsuitable for drinking purposes el bouqdaoui et al 2010 el ghali et al 2020 elfarrak et al 2014 indeed it plays an important role in socio economic development by supplying water for irrigation and livestock production purposes to improve irrigation water management in this area several studies have been conducted for instance el bilali et al 2020a proposed a forecasting model to manage the water salinity for irrigation purposes as it is under continuous salinization with regard to quantity management ouassissou et al 2019 studied the rivalries and arrangements between different categories of farmers more importantly fao 2020 estimated that the irrigation water for the carrot ranges from 5000 m3 to 15 000 m3 not due to the production but the storage of the carrot in the soil with continuous irrigation for more than seven months waiting for a better market price besides using several irrigation water reservoirs to regulate the pressure for drip irrigation and to ensure enough water quantity can lead to significant evaporation losses also the water reservoirs allow the farmers to practice solar pumping to reduce the cost of energy to that end this study aims to evaluate the magnitude of water evaporation from small irrigation reservoirs associated with an exceedance probability 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 identification of the small reservoirs the inventory and surface area of the small reservoirs can be evaluated by extraction of the water bodies from the satellite imagery dataset with high resolution to achieve this goal the mosaic of the daily images provided by mohammed vi b satellite with a 0 5 m resolution during october 2019 march 2020 june 2020 july 2020 and september 2020 months covering the aquifer and corresponding to the whole the 2019 2020 s growing season was used to identify all water bodies in this area fig 2 the remotely sensed datasets were provided by the royal center for remote sensing crts within collaboration with the river basin agency of bouregreg and chaouia abhbc to improve the agricultural water management in the flood plain of berrechid the image bands were treated to automatically delineate wbs using supervised classification method through erdas software these data include water bodies and irrigated areas since these datasets include all water bodies rather than only small irrigation water reservoirs they were considered as raw datasets therefore the validation and exploratory data analysis of these data are required before their use in estimating the evaporation loss cox 2017 to carry out the validation process of remote sensing datasets provided by the crts a topographic survey of 49 reservoirs during the same periods of the imagery dataset was conducted table 1 presents the statistical characteristics of these reservoir capacities namely maximum max minimum min mean and standard deviation sd the validation was carried out with regard to the performances in detecting the small reservoir numbers and evaluating their surface areas besides statistical analysis to detect the outlier values of the surface areas was carried out to separate the small reservoir from the other bodies max maximum of the reservoir areas min minimum of the reservoir areas sd standard deviation of the reservoir areas 2 2 2 evaporation measurements this study used the evaporation datasets provided by the abhbc recorded through the colorado pan at the hydro climatic station installed at the himer dam to manage its reservoir this station was selected as it is the nearest station to the study area fig 1 fig 3 presents the daily evaporation measurements recorded from january 1 2010 to december 31 2020 this figure shows that the pan evaporation trend highly fluctuated over the seasons during this period 2 3 monte carlo simulation mcs monte carlo simulation mcs is one of the most applied approaches for probabilistic modeling in several fields under uncertainty conditions for instance water quality modeling groundwater level modeling flood risk assessment and others charalambous et al 2013 el bilali et al 2021a it is a useful method to evaluate the variability and uncertainty of the variables of the deterministic models since the inaccuracy or insufficiency of the datasets of the pan evaporation uncertainty of the variables should be analyzed and employed before assessing the evaporation loss from the reservoir however for a deterministic calculation the volume of the evaporation loss v evp in m3 is given by eq 1 1 v evp evp c p s while the percentage loss loss compared to the groundwater pumped and stored in the reservoirs can be given by eq 2 2 loss evp c p h 100 where evp is the pan evaporation in m c p is the pan coefficient and was used to account the scale factors from the pan evaporation measurement to reservoir scale while s is the reservoir area in m2 and h is the reservoir height in m the uncertainty is described as any deviation from an unachieved ideal of a deterministic model of a given system walker et al 2003 indeed the evp was not measured at all reservoirs particularly for the small reservoirs that are built for storage of the water for irrigation purposes hence the uncertainty associated with the pan evaporation includes the measurement uncertainty climatic factor uncertainties and pan coefficient uncertainty kirono and jones 2007 lowe et al 2009 indeed for great reservoirs and lakes the uncertainty associate with the reservoir area fluctuation is small compared to those of the pan evaporation meanwhile the high fluctuation of the small reservoir level over time due to the water non simultaneous withdrawal storage process and small dimensions leads to an important uncertainty related to the reservoir area although the remote sensing methods appeared to be an efficient tool to assess the reservoir area their applications to monitor small reservoirs over time are laborious and need time for processing because the extent of such water bodies is highly variable over time therefore the use of the determinist estimation of the evaporation loss needs to update the surface area of the reservoirs in this instance the probabilistic modeling could be valuable to complement the remote sensing datasets for evaluating evaporation loss to that end the probability distributions of all months evp were constructed using the measurement data of the period from january 1 2010 to december 30 2020 fig 2 the distribution laws were selected based on the bayesian information criterion bic schwarz 1978 and akaîke information criterion aic akaike 1974 where the lower values indicate a good fitted distribution meanwhile for the c p and s variables where there are a few measurements the probability distribution can be considered uniform based on expert opinion cain 2001 considering a month j with m j days the monthly water evaporation v mj is given by the following equation 3 v mj i 1 m j evp i c pi s i where evp i c pi and s i are the pan evaporation in m pan coefficient and reservoir area in m2 for a particular day i respectively the mcs was carried out using the probability distribution of the variables and generating randomly n iterations of the evp cp and s hence the mean values of all realization of the output monthly evaporation v mj can be given by the following equation 4 v mj µ mcj 1 n k 1 n i 1 m j evp ik c pik s ik where µ mc is mean of mcs of the output while the variance of mcs estimation is given by eq 5 5 σ mcj 2 1 n k 1 n i 1 m j evp ik c pik s ik µ mc 2 the annual evaporation loss loss is given by the sum of the monthly evaporation losses v mj and multiplying by 10 6 to convert m3 to million m3 mm3 yr 1 according to the eq 6 6 loss 10 6 j 1 12 v mj using the same method and eqs 3 5 the statistical characteristics of the annual evaporation loss such as mean value variance and probability distribution were evaluated however the proposed methodology can be summarized according to the following steps step 1 processing of remote sensing datasets to evaluate the area of the small reservoirs and tanks installed on the aquifer used for irrigation water storage step 2 statistical analysis this step includes the determination of the probability distribution of the variables such as pan evaporation pan coefficient and reservoir area step 3 developing the deterministic model for calculating the water evaporation according to eq 1 and initialization of the input variables step 4 assigning the probability distribution to input variables and generating n iterations step 5 simulation of the water evaporation for each month using n random variables to determine the probabilistic model to forecast the annual evaporation loss then carry out the sa of the model 3 results 3 1 remotely sensed dataset s processing 3 1 1 validation of the remote sensing method the extracted water bodies and irrigated areas from the satellite imagery dataset were prepared using a computer i7 6700hq in the arcmap environment of arcgis 10 2 which is a geographical information system gis software developed by environmental systems research institute esri then the results were exported to csv files for the processing process fig 4 presents the map of the water bodies and irrigated areas on the berrechid aquifer for different seasons it was observed that the spatial distribution of the remotely sensed water bodies was in accordance with the irrigated areas indicating that most farmers use small reservoirs to store water after the groundwater withdrawal however the validation process through more accurate data is crucial to evaluate remote sensing performances with regard to water body inventories and surface area evaluations of the reservoirs the validation of the remote sensing method to monitor and evaluate the area of the irrigation water reservoirs was carried out by comparing remotely sensed and topographically surveyed data assumed real reservoir area of known 49 small reservoirs to that end the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percentage bias pbias were used as statistical indices to evaluate the performances of the remote sensing method importantly all known reservoirs were remotely sensed as water bodies with a percentage of 100 besides the results showed that the r 2 nse and pbias of the remote sensing performances in monitoring the small agricultural reservoirs and tanks were 0 70 0 66 and 10 20 respectively it was observed that even though the percentage of the water body s detections reached 100 the accuracy for evaluating surface areas of the 49 reservoirs was not 100 this may be due to the uncertainties that resulted in the buffering polygon of survived wbs however validation results showed that remote sensing is a powerful method to evaluate the small reservoir areas both in terms of trend and magnitude interestingly according to the suggestions of moriasi et al 2007 in evaluating the forecasting hydrological models these results demonstrated the robustness of the remote sensing method in evaluating small reservoir areas except for pbias these results are in agreement with the findings of zhang et al 2017 indeed the authors applied the remote sensing method to evaluate the area of large reservoirs and found that the pbias was about 3 97 3 16 however for large reservoirs the area fluctuation was small compared to the reservoir area and therefore the pbias decreased as its denominator had a high value compared to the discrepancies as nominator as for detecting the small water bodies the percentage of our study 100 is in agreement with mishra et al 2020 results in detecting wbs in an arid region using a high resolution satellite imagery dataset besides fig 5 presents the graphical comparison of the topographically and remotely sensed reservoir areas s using the superimposed data fig 5a and scatter plot fig 5b this figure shows that the remotely sensed reservoir areas were fairly in agreement with topographical ones except for some values thus fig 5c illustrates the fitted normal distribution of the discrepancies error between the remotely sensed and topographically survived areas this figure shows that the error distribution was fairly gaussian with a mean mu and standard deviation sigma were about 75 7 m2 and 242 8 m2 respectively and as a result acceptable performances in evaluating reservoir surface areas overall the graphical comparison confirms the satisfactory performances of the remote sensing method in evaluating the surface area of the small irrigation water reservoirs 3 1 2 exploratory data analysis eda the remote sensing datasets mainly included water bodies and irrigation areas to manage the agricultural water in the berrechid aquifer this study aims at evaluating the area of the small reservoirs to estimate the evaporation loss however the wetlands lagoons of wastewater treatment plants some examples in fig 1 and flood irrigation based methods can be remotely sensed and inventoried as water bodies which can lead to abnormal and unexplained datasets orimoloye et al 2019 ozesmi and bauer 2002 rebelo et al 2009 therefore eda is crucial to improve the reliability of the dataset before its use in the evaluation of the reservoir areas and evaporation losses fig 6 presents the box plot fig 6a and histogram fig 6b of the remote sensing results of the water body areas recorded during october 2019 march 2020 june 2020 july 2020 and september 2020 months overall fig 6b shows that the distribution of the remotely sensed water bodies was peaked for areas less than 2000 m2 with low counts for the high surface areas indicating an imbalance in the distribution due to some extreme values besides the box plots clearly showed some outlier values in the remotely sensed data accordingly the high areas can be explained either by the wetlands or lagoons of the wastewater treatment plants that existed in the study area meanwhile the extreme lower values of the surface areas less than 1 m2 as example can be explained by the anomalies that have occurred at the sub pixel level duan and bastiaanssen 2013 ji et al 2009 mouret et al 2021 tan et al 2019 although the lower values did not impact the estimation of the evaporation loss they significantly affected the data distribution and visualization however the outlier values can be treated and removed using several techniques such as the quantile based method z score method and interquartile range iqr to do this pandas library and quantile function using jupyter notebook in anaconda platform for implementation were applied with a percentage of 5 to determine the minimum threshold of the lower values and a percentage of 95 to determine the maximum threshold of the extreme values indeed these quantile percentages were selected using trial error procedures based on the field knowledge on the reservoir dimensions where most irrigation water reservoirs areas are ranging from 20 m2 to 3000 m2 then the outlier values were removed from the dataset fig 7 presents the distribution of the remotely sensed dataset of the reservoir area s after outliers removal fig 7 shows that the cleaned data was well distributed compared to that illustrated in fig 6 besides table 2 presents the statistical characteristics and distribution law of the remotely sensed reservoir area it was observed that the mean of reservoir area slightly varied over seasons and ranged from 312 m2 to 338 m2 per reservoir however the reservoir number nr varied from one season to another this can be explained by the installation of new reservoirs and or by the fact that the empty reservoir cannot be remotely sensed as a water body besides it was found that the global area of the reservoirs sum was highly correlated with reservoir numbers r2 0 92 indeed it varied from 68 ha to 104 ha over seasons during the agricultural year of 2019 2020 such variation in reservoir areas and numbers is due to the water withdrawal reservoir scales and the practice of the farmers in addition to the high variability of the climatic conditions in the region these variations can render the deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss an inaccurate approach nr reservoir number max maximum of the reservoir areas min minimum of the reservoir areas sd standard deviation of the reservoir areas si total of the reservoir areas 3 2 uncertainties and probability distributions statistical analysis of the daily pan evaporation for the period from january 1 2010 to december 31 2020 was carried out using a significance level of 5 to select the best fitted probability distribution table 3 presents the corresponding parameters to these distributions however it was observed that 50 of the months obeyed log normal distribution followed by beta weibull and gamma distributions for the pan coefficient we were based on the previous studies to determine the probability distribution interestingly winter 1981 found that this parameter ranged from 0 40 to 2 in the united states lakes meanwhile alvarez et al 2007 found that the monthly cp ranged from 0 80 to 1 20 for irrigation water reservoirs in spain indeed a cp of more than 1 can be explained by the heat transfer from the reservoir bottom to the water body which contributes to the evaporation process during the cold periods less than 0 c therefore the evaporation from reservoirs is higher than the measured pan evaporation since the minimum temperature in the study area is about 6 5 c we assumed that the cp ranged from 0 80 to 1 and considered as uniform distribution also as for the global reservoir area we considered uniformly distributed through the year with a maximum of 105 ha and minimum of 68 ha 3 3 simulation results monte carlo simulation was carried out through the generation of 20000 iterations according to probability distributions of the explanatory variables for each month such as reservoir area pan evaporation and pan coefficient the forecasting model was run to compute the annual evaporation loss from reservoirs table 4 presents descriptive statistical characteristics of the 20000 simulated annual evaporation losses such as the maximum minimum mean median sd and coefficient of variance cv besides fig 8 presents the exceedance probability distribution associated with the annual evaporation loss fig 8a and percentage loss fig 8b it was shown that the annual evaporation losses from the reservoirs associated with exceedance probabilities of 90 75 50 25 and 10 were about 1 50 mm3 yr 1 1 70 mm3 yr 1 1 90 mm3 yr 1 2 14 mm3 yr 1 and 2 34 mm3 yr 1 respectively globally compared to the water availability in berrechid province and aquifer status the minimum evaporation loss is considered important meanwhile the deterministic calculation using average values of the evaporation and reservoir areas provided an average annual evaporation loss about 2 60 mm3 yr 1 according to the mcs results fig 8a the exceedance probability associated with this loss value was less than 4 from this result it was observed that the deterministic approach overestimated the evaporation loss in the studied area circumstances to compare our results with the previously published study results we used a ratio defined as evaporation loss per year divided by reservoir areas maximum value in mm3 ha 1 yr 1 the ratios associated with mean values of the evaporation loss provided by the probabilistic model table 3 and deterministic estimation were about 0 017 and 0 024 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 respectively it was observed that the ratio provided by mcs was close to the finding of the martínez alvarez et al 2008 study where the calculated ratio was 0 012 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 for estimating the evaporation loss from 14 145 irrigation water reservoirs in the semi arid region using a dataset of 74 meteorological stations in spain regarding the large reservoirs the calculated ratio from the results of the wurbs and ayala 2014 study was 0 014 mm3 ha 1 yr 1 the observed differences in these ratios were acceptable and can be explained by the variation in pan evaporation and the dimensions of the reservoirs these comparisons supported the reliability of the developed probabilistic model as these areas were fairly monitored in terms of evaporation measurements compared to the studied zone regarding the percentage loss loss we used the deterministic model presented in the eq 2 to run the mcs considering uniform distribution of reservoir heights this assumption can be justified by the fact that the minimum height is 1 50 m while the maximum height is 3 m and each farmer manages its small reservoir independently that renders all intervals of the same length included in the law support have the same probability however fig 8b illustrates the probability distribution of the simulated loss it was observed that the loss ranged from 2 20 to 6 30 as for exceedance probabilities of 90 and 75 the percentage losses loss were about 2 90 and 3 20 of the annual groundwater withdrawn and stored in irrigation water reservoirs respectively by combining the annual evaporation loss and percentage loss for exceedance probabilities of 90 and 75 the annual water withdrawn and stored in the reservoirs were 51 50 mm3 yr 1 and 52 60 mm3 yr 1 respectively however according to the abhbc the estimated annual water withdrawal from the berrechid aquifer was estimated at 72 mm3 yr 1 indeed this estimation included water for irrigation with reservoirs and without reservoirs livestock production and others 3 4 sensitivity analysis monte carlo simulation was carried out and appeared to be a flexible framework to deal with an uncertainty of the stochastic nature of the input variables the water evaporation from small reservoirs by providing a probabilistic forecasting model however the sensitivity of this model to the input variables is crucial to determine the importance of each variable in this study the sensitivity analysis was carried out using the contribution to variance based approach the sensitivity analysis results of the probabilistic model are presented in fig 9 this figure shows that the contributions of the pan evaporation evp pan coefficient cp and reservoir area s to the variance of the evaporation loss output varied from one month to another interestingly for the dry months from june to october the probabilistic model was more sensitive to cp compared to the other variables with a contribution to variance reaching 0 56 meanwhile for the other month it was observed that the model was sensitive to evp with a contribution reaching 0 70 for november which can be justified by the uncertainty associated with precipitation measurement during the wet months which impacts the evaporation estimation consequently the evaporation measurement and pan coefficient should be prioritized in the monitoring process for all months while for the dry months the surface area s appeared to be important compared to the other months 4 discussion 4 1 reproducibility of the methodology the evaporation loss from irrigation water reservoirs impacts water resource availability and farmers incomes particularly in arid and semi arid areas maestre valero et al 2013 sampaio et al 2020 the estimation of these losses is under different uncertainty sources particularly for the small reservoirs in the regions in which the limiting factors highly vary high resolution remote sensing method and mcs can play an important role in estimating the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs in this study the validation results showed that remote sensing with high resolution satellite imagery datasets is suggested to detect small reservoirs furthermore the comparison of mcs results with determinist estimations of the evaporation loss in fairly monitored semi arid environments demonstrated the robustness of the developed framework consequently the developed approach is seemed to capture all uncertainties in the estimation of the evaporation from small irrigation water reservoirs rather than using deterministic calculation besides the developed methodology is not only valuable for small reservoirs but for all other water surfaces too such as irrigation channels and derivation channels since the surface area of these hydro infrastructures are highly dynamic over time in poorly monitored regions the application of this methodology will be a powerful tool to overcome the lack of the measurements 4 2 practical implication in agricultural water management for two decades worldwide research has investigated the efficiency of many methods to reduce evaporation loss from reservoirs however the implementation of the evaporation suppression measures is valuable in agricultural water management if they are economically viable martínez alvarez et al 2009 indeed the economic viability depends highly on the water price the maintenance costs and the water quantity to be saved more importantly the accuracy in estimating the evaporation loss plays a crucial role in evaluating the economic viability as there is a high daily fluctuation in small reservoir areas the deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss requires continuous monitoring with high frequency meanwhile the developed probabilistic forecasting model is useful to overcome the overlooked uncertainty sources in the deterministic approach because in the probabilistic model all uncertainty sources are embedded by simulating many variable combination scenarios this model provides an exceedance probability for each evaporation loss quantity this information allows the decision makers to disclose the investment related risk and avoiding wrong decisions in other words the economic viability of installing the evaporation reduction measures in reservoirs is determined by a threshold of the water quantity to be recovered but the exceedance probability corresponding to this quantity is a keystone for deciding accordingly an important evaporation loss as a threshold of the economic viability associated with a high exceedance probability can justify investing to install evaporation suppression measures in contrast for a low exceedance probability associated with a threshold of economic viability indicates that the investment to install the selected mitigation measure against the evaporation loss is at high risk concerning the studied area the moroccan water policy fixed the price of groundwater for irrigation purposes at 0 002 per m3 to mitigate the social inequality issue between the rural and urban zones according to martínez alvarez et al 2009 this price cannot cover installing any measures to reduce the evaporation loss by the farmers for example to save groundwater quantity associated with an exceedance probability of 90 1 50 mm3 yr 1 equivalents to 0 003 million per year the farmers need to invest 7 8 million to install suspended shade cloth covers in reservoirs water quantity of 1 5 mm3 yr 1 can allow the irrigation of 300 ha yr 1 of carrot production in this area fao 2020 hence using other indices in evaluating the economic viability of the evaporation measures in similar regions may be valuable such as water productivity and aquifer sustainability however installing floating photovoltaic covers for irrigation water reservoirs could be an economical alternative for both groundwater pumping cost and evaporation reductions particularly in developing countries padilha campos lopes et al 2020 redón santafé et al 2014 taboada et al 2017 furthermore interpretation of the water scarcity cost can change the economic viability of the measures against evaporation loss vallino et al 2020 zetland 2021 therefore measuring the water scarcity and evaluating the impacts of the water re pricing on the farmer incomes are suggested to be studied in future research to improve the policy of agricultural water management to ensure the sustainability of the water resources particularly in developing countries furthermore developing new low cost methods to reduce the evaporation loss from small irrigation water reservoirs could bottom up approaches that should be investigated 5 conclusions the evaporation loss from small reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture leads to water scarcity aggravation particularly in arid environments with aquifers under depletion and continuous salinization the main aim of this study was to develop a probabilistic approach based on high resolution satellite imagery datasets and mcs to forecast the evaporation loss from small reservoirs in a semi arid region more importantly the main findings of this study are as follow 1 the applied approach has an advantage that can overcome the limitations of determinist estimation by embedding all uncertainty sources in the mcs 2 mcs is a valuable alternative to solve the constraint related to the high fluctuation of the surface areas of the reservoirs over time in applying deterministic estimation of the evaporation loss 3 the comparison of the evaporation results with those of the published studies about well monitored zones and similar climates demonstrated the robustness of the applied approach 4 the evaporation from small agricultural reservoirs is significant compared to the water resource availability in the studied area to sum up the application of the developed framework could be useful for evaluating the economic viability of evaporation suppression measures and designing optimal irrigation water reservoirs in groundwater based agriculture furthermore the developed methodology could be valuable to estimate evaporation losses not only for small irrigation water reservoirs but it could be a powerful tool for the large reservoirs particularly in poorly monitored zones declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

9697,accurate groundwater quality estimation is of great significance for effective irrigation management in agricultural areas however due to lack of data the parameterization of the physical models is restricted for large areas with diverse underlying surface conditions to obtain effective and convenient estimations of groundwater quality with the most accessible data is urgently needed in this study the validity of the data based models in irrigation water quality index estimation was investigated by only using physical groundwater parameters as inputs 15 combination scenarios of the physical parameters including temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were examined by support vector machine svm random forests rf artificial neural networks ann and extreme

approach was performed to assess the uncertainty of the physical groundwater parameters and the sensitivity of the ai models the results revealed an input pattern which emphasized the important role of ec and the improving function of ph in revealing the nature of data based irrigation water quality index estimation results of the uncertainty analysis also confirmed the prominent superiority and robustness of the svm rf and elm models in producing excellent estimations with only physical parameters as inputs the developed ai models were valuable in estimating irrigation water quality indexes thus could help decision makers manage irrigation strategies by using physical groundwater parameters as input variables the ai models showed prospects in convenient and cost effective irrigation water quality index estimating keywords groundwater quality data based model uncertainty irrigated agriculture 1 introduction the globally increasing need of food and the problem of salinization nutrient and pesticide pollution pose great challenges for sustainable agriculture management food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011 boyer et al 2013 chaudhary and srivastava 2021 singh 2021 among the problems salinization is the most widespread that threatens agricultural production resulting serious ecological social and health risks zhao et al 2019 this is especially true for areas where irrigation agriculture is well developed xue et al 2018 irrigation water with poor quality affects the physical and chemical properties of soil to such an extent yield is affected further threatening food security ding et al 2020 ondrasek et al 2021 in arid and semiarid regions groundwater is an important source for irrigation groundwater quality highly affects the sustainable management of irrigation therefore to predict the quality of groundwater is vital particularly for groundwater fed agricultural areas li et al 2020 in general irrigation water quality can either be evaluated by physical or data based models for physical or conceptual models various physical processes that control the salt movement including irrigation drainage soil water salinity dynamics and shallow groundwater movement are abstracted into modules based on thorough filed works xue et al 2020 li et al 2020 though more details and better understanding of the water flowing process can be obtained the requirement of a large number of parameters may limit their generalization especially in areas with diverse underlying surface conditions ondrasek and rengel 2021 for data based models

simulating water quality modeling the application of the ai models in irrigation water quality estimating is relatively rare in the countable studies of data based irrigation water quality prediction physical e g electrical conductivity ec hydrogen ion concentration ph temperature t and chemical parameters of the water were usually used as model inputs however to obtain the chemical parameters comprehensively and concisely for a large agricultural area is expensive and time consuming in the study of el bilali et al 2021 promising forecast results of irrigation groundwater quality indexes were derived by using adaptive boosting rf ann and support vector regression models with ec ph and t as inputs this study has provided new ideas for the estimation of irrigation water quality indexes by only using physical parameters however whether the other combinations of the physical parameters for example ec and ph t and ph t still have satisfactory results remains unknown thus it is necessary to specify a candidate input set of significant variables for areas with insufficient data being black box in nature the ai models may have uncertainty chitsazan et al 2015 it is essential to take the sensitivity of the input variables and the uncertainty of the models into consideration when applying ai models otherwise the reliability of these models in addressing real world problems may remain doubtful failing to provide solid scientific suggestions elshorbagy et al 2010 in reference to the current studies the work of optimizing input combinations and uncertainty analysis for the ai models is few reported considering the stochastic and black box characteristics of these models the monte carlo mc simulation which is random sampling in nature can be an appropriate approach to quantify the uncertainty resulting from model structure and inputs shrestha et al 2009 the zhangye basin which is located in the middle of the hexi corridor northwest china and a key node of the silk road economic belt is a place with rare precipitation and limited surface water irrigated agriculture which is well developed in this region is the largest water user in terms of volume and relies increasingly on groundwater ji et al 2006 salinization is severe in this area qi and luo 2007 yang et al 2019 furthermore the expansion of the cultivated area the over exploration of the groundwater resources and the excessive use of chemical fertilizer aggregate the situation largely jiang et al 2020 there is no doubt that the problem of salinization would impact agricultural production and water security thus the main objective of the present study was to investigate the capability and uncertainty of the ai models in estimating irrigation water quality indexes by only using physical groundwater parameters as input to achieve this 1 the validity of possible combination of four physical groundwater parameters including temperature ph ec and dissolved oxygen were tested to estimate irrigation water quality indexes e g tds ps and sar 2 the effectiveness of the ai models was evaluated and compared by applying the svm rf ann and elm models 3 the sensitivity of the physical groundwater parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in irrigation water quality indexes estimation were analyzed by the mc approach 2 irrigation water quality indexes the suitability of irrigation water that induces soil salinization is assessed by diverse indexes such as sodium adsorption ratio sar or na residual sodium carbonate rsc or residual alkalinity ra kelly s ratio kr or kelly s index ki permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar and total hardness th singh et al 2021 note that these indexes are used as metrics of groundwater quality to reflect soil salinization problems considering the fact that soil salinization contains saline and alkaline processes the selection of proper indexes is beneficial to reduce redundance according to the water quality for agriculture guideline of the fao ayers and westcot 1985 and the standard for irrigation water quality of china ministry of ecology and environment of china state administration for market regulation of china 2021 indexes including total dissolved solids tds potential salinity ps and sodium adsorption ratio sar are enough to reflect irrigation induced soil salinization tds as an indicator of dissolved salts and ps as an index for salinity help to reflect the soil salinity condition while sar is used to indicate the soil alkalization calcification process that may impact the infiltration rate of soil tds is the sum of ion concentrations in the water and is reported in microgram per milliliter μg ml sar refers to the relative ratio of the sodium ions in the irrigation water to the sodium ions exchanged with the soil richards 1954 high sar value in μg ml means the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil texture and the decrease of the irrigation

stored in pre cleaned polypropylene bottles and sent back to the laboratory immediately after the fieldwork the concentration of major ions as na k ca2 mg2 nh4 cl no2 no3 and so4 2 was analyzed using respective standard methods at gansu geological engineering laboratory all the groundwater samples were filtered through the 0 45 µm membrane filters pall life sciences ann arbor mi usa acidified with ultra pure nitric acid ph below 2 cations including na k ca2 mg2 nh4 were measured by the inductively coupled plasma spectrometer icap 7400 thermo fisher united states anions like cl no2 no3 and so4 2 were measured by the ion chromatograph ic 8628 qingdao luhai photoelectric technology co ltd china 3 3 ai models 3 3 1 support vector machine svm svm was first developed by vapnik 1998 on the basis of the statistical learning theory in the early 1990s for classification and then extended to regression cortes and vapnik 1995 the nature of support vector regression algorithm is to construct a hyperplane for the high dimensional input features the performance of the svm highly depends on the kernel function e g linear polynomial radial basis function rbf since a well performed kernel function allows the input to be separable in the feature space in this study the rbf function was used to train the model eq 1 parameters including penalty factor c and kernel factor γ which are vital for the general performance of the svm model were computed through the genetic algorithm based parameter searching approach by using the libsvm toolbox version 3 1 chang and lin 2011 the optimum parameters for svmtds svmps and svmsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 1 ϕ x exp γ x i x 2 3 3 2 random forests rf rf is an ensemble learning algorithm by combining the concept of decision trees and bagging breiman 2001 the basic idea of the rf regression model is to extract repeatedly and randomly k samples from the training dataset with replacement according to the bootstrap resampling bagging method a random forest which is composed by a large number of trees referred to as ntree parameter is created for the bootstrap sample set since each decision tree grows to the largest extent and without pruning more detailed description of the rf method can be found in breiman 2001 in this study the randomforest package version 4 6 14 in r software version 4 1 1 was used to perform the algorithm parameters including the ntree and mtry were identified through a parameter searching approach the optimal numbers of ntree and mtry for rftds rfps and rfsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 3 3 3 artificial neural network ann ann is a massively parallel distributed information processing system that is able to simulate the structure and function of the neural system of human brain haykin and lippmann 1994 interested readers can refer to rajaee et al 2019 in this study an input layer with physical parameters one hidden layer with a number of nodes and an output layer were employed as the model structure for the feedforward neural network the optimal number of the hidden nodes was determined by a trial and error approach from i 1 to 2i where i is the number of nodes in the input layer as recommended by swingler 1996 the tansig and purelin were used as transfer functions for the hidden and output layers respectively appendix a tables a 1 a 3 demonstrates the optimal architecture for anntds annps and annsar models under different input combination scenarios after the architecture of the ann model was determined the network was trained in 20 000 epochs with an error goal of 0 01 3 3 4 extreme learning machine elm elm is developed with one single hidden layer feedforward neural network architecture huang et al 2004 the output matrix of the hidden layer needs to be uniquely determined by the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix huang et al 2015 the basic elm algorithm with three layers including the input hidden and output were used to develop the model huang et al 2012 the sigmoid and the linear activation functions were used for the hidden and output layers respectively the numbers of the hidden nodes were determined from 1 to 100 through multiple trials the basic rule to find the optimal number of the hidden nodes lies in the critical point in which error decreased significantly at first while becoming less evident afterwards the numbers of the hidden nodes were not always identical since the model structures were not the same when estimating tds ps and sar in this study the optimal number of the hidden nodes for elmtds elmps and elmsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 3 4 input selection and data preprocessing the inputs of the svm rf ann and elm models were determined based on the physical parameters of the groundwater t ph ec and do indicating that possible combinations of t ph ec and do were assembled to find the best performed one data partitioning is important for the ai models since training and testing are two basic but sequential procedures in this study approximately 70 of the data were used for training the remaining 30 were used for testing table 1 shows the statistical parameters of the aforementioned physical parameters from different dataset the results clearly demonstrated the similar statistical properties of the training and the testing datasets which is important to develop the best ai model maier et al 2010 however the diverse units of the parameters may have adverse effects on the results therefore all the data were standardized between 0 1 to eliminate the dimension difference by applying the following equation before training 2 p p p min p max p min where p p pmin and pmax is the original standardized minimum and maximum value of the physical parameters respectively 3 5 performance evaluation the accuracy of the svm rf ann and elm models were evaluated by the correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns ns ranges between and 1 indicating the simulating ability of a model relative to the mean of the calculations the best fit between the calculated and estimated values should demonstrate r 1 rmse 0 mape 0 and ns 1 note that the performance of a model is considered very good if ns exceeds 0 75 good if ns is greater than 0 65 and satisfactory if ns is greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 6 uncertainty analysis the mc approach was used to analyze the sensitivity of the input parameters t ph do ec and the uncertainty of the ai models svm rf ann elm firstly the uncertainty ranges and the shapes of pdfs for t ph do ec were identified the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to measure the hypothesis that the variable fitted the corresponding theoretical distribution at 95 confidence level dehghani et al 2014 secondly 1000 vectors were randomly generated according to the respective fitted pdfs of t ph do and ec the unrealistic extreme values of the generated vectors need to be excluded to keep the similarity with the original series afterwards an input pattern with one input of the generated mc values in the defined range and the others of the corresponding mean values was run through the best performed ai model of tds ps and sar to analyze the influence of the input parameters thirdly the original datasets of the optimal input combination were resampled for 1000 times randomly keeping the partitioning ratio of the training 70 and testing 30 datasets unchangeable then 1000 time series for the respective tds ps and sar parameters were generated by their corresponding best ai models the 95 confidence interval which is able to provide more information noori et al 2010 was determined for tds ps and sar respectively the d factor was used as a criteria to evaluate the uncertainty of the ai model the ideal value of d factor is closer to 0 d factor less than 1 representing a desirable result abbaspour et al 2007 3 d factor 1 n i 1 n p upper p lower σ p where pupper and plower are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentiles of the parameter σp represents the standard deviation of the parameter 4 results the ability of the ai models including svm rf ann and elm in estimating three irrigation groundwater quality indexes tds ps sar for the zhangye basin were evaluated as possible combinations of the physical parameters were comprehensively conducted once the best performed model structures were determined the mc technique was further performed to examine the relative importance of physical parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps sar estimation respectively 4 1 selection of inputs the validity of the 15 combinations and the effectiveness of the ai models for the estimation of tds ps and sar were mainly analyzed tables 2 5 demonstrate the performance of the svm rf ann and elm for tds ps sar estimation under various input combination scenarios in terms of r rmse mape and ns during the testing period estimating results from the training phase were presented in appendix b tables b 1 b 4 considering the main purpose of this study was to predict irrigation water quality indexes the results from the testing phase were primarily discussed it can be seen from table 2 that with ph ec and do as input svmtds14 yielded the highest ns value 0 961 rftds14 elmtds14 and anntds14 also demonstrated very high accuracy with ns 0 87 which were much higher than the standard of a very good model ns 0 75 in terms of the other metrics the r values of the svmtds14 rftds14 anntds14 and elmtds14 models all exceeded 0 95 indicating the high correlation between the calculated and estimated tds the relatively small rmse less than 295 87 μg ml and mape 21 40 values showed the less error of the tds estimations compared with the calculated data which was ranging from 115 503 μg ml to 4205 623 μg ml these results revealed the excellent skill and good quality of the ai models with ph ec and do as inputs therefore ph ec and do can be regarded as the best input combination for tds estimation besides more excellent combinations can be derived from combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec as the ns values of the ai models exceeded 0 9 in most cases considering the fact that a model can be regarded as a perfect one when the ns value is closer to 1 it can be inferred that the bolded input combinations in tables 2 5 obtained excellent performance moreover the relatively small error and high precision of r rmse and mape also confirmed the effectiveness of these models in tds estimation as for ps svmps13 can be regarded as the best performed model due to the obtained highest ns value 0 927 and the lowest rmse value 103 231 μg ml table 2 meanwhile both rfps13 and elmps13 achieved ns values higher than 0 8 and rmse values lower than 150 3 μg ml with t ph and ec as inputs despite the relatively poor performance of the annps13 model combination 13 was able to derive the highest ns value as well as the lowest rmse value thus t ph and ec composed the best inputs for ps estimation moreover similar to that for tds combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec also achieved very good performance for ps estimation bolded in tables 2 5 the result can also be proved by the relative higher r values 0 850 as well as the lower rmse 258 586 μg ml and mape 56 449 values for sar estimation svmsar13 satisfied the standard of a well performed model due to the lowest rmse value 5 366 μg ml and the highest ns value 0 714 table 2 satisfactory results were derived from rfsar13 and elmsar13 as their ns values 0 541 for rfsar13 0 635 for elmsar13 merely reached the limit of 0 5 as for annsar13 both the lower ns value 0 248 and the higher rmse value 8 700 μg ml signified the very poor estimating accuracy on the other hand combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec achieved good performance for sar estimation since the ns values of the ai models only exceeded 0 5 in most cases bolded in tables 2 5 accordingly the comparatively higher r values 0 644 as well as the lower rmse 11 752 μg ml and mape 60 876 values demonstrated the deteriorated performance in sar estimation as well when comparing the four ai models svm performed the best elm derived slightly inferior performance rf achieved even worse accuracy than elm while ann s performance was the poorest for example svmps3 obtained rmse of 118 557 μg ml and mape of 36 419 the rmse and mape values of the elmps3 model increased 2 088 and 15 483 respectively for rfps3 an obvious deteriorated performance can be discovered as the rmse value increased more than 36 014 μg ml more dramatically significant performance was obtained by the annps3 model since the 87 747 increase of the rmse value the superiority of svm in yielding the most accurate estimations as also reported by other studies yu et al 2020 may lie in the ability to inherently solve the convex optimization problems besides the randomly assigned weights may be the reason for the unstable performance of ann the predicted tds ps and sar of the 15 combination scenarios for the svm rf ann and elm models during the testing phase were also plotted against the corresponding calculated values in appendix c figs c 1 c 3 the superiorities of the well performed combinations were evident because of the tight scattering and the better fit figs 2 4 demonstrate the comparisons between the predicted and calculated tds ps and sar for the respective 8 promising combination scenarios it can be seen that the performance of the four distinctive ai models varied greatly high error in extreme values of tds ps and sar existed though the derived results were satisfactory or even extraordinarily outstanding thus it was necessary to further analyze the uncertainty of the ai models and the sensitivity of the input variables since both of them may incur error 4 2 uncertainty analysis as discussed above ph ec and do were used as the best input combination for tds t ph and ec were the best inputs for ps and sar firstly the fitted pdfs of t ph ec and do were confirmed fig 5 the assumed pdfs generalized extreme value distribution for t and ph γ distribution for ec and do succeeded to pass the hypothesis test according to the kolmogorov smirnov statistics thus was able to further run the mc analysis abbaspour et al 2007 gao et al 2018 table 6 presents the sensitivity of the input parameters to the tds ps and sar estimations the input with the highest influence on tds 3637 321 μg ml and ps 1715 067 μg ml was ec ph was the second most influencing variable the change of which caused tds and ps to change 186 108 μg ml and 93 441 μg ml respectively there was a little difference in the parameter with the minimum effect for tds the parameter was do for ps the parameter was t the first ranked variable for ps was ph resulting in 6 902 μg ml variation the change of ps caused by t was only 0 591 μg ml which was much smaller than ph moreover tiny effect that ec provided can be found since the ec ranging from 310 μs cm to 5760 μs cm merely triggered 0 037 μg ml variation of ps secondly the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps and sar estimation was analyzed in general 19 444 56 481 98 148 and 89 815 of svm rf ann and elm estimations fell within the 95 confidence interval of tds 37 037 46 296 94 444 and 60 185 for ps 18 519 38 889 84 259 and 35 185 for sar respectively figs 6 8 note that the wider the confidence interval the inferior accuracy of the models gao et al 2018 the result indicated the superiority of svm over the other models the uncertainty evaluation criteria also reinforced the result as d factor of the svm rf ann and elm models was 0 050 0 280 1 386 and 0 844 for tds 0 177 0 337 1 452 and 0 341 for ps 0 327 0 553 1 408 and 0 413 for sar respectively the estimating results of ann model appeared to be more uncertain than the other three models recall that d factor less than 1 is desirable the svm rf and elm models can be regarded as satisfactory in tds ps and sar estimation the results were inconsistent with many studies about the application of ann in groundwater quality simulation banerjee et al 2011 el bilali et al 2021 this can be explained by the difference in model structures thirdly table 7 exhibits the descriptive and distribution statistics for different datasets in tds ps and sar estimations the same γ distribution for tds and sar while the lognormal distribution for ps were obtained the results emphasized the similar distribution characteristics of the predicted and corresponding calculated tds ps and sar values although they were generated by different models besides the descriptive statistics of the estimated tds ps and sar also proved the stability of svm over the others the elm model yielded more stable estimations than the ann and rf models after 1000 simulating runs thus it can be said that both the svm and elm models got more accurate results than rf and ann in summary the sensitivity of the input parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps and sar estimation were analyzed by using the mc approach derived results showed that the importance of the inputs for tds can be ranked as ec ph do for ps the rank was ec ph t while for sar the sequence was ph t ec results of the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that the svm rf and elm models were reliable in estimating tds ps and sar svr preferred to be the most robust model however ann showed more uncertainty than the other models 5 discussion 5 1 model interpretation according to the derived results although discrepancy existed in the best performed input combinations for tds ps and sar estimation those combinations that yielded the promising performance were identical through a comprehensive comparison among these combinations it can be found that ec was an important input for ai models to estimate irrigation water quality indexes while ph was able to improve the accuracy of the models when used as inputs together with ec meaning that with only ec as input the good performance of the ai models was guaranteed if higher accuracy was needed in conditions with enough data ph and another influential parameter for the specific water quality indexes was recommended for example in this study the parameters were do for tds t for ps and sar the pattern was plausible as ec was closely related with salinization ph itself a quantification of salinity or alkalinity helped to reflect the characteristics of the irrigation water in an assessment of alkaline irrigation ali et al 2021 also found that the correlation between the predicted and observed hydraulic conductivity was significantly improved by amending a ph driven hydraulic reduction scaling factor into the hydrus 1d model though ai models were commonly reckoned as data based models without physical foundations the results were able to reflect the intrinsic and underlying mechanism in irrigation water quality index estimation as also pointed out by yu et al 2020 5 2 agricultural implication for irrigated agricultural areas like the zhangye basin to accurately predict the irrigation water quality for the whole area by using physical models was difficult for one thing the frequent alternation of seasonal salt accumulation and desalination processes makes the solute transport mechanism very complex zhu et al 2021 li and wang 2021 for another the mechanisms controlling salinity build up vary among groundwater recharge flow through and discharge areas sun et al 2016 though in an application of a four module the irrigation and drainage systems groundwater and a field scale module integrated regional irrigation water productivity model very accurate results ns 0 813 r2 0 815 were achieved in the calibration phase for groundwater salinity estimation xue et al 2020 however for areas e g the zhangye basin with insufficient hydrogeological irrigation drainage data as well as the proper initial and boundary conditions the parameterization of these conceptual or physical models may be restricted regarding that the physical parameters used in this study including t do ph and ec could be conveniently and immediately measured by portable sensors or automated monitoring methods in field the employment of the ai models e g svm rf elm was highly recommended as equitable and efficient methods to predict groundwater quality for irrigated agriculture areas derived results could provide scientific support for policy makers or farmers to make a comprehensive evaluation of the irrigation water quality and a proper adjustment of irrigation scheduling without knowing the sophisticated salt transporting process moreover the finding in this study was especially referencing for similar areas with insufficient data to run the physical models the ai models e g svm rf elm with promising input combination scenarios could be presented as alternatives however this study still had some limitations that could be overcome in future research firstly the capability of the data based models with continuous and seasonal monitoring groundwater data needs further investigation secondly improvement of the performance for sar estimation remains another problem that needs to be solved in the future study possible attempt may lie in the application of efficient data decomposition algorithms like wavelet transform complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise wen et al 2019 thirdly a lot of factors such as meteorological conditions e g potential evapotranspiration anthropological activities e g fertilization and irrigation mode overflow irrigation or water saved irrigation like drip and sprinkle have influence on irrigation water quality further exploration of the data based model s potentiality in incorporating these factors is anticipated 6 conclusions in this study the feasibility of the svm rf ann and elm models with various groundwater physical parameters as inputs for irrigation water quality indexes estimation in the zhangye basin northwest china was investigated according to the performance metrics the sensitivity of the physical parameters and uncertainty of the ai models were further analyzed by the mc technique the results showed that ph ec and do were the best input combination for tds estimation while t ph and ec can be regarded as the best predictors for ps and sar an input pattern embodying in the important role of ec and the improving function of ph was proposed to reveal the nature of data based irrigation water quality index estimation the results also confirmed the prominent superiority and robustness of the svm rf and elm models in producing excellent estimations with only physical parameters as inputs the finding stated clearly the ability of the ai models e g svm rf and elm in accurately estimating the irrigation water quality indexes even for small samples since the physical groundwater parameters can be easily accessed those well performed ai models were highly recommended as convenient and cost effective irrigation water quality index estimating approaches especially for similar irrigated agricultural areas like the zhangye basin the ai models and the predicted results would help decision

9697,accurate groundwater quality estimation is of great significance for effective irrigation management in agricultural areas however due to lack of data the parameterization of the physical models is restricted for large areas with diverse underlying surface conditions to obtain effective and convenient estimations of groundwater quality with the most accessible data is urgently needed in this study the validity of the data based models in irrigation water quality index estimation was investigated by only using physical groundwater parameters as inputs 15 combination scenarios of the physical parameters including temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen were examined by support vector machine svm random forests rf artificial neural networks ann and extreme

intelligence ai models was evaluated according to the coefficient of correlation r root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns the monte carlo mc approach was performed to assess the uncertainty of the physical groundwater parameters and the sensitivity of the ai models the results revealed an input pattern which emphasized the important role of ec and the improving function of ph in revealing the nature of data based irrigation water quality index estimation results of the uncertainty analysis also confirmed the prominent superiority and robustness of the svm rf and elm models in producing excellent estimations with only physical parameters as inputs the developed ai models were valuable in estimating irrigation water quality indexes thus could help decision makers manage irrigation strategies by using physical groundwater parameters as input variables the ai models showed prospects in convenient and cost effective irrigation water quality index estimating keywords groundwater quality data based model uncertainty irrigated agriculture 1 introduction the globally increasing need of food and the problem of salinization nutrient and pesticide pollution pose great challenges for sustainable agriculture management food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2011 boyer et al 2013 chaudhary and srivastava 2021 singh 2021 among the problems salinization is the most widespread that threatens agricultural production resulting serious ecological social and health risks zhao et al 2019 this is especially true for areas where irrigation agriculture is well developed xue et al 2018 irrigation water with poor quality affects the physical and chemical properties of soil to such an extent yield is affected further threatening food security ding et al 2020 ondrasek et al 2021 in arid and semiarid regions groundwater is an important source for irrigation groundwater quality highly affects the sustainable management of irrigation therefore to predict the quality of groundwater is vital particularly for groundwater fed agricultural areas li et al 2020 in general irrigation water quality can either be evaluated by physical or data based models for physical or conceptual models various physical processes that control the salt movement including irrigation drainage soil water salinity dynamics and shallow groundwater movement are abstracted into modules based on thorough filed works xue et al 2020 li et al 2020 though more details and better understanding of the water flowing process can be obtained the requirement of a large number of parameters may limit their generalization especially in areas with diverse underlying surface conditions ondrasek and rengel 2021 for data based models irrigation water quality is usually parameterized by comprehensive e g groundwater quality index wqi or specific indexes e g total dissolved solids tds potential salinity ps sodium adsorption ratio sar for salinization singha et al 2021 the highly nonlinear nonstationary and stochastic characteristics of the irrigation water quality make the predicting work a challenging task nosetto et al 2013 yin et al 2021c b in the last decades artificial intelligence ai models e g artificial neural networks ann support vector machine svm random forest rf extreme learning machine elm have been extensively used due to the simplicity and flexibility the powerful capability of these models in automatically capturing the complex nonlinear structures and characteristics of the environmental and

models and to yield more accurate predictions jamei et al 2020 despite the achieved satisfactory results in the application of many other aspects e g streamflow forecasting groundwater level simulating water quality modeling the application of the ai models in irrigation water quality estimating is relatively rare in the countable studies of data based irrigation water quality prediction physical e g electrical conductivity ec hydrogen ion concentration ph temperature t and chemical parameters of the water were usually used as model inputs however to obtain the chemical parameters comprehensively and concisely for a large agricultural area is expensive and time consuming in the study of el bilali et al 2021 promising forecast results of irrigation groundwater quality indexes were derived by using adaptive boosting rf ann and support vector regression models with ec ph and t as inputs this study has provided new ideas for the estimation of irrigation water quality indexes by only using physical parameters however whether the other combinations of the physical parameters for example ec and ph t and ph t still have satisfactory results remains unknown thus it is necessary to specify a candidate input set of significant variables for areas with insufficient data being black box in nature the ai models may have uncertainty chitsazan et al 2015 it is essential to take the sensitivity of the input variables and the uncertainty of the models into consideration when applying ai models otherwise the reliability of these models in addressing real world problems may remain doubtful failing to provide solid scientific suggestions elshorbagy et al 2010 in reference to the current studies the work of optimizing input combinations and uncertainty analysis for the ai models is few reported considering the stochastic and black box characteristics of these models the monte carlo mc simulation which is random sampling in nature can be an appropriate approach to quantify the uncertainty resulting from model structure and inputs shrestha et al 2009 the zhangye basin which is located in the middle of the hexi corridor northwest china and a key node of the silk road economic belt is a place with rare precipitation and limited surface water irrigated agriculture which is well developed in this region is the largest water user in terms of volume and relies increasingly on groundwater ji et al 2006 salinization is severe in this area qi and luo 2007 yang et al 2019 furthermore the expansion of the cultivated area the over exploration of the groundwater resources and the excessive use of chemical fertilizer aggregate the situation largely jiang et al 2020 there is no doubt that the problem of salinization would impact agricultural production and water security thus the main objective of the present study was to investigate the capability and uncertainty of the ai models in estimating irrigation water quality indexes by only using physical groundwater parameters as input to achieve this 1 the validity of possible combination of four physical groundwater parameters including temperature ph ec and dissolved oxygen were tested to estimate irrigation water quality indexes e g tds ps and sar 2 the effectiveness of the ai models was evaluated and compared by applying the svm rf ann and elm models 3 the sensitivity of the physical groundwater parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in irrigation water quality indexes estimation were analyzed by the mc approach 2 irrigation water quality indexes the suitability of irrigation water that induces soil salinization is assessed by diverse indexes such as sodium adsorption ratio sar or na residual sodium carbonate rsc or residual alkalinity ra kelly s ratio kr or kelly s index ki permeability index pi magnesium hazard mh or magnesium adsorption ratio mar and total hardness th singh et al 2021 note that these indexes are used as metrics of groundwater quality to reflect soil salinization problems considering the fact that soil salinization contains saline and alkaline processes the selection of proper indexes is beneficial to reduce redundance according to the water quality for agriculture guideline of the fao ayers and westcot 1985 and the standard for irrigation water quality of china ministry of ecology and environment of china state administration for market regulation of china 2021 indexes including total dissolved solids tds potential salinity ps and sodium adsorption ratio sar are enough to reflect irrigation induced soil salinization tds as an indicator of dissolved salts and ps as an index for salinity help to reflect the soil salinity condition while sar is used to indicate the soil alkalization calcification process that may impact the infiltration rate of soil tds is the sum of ion concentrations in the water and is reported in microgram per milliliter μg ml sar refers to the relative ratio of the sodium ions in the irrigation water to the sodium ions exchanged with the soil richards 1954 high sar value in μg ml means the reduction of the hydraulic conductivity of the soil texture and the decrease of the irrigation efficiency ps is defined as the chloride concentration plus half of the sulfate concentration in μg ml doneen 1964 ps highly affects the nature of irrigation water panneerselvam et al 2021 3 materials

liu et al 2018 however limited water could be intercepted from the river for agriculture since certain streamflow amount should be kept for both the life and ecology in the lower reach of the heihe

leached water and groundwater frequently interacted liu et al 2018 wang et al 2021b as irrigated agriculture is highly developed in these areas the irrigation process induces soil surface water and groundwater inextricably linked forming a feedback loop pulido bosch et al 2018 along with the interactions is the significant changes in solute resulting in the pollutants or salts to migrate with water to the deep soil or even groundwater li et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 when the groundwater with surplus salts is used for irrigation salinization may occur such irrigation activity has caused salinization area accelerating in the zhangye basin yin et al 2022 considering the significant role of groundwater in agricultural irrigation to assess its quality is urgently needed 3 2 groundwater

the statistical learning theory in the early 1990s for classification and then extended to regression cortes and vapnik 1995 the nature of support vector regression algorithm is to construct a hyperplane for the high dimensional input features the performance of the svm highly depends on the kernel function e g linear polynomial radial basis function rbf since a well performed kernel function allows the input to be separable in the feature space in this study the rbf function was used to train the model eq 1 parameters including penalty factor c and kernel factor γ which are vital for the general performance of the svm model were computed through the genetic algorithm based parameter searching approach by using the libsvm toolbox version 3 1 chang and lin 2011 the optimum parameters for svmtds svmps and svmsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 1 ϕ x exp γ x i x 2 3 3 2 random forests rf rf is an ensemble learning algorithm by combining the concept of decision trees and bagging breiman 2001 the basic idea of the rf regression model is to extract repeatedly and randomly k samples from the training dataset with replacement according to the bootstrap resampling bagging method a random forest which is composed by a large number of trees referred to as ntree parameter is created for the bootstrap sample set since each decision tree grows to the largest extent and without pruning more detailed description of the rf method can be found in breiman 2001 in this study the randomforest package version 4 6 14 in r software version 4 1 1 was used to perform the algorithm parameters including the ntree and mtry were identified through a parameter searching approach the optimal numbers of ntree and mtry for rftds rfps and rfsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 3 3 3 artificial neural network ann ann is a massively parallel distributed information processing system that is able to simulate the structure and function of the neural system of human brain haykin and lippmann 1994 interested readers can refer to rajaee et al 2019 in this study an input layer with physical parameters one hidden layer with a number of nodes and an output layer were employed as the model structure for the feedforward neural network the optimal number of the hidden nodes was determined by a trial and error approach from i 1 to 2i where i is the number of nodes in the input layer as recommended by swingler 1996 the tansig and purelin were used as transfer functions for the hidden and output layers respectively appendix a tables a 1 a 3 demonstrates the optimal architecture for anntds annps and annsar models under different input combination scenarios after the architecture of the ann model was determined the network was trained in 20 000 epochs with an error goal of 0 01 3 3 4 extreme learning machine elm elm is developed with one single hidden layer feedforward neural network architecture huang et al 2004 the output matrix of the hidden layer needs to be uniquely determined by the moore penrose generalized inverse matrix huang et al 2015 the basic elm algorithm with three layers including the input hidden and output were used to develop the model huang et al 2012 the sigmoid and the linear activation functions were used for the hidden and output layers respectively the numbers of the hidden nodes were determined from 1 to 100 through multiple trials the basic rule to find the optimal number of the hidden nodes lies in the critical point in which error decreased significantly at first while becoming less evident afterwards the numbers of the hidden nodes were not always identical since the model structures were not the same when estimating tds ps and sar in this study the optimal number of the hidden nodes for elmtds elmps and elmsar models under different input combination scenarios are demonstrated in appendix a tables a 1 a 3 3 4 input selection and data preprocessing the inputs of the svm rf ann and elm models were determined based on the physical parameters of the groundwater t ph ec and do indicating that possible combinations of t ph ec and do were assembled to find the best performed one data partitioning is important for the ai models since training and testing are two basic but sequential procedures in this study approximately 70 of the data were used for training the remaining 30 were used for testing table 1 shows the statistical parameters of the aforementioned physical parameters from different dataset the results clearly demonstrated the similar statistical properties of the training and the testing datasets which is important to develop the best ai model maier et al 2010 however the diverse units of the parameters may have adverse effects on the results therefore all the data were standardized between 0 1 to eliminate the dimension difference by applying the following equation before training 2 p p p min p max p min where p p pmin and pmax is the original standardized minimum and maximum value of the physical parameters respectively 3 5 performance evaluation the accuracy of the svm rf ann and elm models were evaluated by the correlation coefficient r root mean squared error rmse mean absolute percentage error mape and nash sutcliffe efficiency ns ns ranges between and 1 indicating the simulating ability of a model relative to the mean of the calculations the best fit between the calculated and estimated values should demonstrate r 1 rmse 0 mape 0 and ns 1 note that the performance of a model is considered very good if ns exceeds 0 75 good if ns is greater than 0 65 and satisfactory if ns is greater than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 6 uncertainty analysis the mc approach was used to analyze the sensitivity of the input parameters t ph do ec and the uncertainty of the ai models svm rf ann elm firstly the uncertainty ranges and the shapes of pdfs for t ph do ec were identified the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to measure the hypothesis that the variable fitted the corresponding theoretical distribution at 95 confidence level dehghani et al 2014 secondly 1000 vectors were randomly generated according to the respective fitted pdfs of t ph do and ec the unrealistic extreme values of the generated vectors need to be excluded to keep the similarity with the original series afterwards an input pattern with one input of the generated mc values in the defined range and the others of the corresponding mean values was run through the best performed ai model of tds ps and sar to analyze the influence of the input parameters thirdly the original datasets of the optimal input combination were resampled for 1000 times randomly keeping the partitioning ratio of the training 70 and testing 30 datasets unchangeable then 1000 time series for the respective tds ps and sar parameters were generated by their corresponding best ai models the 95 confidence interval which is able to provide more information noori et al 2010 was determined for tds ps and sar respectively the d factor was used as a criteria to evaluate the uncertainty of the ai model the ideal value of d factor is closer to 0 d factor less than 1 representing a desirable result abbaspour et al 2007 3 d factor 1 n i 1 n p upper p lower σ p where pupper and plower are the 97 5th and the 2 5th percentiles of the parameter σp represents the standard deviation of the parameter 4 results the ability of the ai models including svm rf ann and elm in estimating three irrigation groundwater quality indexes tds ps sar for the zhangye basin were evaluated as possible combinations of the physical parameters were comprehensively conducted once the best performed model structures were determined the mc technique was further performed to examine the relative importance of physical parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps sar estimation respectively 4 1 selection of inputs the validity of the 15 combinations and the effectiveness of the ai models for the estimation of tds ps and sar were mainly analyzed tables 2 5 demonstrate the performance of the svm rf ann and elm for tds ps sar estimation under various input combination scenarios in terms of r rmse mape and ns during the testing period estimating results from the training phase were presented in appendix b tables b 1 b 4 considering the main purpose of this study was to predict irrigation water quality indexes the results from the testing phase were primarily discussed it can be seen from table 2 that with ph ec and do as input svmtds14 yielded the highest ns value 0 961 rftds14 elmtds14 and anntds14 also demonstrated very high accuracy with ns 0 87 which were much higher than the standard of a very good model ns 0 75 in terms of the other metrics the r values of the svmtds14 rftds14 anntds14 and elmtds14 models all exceeded 0 95 indicating the high correlation between the calculated and estimated tds the relatively small rmse less than 295 87 μg ml and mape 21 40 values showed the less error of the tds estimations compared with the calculated data which was ranging from 115 503 μg ml to 4205 623 μg ml these results revealed the excellent skill and good quality of the ai models with ph ec and do as inputs therefore ph ec and do can be regarded as the best input combination for tds estimation besides more excellent combinations can be derived from combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec as the ns values of the ai models exceeded 0 9 in most cases considering the fact that a model can be regarded as a perfect one when the ns value is closer to 1 it can be inferred that the bolded input combinations in tables 2 5 obtained excellent performance moreover the relatively small error and high precision of r rmse and mape also confirmed the effectiveness of these models in tds estimation as for ps svmps13 can be regarded as the best performed model due to the obtained highest ns value 0 927 and the lowest rmse value 103 231 μg ml table 2 meanwhile both rfps13 and elmps13 achieved ns values higher than 0 8 and rmse values lower than 150 3 μg ml with t ph and ec as inputs despite the relatively poor performance of the annps13 model combination 13 was able to derive the highest ns value as well as the lowest rmse value thus t ph and ec composed the best inputs for ps estimation moreover similar to that for tds combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec also achieved very good performance for ps estimation bolded in tables 2 5 the result can also be proved by the relative higher r values 0 850 as well as the lower rmse 258 586 μg ml and mape 56 449 values for sar estimation svmsar13 satisfied the standard of a well performed model due to the lowest rmse value 5 366 μg ml and the highest ns value 0 714 table 2 satisfactory results were derived from rfsar13 and elmsar13 as their ns values 0 541 for rfsar13 0 635 for elmsar13 merely reached the limit of 0 5 as for annsar13 both the lower ns value 0 248 and the higher rmse value 8 700 μg ml signified the very poor estimating accuracy on the other hand combination 3 ec 7 t ec 9 do ec 10 ph ec 12 t do ec 13 t ph ec and 15 t do ph ec achieved good performance for sar estimation since the ns values of the ai models only exceeded 0 5 in most cases bolded in tables 2 5 accordingly the comparatively higher r values 0 644 as well as the lower rmse 11 752 μg ml and mape 60 876 values demonstrated the deteriorated performance in sar estimation as well when comparing the four ai models svm performed the best elm derived slightly inferior performance rf achieved even worse accuracy than elm while ann s performance was the poorest for example svmps3 obtained rmse of 118 557 μg ml and mape of 36 419 the rmse and mape values of the elmps3 model increased 2 088 and 15 483 respectively for rfps3 an obvious deteriorated performance can be discovered as the rmse value increased more than 36 014 μg ml more dramatically significant performance was obtained by the annps3 model since the 87 747 increase of the rmse value the superiority of svm in yielding the most accurate estimations as also reported by other studies yu et al 2020 may lie in the ability to inherently solve the convex optimization problems besides the randomly assigned weights may be the reason for the unstable performance of ann the predicted tds ps and sar of the 15 combination scenarios for the svm rf ann and elm models during the testing phase were also plotted against the corresponding calculated values in appendix c figs c 1 c 3 the superiorities of the well performed combinations were evident because of the tight scattering and the better fit figs 2 4 demonstrate the comparisons between the predicted and calculated tds ps and sar for the respective 8 promising combination scenarios it can be seen that the performance of the four distinctive ai models varied greatly high error in extreme values of tds ps and sar existed though the derived results were satisfactory or even extraordinarily outstanding thus it was necessary to further analyze the uncertainty of the ai models and the sensitivity of the input variables since both of them may incur error 4 2 uncertainty analysis as discussed above ph ec and do were used as the best input combination for tds t ph and ec were the best inputs for ps and sar firstly the fitted pdfs of t ph ec and do were confirmed fig 5 the assumed pdfs generalized extreme value distribution for t and ph γ distribution for ec and do succeeded to pass the hypothesis test according to the kolmogorov smirnov statistics thus was able to further run the mc analysis abbaspour et al 2007 gao et al 2018 table 6 presents the sensitivity of the input parameters to the tds ps and sar estimations the input with the highest influence on tds 3637 321 μg ml and ps 1715 067 μg ml was ec ph was the second most influencing variable the change of which caused tds and ps to change 186 108 μg ml and 93 441 μg ml respectively there was a little difference in the parameter with the minimum effect for tds the parameter was do for ps the parameter was t the first ranked variable for ps was ph resulting in 6 902 μg ml variation the change of ps caused by t was only 0 591 μg ml which was much smaller than ph moreover tiny effect that ec provided can be found since the ec ranging from 310 μs cm to 5760 μs cm merely triggered 0 037 μg ml variation of ps secondly the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps and sar estimation was analyzed in general 19 444 56 481 98 148 and 89 815 of svm rf ann and elm estimations fell within the 95 confidence interval of tds 37 037 46 296 94 444 and 60 185 for ps 18 519 38 889 84 259 and 35 185 for sar respectively figs 6 8 note that the wider the confidence interval the inferior accuracy of the models gao et al 2018 the result indicated the superiority of svm over the other models the uncertainty evaluation criteria also reinforced the result as d factor of the svm rf ann and elm models was 0 050 0 280 1 386 and 0 844 for tds 0 177 0 337 1 452 and 0 341 for ps 0 327 0 553 1 408 and 0 413 for sar respectively the estimating results of ann model appeared to be more uncertain than the other three models recall that d factor less than 1 is desirable the svm rf and elm models can be regarded as satisfactory in tds ps and sar estimation the results were inconsistent with many studies about the application of ann in groundwater quality simulation banerjee et al 2011 el bilali et al 2021 this can be explained by the difference in model structures thirdly table 7 exhibits the descriptive and distribution statistics for different datasets in tds ps and sar estimations the same γ distribution for tds and sar while the lognormal distribution for ps were obtained the results emphasized the similar distribution characteristics of the predicted and corresponding calculated tds ps and sar values although they were generated by different models besides the descriptive statistics of the estimated tds ps and sar also proved the stability of svm over the others the elm model yielded more stable estimations than the ann and rf models after 1000 simulating runs thus it can be said that both the svm and elm models got more accurate results than rf and ann in summary the sensitivity of the input parameters and the uncertainty of the ai models in tds ps and sar estimation were analyzed by using the mc approach derived results showed that the importance of the inputs for tds can be ranked as ec ph do for ps the rank was ec ph t while for sar the sequence was ph t ec results of the uncertainty analysis demonstrated that the svm rf and elm models were reliable in estimating tds ps and sar svr preferred to be the most robust model however ann showed more uncertainty than the other models 5 discussion 5 1 model interpretation according to the derived results although discrepancy existed in the best performed input combinations for tds ps and sar estimation those combinations that yielded the promising performance were identical through a comprehensive comparison among these combinations it can be found that ec was an important input for ai models to estimate irrigation water quality indexes while ph was able to improve the accuracy of the models when used as inputs together with ec meaning that with only ec as input the good performance of the ai models was guaranteed if higher accuracy was needed in conditions with enough data ph and another influential parameter for the specific water quality indexes was recommended for example in this study the parameters were do for tds t for ps and sar the pattern was plausible as ec was closely related with salinization ph itself a quantification of salinity or alkalinity helped to reflect the characteristics of the irrigation water in an assessment of alkaline irrigation ali et al 2021 also found that the correlation between the predicted and observed hydraulic conductivity was significantly improved by amending a ph driven hydraulic reduction scaling factor into the hydrus 1d model though ai models were commonly reckoned as data based models without physical foundations the results were able to reflect the intrinsic and underlying mechanism in irrigation water quality index estimation as also pointed out by yu et al 2020 5 2 agricultural implication for irrigated agricultural areas like the zhangye basin to accurately predict the irrigation water quality for the whole area by using physical models was difficult for one thing the frequent alternation of seasonal salt accumulation and desalination processes makes the solute transport mechanism very complex zhu et al 2021 li and wang 2021 for another the mechanisms controlling salinity build up vary among groundwater recharge flow through and discharge areas sun et al 2016 though in an application of a four module the irrigation and drainage systems groundwater and a field scale module integrated regional irrigation water productivity model very accurate results ns 0 813 r2 0 815 were achieved in the calibration phase for groundwater salinity estimation xue et al 2020 however for areas e g the zhangye basin with insufficient hydrogeological irrigation drainage data as well as the proper initial and boundary conditions the parameterization of these conceptual or physical models may be restricted regarding that the physical parameters used in this study including t do ph and ec could be conveniently and immediately measured by portable sensors or automated monitoring methods in field the employment of the ai models e g svm rf elm was highly recommended as equitable and efficient methods to predict groundwater quality for irrigated agriculture areas derived results could provide scientific support for policy makers or farmers to make a comprehensive evaluation of the irrigation water quality and a proper adjustment of irrigation scheduling without knowing the sophisticated salt transporting process moreover the finding in this study was especially referencing for similar areas with insufficient data to run the physical models the ai models e g svm rf elm with promising input combination scenarios could be presented as alternatives however this study still had some limitations that could be overcome in future research firstly the capability of the data based models with continuous and seasonal monitoring groundwater data needs further investigation secondly improvement of the performance for sar estimation remains another problem that needs to be solved in the future study possible attempt may lie in the application of efficient data decomposition algorithms like wavelet transform complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise wen et al 2019 thirdly a lot of factors such as meteorological conditions e g potential evapotranspiration anthropological activities e g fertilization and irrigation mode overflow irrigation or water saved irrigation like drip and sprinkle have influence on irrigation water quality further exploration of the data based model s potentiality in incorporating these factors is anticipated 6 conclusions in this study the feasibility of the svm rf ann and elm models with various groundwater physical parameters as inputs for irrigation water quality indexes estimation in the zhangye basin northwest china was investigated according to the performance metrics the sensitivity of the physical parameters and uncertainty of the ai models were further analyzed by the mc technique the results showed that ph ec and do were the best input combination for tds estimation while t ph and ec can be regarded as the best predictors for ps and sar an input pattern embodying in the important role of ec and the improving function of ph was proposed to reveal the nature of data based irrigation water quality index estimation the results also confirmed the prominent superiority and robustness of the svm rf and elm models in producing excellent estimations with only physical parameters as inputs the finding stated clearly the ability of the ai models e g svm rf and elm in accurately estimating the irrigation water quality indexes even for small samples since the physical groundwater parameters can be easily accessed those well performed ai models were highly recommended as convenient and cost effective irrigation water quality index estimating approaches especially for similar irrigated agricultural areas like the zhangye basin the ai models and the predicted results would help decision

9698,irrigation water is a vital input for agricultural production the supply of irrigation water to crops enhances land productivity and affects the agroecosystem functioning agroecosystems co provide a wide range of agroecosystem services and disservices which contribute positively and negatively respectively to human wellbeing therefore irrigated agroecosystems produce several positive and negative outcomes in relation to society and agricultural water management is key to the provision of adequate incentives for the enhancement of social wellbeing in such a context the aim of this work was to value the contribution of water to the provision of agroecosystem services and disservices as a way to summarise the contribution of irrigation to social wellbeing to this end a demand side integrated valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices was carried out for both rain fed and irrigated agriculture in two different agroecosystems of the region of murcia south eastern spain a semi arid western mediterranean region characterised by water scarcity in addition the intensity of the agricultural water use was considered by distinguishing traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems almond and lemon two woody crops were employed to develop the economic valuation in rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems respectively the assessment of biophysical indicators to quantify the provision of services and disservices and their economic valuation using market and non market methods were used the results show that the contribution of water to social wellbeing is valued at 9000 12 300 ha year being greater when the intensive use of agricultural water is promoted the net economic value of all categories of agroecosystem services and disservices increases when irrigation water is supplied notwithstanding the greatest contribution is due to the increase in provisioning services mainly food provision in the case of the highly intensive agroecosystem traditional irrigated agroecosystems make a greater contribution to regulating and cultural agroecosystem services hence agricultural water management should focus on increasing the contribution of irrigated agroecosystems to human wellbeing keywords agroecosystem services agroecosystem disservices human wellbeing market valuation non market valuation 1 introduction the activity with the greatest use of water globally is agricultural irrigation it accounts for 85 of the total consumptive water use worldwide wwap 2016 the lower availability of water resources expected due to climate change ipcc 2019 together with the growing food demand of the human population will require both increased water productivity and improved water management in the existing agricultural systems svendsen and turral 2007 also irrigated agriculture integrated with terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems generates trade offs with the surrounding ecosystems such as rivers and lakes affecting their ecological processes gordon et al 2010 for instance the use of irrigation water in agriculture may reduce the water resources available for such ecosystems generating trade offs between the use of freshwater in agriculture or in surrounding ecosystems perni and martínez paz 2017 especially significant in water scarce regions on the other hand irrigated agriculture with excessive use of fertilisers may be responsible of water bodies eutrophication and thus the degradation of aquatic ecosystems which ends requiring farmers and policy makers actions to be overcome alcon et al 2022 therefore water should be managed by the stakeholders in relation to food security farmers livelihoods and ecosystems conservation boelee 2013 in this circumstance dealing with food security and the protection of ecosystems become key tasks to ensure the social wellbeing and should be key elements in the political agenda of agricultural water management where positive and negative contributions need to be considered water resources allocated to irrigation have several purposes and should be managed in a way that provides a wide range of services to society falkenmark et al 2007 considering that markets fail to provide adequate incentives for wellbeing maximisation this becomes more relevant in areas of water scarcity such as the mediterranean countries where reductions in the allocations of water to agriculture are expected molle and berkoff 2006 irrigation water has been traditionally managed and valued by only considering its contribution to land productivity however its contribution could be further and therefore disentanglement of the value of irrigation water is the first step in the improvement of agricultural water management irrigation water is a key input in agricultural systems mainly because of its capacity to increase land productivity but also for food security rural livelihoods and above all the support of agroecosystems health wwap 2021 despite its crucial importance irrigation water remains undervalued not only by farmers who do not always pay for its real value but also by decision makers who often do not take properly informed decisions water scarcity makes irrigation water more valuable meaning that alternative and even competing uses require water management that is guided by efficient and sustainable decisions sultana and loftus 2020 the economic value of natural resources either goods or services measures their contribution to human wellbeing freeman et al 2003 hence the challenge of valuing irrigation water is straightforward it should be valued not only considering its contribution to land productivity but also its overall contribution to human wellbeing agroecosystems are anthropised ecosystems that generate a wide set of ecosystem services as results of the ecosystem functioning and human interaction fischer and eastwood 2016 human interference mainly through agricultural practices can greatly influence the agroecosystem impact on human wellbeing dale and polasky 2007 by producing both agroecosystem services aes and agroecosystem disservices aeds that impact positive or negatively respectively human wellbeing power 2010 shackleton et al 2016 the provision of aes and aeds depends on the agroecosystem functioning as well as on the state of health of the agroecosystem and the biodiversity both of which determine the agroecosystem s capacity zabala et al 2021a within such anthropised ecosystems water as a core resource for life is key to agroecosystem functioning and capacity and so affects the provision of aes and aeds flows water affects the innate agroecosystem functioning supplying water for irrigation interferes with the agroecosystem state biodiversity and functioning consequently contributing to the provision of aes and aeds boelee 2013 however agricultural water not only contributes to aes and aeds flows but also could be directly responsible for the provision of aeds itself for instance the use of agricultural water for irrigation decreases the availability of water for other uses and ecosystems therefore providing aeds mainly when semi arid and arid environments are involved the greater the use of water for agricultural purposes the lower its availability for alternative uses especially environmental ones and thus the greater the aeds the ecosystem service approach provides therefore a framework for the assessment and valuation of the contribution of water to aes and aeds namely the way in which agricultural water contributes to human wellbeing the supplying of water to agriculture will contribute to agroecosystem functioning and capacity therefore impacting the provision of aes and aeds which are finally translated into contributions to human wellbeing gordon et al 2010 in addition aes and aeds represent benefits and costs respectively within the socioeconomic system as a consequence of the economic valuation of their contribution to human wellbeing made using market and non market valuation methods zabala et al 2021a the valuation of aes and aeds represents a way to summarise in monetary units the contribution of aes and aeds to human wellbeing and thus also the contribution of agricultural water to human wellbeing for valuation purposes zabala et al 2021a established a comprehensive framework to accommodate the agroecosystems within the existing ecosystem services classifications namely mea 2005 teeb 2010 and cices haines young and potschin 2018 also zabala et al 2021a identified the main aes and aeds in semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems and indicated that policies intended to maximise wellbeing should consider irrigation water in the literature several methods for the estimation of the economic value of irrigation water have been described young 2005 in mono criteria and multi criteria analysis using mathematical programming to consider the value of irrigation water the criterion of maximising yields or maximising farmers utility respectively is applied thus a profit maximising approach is applied for the value of irrigation water in mono criteria programming e g chaudhry and young 1989 while multi criteria analysis seeks to understand farmers behaviour by maximising a utility function representing their preferences e g gómez limón and berbel 2000 berbel et al 2009 the production function method has also been applied to estimate the value of irrigation water e g mesa jurado et al 2010 bierkens et al 2019 this is based on the estimation of the production function of irrigated crops the economic value of the marginal productivity of water being ceteris paribus the shadow price of the irrigation water the residual valuation method assumes that a profit maximising farm will use irrigation water up to the level where the net revenue gained from an additional unit of water equals the marginal cost of the irrigation water lange 2006 in practice the residual valuation method is based on the assumption that competitive markets exist for all the production factors except water namely the marginal cost of such factors is known and therefore the value of irrigation water is just the net returns to water that is the total value of crop production after subtracting the value of non water input factors this method has been developed among others by berbel et al 2011 and ziolkowska 2015 despite being less usual stated preference methods have also been applied to estimate the value of irrigation water using either contingent valuation e g colino and martínez paz 2007 martínez paz and perni 2011 or a choice experiment rigby et al 2010 barreiro hurle et al 2018 alcon et al 2019 in recent years the focus has been on estimating the economic value of irrigation water by comparing the market benefits in irrigated and non irrigated farms e g d odorico et al 2020 however in spite of the great number of works encompassing the economic value of irrigation water all of them share the same approach they focus on the contribution of water to the farm benefits centred only on market valuation but not those affecting the whole society indeed these works assume irrigation water to be just another resource a factor of production that only affects and is affected by farmers decisions however as mentioned above the impact of irrigation water goes beyond the farm gate ultimately influencing human wellbeing in such a context the aim of this study was to value the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing by determining the value of the provision of aes and aeds in irrigated agroecosystems to this end the contribution of agricultural water to the value of aes and aeds was estimated by comparing the social demand side and integrated market and non market values of irrigated crops with the respective values of rain fed crops the region of murcia south eastern spain a semi arid western mediterranean region characterised by an important irrigated agriculture sector and by water scarcity was used as the case study the wellbeing impact of irrigation water allocations was explored to inform normative policies and to design economic policy instruments the novelty of this paper lies in the valuation of irrigation water according to its contribution to human wellbeing through the ecosystem service approach the results are expected to provide a better insight into the impacts of irrigation water from a comprehensive point of view the use of a demand side approach for the valuation methods adds to the novelty of the results in addition the paper also contributes to the ongoing research into the integrated economic valuation of aes and aeds including most of the aes and aeds identified by zabala et al 2021a for semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems 2 the demand side approach and the integration of aes and aeds the cornerstones of the present work are 1 the use of a demand side approach for the economic valuation of the contribution of water to wellbeing and 2 the integrated valuation of aes and aeds the use of a demand side approach allows us to make human wellbeing the focus of the economic valuation all the valuation methods employed are centred on the social demand either actual revealed by markets or inferred revealed by means of stated preference methods this ultimately requires the integration of market and non market valuation methods to estimate the values of aes and aeds the market price method seems appropriate to estimate the values of services that are tradeable on well functioning markets bateman et al 2014 such as markets for food and agricultural inputs meanwhile the non market benefits and costs should be estimated by focusing on the demand side considering the human wellbeing gain resulting from the change in aes and aeds by eliciting individuals willingness to pay for this change birol et al 2006 only in this way does human wellbeing become the foundation of the economic valuation however examples of such kinds of studies are scarce in the literature some papers combine demand and supply methods to estimate the values of aes ignoring the fact that supply side methods cannot be used to compare costs and benefits being useful and illustrative only in specific circumstances alcon et al 2010 examples of the use of supply side non market valuation methods to value some aes combined with demand side methods to value other aes can be found in hardaker et al 2020 where the replacement cost method was used to value carbon sequestration or local flood risks and in sandhu et al 2020 and chang et al 2011 where this method was employed to value erosion services despite the efforts made to show the relevance of including both aes and aeds in agroecosystem valuation power 2010 shackleton et al 2016 blanco et al 2019 and their relevance to policy makers sandhu et al 2019 previous studies have dealt with a limited set of aes and aeds overlooking some of the overall impacts that agroecosystems have on human wellbeing for instance chang et al 2011 using greenhouse vegetable cultivation in china as a case study considered yield co2 fixation soil retention soil fertility and water saving as aes and soil salinization and n2o emissions as aeds to show that even when considering the value of aeds the use of greenhouses for vegetable production yields net economic benefits in wales hardaker et al 2020 compared the net economic benefits of agriculture and forestry land uses they concluded that even considering that most of the disservices were derived from agriculture the economic value of the benefits from agriculture was higher than that of those from forestry to this end they estimated the economic value of crop production water supply for consumptive use carbon sequestration and employment as aes and potable water quality reduction and greenhouse gas emissions as aeds in minnesota sandhu et al 2020 compared the net benefits of producing genetically modified corn with those of organically produced corn by using the teebagrifood framework teeb 2018 for the aes these authors considered only the corn grain yield while services associated with water groundwater pollution soil erosion and air quality co2 and n2o emissions together with health costs were used as aeds recently zhen et al 2021 by combining both supply and demand valuation methods showed that the value of aeds in conventional greenhouse production in china clearly surpasses the value of aeds for organic production these are to our knowledge the only studies that have dealt with the integration of aes and aeds to date therefore the present work is expected to contribute to the increasing literature regarding the integrated valuation of aes and aeds accounting all the significant contributions of agroecosystems to wellbeing in semi arid western mediterranean irrigated agriculture consideration of the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing when determining its value will better guide water decision makers in their commitment to agricultural water management since then not only the contribution of irrigation water in relation to farmers but also for the entire society will be included in addition the integrated valuation of agroecosystems including both market and non market values of aes and aeds informs policy makers in the implementation of normative and economic policy tools zhen et al 2021 intended to produce sustainable and resilient agroecosystems sandhu et al 2019 water policies in europe within the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec context would be better informed in relation to the selection of specific measures to achieve the good ecological status of water bodies thus investment or delegation decisions would be better justified by including benefits and beneficiaries from water ecosystem services that had not been taken into account grizzetti et al 2016 also the adoption of economic tools to achieve the full water services cost recovery principle would be better justified alcon et al 2012 agricultural policies such as the common agricultural policy cap would benefit from the integrated valuation of agroecosystems with regard to the adjustment of regional payments according to their social benefits and the design of potential eco schemes to be included in the future cap to reach the green deal targets therefore this work is expected to be useful for the making of decisions about agricultural water management based on the specific characteristics of the agroecosystem and for the adoption of agricultural policies that maximise the social wellbeing that the agroecosystem imparts to society by showing the total cost of the products including the environmental and social costs it will also support water policies in the establishment of normative criteria and the design of economic instruments in water scarce areas by assessing environmental sustainability and providing a reference for compensation 3 methodology the methodology applied to value the contribution of irrigation water to wellbeing combines biophysical indicators and economic valuation methods and is applied to rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems it is based on the notion that irrigation water increases the flow and thereby the value of aes and aeds in irrigated agroecosystems with respect to rain fed agroecosystems therefore the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing is represented by the increase in economic value from rain fed to irrigated agroecosystems the analytical framework followed is presented in fig 1 3 1 case study description the region of murcia within the segura river basin south eastern spain is used as the case study in order to deal with the main agroecosystems two specific areas namely ricote and campo de cartagena were selected in order to include rain fed agroecosystems combined with both traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems thus four main sub systems were assessed and valued 1 traditional rain fed 2 traditional irrigated 3 highly intensive rain fed 4 highly intensive irrigated fig 2 shows the case study areas which combined irrigated areas with rain fed agroecosystems representative of water scarce areas where the availability of irrigation water is limited the village of ricote within the ricote valley in the segura river basin is an area that has been irrigated since the 10th 13th centuries ad balbo et al 2020 the county of campo de cartagena is an agricultural area consolidated in the 1980 s that combines highly intensive citrus and vegetables crops with rain fed crops both these agroecosystems are characterised by the historical use of irrigation water and currently intensive management the ricote valley agroecosystem combines areas of rain fed crops mainly occupied by almond orchards 76 6 with an irrigated area historically used for subsistence by the inhabitants and transformed into lemon orchards in 1962 puy 2014 currently 79 0 of the irrigated area is covered by lemon orchards as shown in table 1 the main irrigation water source the segura river is supplemented with the use of perennial springs uncertain and variable water allocations have driven the modernisation of the irrigation infrastructure over recent decades a collective drip irrigation system is maintained by the 620 irrigators that together own a highly fragmented area heider et al 2018 both rain fed and irrigated crops are mainly grown on terraces flanked by mountainous mediterranean forests puy and balbo 2013 the typical agricultural landscapes with remains of traditional water systems e g waterwheels and traditional irrigation ditches along with the maintenance of traditional agricultural practices and elements e g terraces and stone walls and intergenerational ecological knowledge represent a cultural and landscape heritage with a growing touristic and recreation interest heider et al 2021 the agri environmental benefits comprise local climate regulation soil maintenance and biodiversity the campo de cartagena county covers 48 972 ha of agricultural lands mainly occupied by irrigated crops the main woody irrigated crop is lemon with 3619 ha together with other citrus species and horticultural crops it represents the main irrigated area in the region irrigated crops are mixed with rain fed orchards almond with 4344 ha being the most representative of these agroecosystems the irrigated area is mainly within the campo de cartagena irrigation community domain the main water source is the transfer from the tajo river to the segura river basin through the tajo segura aqueduct this is combined with other sources such as surface groundwater desalinated and reclaimed water martínez paz et al 2018 water is distributed among the farmers by a pressurised remote control distribution network nearly all the plots owned by more than 9500 farmers are equipped with drip irrigation technology alcon et al 2017 this irrigated area dates from the 17th century when groundwater was extracted by windmills infrastructures that are included in the heritage red list agri environmental challenges in this area relate to water conservation groundwater pollution and biodiversity given the crop distribution in both areas and in order to integrate their similarities the present study is centred on woody crops lemon orchards in irrigated sub systems and almond orchards in rain fed ones these two crops were chosen due to their importance and representativeness for both agroecosystems therefore it is assumed that almond orchards substitute for lemon orchards in the absence of irrigation water given that almond is the main rain fed crop in all the case study area 3 2 biophysical assessment several approaches are used to assess biophysical indicators for aes and aeds some authors have employed indicators that combine ecological and economic aspects within the spatial dimension bagstad et al 2013 while others have used proxies of the aes directly related with the ecosystem as a flexible approach to measure aes layke et al 2012 grizzetti et al 2016 and their useful capacity for spatial accounting provisioning regulating and cultural categories of services and disservices were used to classify aes and aeds and their related indicators our approach also includes supporting mea 2005 and habitat teeb 2010 services in the regulating category only if they do not imply a double accounting bias see zabala et al 2021a this is the case of the agroecosystem contribution to biodiversity thus in the present work suitable indicators for aes and aeds were selected and assessed to link the biophysical assessment with the economic valuation all the indicators refer to 2019 which was used as the base year for the assessment the definitions of the indicators employed for the semi arid mediterranean agroecosystems are shown in table 2 provisioning services encompass food provision and the agricultural impact on fresh water resources that is irrigation water both indicators were estimated by using secondary sources interviews with farmers were carried out to identify the technical farm characteristics for each agricultural sub system 10 interviews per sub system food provision is directly associated with crop yield being measured as the crop yield in kg per hectare and year among the provisioning aeds the water supply for irrigation was also included in the biophysical assessment given the competition for water resources among alternative uses in semi arid regions with water scarcity issues such as the case study area perni and martínez paz 2017 zabala et al 2019 the indicator employed was the amount of water supplied for irrigation in each sub system measured in cubic metres per hectare and year following zabala et al 2021a 2021b biophysical indicators to account regulating aes and aeds were obtained by using quantifiable proxy indicators in the study area whose data came from secondary sources and scientific literature emission of contaminants to the atmosphere considered one of the aeds and global climate regulation one of the aes are measured generally on the basis of the co2 balance which combines the co2 emissions from input use measured by the life cycle assessment indicators martin gorriz et al 2020a 2020b and co2 sequestration measured as the crop carbon sequestration along its lifespan as estimated by carvajal et al 2010 for the analysed crops at the local level irrigated crops can regulate the climate by modifying the surface temperature in the case study area albaladejo garcía et al 2020 found that irrigated citrus crops can reduce the temperature by up to 2ºc irrigation water besides its role as one of the competing provisioning aeds also acts as one of the regulating aeds due to its purification and waste treatment capacity in many water scarce areas where intensive agricultural systems predominate the purification role of water is inverted agricultural water being a source of diffuse pollution thus the nitrate concentration in the aquifers in the case study area is used as a proxy indicator for water purification and waste treatment aeds soil maintenance in agriculture is related extremely closely to the agricultural practices thus agroecosystems can provide aes or aeds according to the agricultural practices implemented by the farmers in the study area where soils are poor in organic matter and rainfall is scarce agriculture provides aeds associated with the loss of soil due to wind or precipitation if soil conservation practices are not applied boix fayos et al 2005 in this work soil loss was measured using the soil erosion national inventory based on the rusle model miteco 2021 as a proxy for the soil maintenance service in agroecosystems biodiversity allows the regulation of the physical chemical and biological conditions as well as pest and disease control indeed biodiversity was identified by experts as the most relevant of the aes in the case study area zabala et al 2021a the margalef bird species richness index magurran 2004 was estimated for each sub system as a biodiversity proxy using the ebird geo located database in the study area ebird 2021 the non material nature of cultural aes means that the selection of measurement indicators for cultural aes is always challenging according to the characteristics of the case study area and the information available obtained from interviews with farmers field visits and geophysical data the indicators included in table 2 were used the culture art and design aes were measured by using four indicators presence of terraces dry stone walls historic elements and cultural identity the presence of such cultural and historical elements within agroecosystems landscapes is related to the agricultural and water management and is also considered a sign of place identity the aesthetic value contributing to the aes defined as the scenic landscape beauty was measured as the landscape heterogeneity considering the agricultural land covered by crops other than the one analysed for each sub system this indicator was obtained using the spanish land parcel identification system sigpac 2021 where the different agricultural land covers are identified opportunities for recreation and tourism aes were measured as the chance of enjoying such kinds of activities within the agroecosystems using as an indicator the final value of the outdoor recreation available in aries artificial intelligence for ecosystem services which follows the paracchini et al 2014 proposal for assessing the potential for outdoor recreation across the european union the cognitive development and good living aes were identified as the employment generated by the agroecosystems laterra et al 2019 measured in annual work units awu per hectare and year 3 3 economic valuation the total economic value tev of the agroecosystems was calculated by aggregating the economic value of all aes and aeds identified for the four sub systems based on biophysical indicators both market and non market values were estimated for the aes and aeds and these were aggregated sandhu et al 2008 1 tev total i tev market i tev non market i tev provisioning i tev regulating i tev cultural i where the total economic value tev total i represents the economic value of the aes and aeds provided by each of the i sub systems assessed tev total i can be decomposed according to the market tev market i and non market tev non market i nature of the economic value as well as by considering the contributions of the different categories of aes and aeds provisioning tev provisioning i regulating tev regulating i and cultural tev cultural i the economic value of the aes and aeds was estimated per hectare and year by combining the corresponding biophysical indicator i e tonnes co2eq ha year and its unit economic value e g t co2eq in terms of avoided social costs for carbon sequestration therefore the total economic value of the aes and aeds provided by each sub system i was calculated as follows hardaker et al 2020 2 tev total i n 1 n ev n i n 1 n s n i p n i where ev n i encompasses the economic value of each n aes and aeds s n i represents a n of the aes and aeds supplied by a specific agricultural sub system i measured in biophysical units and p n i is the marginal value estimated for the specific aes or aeds the aes and aeds show positive and negative marginal values respectively as eq 2 reveals a linear marginal value is assumed for aes and aeds notwithstanding this is not always the rule watson et al 2021 indeed as zabala et al 2021b stated for this kind of agroecosystem the marginal utility decreases for some of the aes and aeds specifically food provision irrigation water and water purification and waste treatment therefore we used the consumer surplus instead for the economic value of such aes and aeds following zabala et al 2021b the use of a demand side approach for non market valuation methods allowed us to consider social preferences and thereby the use and non use values within the total economic value estimations thus obtaining the difference in wellbeing between the irrigated and rain fed sub systems thus the contribution of irrigation water to the value of irrigated agroecosystems that is the wellbeing gain of irrigation water can be estimated as follows 3 tev total i water tev total i irrigated tev total i rain fed where tev total i water represents the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the agroecosystems and tev total i irrigated and tev total i rain fed are the total economic value of the aes and aeds provided by irrigated and rain fed agroecosystems respectively in addition the contribution of irrigation water can be decomposed into the contributions from market tev market i water and non market tev non market i water sources of economic value and those from the provisioning tev provisioning i water regulating tev regulating i water and cultural tev cultural i water aes and aeds as follows 4 tev total i water tev market i water tev non market i water tev provisioning i water tev regulating i water tev cultural i water the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the irrigated agroecosystems allows determination of the total economic productivity tep water i and the total economic value of irrigation water v water i both measured in m3 d odorico et al 2020 5 tep water i tev total i irrigated irrigation water 6 v water i tev total i water irrigation water hence these values represent the average wellbeing impact that irrigation water provides table 3 shows the market and non market valuation methods followed to estimate the economic values of the aes and aeds together with the economic indicators and their sources they were estimated based on the values of the biophysical indicators assessed in table 2 the methods employed to value the aes and aeds included direct on demand estimations in the study area based on the choice experiment carried out by zabala et al 2021b and indirect estimations obtained outside the study area but transferred using benefit transfer to the case study for the benefit transfer economic values obtained from other regions were normalised in terms of purchasing power parity world bank 2021 and the prices were normalised to 2019 the reference year for non market valuation in zabala et al 2021b by using the standard consumer price index ine 2021 for standardisation purposes different valuation units were converted to the economic value per hectare by sub system the market price method provides the economic value of the aes flows traded in markets in consequence this method was applied here for food provision specifically this was valued through farm benefits which consider the revenues from the value of the crop yield once the variable and fixed costs have been subtracted irrigation water is thereby included as a variable cost in the estimation of farm benefits using the price paid by farmers for water in each agroecosystem however given the water scarcity in the case study area irrigation water is also considered to be one of the aeds due to the existence of competing uses zabala et al 2019 and the social demand for water allocation solutions perni and martínez paz 2017 therefore the use of water for irrigation could be seen as having a negative impact on human wellbeing if it reduces significantly the water resources available for alternative uses the agricultural impact on wellbeing due to the use of irrigation water will depend on the amount of irrigation water employed in accordance with a non linear utility function zabala et al 2021b food security is also understood as a positive contribution of agroecosystems to human wellbeing hence both water supply and food security services were valued in a non market way following a choice experiment implemented in the case study area zabala et al 2021b the value of the regulating services was measured by means of non market valuation methods a positive negative carbon balance implies social benefits costs in terms of the avoided actual social costs that the net co2eq sequestration emission supposes the economic value associated with these aes or aeds depending on the sign of the carbon balance has a marked global character whose benefits costs expand beyond the limits of the local and regional agroecosystems however the rest of the regulating aes and aeds are confined to the regional limits and their social demand was estimated by using the choice experiment method in the case study area only the value for the soil erosion was transferred from a study of woody crops in andalusia southern spain given the proximity of the two regions and the similarity of the problem in them the cultural value of the traditional and highly intensive agroecosystems was estimated by using a demand side approach with non market methods the presence and maintenance of cultural and historical elements associated with irrigation and agriculture was valued through benefit transfer from stated preference methods applied in other agroecosystems similar to those of the case study area these were the adra and nacimiento watershed south eastern spain where almond orchards and terraces were valued garcía llorente et al 2012 the peninsula of sorrento southern italy where the presence of elements of heritage was valued tagliafierro et al 2013 and the huerta of murcia south eastern spain where the value of the cultural and historical identity associated with traditional irrigated lands was estimated martínez paz et al 2019 arriaza et al 2008 showed that agricultural woody landscapes with a greater variety of vegetation are more valuable their approach and economic values were then transferred from andalusia southern spain to estimate the economic value of the agroecosystem landscapes in our case study area agroecosystems provide an enjoyable landscape for activities of leisure and recreation according to the social value attached to this ecosystem service by the local population zabala et al 2021b finally the presence of distortions in the labour markets mainly derived from high and persistent unemployment rates means that current wages do not represent the opportunity cost of labour instead shadow wages account for the presence of such imbalances it is thereby understood that the higher the unemployment rate the lower the opportunity cost of labour and the greater the social benefits of providing employment to society sepe 2020 this approach was followed to estimate the social benefits of employment generation in agriculture using the gap between the shadow and current wages as a measure of such benefits 4 results irrigation water does contribute to the provision and economic value of both aes and aeds table 4 shows the main results for both the biophysical and economic value indicators distinguishing the source of the value namely the market and non market values and the categories of services as well as the contribution of water to the net provision of aes and aeds the total economic value is higher for the irrigated crops than for the rain fed crops and it also depends on the kind of agroecosystem assessed in particular the total economic value of the traditional irrigated agroecosystems reaches 10 729 ha year and that of the highly intensive ones reaches 13 485 ha year whilst the values of the rain fed agroecosystems are around 1650 and 1100 ha year respectively the contribution of irrigation water is thereby more than 9000 ha for the traditional irrigated agroecosystem and 12 300 ha for the highly intensive agroecosystem regarding the provisioning services the economic value of the food provided is mainly driven by the crop productivity therefore the highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem is the most valued one in both market and non market terms notwithstanding the greater use of irrigation water in this agroecosystem means that it represents one of the aeds thereby having a negative impact on social wellbeing the non linear social preferences for the supply of irrigation water to the agroecosystems in the case study area determine this economic cost as zabala et al 2021b revealed in the case of the regulating services the greater economic values correspond to the contributions to global climate regulation biodiversity and water purification irrigated crops are able to sequester more carbon than rain fed ones this being the key factor that best explains the differences in addition the traditional irrigated agroecosystem also exhibits a greater economic value for the global climate regulation service given the lower carbon footprint the traditional agroecosystems contribute better to the biodiversity while barely showing groundwater pollution as opposed to the highly intensive agroecosystems this reveals that there is room to improve the agricultural practices in the highly intensive agroecosystems to achieve a greater contribution to biodiversity and a lower one to groundwater pollution finally in regard to the cultural services the traditional agroecosystems show greater economic values for all the aes considered the landscape beauty the contribution to outdoor recreation and employment the distribution of the values of the agroecosystems among the categories of aes and aeds depends clearly on the type of agroecosystem assessed in rain fed agroecosystems regulating services represent the most important category of aes and aeds their relative importance being 50 of the total economic value in the case of the traditional agroecosystem and 75 in the case of the highly intensive one provisioning services are less important in the case of the rain fed agroecosystems representing less than one third of the total economic value for the traditional one and only 5 in the case of the highly intensive one however the results are quite different for the irrigated agroecosystems provisioning services are the main aes their relative importance reaching nearly 75 in the traditional agroecosystem and more than 80 in the highly intensive one hence water contributes not only to an increase in the total economic value of the agroecosystems but also to a redistribution of the importance of the aes and aeds provided as commented on before water is a key element with regard to increasing the provision of aes and aeds whose net impact is entirely positive table 5 shows the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the agroecosystems irrigated agriculture is responsible for increasing the provision of aes and aeds thereby in net terms increasing the contribution of agriculture to human wellbeing this increase in the provision of aes and aeds is present in all the groups of aes and aeds although it is mainly concentrated in the provisioning ones indeed the increase in the value of the provisioning services due to irrigation water varies between 80 and 90 depending on the agroecosystem this is driven by the increase in food provision resulting from the supply of water for irrigation cultural services represent 10 15 of the total contribution of water to the value of aes and aeds this is mainly driven by the improvement in cognitive development and good living that agroecosystems provide due to employment generation however water produces only a slight increase in the value of regulating services due to the positive net balance among the contributions of aes and aeds indeed water is behind the increases in carbon sequestration and temperature regulation and the reduction in soil erosion which make a positive contribution to the net value of regulating services in contrast the nitrate concentration in aquifers and bird species richness indicators tend to worsen in the irrigated agroecosystems in particular when there is intensive use of agricultural water this is revealed by the contribution of water to the value of the regulating services which reaches 524 ha year for the traditional agroecosystem but only 239 ha year for the highly intensive one the results for the total economic productivity of irrigation water enhance the assessment indeed the traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems exhibit a similar total economic productivity of water 2 19 m3 and 2 16 m3 respectively however the sources of this total economic productivity are not equally distributed the market contribution is the greatest one being 65 80 depending on the agroecosystem and being highest for the highly intensive agroecosystem the same applies to the distribution of the water economic productivity when distinguishing among the different groups of aes and aeds the value of the provisioning services contributes 72 82 of the water economic productivity while that of the cultural services represents 10 16 and that of the regulating services 8 12 these ranges differ also between the traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems given that the traditional one provides higher values of the regulating and cultural services in contrast to the highly intensive one where the provisioning services provide higher economic values the economic value of irrigation water is 1 99 m3 in the highly intensive agroecosystem slightly higher than in the traditional agroecosystem 1 85 m3 again the market component of irrigation water determines this difference notwithstanding the contribution of non market aes and aeds to the economic value of the water is greater in the case of the traditional agroecosystem this reflects the duality in the case study area a highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem with a higher market value of irrigation water coexists with a traditional irrigated agroecosystem in which irrigation water that has a greater non market value due to its contribution to regulating and cultural aes and aeds therefore the intensity of the use of irrigation water influences not only its final value but also the kind of contribution it makes to human wellbeing the economic values estimated for the analysed sub systems allow us to determine the overall impact of agriculture on human wellbeing in the case study area table 6 shows the aggregated tev for each sub system the aggregated tevs of the agroecosystems in the campo de cartagena are notably greater given the large extension occupied by lemon crops and the higher economic value of the irrigated agroecosystems hence here the irrigated agroecosystems provide nearly 49 m year of net benefits to society which contrasts with the value of 2 3 m year for the irrigated agroecosystems in ricote valley changes in the crop distribution will necessarily change these economic values 5 discussion water boosts the contribution of agriculture to wellbeing the integrated market and non market economic valuation of aes and aeds in rain fed and irrigated semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems shows the importance of irrigation water with regard to enhancing the provision of aes and aeds and thereby its contribution to human wellbeing also the intensity of the use of agricultural water has been tested using two different types of agroecosystems as case study areas a traditional irrigated agroecosystem and a highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem the results reveal that irrigation can increase the values of irrigated agroecosystems so that they are six to twelve times those of rain fed ones depending on the intensity of the use of irrigation water the economic values of the aes and aeds understood as a summary of the net contribution of agriculture to human wellbeing reveal that irrigation water is crucial not only for increasing land productivity but also for social wellbeing this is key for agricultural water management irrigation water should be thereby managed for increasing the net value of agroecosystems which ultimately is converted into increases in social wellbeing enhancing the provision of aes while mitigating aeds could be ensured by both redistributing irrigation water between agroecosystems and adopting new agricultural practices such as regulated deficit irrigation or precision agriculture that support it the economic value of irrigation water exceeds the current market price of irrigation water in the study area 0 30 0 40 m3 depending on the agroecosystem considered the overall value of irrigation water reflects therefore not only its contribution to the value of the crop yield as most studies usually show e g berbel et al 2011 ziolkowska 2015 bierkens et al 2019 but also its overall contribution to social wellbeing when the market and non market irrigation water contributions to society are considered the value of irrigation water rises to 1 85 1 99 m3 these values contrast sharply with those found in the literature for citrus in spain around 0 35 m3 bierkens et al 2019 0 43 m3 berbel et al 2011 and 0 50 m3 rigby et al 2010 indeed most of these values for irrigation water are close to the market price of irrigation water in each case this difference reveals the significance of considering the non market side of irrigation water whose value is important for society in this study the greatest contribution of water is to the market value of aes whilst in the rain fed agroecosystems the non market value of the aes and aeds represents the greater part of the tev the market value provides the most significant part of the tev in the irrigated agroecosystems this is mostly due to the increase in crop productivity which is translated into the value of the provisioning services indeed most of the agroecosystems valuations reported in the literature show the prevalence of market values over non market ones e g sandhu et al 2008 ghaley et al 2014 hardaker et al 2020 the tev of water depends on how much irrigation water is supplied to the agroecosystem as zabala et al 2021b revealed so supplying water to the traditional agroecosystem is understood as a positive contribution to human wellbeing namely as a benefit whilst supplying water to the highly intensive agroecosystems given the high water consumption is categorised among the aeds therefore having a social cost fig 3 shows the relative importance of each category of the aes and aeds to the tev as well as their importance in the contribution of water to the aes and aeds in addition all of the aes and aeds are also influenced by the contribution of water the cultural services in particular employment generation and aesthetic values are the ones most influenced by this contribution followed by the regulating services carbon sequestration and the reduction of soil erosion rates that is the reduction of one of the aeds comprise the positive contribution of water to the regulating services however on the negative side water could also contribute to an increase in groundwater pollution and a loss of biodiversity given the induced intensity that irrigated agriculture may impose nonetheless the results show that there is room for actions to reduce these negative impacts and even to try to improve the contribution of irrigated agriculture to human wellbeing the monetary values which summarise the current wellbeing impact of the different types of agroecosystems are of high importance in the improvement of agricultural water management gordon et al 2010 thus in order to compare alternative solutions and scenarios for policy design table 7 shows a set of scenarios for agricultural water management this allows one to evaluate if there is room to increase the value of the agroecosystems by modifying the current water management by maintaining the current irrigation water supply to agriculture water could be managed in a way that increases the tev in the region of murcia as a whole assuming that water can be easily conveyed between irrigated sub systems which is indeed the case the solution that provides the greatest tev for the entire region implies that the entire water supply for irrigation is moved to the campo de cartagena given its higher economic productivity when water is not a limited resource all types of agriculture would be transformed into irrigated agriculture increasing significantly the overall impact on human wellbeing whose aggregated tev would rise to 119 m year however despite its socioeconomic desirability this situation is not realistic given the current water availability nevertheless even with the water currently available the tev could be enhanced scenario 1 shows an economic gain of 149 202 year if the aggregated tev is maximised with the current water resources however this would imply transformation of the traditional irrigated agroecosystem into a rain fed one despite the superior regulating and cultural services the former provides irrigation water could also be managed to foster some aes or mitigate some aeds by promoting the expansion of irrigated agroecosystems in one or another agroecosystem therefore if policy makers decide to promote regulating and or cultural services instead of provisioning ones water for irrigation should be distributed in a way that fosters irrigated farmland in the traditional agroecosystem in this case water resources should be allocated firstly to the traditional agroecosystem with the remaining water allocated to the highly intensive agroecosystems this is shown in scenario 2 however despite the promotion of regulating and cultural aes and the mitigation of their respective aeds the tev in the case study area would ultimately be lower than in the current situation climate change would compromise the availability of water resources forcing agricultural stakeholders to adapt agriculture and mitigate its impact on human wellbeing climate change is expected to impact on water availability in the case study area by reducing 1 the natural water resources in the region 2 the amount of water transferred from the tajo river basin it is thought that natural water resources obtained from the segura river would drop by 40 while inter basin transfers from the tajo river could be reduced by 70 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 this scenario 3 would necessarily reduce the extension of irrigated sub systems which would be replaced by rain fed crops this would be rapidly translated into a reduction of the aggregated tev of the agroecosystems and therefore into a reduction of the impact of agriculture on human wellbeing notwithstanding actions could be taken in the context of agriculture and farmers practices in order to reverse or at least try to mitigate this negative impact on wellbeing the total economic water productivity is the indicator that can best summarise all the contributions of aes and aeds to the economic value hence in order to increase the tev of agriculture in a context of water scarcity the total economic productivity of irrigation water should be maximised fernández et al 2020 there are different ways to affect this indicator 1 increase the efficiency of the use of irrigation water namely reduce the water supply for crop irrigation while minimising its impact on crop production 2 increase the provision of aes which will be translated ceteris paribus into an increase in the tev of the sub systems 3 reduce the provision of aeds which will increase ceteris paribus the tev of the sub systems to promote this net gain in wellbeing the adoption of alternative agricultural practices is essential changing the way farmers act and connect to agroecosystems namely their agricultural practices is the basis for ensuring an improvement in the economic water productivity both the market and non market water productivity the first action proposed is to reduce the water supply for irrigation without compromising the output that is the implementation of regulated deficit irrigation fernández et al 2020 specifically within the irrigated sub system in the campo de cartagena there is room to implement such regulated deficit irrigation strategies given the great consumption of irrigation water in the area saitta et al 2021 in addition as previously mentioned another way to increase the economic water productivity is to enhance the provision of aes without compromising aeds and irrigation water use agricultural practices can be modified in traditional irrigated agroecosystems in order to increase food provision in highly intensive agroecosystems there is more room to improve the biodiversity landscape beauty and outdoor recreation therefore precision agriculture could be a way to increase land productivity in irrigated sub systems of traditional agroecosystems jenrich 2011 fountas et al 2015 besides agricultural practices to promote biodiversity such as the establishment of perimeter hedgerows assandri et al 2016 heath et al 2017 or biological pest control bianchi et al 2006 crowder and jabbour 2014 can be applied in the campo de cartagena alternatively reduction of the provision of aeds is also a way to increase the net value of agroecosystems conservation agriculture based on reduced tillage and cover crops crop diversification and the use of green manure are examples of agricultural practices that would reduce soil erosion eekhout and de vente 2019 increase carbon sequestration aguilera et al 2013 sánchez navarro et al 2019 and diminish groundwater pollution hunt et al 2019 in order to ensure that such these agricultural practices are widely adopted by farmers the development and implementation of private and public actions and instruments might support their enhancement the range of instruments available for encouraging farmers to implement new agricultural practices depends on the intensity of changes that they may imply with regard to their current practices for instance the most common public instrument is the use of direct subsidies to farmers usually applied to compensate the implementation costs of new practices or even incentivise them monetarily villanueva et al 2017 however not only monetary incentives are available cortés capano et al 2021 there are a wide range of non monetary instruments such as technical support training and courses or labelling incentives among others that can also be applied from the public side to incentivise the adoption of agricultural and water saving practices by farmers even collective schemes can be also publicly incentivised using the current social infrastructure for instance through irrigation communities at a lower cost for public budgets kaczan et al 2017 on the other hand new business models based on circular economy and sustainability could be seen as an opportunity for farmers to adopt agricultural practices and promotes the provision of aes whilst mitigating aeds daou et al 2020 in this way the results of this work allow improving the design and implementation of agricultural policies which can be applied to other mediterranean agroecosystems with similar characteristics as is the case of intensive agriculture in the island of crete greece kourgialas et al 2018 and souss massa region morocco abdelmajid et al 2021 and traditional agriculture in valencia spain melo 2020 and umbria region and veneto plain italy torquati et al 2017 tempesta 2010 6 conclusions agricultural irrigation water is a key input not only for agriculture but also for agroecosystem functioning since it impacts aes and aeds flows to society and thereby human wellbeing this integrated market and non market valuation of aes and aeds for rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems has revealed a contribution of water to the value of agroecosystems which could be understood as the irrigation water contribution to human wellbeing the higher values of irrigation water in relation to ecosystem services reflect the need to promote more efficient uses of water given its positive impacts on society the analysis of the contribution of water to the value of irrigated agroecosystems has revealed the potential of irrigation water to increase the economic and social value of agriculture thereby exceeding the market value of the agricultural output irrigation water contributes to the tev of all categories of aes and aeds mainly provisioning services but also regulating and cultural the intensity of the water use also influences the outcomes agroecosystems with more intensive use being greater providers of provisioning aes whilst agroecosystems with less intensive use are greater providers of regulating and cultural aes appropriate agricultural water management and agricultural practices are crucial to ensure social wellbeing efficient and socially accepted water and agricultural policies should benefit the tev of water to justify the promotion of agricultural practices that enhance the provision of aes and mitigate the generation of aeds in a context of growing pressures on water resources both the market and non market economic water productivity should be boosted in order to increase the social wellbeing derived from the use of irrigation water economic instruments such as water markets could be used when water re distribution between irrigation areas and agroecosystems would increase the total social wellbeing provided by agriculture the defining variable for setting the rates and volumes exchanged should be guided not only by the marginal productivity associated with the provision of aes as is usual but by the total economic water productivity of each agroecosystem the total economic productivity of the irrigation water for the buyers should not be lower than the total economic water productivity of the sellers in order to ensure that a compensation point could be reached with public subsidies and tax on the exchange rates to offset the provision of non market aes and aeds

9698,irrigation water is a vital input for agricultural production the supply of irrigation water to crops enhances land productivity and affects the agroecosystem functioning agroecosystems co provide a wide range of agroecosystem services and disservices which contribute positively and negatively respectively to human wellbeing therefore irrigated agroecosystems produce several positive and negative outcomes in relation to society and agricultural water management is key to the provision of adequate incentives for the enhancement of social wellbeing in such a context the aim of this work was to value the contribution of water to the provision of agroecosystem services and disservices as a way to summarise the contribution of irrigation to social wellbeing to this end a demand side integrated valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices was carried out for both rain fed and irrigated agriculture in two different agroecosystems of the region of murcia south eastern spain a semi arid western mediterranean region characterised by water scarcity in addition the intensity of the agricultural water use was considered by distinguishing traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems almond and lemon two woody crops were employed to develop the economic valuation in rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems respectively the assessment of biophysical indicators to quantify the provision of services and disservices and their economic valuation using market and non market methods were used the results show that the contribution of water to social wellbeing is valued at 9000 12 300 ha year being greater when the intensive use of agricultural water is promoted the net economic value of all categories of agroecosystem services and disservices increases when irrigation water is supplied notwithstanding the greatest contribution is due to the increase in provisioning services mainly food provision in the case of the highly intensive agroecosystem traditional irrigated agroecosystems make a greater contribution to regulating and cultural agroecosystem services hence agricultural water management should focus on increasing the contribution of irrigated agroecosystems to human wellbeing keywords agroecosystem services agroecosystem disservices human wellbeing market valuation non market valuation 1 introduction the activity with the greatest use of water globally is agricultural irrigation it accounts for 85 of the total consumptive water use worldwide wwap 2016 the lower availability of water resources expected due to climate change ipcc 2019 together with the growing food demand of the human population will require both increased water productivity and improved water management in the existing agricultural systems svendsen and turral 2007 also irrigated agriculture integrated with terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems generates trade offs with the surrounding ecosystems such as rivers and lakes affecting their ecological processes gordon et al 2010 for instance the use of irrigation water in agriculture may reduce the water resources available for such ecosystems generating trade offs between the use of freshwater in agriculture or in surrounding ecosystems perni and martínez paz 2017 especially significant in water scarce regions on the other hand irrigated agriculture with excessive use of fertilisers may be responsible of water bodies eutrophication and thus the degradation of aquatic ecosystems which ends requiring farmers and policy makers actions to be overcome alcon et al 2022 therefore water should be managed by the stakeholders in relation to food security farmers livelihoods and ecosystems conservation boelee 2013 in this circumstance dealing with food security and the protection of ecosystems become key tasks to ensure the social wellbeing and should be key elements in the political agenda of agricultural water management where positive and negative contributions need to be considered water resources allocated to irrigation have several purposes and should be managed in a way that provides a wide range of services to society falkenmark et al 2007 considering that markets fail to provide adequate incentives for wellbeing maximisation this becomes more relevant in areas of water scarcity such as the mediterranean countries where reductions in the allocations of water to agriculture are expected molle and berkoff 2006 irrigation water has been traditionally managed and valued by only considering its contribution to land productivity however its contribution could be further and therefore disentanglement of the value of irrigation water is the first step in the improvement of agricultural water management irrigation water is a key input in agricultural systems mainly because of its capacity to increase land productivity but also for food security rural livelihoods and above all the support of agroecosystems health wwap 2021 despite its crucial importance irrigation water remains undervalued not only by farmers who do not always pay for its real value but also by decision makers who often do not take properly informed decisions water scarcity makes irrigation water more valuable meaning that alternative and even competing uses require water management that is guided by efficient and sustainable decisions sultana and loftus 2020 the economic value of natural resources either goods or services measures their contribution to human wellbeing freeman et al 2003 hence the challenge of valuing irrigation water is straightforward it should be valued not only considering its contribution to land productivity but also its overall contribution to human wellbeing agroecosystems are anthropised ecosystems that generate a wide set of ecosystem services as results of the ecosystem functioning and human interaction fischer and eastwood 2016 human interference mainly through agricultural practices can greatly influence the agroecosystem impact on human wellbeing dale and polasky 2007 by producing both agroecosystem services aes and agroecosystem disservices aeds that impact positive or negatively respectively human wellbeing power 2010 shackleton et al 2016 the provision of aes and aeds depends on the agroecosystem functioning as well as on the state of health of the agroecosystem and the biodiversity both of which determine the agroecosystem s capacity zabala et al 2021a within such anthropised ecosystems water as a core resource for life is key to agroecosystem functioning and capacity and so affects the provision of aes and aeds flows water affects the innate agroecosystem functioning supplying water for irrigation interferes with the agroecosystem state biodiversity and functioning consequently contributing to the provision of aes and aeds boelee 2013 however agricultural water not only contributes to aes and aeds flows but also could be directly responsible for the provision of aeds itself for instance the use of agricultural water for irrigation decreases the availability of water for other uses and ecosystems therefore providing aeds mainly when semi arid and arid environments are involved the greater the use of water for agricultural purposes the lower its availability for alternative uses especially environmental ones and thus the greater the aeds the ecosystem service approach provides therefore a framework for the assessment and valuation of the contribution of water to aes and aeds namely the way in which agricultural water contributes to human wellbeing the supplying of water to agriculture will contribute to agroecosystem functioning and capacity therefore impacting the provision of aes and aeds which are finally translated into contributions to human wellbeing gordon et al 2010 in addition aes and aeds represent benefits and costs respectively within the socioeconomic system as a consequence of the economic valuation of their contribution to human wellbeing made using market and non market valuation methods zabala et al 2021a the valuation of aes and aeds represents a way to summarise in monetary units the contribution of aes and aeds to human wellbeing and thus also the contribution of agricultural water to human wellbeing for valuation purposes zabala et al 2021a established a comprehensive framework to accommodate the agroecosystems within the existing ecosystem services classifications namely mea 2005 teeb 2010 and cices haines young and potschin 2018 also zabala et al 2021a identified the main aes and aeds in semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems and indicated that policies intended to maximise wellbeing should consider irrigation water in the literature several methods for the estimation of the economic value of irrigation water have been described young 2005 in mono criteria and multi criteria analysis using mathematical programming to consider the value of irrigation water the criterion of maximising yields or maximising farmers utility respectively is applied thus a profit maximising approach is applied for the value of irrigation water in mono criteria programming e g chaudhry and young 1989 while multi criteria analysis seeks to understand farmers behaviour by maximising a utility function representing their preferences e g gómez limón and berbel 2000 berbel et al 2009 the production function method has also been applied to estimate the value of irrigation water e g mesa jurado et al 2010 bierkens et al 2019 this is based on the estimation of the production function of irrigated crops the economic value of the marginal productivity of water being ceteris paribus the shadow price of the irrigation water the residual valuation method assumes that a profit maximising farm will use irrigation water up to the level where the net revenue gained from an additional unit of water equals the marginal cost of the irrigation water lange 2006 in practice the residual valuation method is based on the assumption that competitive markets exist for all the production factors except water namely the marginal cost of such factors is known and therefore the value of irrigation water is just the net returns to water that is the total value of crop production after subtracting the value of non water input factors this method has been developed among others by berbel et al 2011 and ziolkowska 2015 despite being less usual stated preference methods have also been applied to estimate the value of irrigation water using either contingent valuation e g colino and martínez paz 2007 martínez paz and perni 2011 or a choice experiment rigby et al 2010 barreiro hurle et al 2018 alcon et al 2019 in recent years the focus has been on estimating the economic value of irrigation water by comparing the market benefits in irrigated and non irrigated farms e g d odorico et al 2020 however in spite of the great number of works encompassing the economic value of irrigation water all of them share the same approach they focus on the contribution of water to the farm benefits centred only on market valuation but not those affecting the whole society indeed these works assume irrigation water to be just another resource a factor of production that only affects and is affected by farmers decisions however as mentioned above the impact of irrigation water goes beyond the farm gate ultimately influencing human wellbeing in such a context the aim of this study was to value the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing by determining the value of the provision of aes and aeds in irrigated agroecosystems to this end the contribution of agricultural water to the value of aes and aeds was estimated by comparing the social demand side and integrated market and non market values of irrigated crops with the respective values of rain fed crops the region of murcia south eastern spain a semi arid western mediterranean region characterised by an important irrigated agriculture sector and by water scarcity was used as the case study the wellbeing impact of irrigation water allocations was explored to inform normative policies and to design economic policy instruments the novelty of this paper lies in the valuation of irrigation water according to its contribution to human wellbeing through the ecosystem service approach the results are expected to provide a better insight into the impacts of irrigation water from a comprehensive point of view the use of a demand side approach for the valuation methods adds to the novelty of the results in addition the paper also contributes to the ongoing research into the integrated economic valuation of aes and aeds including most of the aes and aeds identified by zabala et al 2021a for semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems 2 the demand side approach and the integration of aes and aeds the cornerstones of the present work are 1 the use of a demand side approach for the economic valuation of the contribution of water to wellbeing and 2 the integrated valuation of aes and aeds the use of a demand side approach allows us to make human wellbeing the focus of the economic valuation all the valuation methods employed are centred on the social demand either actual revealed by markets or inferred revealed by means of stated preference methods this ultimately requires the integration of market and non market valuation methods to estimate the values of aes and aeds the market price method seems appropriate to estimate the values of services that are tradeable on well functioning markets bateman et al 2014 such as markets for food and agricultural inputs meanwhile the non market benefits and costs should be estimated by focusing on the demand side considering the human wellbeing gain resulting from the change in aes and aeds by eliciting individuals willingness to pay for this change birol et al 2006 only in this way does human wellbeing become the foundation of the economic valuation however examples of such kinds of studies are scarce in the literature some papers combine demand and supply methods to estimate the values of aes ignoring the fact that supply side methods cannot be used to compare costs and benefits being useful and illustrative only in specific circumstances alcon et al 2010 examples of the use of supply side non market valuation methods to value some aes combined with demand side methods to value other aes can be found in hardaker et al 2020 where the replacement cost method was used to value carbon sequestration or local flood risks and in sandhu et al 2020 and chang et al 2011 where this method was employed to value erosion services despite the efforts made to show the relevance of including both aes and aeds in agroecosystem valuation power 2010 shackleton et al 2016 blanco et al 2019 and their relevance to policy makers sandhu et al 2019 previous studies have dealt with a limited set of aes and aeds overlooking some of the overall impacts that agroecosystems have on human wellbeing for instance chang et al 2011 using greenhouse vegetable cultivation in china as a case study considered yield co2 fixation soil retention soil fertility and water saving as aes and soil salinization and n2o emissions as aeds to show that even when considering the value of aeds the use of greenhouses for vegetable production yields net economic benefits in wales hardaker et al 2020 compared the net economic benefits of agriculture and forestry land uses they concluded that even considering that most of the disservices were derived from agriculture the economic value of the benefits from agriculture was higher than that of those from forestry to this end they estimated the economic value of crop production water supply for consumptive use carbon sequestration and employment as aes and potable water quality reduction and greenhouse gas emissions as aeds in minnesota sandhu et al 2020 compared the net benefits of producing genetically modified corn with those of organically produced corn by using the teebagrifood framework teeb 2018 for the aes these authors considered only the corn grain yield while services associated with water groundwater pollution soil erosion and air quality co2 and n2o emissions together with health costs were used as aeds recently zhen et al 2021 by combining both supply and demand valuation methods showed that the value of aeds in conventional greenhouse production in china clearly surpasses the value of aeds for organic production these are to our knowledge the only studies that have dealt with the integration of aes and aeds to date therefore the present work is expected to contribute to the increasing literature regarding the integrated valuation of aes and aeds accounting all the significant contributions of agroecosystems to wellbeing in semi arid western mediterranean irrigated agriculture consideration of the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing when determining its value will better guide water decision makers in their commitment to agricultural water management since then not only the contribution of irrigation water in relation to farmers but also for the entire society will be included in addition the integrated valuation of agroecosystems including both market and non market values of aes and aeds informs policy makers in the implementation of normative and economic policy tools zhen et al 2021 intended to produce sustainable and resilient agroecosystems sandhu et al 2019 water policies in europe within the water framework directive wfd directive 2000 60 ec context would be better informed in relation to the selection of specific measures to achieve the good ecological status of water bodies thus investment or delegation decisions would be better justified by including benefits and beneficiaries from water ecosystem services that had not been taken into account grizzetti et al 2016 also the adoption of economic tools to achieve the full water services cost recovery principle would be better justified alcon et al 2012 agricultural policies such as the common agricultural policy cap would benefit from the integrated valuation of agroecosystems with regard to the adjustment of regional payments according to their social benefits and the design of potential eco schemes to be included in the future cap to reach the green deal targets therefore this work is expected to be useful for the making of decisions about agricultural water management based on the specific characteristics of the agroecosystem and for the adoption of agricultural policies that maximise the social wellbeing that the agroecosystem imparts to society by showing the total cost of the products including the environmental and social costs it will also support water policies in the establishment of normative criteria and the design of economic instruments in water scarce areas by assessing environmental sustainability and providing a reference for compensation 3 methodology the methodology applied to value the contribution of irrigation water to wellbeing combines biophysical indicators and economic valuation methods and is applied to rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems it is based on the notion that irrigation water increases the flow and thereby the value of aes and aeds in irrigated agroecosystems with respect to rain fed agroecosystems therefore the contribution of irrigation water to human wellbeing is represented by the increase in economic value from rain fed to irrigated agroecosystems the analytical framework followed is presented in fig 1 3 1 case study description the region of murcia within the segura river basin south eastern spain is used as the case study in order to deal with the main agroecosystems two specific areas namely ricote and campo de cartagena were selected in order to include rain fed agroecosystems combined with both traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems thus four main sub systems were assessed and valued 1 traditional rain fed 2 traditional irrigated 3 highly intensive rain fed 4 highly intensive irrigated fig 2 shows the case study areas which combined irrigated areas with rain fed agroecosystems representative of water scarce areas where the availability of irrigation water is limited the village of ricote within the ricote valley in the segura river basin is an area that has been irrigated since the 10th 13th centuries ad balbo et al 2020 the county of campo de cartagena is an agricultural area consolidated in the 1980 s that combines highly intensive citrus and vegetables crops with rain fed crops both these agroecosystems are characterised by the historical use of irrigation water and currently intensive management the ricote valley agroecosystem combines areas of rain fed crops mainly occupied by almond orchards 76 6 with an irrigated area historically used for subsistence by the inhabitants and transformed into lemon orchards in 1962 puy 2014 currently 79 0 of the irrigated area is covered by lemon orchards as shown in table 1 the main irrigation water source the segura river is supplemented with the use of perennial springs uncertain and variable water allocations have driven the modernisation of the irrigation infrastructure over recent decades a collective drip irrigation system is maintained by the 620 irrigators that together own a highly fragmented area heider et al 2018 both rain fed and irrigated crops are mainly grown on terraces flanked by mountainous mediterranean forests puy and balbo 2013 the typical agricultural landscapes with remains of traditional water systems e g waterwheels and traditional irrigation ditches along with the maintenance of traditional agricultural practices and elements e g terraces and stone walls and intergenerational ecological knowledge represent a cultural and landscape heritage with a growing touristic and recreation interest heider et al 2021 the agri environmental benefits comprise local climate regulation soil maintenance and biodiversity the campo de cartagena county covers 48 972 ha of agricultural lands mainly occupied by irrigated crops the main woody irrigated crop is lemon with 3619 ha together with other citrus species and horticultural crops it represents the main irrigated area in the region irrigated crops are mixed with rain fed orchards almond with 4344 ha being the most representative of these agroecosystems the irrigated area is mainly within the campo de cartagena irrigation community domain the main water source is the transfer from the tajo river to the segura river basin through the tajo segura aqueduct this is combined with other sources such as surface groundwater desalinated and reclaimed water martínez paz et al 2018 water is distributed among the farmers by a pressurised remote control distribution network nearly all the plots owned by more than 9500 farmers are equipped with drip irrigation technology alcon et al 2017 this irrigated area dates from the 17th century when groundwater was extracted by windmills infrastructures that are included in the heritage red list agri environmental challenges in this area relate to water conservation groundwater pollution and biodiversity given the crop distribution in both areas and in order to integrate their similarities the present study is centred on woody crops lemon orchards in irrigated sub systems and almond orchards in rain fed ones these two crops were chosen due to their importance and representativeness for both agroecosystems therefore it is assumed that almond orchards substitute for lemon orchards in the absence of irrigation water given that almond is the main rain fed crop in all the case study area 3 2 biophysical assessment several approaches are used to assess biophysical indicators for aes and aeds some authors have employed indicators that combine ecological and economic aspects within the spatial dimension bagstad et al 2013 while others have used proxies of the aes directly related with the ecosystem as a flexible approach to measure aes layke et al 2012 grizzetti et al 2016 and their useful capacity for spatial accounting provisioning regulating and cultural categories of services and disservices were used to classify aes and aeds and their related indicators our approach also includes supporting mea 2005 and habitat teeb 2010 services in the regulating category only if they do not imply a double accounting bias see zabala et al 2021a this is the case of the agroecosystem contribution to biodiversity thus in the present work suitable indicators for aes and aeds were selected and assessed to link the biophysical assessment with the economic valuation all the indicators refer to 2019 which was used as the base year for the assessment the definitions of the indicators employed for the semi arid mediterranean agroecosystems are shown in table 2 provisioning services encompass food provision and the agricultural impact on fresh water resources that is irrigation water both indicators were estimated by using secondary sources interviews with farmers were carried out to identify the technical farm characteristics for each agricultural sub system 10 interviews per sub system food provision is directly associated with crop yield being measured as the crop yield in kg per hectare and year among the provisioning aeds the water supply for irrigation was also included in the biophysical assessment given the competition for water resources among alternative uses in semi arid regions with water scarcity issues such as the case study area perni and martínez paz 2017 zabala et al 2019 the indicator employed was the amount of water supplied for irrigation in each sub system measured in cubic metres per hectare and year following zabala et al 2021a 2021b biophysical indicators to account regulating aes and aeds were obtained by using quantifiable proxy indicators in the study area whose data came from secondary sources and scientific literature emission of contaminants to the atmosphere considered one of the aeds and global climate regulation one of the aes are measured generally on the basis of the co2 balance which combines the co2 emissions from input use measured by the life cycle assessment indicators martin gorriz et al 2020a 2020b and co2 sequestration measured as the crop carbon sequestration along its lifespan as estimated by carvajal et al 2010 for the analysed crops at the local level irrigated crops can regulate the climate by modifying the surface temperature in the case study area albaladejo garcía et al 2020 found that irrigated citrus crops can reduce the temperature by up to 2ºc irrigation water besides its role as one of the competing provisioning aeds also acts as one of the regulating aeds due to its purification and waste treatment capacity in many water scarce areas where intensive agricultural systems predominate the purification role of water is inverted agricultural water being a source of diffuse pollution thus the nitrate concentration in the aquifers in the case study area is used as a proxy indicator for water purification and waste treatment aeds soil maintenance in agriculture is related extremely closely to the agricultural practices thus agroecosystems can provide aes or aeds according to the agricultural practices implemented by the farmers in the study area where soils are poor in organic matter and rainfall is scarce agriculture provides aeds associated with the loss of soil due to wind or precipitation if soil conservation practices are not applied boix fayos et al 2005 in this work soil loss was measured using the soil erosion national inventory based on the rusle model miteco 2021 as a proxy for the soil maintenance service in agroecosystems biodiversity allows the regulation of the physical chemical and biological conditions as well as pest and disease control indeed biodiversity was identified by experts as the most relevant of the aes in the case study area zabala et al 2021a the margalef bird species richness index magurran 2004 was estimated for each sub system as a biodiversity proxy using the ebird geo located database in the study area ebird 2021 the non material nature of cultural aes means that the selection of measurement indicators for cultural aes is always challenging according to the characteristics of the case study area and the information available obtained from interviews with farmers field visits and geophysical data the indicators included in table 2 were used the culture art and design aes were measured by using four indicators presence of terraces dry stone walls historic elements and cultural identity the presence of such cultural and historical elements within agroecosystems landscapes is related to the agricultural and water management and is also considered a sign of place identity the aesthetic value contributing to the aes defined as the scenic landscape beauty was measured as the landscape heterogeneity considering the agricultural land covered by crops other than the one analysed for each sub system this indicator was obtained using the spanish land parcel identification system sigpac 2021 where the different agricultural land covers are identified opportunities for recreation and tourism aes were measured as the chance of enjoying such kinds of activities within the agroecosystems using as an indicator the final value of the outdoor recreation available in aries artificial intelligence for ecosystem services which follows the paracchini et al 2014 proposal for assessing the potential for outdoor recreation across the european union the cognitive development and good living aes were identified as the employment generated by the agroecosystems laterra et al 2019 measured in annual work units awu per hectare and year 3 3 economic valuation the total economic value tev of the agroecosystems was calculated by aggregating the economic value of all aes and aeds identified for the four sub systems based on biophysical indicators both market and non market values were estimated for the aes and aeds and these were aggregated sandhu et al 2008 1 tev total i tev market i tev non market i tev provisioning i tev regulating i tev cultural i where the total economic value tev total i represents the economic value of the aes and aeds provided by each of the i sub systems assessed tev total i can be decomposed according to the market tev market i and non market tev non market i nature of the economic value as well as by considering the contributions of the different categories of aes and aeds provisioning tev provisioning i regulating tev regulating i and cultural tev cultural i the economic value of the aes and aeds was estimated per hectare and year by combining the corresponding biophysical indicator i e tonnes co2eq ha year and its unit economic value e g t co2eq in terms of avoided social costs for carbon sequestration therefore the total economic value of the aes and aeds provided by each sub system i was calculated as follows hardaker et al 2020 2 tev total i n 1 n ev n i n 1 n s n i p n i where ev n i encompasses the economic value of each n aes and aeds s n i represents a n of the aes and aeds supplied by a specific agricultural sub system i measured in biophysical units and p n i is the marginal value estimated for the specific aes or aeds the aes and aeds show positive and negative marginal values respectively as eq 2 reveals a linear marginal value is assumed for aes and aeds notwithstanding this is not always the rule watson et al 2021 indeed as zabala et al 2021b stated for this kind of agroecosystem the marginal utility decreases for some of the aes and aeds specifically food provision irrigation water and water purification and waste treatment therefore we used the consumer surplus instead for the economic value of such aes and aeds following zabala et al 2021b the use of a demand side approach for non market valuation methods allowed us to consider social preferences and thereby the use and non use values within the total economic value estimations thus obtaining the difference in wellbeing between the irrigated and rain fed sub systems thus the contribution of irrigation water to the value of irrigated agroecosystems that is the wellbeing gain of irrigation water can be estimated as follows 3 tev total i water tev total i irrigated tev total i rain fed where tev total i water represents the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the agroecosystems and tev total i irrigated and tev total i rain fed are the total economic value of the aes and aeds provided by irrigated and rain fed agroecosystems respectively in addition the contribution of irrigation water can be decomposed into the contributions from market tev market i water and non market tev non market i water sources of economic value and those from the provisioning tev provisioning i water regulating tev regulating i water and cultural tev cultural i water aes and aeds as follows 4 tev total i water tev market i water tev non market i water tev provisioning i water tev regulating i water tev cultural i water the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the irrigated agroecosystems allows determination of the total economic productivity tep water i and the total economic value of irrigation water v water i both measured in m3 d odorico et al 2020 5 tep water i tev total i irrigated irrigation water 6 v water i tev total i water irrigation water hence these values represent the average wellbeing impact that irrigation water provides table 3 shows the market and non market valuation methods followed to estimate the economic values of the aes and aeds together with the economic indicators and their sources they were estimated based on the values of the biophysical indicators assessed in table 2 the methods employed to value the aes and aeds included direct on demand estimations in the study area based on the choice experiment carried out by zabala et al 2021b and indirect estimations obtained outside the study area but transferred using benefit transfer to the case study for the benefit transfer economic values obtained from other regions were normalised in terms of purchasing power parity world bank 2021 and the prices were normalised to 2019 the reference year for non market valuation in zabala et al 2021b by using the standard consumer price index ine 2021 for standardisation purposes different valuation units were converted to the economic value per hectare by sub system the market price method provides the economic value of the aes flows traded in markets in consequence this method was applied here for food provision specifically this was valued through farm benefits which consider the revenues from the value of the crop yield once the variable and fixed costs have been subtracted irrigation water is thereby included as a variable cost in the estimation of farm benefits using the price paid by farmers for water in each agroecosystem however given the water scarcity in the case study area irrigation water is also considered to be one of the aeds due to the existence of competing uses zabala et al 2019 and the social demand for water allocation solutions perni and martínez paz 2017 therefore the use of water for irrigation could be seen as having a negative impact on human wellbeing if it reduces significantly the water resources available for alternative uses the agricultural impact on wellbeing due to the use of irrigation water will depend on the amount of irrigation water employed in accordance with a non linear utility function zabala et al 2021b food security is also understood as a positive contribution of agroecosystems to human wellbeing hence both water supply and food security services were valued in a non market way following a choice experiment implemented in the case study area zabala et al 2021b the value of the regulating services was measured by means of non market valuation methods a positive negative carbon balance implies social benefits costs in terms of the avoided actual social costs that the net co2eq sequestration emission supposes the economic value associated with these aes or aeds depending on the sign of the carbon balance has a marked global character whose benefits costs expand beyond the limits of the local and regional agroecosystems however the rest of the regulating aes and aeds are confined to the regional limits and their social demand was estimated by using the choice experiment method in the case study area only the value for the soil erosion was transferred from a study of woody crops in andalusia southern spain given the proximity of the two regions and the similarity of the problem in them the cultural value of the traditional and highly intensive agroecosystems was estimated by using a demand side approach with non market methods the presence and maintenance of cultural and historical elements associated with irrigation and agriculture was valued through benefit transfer from stated preference methods applied in other agroecosystems similar to those of the case study area these were the adra and nacimiento watershed south eastern spain where almond orchards and terraces were valued garcía llorente et al 2012 the peninsula of sorrento southern italy where the presence of elements of heritage was valued tagliafierro et al 2013 and the huerta of murcia south eastern spain where the value of the cultural and historical identity associated with traditional irrigated lands was estimated martínez paz et al 2019 arriaza et al 2008 showed that agricultural woody landscapes with a greater variety of vegetation are more valuable their approach and economic values were then transferred from andalusia southern spain to estimate the economic value of the agroecosystem landscapes in our case study area agroecosystems provide an enjoyable landscape for activities of leisure and recreation according to the social value attached to this ecosystem service by the local population zabala et al 2021b finally the presence of distortions in the labour markets mainly derived from high and persistent unemployment rates means that current wages do not represent the opportunity cost of labour instead shadow wages account for the presence of such imbalances it is thereby understood that the higher the unemployment rate the lower the opportunity cost of labour and the greater the social benefits of providing employment to society sepe 2020 this approach was followed to estimate the social benefits of employment generation in agriculture using the gap between the shadow and current wages as a measure of such benefits 4 results irrigation water does contribute to the provision and economic value of both aes and aeds table 4 shows the main results for both the biophysical and economic value indicators distinguishing the source of the value namely the market and non market values and the categories of services as well as the contribution of water to the net provision of aes and aeds the total economic value is higher for the irrigated crops than for the rain fed crops and it also depends on the kind of agroecosystem assessed in particular the total economic value of the traditional irrigated agroecosystems reaches 10 729 ha year and that of the highly intensive ones reaches 13 485 ha year whilst the values of the rain fed agroecosystems are around 1650 and 1100 ha year respectively the contribution of irrigation water is thereby more than 9000 ha for the traditional irrigated agroecosystem and 12 300 ha for the highly intensive agroecosystem regarding the provisioning services the economic value of the food provided is mainly driven by the crop productivity therefore the highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem is the most valued one in both market and non market terms notwithstanding the greater use of irrigation water in this agroecosystem means that it represents one of the aeds thereby having a negative impact on social wellbeing the non linear social preferences for the supply of irrigation water to the agroecosystems in the case study area determine this economic cost as zabala et al 2021b revealed in the case of the regulating services the greater economic values correspond to the contributions to global climate regulation biodiversity and water purification irrigated crops are able to sequester more carbon than rain fed ones this being the key factor that best explains the differences in addition the traditional irrigated agroecosystem also exhibits a greater economic value for the global climate regulation service given the lower carbon footprint the traditional agroecosystems contribute better to the biodiversity while barely showing groundwater pollution as opposed to the highly intensive agroecosystems this reveals that there is room to improve the agricultural practices in the highly intensive agroecosystems to achieve a greater contribution to biodiversity and a lower one to groundwater pollution finally in regard to the cultural services the traditional agroecosystems show greater economic values for all the aes considered the landscape beauty the contribution to outdoor recreation and employment the distribution of the values of the agroecosystems among the categories of aes and aeds depends clearly on the type of agroecosystem assessed in rain fed agroecosystems regulating services represent the most important category of aes and aeds their relative importance being 50 of the total economic value in the case of the traditional agroecosystem and 75 in the case of the highly intensive one provisioning services are less important in the case of the rain fed agroecosystems representing less than one third of the total economic value for the traditional one and only 5 in the case of the highly intensive one however the results are quite different for the irrigated agroecosystems provisioning services are the main aes their relative importance reaching nearly 75 in the traditional agroecosystem and more than 80 in the highly intensive one hence water contributes not only to an increase in the total economic value of the agroecosystems but also to a redistribution of the importance of the aes and aeds provided as commented on before water is a key element with regard to increasing the provision of aes and aeds whose net impact is entirely positive table 5 shows the contribution of irrigation water to the total economic value of the agroecosystems irrigated agriculture is responsible for increasing the provision of aes and aeds thereby in net terms increasing the contribution of agriculture to human wellbeing this increase in the provision of aes and aeds is present in all the groups of aes and aeds although it is mainly concentrated in the provisioning ones indeed the increase in the value of the provisioning services due to irrigation water varies between 80 and 90 depending on the agroecosystem this is driven by the increase in food provision resulting from the supply of water for irrigation cultural services represent 10 15 of the total contribution of water to the value of aes and aeds this is mainly driven by the improvement in cognitive development and good living that agroecosystems provide due to employment generation however water produces only a slight increase in the value of regulating services due to the positive net balance among the contributions of aes and aeds indeed water is behind the increases in carbon sequestration and temperature regulation and the reduction in soil erosion which make a positive contribution to the net value of regulating services in contrast the nitrate concentration in aquifers and bird species richness indicators tend to worsen in the irrigated agroecosystems in particular when there is intensive use of agricultural water this is revealed by the contribution of water to the value of the regulating services which reaches 524 ha year for the traditional agroecosystem but only 239 ha year for the highly intensive one the results for the total economic productivity of irrigation water enhance the assessment indeed the traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems exhibit a similar total economic productivity of water 2 19 m3 and 2 16 m3 respectively however the sources of this total economic productivity are not equally distributed the market contribution is the greatest one being 65 80 depending on the agroecosystem and being highest for the highly intensive agroecosystem the same applies to the distribution of the water economic productivity when distinguishing among the different groups of aes and aeds the value of the provisioning services contributes 72 82 of the water economic productivity while that of the cultural services represents 10 16 and that of the regulating services 8 12 these ranges differ also between the traditional and highly intensive irrigated agroecosystems given that the traditional one provides higher values of the regulating and cultural services in contrast to the highly intensive one where the provisioning services provide higher economic values the economic value of irrigation water is 1 99 m3 in the highly intensive agroecosystem slightly higher than in the traditional agroecosystem 1 85 m3 again the market component of irrigation water determines this difference notwithstanding the contribution of non market aes and aeds to the economic value of the water is greater in the case of the traditional agroecosystem this reflects the duality in the case study area a highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem with a higher market value of irrigation water coexists with a traditional irrigated agroecosystem in which irrigation water that has a greater non market value due to its contribution to regulating and cultural aes and aeds therefore the intensity of the use of irrigation water influences not only its final value but also the kind of contribution it makes to human wellbeing the economic values estimated for the analysed sub systems allow us to determine the overall impact of agriculture on human wellbeing in the case study area table 6 shows the aggregated tev for each sub system the aggregated tevs of the agroecosystems in the campo de cartagena are notably greater given the large extension occupied by lemon crops and the higher economic value of the irrigated agroecosystems hence here the irrigated agroecosystems provide nearly 49 m year of net benefits to society which contrasts with the value of 2 3 m year for the irrigated agroecosystems in ricote valley changes in the crop distribution will necessarily change these economic values 5 discussion water boosts the contribution of agriculture to wellbeing the integrated market and non market economic valuation of aes and aeds in rain fed and irrigated semi arid western mediterranean agroecosystems shows the importance of irrigation water with regard to enhancing the provision of aes and aeds and thereby its contribution to human wellbeing also the intensity of the use of agricultural water has been tested using two different types of agroecosystems as case study areas a traditional irrigated agroecosystem and a highly intensive irrigated agroecosystem the results reveal that irrigation can increase the values of irrigated agroecosystems so that they are six to twelve times those of rain fed ones depending on the intensity of the use of irrigation water the economic values of the aes and aeds understood as a summary of the net contribution of agriculture to human wellbeing reveal that irrigation water is crucial not only for increasing land productivity but also for social wellbeing this is key for agricultural water management irrigation water should be thereby managed for increasing the net value of agroecosystems which ultimately is converted into increases in social wellbeing enhancing the provision of aes while mitigating aeds could be ensured by both redistributing irrigation water between agroecosystems and adopting new agricultural practices such as regulated deficit irrigation or precision agriculture that support it the economic value of irrigation water exceeds the current market price of irrigation water in the study area 0 30 0 40 m3 depending on the agroecosystem considered the overall value of irrigation water reflects therefore not only its contribution to the value of the crop yield as most studies usually show e g berbel et al 2011 ziolkowska 2015 bierkens et al 2019 but also its overall contribution to social wellbeing when the market and non market irrigation water contributions to society are considered the value of irrigation water rises to 1 85 1 99 m3 these values contrast sharply with those found in the literature for citrus in spain around 0 35 m3 bierkens et al 2019 0 43 m3 berbel et al 2011 and 0 50 m3 rigby et al 2010 indeed most of these values for irrigation water are close to the market price of irrigation water in each case this difference reveals the significance of considering the non market side of irrigation water whose value is important for society in this study the greatest contribution of water is to the market value of aes whilst in the rain fed agroecosystems the non market value of the aes and aeds represents the greater part of the tev the market value provides the most significant part of the tev in the irrigated agroecosystems this is mostly due to the increase in crop productivity which is translated into the value of the provisioning services indeed most of the agroecosystems valuations reported in the literature show the prevalence of market values over non market ones e g sandhu et al 2008 ghaley et al 2014 hardaker et al 2020 the tev of water depends on how much irrigation water is supplied to the agroecosystem as zabala et al 2021b revealed so supplying water to the traditional agroecosystem is understood as a positive contribution to human wellbeing namely as a benefit whilst supplying water to the highly intensive agroecosystems given the high water consumption is categorised among the aeds therefore having a social cost fig 3 shows the relative importance of each category of the aes and aeds to the tev as well as their importance in the contribution of water to the aes and aeds in addition all of the aes and aeds are also influenced by the contribution of water the cultural services in particular employment generation and aesthetic values are the ones most influenced by this contribution followed by the regulating services carbon sequestration and the reduction of soil erosion rates that is the reduction of one of the aeds comprise the positive contribution of water to the regulating services however on the negative side water could also contribute to an increase in groundwater pollution and a loss of biodiversity given the induced intensity that irrigated agriculture may impose nonetheless the results show that there is room for actions to reduce these negative impacts and even to try to improve the contribution of irrigated agriculture to human wellbeing the monetary values which summarise the current wellbeing impact of the different types of agroecosystems are of high importance in the improvement of agricultural water management gordon et al 2010 thus in order to compare alternative solutions and scenarios for policy design table 7 shows a set of scenarios for agricultural water management this allows one to evaluate if there is room to increase the value of the agroecosystems by modifying the current water management by maintaining the current irrigation water supply to agriculture water could be managed in a way that increases the tev in the region of murcia as a whole assuming that water can be easily conveyed between irrigated sub systems which is indeed the case the solution that provides the greatest tev for the entire region implies that the entire water supply for irrigation is moved to the campo de cartagena given its higher economic productivity when water is not a limited resource all types of agriculture would be transformed into irrigated agriculture increasing significantly the overall impact on human wellbeing whose aggregated tev would rise to 119 m year however despite its socioeconomic desirability this situation is not realistic given the current water availability nevertheless even with the water currently available the tev could be enhanced scenario 1 shows an economic gain of 149 202 year if the aggregated tev is maximised with the current water resources however this would imply transformation of the traditional irrigated agroecosystem into a rain fed one despite the superior regulating and cultural services the former provides irrigation water could also be managed to foster some aes or mitigate some aeds by promoting the expansion of irrigated agroecosystems in one or another agroecosystem therefore if policy makers decide to promote regulating and or cultural services instead of provisioning ones water for irrigation should be distributed in a way that fosters irrigated farmland in the traditional agroecosystem in this case water resources should be allocated firstly to the traditional agroecosystem with the remaining water allocated to the highly intensive agroecosystems this is shown in scenario 2 however despite the promotion of regulating and cultural aes and the mitigation of their respective aeds the tev in the case study area would ultimately be lower than in the current situation climate change would compromise the availability of water resources forcing agricultural stakeholders to adapt agriculture and mitigate its impact on human wellbeing climate change is expected to impact on water availability in the case study area by reducing 1 the natural water resources in the region 2 the amount of water transferred from the tajo river basin it is thought that natural water resources obtained from the segura river would drop by 40 while inter basin transfers from the tajo river could be reduced by 70 pellicer martínez and martínez paz 2018 this scenario 3 would necessarily reduce the extension of irrigated sub systems which would be replaced by rain fed crops this would be rapidly translated into a reduction of the aggregated tev of the agroecosystems and therefore into a reduction of the impact of agriculture on human wellbeing notwithstanding actions could be taken in the context of agriculture and farmers practices in order to reverse or at least try to mitigate this negative impact on wellbeing the total economic water productivity is the indicator that can best summarise all the contributions of aes and aeds to the economic value hence in order to increase the tev of agriculture in a context of water scarcity the total economic productivity of irrigation water should be maximised fernández et al 2020 there are different ways to affect this indicator 1 increase the efficiency of the use of irrigation water namely reduce the water supply for crop irrigation while minimising its impact on crop production 2 increase the provision of aes which will be translated ceteris paribus into an increase in the tev of the sub systems 3 reduce the provision of aeds which will increase ceteris paribus the tev of the sub systems to promote this net gain in wellbeing the adoption of alternative agricultural practices is essential changing the way farmers act and connect to agroecosystems namely their agricultural practices is the basis for ensuring an improvement in the economic water productivity both the market and non market water productivity the first action proposed is to reduce the water supply for irrigation without compromising the output that is the implementation of regulated deficit irrigation fernández et al 2020 specifically within the irrigated sub system in the campo de cartagena there is room to implement such regulated deficit irrigation strategies given the great consumption of irrigation water in the area saitta et al 2021 in addition as previously mentioned another way to increase the economic water productivity is to enhance the provision of aes without compromising aeds and irrigation water use agricultural practices can be modified in traditional irrigated agroecosystems in order to increase food provision in highly intensive agroecosystems there is more room to improve the biodiversity landscape beauty and outdoor recreation therefore precision agriculture could be a way to increase land productivity in irrigated sub systems of traditional agroecosystems jenrich 2011 fountas et al 2015 besides agricultural practices to promote biodiversity such as the establishment of perimeter hedgerows assandri et al 2016 heath et al 2017 or biological pest control bianchi et al 2006 crowder and jabbour 2014 can be applied in the campo de cartagena alternatively reduction of the provision of aeds is also a way to increase the net value of agroecosystems conservation agriculture based on reduced tillage and cover crops crop diversification and the use of green manure are examples of agricultural practices that would reduce soil erosion eekhout and de vente 2019 increase carbon sequestration aguilera et al 2013 sánchez navarro et al 2019 and diminish groundwater pollution hunt et al 2019 in order to ensure that such these agricultural practices are widely adopted by farmers the development and implementation of private and public actions and instruments might support their enhancement the range of instruments available for encouraging farmers to implement new agricultural practices depends on the intensity of changes that they may imply with regard to their current practices for instance the most common public instrument is the use of direct subsidies to farmers usually applied to compensate the implementation costs of new practices or even incentivise them monetarily villanueva et al 2017 however not only monetary incentives are available cortés capano et al 2021 there are a wide range of non monetary instruments such as technical support training and courses or labelling incentives among others that can also be applied from the public side to incentivise the adoption of agricultural and water saving practices by farmers even collective schemes can be also publicly incentivised using the current social infrastructure for instance through irrigation communities at a lower cost for public budgets kaczan et al 2017 on the other hand new business models based on circular economy and sustainability could be seen as an opportunity for farmers to adopt agricultural practices and promotes the provision of aes whilst mitigating aeds daou et al 2020 in this way the results of this work allow improving the design and implementation of agricultural policies which can be applied to other mediterranean agroecosystems with similar characteristics as is the case of intensive agriculture in the island of crete greece kourgialas et al 2018 and souss massa region morocco abdelmajid et al 2021 and traditional agriculture in valencia spain melo 2020 and umbria region and veneto plain italy torquati et al 2017 tempesta 2010 6 conclusions agricultural irrigation water is a key input not only for agriculture but also for agroecosystem functioning since it impacts aes and aeds flows to society and thereby human wellbeing this integrated market and non market valuation of aes and aeds for rain fed and irrigated agroecosystems has revealed a contribution of water to the value of agroecosystems which could be understood as the irrigation water contribution to human wellbeing the higher values of irrigation water in relation to ecosystem services reflect the need to promote more efficient uses of water given its positive impacts on society the analysis of the contribution of water to the value of irrigated agroecosystems has revealed the potential of irrigation water to increase the economic and social value of agriculture thereby exceeding the market value of the agricultural output irrigation water contributes to the tev of all categories of aes and aeds mainly provisioning services but also regulating and cultural the intensity of the water use also influences the outcomes agroecosystems with more intensive use being greater providers of provisioning aes whilst agroecosystems with less intensive use are greater providers of regulating and cultural aes appropriate agricultural water management and agricultural practices are crucial to ensure social wellbeing efficient and socially accepted water and agricultural policies should benefit the tev of water to justify the promotion of agricultural practices that enhance the provision of aes and mitigate the generation of aeds in a context of growing pressures on water resources both the market and non market economic water productivity should be boosted in order to increase the social wellbeing derived from the use of irrigation water economic instruments such as water markets could be used when water re distribution between irrigation areas and agroecosystems would increase the total social wellbeing provided by agriculture the defining variable for setting the rates and volumes exchanged should be guided not only by the marginal productivity associated with the provision of aes as is usual but by the total economic water productivity of each agroecosystem the total economic productivity of the irrigation water for the buyers should not be lower than the total economic water productivity of the sellers in order to ensure that a compensation point could be reached with public subsidies and tax on the exchange rates to offset the provision of non market aes and aeds

9699,subsurface tile drains in areas with intensive agriculture can be a major contributor of salinity loadings to streams and rivers as salts in soil and groundwater are transported into the tile drains modeling tools can be used to assess baseline conditions quantify salt mass export and assess management scenarios to decrease salt removal in this study a newly developed version of the swat model for salinity transport swat salt was modified to include salt ion transport in subsurface tile drains and used to explore the effects of region wide implementation of subsurface drainage on salinity transport and export from an irrigated semi arid watershed the model includes the transport of 8 major salt ions so4 ca na cl mg k co3 hco3 and with the inclusion of tile drain transport simulates the fate and reactive transport of these ions in soil water groundwater tile drain water and stream water the swat salt model is applied to a 732 km2 salinity impaired irrigation region within the arkansas river valley in southeastern colorado the model is first tested against salt ion data in effluent from a 15 km2 tile drainage district and then applied to the entire region to assess the impact of region wide implementation of subsurface tile drainage on in stream salt ion concentrations in stream salt ion loading and total salt export from the watershed the model can be a useful tool in simulating salinity transport in tile drained watershed and investigating the effect of salinity management practices at a variety of spatial and temporal scales keywords salinity tile drains swat swat salt 1 introduction salinity in soil water groundwater and surface water is a critical issue for food security worldwide approximately 20 of total cultivated lands and 33 of irrigated lands worldwide are affected by high salinity ghassemi et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 and increasing in many regions of the world such as the western united states eastern australia the middle east china and north and east africa abbas et al 2013 ivushkin et al 2019 for irrigated regions high soil salinity and associated decrease in crop yield are typically a result of poor natural drainage shallow water tables and waterlogging and evapo concentration in the root zone of crops morway and gates 2012 salt minerals e g gypsum caso4 calcite caco3 in soils and parent rock are the origin of dissolved salt ions but then are transported through a watershed system often concentrating in shallow soil zones in irrigated regions to combat rising water tables and associated evapo concentration of salt ions in root zones artificial subsurface drains often are installed to drain away excess soil water and groundwater hornbuckle et al 2007 rhoades et al 1997 ritzema et al 2008 hopkins et al 2012 feng et al 2017 tiwari and goel 2017 however tile drains also serve as an artificial route of salt mass from the landscape to receiving water bodies thereby increasing salt export from the drained areas christen et al 2001 okuda et al 2020 while salt removal is beneficial for the tiled area salt loads exported via the tile drains to streams can lead to poor growing conditions downstream as downstream users divert the saline water for irrigation purposes christen et al 2001 gill and terry 2016 due to these secondary effects of subsurface drainage there is a growing to study the storage transport and transformation of major salt ions sulfate so4 calcium ca sodium na chloride cl magnesium mg potassium k carbonate co3 bicarbonate hco3 in a tile drained system as it relates to salt export salinity in receiving water bodies and effects on downstream areas this assessment should be performed within the context of potential management practices and a changing climate many studies have investigated the influence of subsurface drainage and subsurface drainage system parameters spacing depth pipe size on soil salinity and salt loading several studies use existing tile drain layouts while others explore hypothetical scenarios of drain implementation study methods include field experiments laboratory experiments numerical modeling experiments and combinations of these field studies christen et al 2001 hornbuckle et al 2005 jafari talukolaee et al 2015 okuda et al 2020 el ghannam et al 2021 have focused on the effect of system design drain spacing drain depth controlled drainage on soil salinity build up crop yield and tile drain salt loading demonstrating the effect of tile drains on increasing salt loading from tile drained areas modeling studies have mainly focused on field scale experiments of subsurface drainage and its relation to soil salinity yao et al 2017 used a water and salt balance model sahysmod to simulate salt balances and field soil water under various scenarios and derive appropriate field management practices based upon the simulation results for a farmland in a coastal region of eastern china lu et al 2019 used field experiments and hydrus 3d to simulate soil water flow and salt transport under the application of a drainage module in a field planted with maize straw under a variety of leaching scenarios feng et al 2019 using hydrus 2d to quantify the effect of irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth on soil water salt content and crop yield in an experimental field plot qian et al 2021 used swms 2d based on the hydrus model to simulate salinity transport in a 2d cross section of a subsurface drain system the model size was 5 m depth with a width equal to the spacing between two subsurface drains liu et al 2021 used hydrus 2d to test various boundary treatment for small scale subsurface pipe drainage similar to qian et al 2021 they used a cross section layout of a small scale drained field while these modeling studies have focused on field scale effects of tile drains on soil water soil salinity and crop yield there remains a need to quantify the influence of subsurface tile drains on system wide salt storage transport and loading in a tile drained system where the system is a network of tile drains the system wide assessment includes groundwater salinity soil salinity and tile drain salt loading in addition salinity should be decomposed into individual salt ions to determine the relative magnitude of each and quantify their relative fate and transport as each are subject to distinct chemical reactions e g precipitation dissolution complexation cation exchange the objectives of this paper are to first introduce a version of swat salt that simulates salt ion fate and transport in a tile drained irrigated watershed second apply and test the model to an irrigated area with a network of connected tile drains and third use the model to investigate the impact of subsurface tile drains on watershed wide salinity loading in a semi arid region the second objective is accomplished for the fairmont drainage district 15 km2 located in the lower arkansas river valley larv colorado the third objective is accomplished for a salinity impaired 732 km2 region that encompasses the fairmont drainage district the larv has high salt concentration in soils groundwater irrigation canals and river water leading to a decrease in crop yield in recent decades morway and gates 2012 previous studies xiaolu et al 2018 bailey et al 2019 have constructed and tested swat and swat salt models in this region 2 swat salt model with tile drainage 2 1 overview of the swat model the swat soil and water assessment tool model arnold et al 1998 is a physically based comprehensive hydrologic simulation model for long term predictions of water quality and hydrological impacts of alternative land management practices swat offers a range of capabilities to address issues in agriculture water and environmental management including water supply irrigation systems subsurface drainage systems nutrient management crop yield and food production and climate change impacts the model simulates water budgets nutrient mass budgets and sediment mass budgets at the watershed scale by considering climate soil topography and land use to prepare a swat model the watershed is delineated into smaller subbasins with each subbasin containing one surface water stream each subbasin is divided into multiple hydrologic response units hrus with each hru a unique combination of soil type topographic slope class and land use type within the subbasin for each daily time step of the simulation the water volume nutrient mass and sediment mass generated from each hru via surface runoff soil lateral flow tile drain flow and groundwater flow is calculated and routed to the subbasin stream each constituent is then routed through the watershed stream network towards the watershed outlet 2 2 overview of the swat salt model whereas swat simulates the fate and transport of nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus species pesticides and sediment the original code does not simulate the transport of salinity species which in many semi arid and arid regions of the world are the chemical species of concern in relation to soil health crop growth and general environmental health bailey et al 2019 developed swat salt a modified version of swat that includes a salinity module that simulates the fate and transport of eight major salt ions sulfate so4 calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 in an irrigated watershed system equilibrium precipitation dissolution reactions are included for five salt minerals caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl based on the original salinity module of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 for subsurface systems which are simulated for each hru soil layer and each hru aquifer unit detailed salt ion equilibrium chemistry equations are provided in bailey et al 2019 the mass fate and transport of each salt ion in the soil system i e hru soil layers and the aquifer system hru aquifer is shown in the following equations using so4 as an example the mass balance kg ha in an hru soil layer for a daily time step is formulated as 1 d m s o 4 s o i l d t m i r r i g s w m i r r i g g w m d i s s m p r e c i p m r o m l a t m p e r c m r e v a p where m represents salt ion mass irrig sw represents salt ion mass in surface water irrigation irrig gw represents salt ion mass in groundwater irrigation diss represents dissolution of salt minerals into salt ion mass e g caso4 ca so4 precip represents precipitation of salt minerals from dissolved salt ion mass ro represents salt ion mass removed via surface runoff lat represents salt ion mass removed via soil lateral flow perc represents salt ion mass removed via percolation from the bottom of the soil layer and revap represents salt ion mass added to the soil layer via upflux from the shallow aquifer salt ion mass removal in surface runoff occurs only for the top soil layer whereas salt ion mass addition in upflux occurs only for the bottom soil layer eq 1 is repeated for each salt ion for each soil layer for each hru in the watershed again using so4 as an example the mass balance kg ha in the aquifer for each hru on a daily time step is formulated as 2 d m s o 4 g w d t m p e r c m r e v a p m d i s s m p r e c i p m g w f l o w where gwflow represents the salt ion mass removed from the aquifer via groundwater discharge to the subbasin stream from eqs 1 and 2 salt ion mass loading to the subbasin streams and therefore salt loading i e export from the watershed occurs via surface runoff m ro soil lateral flow m lat and groundwater discharge m gwflow fig 1 shows a schematic of hydrologic and salinity transport processes simulated by swat salt with equilibrium chemistry reactions precipitation dissolution complexation cation exchange simulated in the soil profile and unconfined aquifer the inclusion of salinity transport in tile drains is explained in the next section section 2 3 the salinity module is imbedded in the swat code fortran with new subroutines added for salt equilibrium chemistry salinity percolation and leaching salt irrigation loading from surface water and groundwater irrigation and salt groundwater transport and loading to streams other subroutines within swat were also modified to incorporate salt ion transport and effects such as lagging solutes in surface runoff and groundwater flow and routing salt ions through the stream network bailey et al 2019 the code writes files containing hru specific subbasin specific and watershed wide salt ion concentrations and fluxes to determine transport and storage of salt within the watershed system the source files of swat and the accompanying salinity module are available on github https github com rtbailey8 swat salinity 2 3 modifying swat salt to include tile drain salinity transport as part of this study the swat salinity module was modified to include the transport of the 8 salt ions so4 ca mg na k cl co3 and hco3 in subsurface tile drains and their loading to subbasin streams the swat model simulates water flow in subsurface tile drains for tile designated hrus using a basic tile flow equation neitsch et al 2011 or incorporating drainmod equations moriasi et al 2012 with the latter using the physically based hooghoudt and kirkham tile drain equations the main tile drain parameter for the original equation is the time required to drain the soil to field capacity d time hr whereas the tile drain parameters for drainmod include drain radius d rad mm distance between drains d dist

saline tile drained region this section provides a demonstration of the modified swat salt code for salt ion transport in a tile drain network the study region is described first followed by the model application 3 1 study region lower arkansas river valley colorado the general study region fig 2 is located within the lower arkansas river valley larv a productive agricultural region in southeastern colorado located downstream of pueblo reservoir and upstream of john martin reservoir the region spans 732 km2 between the towns of manzanola and las animas encompassing 26 400 ha of irrigated land the region has a semi arid climate the average annual temperature is 13 6 c with the monthly average temperature ranging from 13 c in january to 36 c in july average annual precipitation is 375 mm 14 5 in necessitating irrigation to sustain crop growth irrigation begun in the late 19th century is provided by earthen canals that divert water from the arkansas river or from a network of wells that pump groundwater from the alluvial aquifer see fig 2b and c main crop types include wheat sorghum corn alfalfa legumes melons and vegetables the region has experienced high salinity in soils groundwater the surface water arkansas river and tributaries during the past few decades gates et al 2002 morway and gates 2012 salinity in the stream aquifer system of the larv is due to salt mineral dissolution and extended irrigation practices konikow and person 1985 gates et al 2016 with the latter causing high water tables and associated salinization of soil profiles due to a lack of adequate natural drainage as reported by gates et al 2002 and morway and gates 2012 about 70 of the region experiences crop yield decrease due to high soil salinity levels during the 2006 2010 period for the region shown in fig 2b which coincides with the boundary of the swat model used in this study average groundwater salinity concentration was approximately 3300 mg l 443 samples from groundwater monitoring wells average soil salinity was 4 1 ds m and average surface water salinity in the arkansas river and its tributaries was 1145 mg l 3 2 study site and data collection fairmont drainage district the specific area investigated in this study for model testing is the fairmont drainage district fdd fig 2c a network of tile drains located within the timpas creek watershed the drainage network is approximately 2 km south of the arkansas river the fdd has been well maintained and is operating in a very good condition with substantial outflow and effect on surrounding groundwater levels as seen in fig 3 the drains from outlying fields are connected to main lines which then drain to a main tile drain trunk northernmost line in fig 2c the water that leaves the outlet of the tile drain trunk mixes with surface water runoff and then discharges to timpas creek the water at the outlet of the drainshed was sampled for salt ion concentration 27 times between june 10 2014 and august 25 2018 all samples were collected using a peristaltic pump a qed multiparameter sonde was used for in situ readings consisting of electrical conductivity specific conductance at 25 c temperature oxidation reduction potential orp ph and dissolved oxygen do samples were shipped in a cooler with ice to ward laboratories inc kearney nebraska for salt ion analysis 3 3 simulating salinity transport in the fairmont drainage district the swat salt model with the added routines for tile drainage salt ion transport is applied to the fdd and tested against results from the water quality samples a previously tested swat hydrologic model wei et al 2018 of the 732 km2 region fig 2b which encompasses the fdd is used to drive the hydrologic fluxes in the fdd area the region was divided into 72 subbasins and 5270 hrus fig 4 determined from a digital elevation model stream network soil map and land use map each cultivated field is represented by a unique hru wei et al 2018 including canal seepage in the modeling process required a change to the swat code wei et al 2018 within the code estimated daily seepage from earthen canals was added to the aquifer unit of adjacent hrus with values obtained from an input file the model however did not include tile drainage for any hrus the model was run for the 1999 2009 time period and tested against measured streamflow at three gages along the arkansas river and two tributaries for this study the model was extended to run through 2018 to coincide with the time period of collected water samples in the fdd this extension required processing climate data rainfall temperature and land use for each year between 2010 and 2018 climate data were included in the appropriate swat input files and the management file of each hru was extended to include crop type and associated irrigation routines for these years the tested swat salt model for this region bailey et al 2019 is used as the base salinity transport model the model requires initial soil water and groundwater salt ion concentrations initial soil and aquifer salt mineral fractions and salinity loading in the arkansas river in the upstream end of the modeled region as a source input the original model was tested against soil salinity groundwater salt ion concentrations and in stream salt ion concentrations bailey et al 2019 for this study tile flow was included for the 41 hrus that correspond to the cultivated fields within the fdd these hrus are shown in fig 3b within subbasin 66 of the swat model only the drainmod routines of moriasi et al 2012 were used within the swat drainage routines tile drain parameters include the effective drain radius re set to 20 mm the horizontal distance between two drains sdrain set to 100 m based on the actual map distance see fig 2c and the drainage coefficient drain co set to 15 mm as most of the groundwater within these hrus drains to the tile drains rather than discharges to timpas creek groundwater discharge to streams was negated for these 41 hrus by changing aquifer parameters as seen in fig 3b the fdd resides within subbasin 66 of the original swat model which has 160 hrus the outlet of this subbasin i e the discharge location to timpas creek coincides with the location of water quality sampling therefore the model was tested by comparing simulated salt ion concentrations at the outlet of subbasin 66 with the measured salt ion concentrations from the water quality samples see section 3 2 salt budgets are then used for subbasin 66 to determine the relative salinity yield of surface runoff soil lateral flow groundwater discharge and tile drainage to provide context for the effect of tile flow on salt mass export from the tile drained area model testing results are shown in section 3 5 3 4 simulating effects of region wide implementation of tile drainage with the model tested against salt export data in the tile drained area the model for the entire 732 km2 region is used to investigate the effects of region wide implementation of tile drains on watershed salinity specifically analyzing in stream salt loading in the arkansas river and tributaries and the change in the watershed salt budget region wide implementation of tile drains is achieved by activating tile drainage for each cultivated hru in the region wide swat salt model 3 5 results and discussion 3 5 1 tile drain network simulated and observed salt ion concentrations mg l at the subbasin outlet are shown in fig 4 for so4 ca cl na and tds summation of all 8 salt ions overall the model tracks the temporal variation of measured concentrations well r2 values are 0 58 0 65 0 62 0 70 and 0 54 for so4 na cl ca and tds respectively however the model underpredicts na concentration particularly during the winter of 2014 2015 and the summer of 2017 simulating na and cl in this area is problematic the swat salt model requires salt mineral soil fractions as inputs for each hru the soil maps used to populate these data contained caso4 gypsum and caco3 calcite fractions but did not contain nacl fractions therefore there is a high degree of uncertainty in initial nacl mineral content which drives the resulting na and cl concentration in soil water groundwater and resulting tile water several model scenarios were run see fig 5 to investigate the influence of varying nacl initial soil fractions in general comparing simulated and measured solute concentrations on a daily basis is a difficult challenge for watershed modelling in general however we conclude from these results that the model performs adequately well in simulating salt ion export from a subbasin that contains extensive tile drainage daily and annual salt fluxes kg ha are shown in fig 6 for lateral flow surface runoff groundwater flow and tile drain flow in subbasin 66 although 70 of the total salt loaded from subbasin 66 is via groundwater discharge tile drainage has high daily salt fluxes fig 6a and contributes 22 of the total salt flux from the subbasin surface runoff 6 and lateral flow 2 are minor contributors to salt loading salt export in 2002 2003 and 2012 2013 are relatively low due to drought conditions when rainfall recharge and groundwater storage were all low compared to other years the dominant salt ion in tile drainage water is so4 fig 6d due to the prevalence of the salt mineral gypsum caso4 in the region s soils this is true of soil water groundwater and surface water in the larv in general gates et al 2009 bailey et al 2019 3 5 2 impacts of tile drains on region wide salinity transport results for the region wide implementation of tile drainage in the study region are shown in figs 7 11 fig 7 shows the region wide average annual water flux mm and salt flux kg ha in surface runoff soil lateral flow groundwater discharge to streams from shallow aquifer groundwater discharge to streams from deep aquifer and tile drain flow for conditions with and without tile drainage for water flux fig 7a tile flow increases from 0 1 mm to 14 mm the 0 1 mm corresponds to the tile drainage in the fdd in subbasin 66 under the tile drain scenario however total water yield in the river system runoff lateral flow groundwater discharge tile flow is approximately the same 103 mm vs 102 mm as groundwater discharge from the shallow aquifer decreases from 77 mm to 63 mm with the water that typically would recharge the aquifer and move towards streams instead being intercepted by the tile drains therefore results show that implementing region wide tile drainage does not change the overall water yield from the watershed but likely changes the timing of flow due to the difference in travel time between groundwater flow and tile drain flow a similar relationship between groundwater and tile drains occurs for salt transport fig 7b as the increase in salt loading to streams via tile drains 6 kg ha 359 kg ha δ 353 kg ha causes a decrease in salt loading via groundwater discharge 1603 kg ha 1281 kg ha δ 322 kg ha with a net increase in total salt yield of 32 kg ha 1619 kg ha 1651 kg ha again the salt that would have leached to the water table and then been transported diffusely to nearby streams is intercepted and routed quickly to the streams via the tile drains the timing of loading via groundwater discharge and tile drain flow is demonstrated in fig 8 with daily time series kg ha whereas groundwater salt loading occurs relatively consistently throughout each growing season tile drainage provides high magnitude loads periodically often during large irrigation and or rainfall events that increase soil water flow to the tile drains therefore although region wide implementation of tile drains only slightly changes the overall salt yield from the watershed system on multi year basis pulses of high salt loading from tile drains do occur notice that the portion of total salt yield contributed by surface runoff is small see fig 7b compared to its portion of water yield see fig 7a due to lower salt ion concentrations in rainfall and irrigation water as compared to soil water and groundwater also notice that even with tile drains installed in every cultivated field in the region groundwater discharge is still the dominant pathway for salt to load to streams with annual salt fluxes of 1280 kg ha and 360 kg ha for groundwater and tile drains respectively see fig 7b the interplay between long term magnitude and short term pulses is also seen in the time series of in stream loads kg day of so4 ca and tds in the arkansas river at the outlet of the watershed shown in fig 9 for so4 the total mass export from the watershed is 1337 106 kg over the 19 year period of 2000 2018 with region wide tile drainage compared to 1315 106 kg in the baseline scenario an increase of only 1 6 however as seen in fig 9a there are days in which the so4 loads are double or triple the baseline value due to pulses from tile drain outflow these pulses can change the in stream concentration of so4 in the arkansas river as shown in fig 9d these higher concentrations can have a detrimental impact on crop yield and general soil health in downstream irrigated regions this result has been documented in australia hornbuckle et al 2005 with local benefits in tile drained areas tempered by high saline water in downstream consumptive areas similar temporal patterns of in stream loading and concentrations occur for ca fig 9b and e and tds fig 9c and f the spatial patterns of salt loading via groundwater and tile drains are shown by subbasin and hru in figs 10 and 11 respectively providing a spatial analogue to the overall salt flux changes shown in fig 7b groundwater salt loading at the subbasin level decreases when tile drains are implemented fig 10a and b due to the increase in tile drain salt loading fig 10c and d due to tile drains intercepting water and salt ion mass that otherwise would leach to the aquifer and be transported to streams via groundwater flow notice that the majority of salt flux occurs in the central area of the region due to the localized intensive cultivation practices in this area a similar spatial pattern is seen in groundwater concentration mg l at the hru level fig 11 for many of the cultivated fields in the central area of the study region the so4 concentration in the underlying aquifer decreases orange color in fig 11a changes to yellow color in b when tile drains are implemented as so4 mass is intercepted by the tile drains region wide average so4 concentration in the aquifer decreases from 2040 mg l to 1800 mg l 12 decrease when tile drains are implemented the same pattern occurs for the other 7 salt ions this can impact salt loading by groundwater irrigation if tile drains are implemented at a large scale and thereby decrease groundwater salt ion concentrations salt loading to field surfaces via groundwater pumping will be decreased leading to improved crop production and soil health again however these local benefits must be balanced with the potential of increased salinity concentrations in downstream river water leading to negative impacts on crop yield and soil health in those areas 4 limitations of using swat salt for salt transport in tile drained regions the salinity tile drain module of swat differs from other salinity models in that it accounts for salt loading for each major hydrologic pathway in a watershed setting stream groundwater lateral flow surface runoff tile drain flow for each major salt ion subject to chemical equilibrium reactions precipitation dissolution complexation cation exchange as such it can be used to estimate baseline salt loading within a watershed and also explore the impact of land management and water management scenarios to mitigate soil salinity groundwater salinity and surface water salinity however there are limitations in the processes simulated by swat salt in general the movement of salinity in the groundwater system is simulated in a simplistic manner at the hru level due to the use of steady state and lumped equations in swat s groundwater module a more accurate approach would be the use of swat modflow rt3d wei et al 2019 which uses physically based spatially distributed flow and reactive transport modeling for groundwater and associated solutes however a salinity module has not yet been included in the modeling code specific to tile drainage tile drain flow as simulated by the incorporated tile drain equations in swat occurs as pulses at the hru level rather than diffuse transport of water from the soil aquifer into individual tile drains this shortcoming can be remedied by simulating groundwater storage flow and groundwater tile drain interactions in a physically based spatially distributed manner such as with swat modflow bailey et al 2016 again however the salinity module would need to be incorported into the modeling code therefore the modeling procedures used in this study are the best available for regional scale investigations and quantifying the interplay between various salt transport pathways also this study does not include the effect of tile drainage on crop yield the export of salinity via tile drains to downstream regions is detrimental to downstream irrigation practices but tile drained areas result in less waterlogging and soil salinity build up leading to improved crop yield in the long term this balance between improved crop yield and decreased downstream water quality will be explored in future studies 5 summary and conclusions this paper introduces a new version of swat salt bailey et al 2019 that simulates the fate and transport of salt ions in irrigated watersheds drained by artificial subsurface tile drains the model simulates transport of major cations and anions in groundwater soil percolation surface runoff lateral flow streams and equilibrium chemistry reactions in soil layers and the aquifer model results are tested against salt ion concentrations in effluent from a tile drained area in the arkansas river valley colorado whereupon the model is used to assess the impact of region wide tile drain implementation on salt fluxes surface runoff lateral flow groundwater discharge tile drain outflow and watershed salt export general conclusions from the hypothetical region wide tile drain analysis include implementing region wide tile drainage increases total salt yield from the watershed by only 1 during a long simulation period 2000 2018 see fig 9c the increase in salt loaded from the landscape to stream via tile drains is balanced by the decrease in groundwater loading as the salt mass that would be transported in the aquifer is instead intercepted by the tile drains even with tile drains installed in every cultivated field in the region groundwater discharge is still the dominant pathway for salt to load to streams with annual salt fluxes of 1280 kg ha and 360 kg ha for groundwater and tile drains respectively see fig 7b although the long term watershed salt yield is approximately the same under tile drained conditions the timing of salt loading to streams changes to higher daily pulse loadings as opposed to long term diffuse loading from groundwater see fig 8 these higher daily loadings result in high in stream concentrations see fig 9d f which can lead to negative impacts on crop growth and overall soil health in downstream irrigated areas groundwater salt ion concentrations can be decreased significantly in tile drained areas see figs 10 and 11 resulting in improved crop yield for areas that pump groundwater for irrigation see fig 2b for the locations of pumping wells in the study region these results provide insights into the impact of tile drains on watershed wide salinity transport and loading and can be used to help guide salinity management in irrigated drained landscapes appropriate management at the regional scale must balance the derived local benefits crop yield soil health groundwater quality with downstream environmental conditions for instream ecosystems and water users in general the model can be a useful tool in

9699,subsurface tile drains in areas with intensive agriculture can be a major contributor of salinity loadings to streams and rivers as salts in soil and groundwater are transported into the tile drains modeling tools can be used to assess baseline conditions quantify salt mass export and assess management scenarios to decrease salt removal in this study a newly developed version of the swat model for salinity transport swat salt was modified to include salt ion transport in subsurface tile drains and used to explore the effects of region wide implementation of subsurface drainage on salinity transport and export from an irrigated semi arid watershed the model includes the transport of 8 major salt ions so4 ca na cl mg k co3 hco3 and with the inclusion of tile drain transport simulates the fate and reactive transport of these ions in soil water groundwater tile drain water and stream water the swat salt model is applied to a 732 km2 salinity impaired irrigation region within the arkansas river valley in southeastern colorado the model is first tested against salt ion data in effluent from a 15 km2 tile drainage district and then applied to the entire region to assess the impact of region wide implementation of subsurface tile drainage on in stream salt ion concentrations in stream salt ion loading and total salt export from the watershed the model can be a useful tool in simulating salinity transport in tile drained watershed and investigating the effect of salinity management practices at a variety of spatial and temporal scales keywords salinity tile drains swat swat salt 1 introduction salinity in soil water groundwater and surface water is a critical issue for food security worldwide approximately 20 of total cultivated lands and 33 of irrigated lands worldwide are affected by high salinity ghassemi et al 1995 srivastava et al 2019 and increasing in many regions of the world such as the western united states eastern australia the middle east china and north and east africa abbas et al 2013 ivushkin et al 2019 for irrigated regions high soil salinity and associated decrease in crop yield are typically a result of poor natural drainage shallow water tables and waterlogging and evapo concentration in the root zone of crops morway and gates 2012 salt minerals e g gypsum caso4 calcite caco3 in soils and parent rock are the origin of dissolved salt ions but then are transported through a watershed system often concentrating in shallow soil zones in irrigated regions to combat rising water tables and associated evapo concentration of salt ions in root zones artificial subsurface drains often are installed to drain away excess soil water and groundwater hornbuckle et al 2007 rhoades et al 1997 ritzema et al 2008 hopkins et al 2012 feng et al 2017 tiwari and goel 2017 however tile drains also serve as an artificial route of salt mass from the landscape to receiving water bodies thereby increasing salt export from the drained areas christen et al 2001 okuda et al 2020 while salt removal is beneficial for the tiled area salt loads exported via the tile drains to streams can lead to poor growing conditions downstream as downstream users divert the saline water for irrigation purposes christen et al 2001 gill and terry 2016 due to these secondary effects of subsurface drainage there is a growing to study the storage transport and transformation of major salt ions sulfate so4 calcium ca sodium na chloride cl magnesium mg potassium k carbonate co3 bicarbonate hco3 in a tile drained system as it relates to salt export salinity in receiving water bodies and effects on downstream areas this assessment should be performed within the context of potential management practices and a changing climate many studies have investigated the influence of subsurface drainage and subsurface drainage system parameters spacing depth pipe size on soil salinity and salt loading several studies use existing tile drain layouts while others explore hypothetical scenarios of drain implementation study methods include field experiments laboratory experiments numerical modeling experiments and combinations of these field studies christen et al 2001 hornbuckle et al 2005 jafari talukolaee et al 2015 okuda et al 2020 el ghannam et al 2021 have focused on the effect of system design drain spacing drain depth controlled drainage on soil salinity build up crop yield and tile drain salt loading demonstrating the effect of tile drains on increasing salt loading from tile drained areas modeling studies have mainly focused on field scale experiments of subsurface drainage and its relation to soil salinity yao et al 2017 used a water and salt balance model sahysmod to simulate salt balances and field soil

experiments and hydrus 3d to simulate soil water flow and salt transport under the application of a drainage module in a field planted with maize straw under a variety of leaching scenarios feng et al 2019 using hydrus 2d to quantify the effect of irrigation water salinity and subsurface drainage depth on soil water salt content and crop yield in an experimental field plot qian et al 2021 used swms 2d based on the hydrus model to simulate salinity transport in a 2d cross section of a subsurface drain system the model size was 5 m depth with a width equal to the spacing between two subsurface drains liu et al 2021 used hydrus 2d to test various boundary treatment for small scale subsurface pipe drainage similar to qian et al 2021 they used a cross section layout of a small scale drained field while these modeling studies have focused on field scale effects of tile drains on soil water soil salinity and crop yield there remains a need to quantify the influence of subsurface tile drains on system wide salt storage transport and loading in a tile drained system where the system is a network of tile drains the system wide assessment includes groundwater salinity soil salinity and tile drain salt loading in addition salinity should be decomposed into individual salt ions to determine the relative magnitude of each and quantify their relative fate and transport as each are subject to distinct chemical reactions e g precipitation dissolution complexation cation exchange the objectives of this paper are to first introduce a version of swat salt that simulates salt ion fate and transport in a tile drained irrigated watershed second apply and test the model to an irrigated area with a network of connected tile drains and third use the model to investigate the impact of subsurface tile drains on watershed wide salinity loading in a semi arid region the second objective is accomplished for the fairmont drainage district 15 km2 located in the lower arkansas river valley larv colorado the third objective is accomplished for a salinity impaired 732 km2 region that encompasses the fairmont drainage district the larv has high salt concentration in soils groundwater irrigation canals and river water leading to a decrease in crop yield in recent decades morway and gates 2012 previous studies xiaolu et al 2018 bailey et al 2019 have constructed and tested swat and swat salt models in this region 2 swat salt model with tile drainage 2 1 overview of the swat model the swat soil and water assessment tool model arnold et al 1998 is a physically based comprehensive hydrologic simulation model for long term predictions of water quality and hydrological impacts of alternative land management practices swat offers a range of capabilities to address issues in agriculture water and environmental management including water supply irrigation systems subsurface drainage systems nutrient management crop yield and food production and climate change impacts the model simulates water budgets nutrient mass budgets and sediment mass budgets at the watershed scale by considering climate soil topography and land use to prepare a swat model the watershed is delineated into smaller subbasins with each subbasin containing one surface water stream each subbasin is divided into multiple hydrologic response units hrus with each hru a unique combination of soil type topographic slope class and land use type within the subbasin for each daily time step of the simulation the water volume nutrient mass and sediment mass generated from each hru via surface runoff soil lateral flow tile drain flow and groundwater flow is calculated and routed to the subbasin stream each constituent is then routed through the watershed stream network towards the watershed outlet 2 2 overview of the swat salt model whereas swat simulates the fate and transport of nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus species pesticides and sediment the original code does not simulate the transport of salinity species which in many semi arid and arid regions of the world are the chemical species of concern in relation to soil health crop growth and general environmental health bailey et al 2019 developed swat salt a modified version of swat that includes a salinity module that simulates the fate and transport of eight major salt ions sulfate so4 calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 in an irrigated watershed system equilibrium precipitation dissolution reactions are included for five salt minerals caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl based on the original salinity module of tavakoli kivi et al 2019 for subsurface systems which are simulated for each hru soil layer and each hru aquifer unit detailed salt ion equilibrium chemistry equations are provided in bailey et al 2019 the mass fate and transport of each salt ion in the soil system i e hru soil layers and the aquifer system hru aquifer is shown in the following equations using so4 as an example the mass balance kg ha in an hru soil layer for a daily time step is formulated as 1 d m s o 4 s o i l d t m i r r i g s w m i r r i

ion mass removed via surface runoff lat represents salt ion mass removed via soil lateral flow perc represents salt ion mass removed via percolation from the bottom of the soil layer and revap represents salt ion mass added to the soil layer via upflux from the shallow aquifer salt ion mass removal in surface runoff occurs only for the top soil layer whereas salt ion mass addition in upflux occurs only for the bottom soil layer eq 1 is repeated for each salt ion for each soil layer for each hru in the watershed again using so4 as an example the mass balance kg ha in the aquifer for each hru on a daily time step is formulated as 2 d m s o 4 g w d t m p e r c m r e v a p m d i s s m p r e c i p m g w f l o w where gwflow represents the salt ion mass removed from the aquifer via

salinity module is imbedded in the swat code fortran with new subroutines added for salt equilibrium chemistry salinity percolation and leaching salt irrigation loading from surface water and groundwater irrigation and salt groundwater transport and loading to streams other subroutines within swat were also modified to incorporate salt ion transport and effects such as lagging solutes in surface runoff and groundwater flow and routing salt ions through the stream network bailey et al 2019 the code writes files containing hru specific subbasin specific and watershed wide salt ion concentrations and fluxes to determine transport and storage of salt within the watershed system the source files of swat and the accompanying salinity module are available on github https github com

mg na k cl co3 and hco3 in subsurface tile drains and their loading to subbasin streams the swat model simulates water flow in subsurface tile drains for tile designated hrus using a basic tile flow equation neitsch et al 2011 or incorporating drainmod equations moriasi et al 2012 with the latter using the physically based hooghoudt and kirkham tile drain equations the main tile drain parameter for the original equation is the time required to drain the soil to field capacity d time hr whereas the tile drain parameters for drainmod include drain radius d rad mm distance between drains d dist mm depth to the tile drains d depth mm and saturated soil hydraulic conductivity k sat mm hr for each day of the simulation and for hrus specified as containing a subsurface tile drain a tile drain flow rate q tile mm is calculated this volume of water depth hru area is added to the corresponding subbasin stream using a lagging equation to include salt ion transport and loading in tile drains

saline tile drained region this section provides a demonstration of the modified swat salt code for salt ion transport in a tile drain network the study region is described first followed by the model application 3 1 study region lower arkansas river valley colorado the general study region fig 2 is located within the lower arkansas river valley larv a productive agricultural region in southeastern colorado located downstream of pueblo reservoir and upstream of john martin reservoir the region spans 732 km2 between the towns of manzanola and las animas encompassing 26 400 ha of irrigated land the region has a semi arid climate the average annual temperature is 13 6 c with the monthly average temperature ranging from 13 c in january to 36 c in july average annual precipitation is 375 mm 14 5 in necessitating irrigation to sustain crop growth irrigation begun in the late 19th century is provided by earthen canals that divert water from the arkansas river or from a network of wells that pump groundwater from the alluvial aquifer see fig 2b and c main crop types include wheat sorghum corn alfalfa legumes melons and vegetables the region has experienced high salinity in soils groundwater the surface water arkansas river and tributaries during the past few decades gates et al 2002 morway and gates 2012 salinity in the stream aquifer system of the larv is due to salt mineral dissolution and extended irrigation practices konikow and person 1985 gates et al 2016 with the latter causing high water tables and associated salinization of soil profiles due to a lack of adequate natural drainage as reported by gates et al 2002 and morway and gates 2012 about 70 of the region experiences crop yield decrease due to high soil salinity levels during the 2006 2010 period for the region shown in fig 2b which coincides with the boundary of the swat model used in this study average groundwater salinity concentration was approximately 3300 mg l 443 samples from groundwater monitoring wells average soil salinity was 4 1 ds m and average surface water salinity in the arkansas river and its tributaries was 1145 mg l 3 2 study site and data collection fairmont drainage district the specific area investigated in this study for model testing is the fairmont drainage district fdd fig 2c a network of tile drains located within the timpas creek watershed the drainage network is approximately 2 km south of the arkansas river the fdd has been well maintained and is operating in a very good condition with substantial outflow and effect on surrounding groundwater levels as seen in fig 3 the drains from outlying fields are connected to main lines which then drain to a main tile drain trunk northernmost line in fig 2c the water that leaves the outlet of the tile drain trunk mixes with surface water runoff and then discharges to timpas creek the water at the outlet of the drainshed was sampled for salt ion concentration 27 times between june 10 2014 and august 25 2018 all samples were collected using a peristaltic pump a qed multiparameter sonde was used for in situ readings consisting of electrical conductivity specific conductance at 25 c temperature oxidation reduction potential orp ph and dissolved oxygen do samples were shipped in a cooler with ice to ward laboratories inc kearney nebraska for salt ion analysis 3 3 simulating salinity transport in the fairmont drainage district the swat salt model with the added routines for tile drainage salt ion transport is applied to the fdd and tested against results from the water quality samples a previously tested swat hydrologic model wei et al 2018 of the 732 km2 region fig 2b which encompasses the fdd is used to drive the hydrologic fluxes in the fdd area the region was divided into 72 subbasins and 5270 hrus fig 4 determined from a digital elevation model stream network soil map and land use map each cultivated field is represented by a unique hru wei et al 2018 including canal seepage in the modeling process required a change to the swat code wei et al 2018 within the code estimated daily seepage from earthen canals was added to the aquifer unit of adjacent hrus with values obtained from an input file the model however did not include tile drainage for any hrus the model was run for the 1999 2009 time period and tested against measured streamflow at three gages along the arkansas river and two tributaries for this study the model was extended to run through 2018 to coincide with the time period of collected water samples in the fdd this extension required processing climate data rainfall temperature and land use for each year between 2010 and 2018 climate data were included in the appropriate swat input files and the management file of each hru was extended to include crop type and associated irrigation routines for these years the tested swat salt model for this region bailey et al 2019 is used as the base salinity transport model the model requires initial soil water and groundwater salt ion concentrations initial soil and aquifer salt mineral fractions and salinity loading in the arkansas river in the upstream end of the modeled region as a source input the original model was tested against soil salinity groundwater salt ion concentrations and in stream salt ion concentrations bailey et al 2019 for this study tile flow was included for the 41 hrus that correspond to the cultivated fields within the fdd these hrus are shown in fig 3b within subbasin 66 of the swat model only the drainmod routines of moriasi et al 2012 were used within the swat drainage routines tile drain parameters include the effective drain radius re set to 20 mm the horizontal distance between two drains sdrain set to 100 m based on the actual map distance see fig 2c and the drainage coefficient drain co set to 15 mm as most of the groundwater within these hrus drains to the tile drains rather than discharges to timpas creek groundwater discharge to streams was negated for these 41 hrus by changing aquifer parameters as seen in fig 3b the fdd resides within subbasin 66 of the original swat model which has 160 hrus the outlet of this subbasin i e the discharge location to timpas creek coincides with the location of water quality sampling therefore the model was tested by comparing simulated salt ion concentrations at the outlet of subbasin 66 with the measured salt ion concentrations from the water quality samples see section 3 2 salt budgets are then used for subbasin 66 to determine the relative salinity yield of surface runoff soil lateral flow groundwater discharge and tile drainage to provide context for the effect of tile flow on salt mass export from the tile drained area model testing results are shown in section 3 5 3 4 simulating effects of region wide implementation of tile drainage with the model tested against salt export data in the tile drained area the model for the entire 732 km2 region is used to investigate the effects of region wide implementation of tile drains on watershed salinity specifically analyzing in stream salt loading in the arkansas river and tributaries and the change in the watershed salt budget region wide implementation of tile drains is achieved by activating tile drainage for each cultivated hru in the region wide swat salt model 3 5 results and discussion 3 5 1 tile drain network simulated and observed salt ion concentrations mg l at the subbasin outlet are shown in fig 4 for so4 ca cl na and tds summation of all 8 salt ions overall the model tracks the temporal variation of measured concentrations well r2 values are 0 58 0 65 0 62 0 70 and 0 54 for so4 na cl ca and tds respectively however the model underpredicts na concentration particularly during the winter of 2014 2015 and the summer of 2017 simulating na and cl in this area is problematic the swat salt model requires salt mineral soil fractions as inputs for each hru the soil maps used to populate these data contained caso4 gypsum and caco3 calcite fractions but did not contain nacl fractions therefore there is a high degree of uncertainty in initial nacl mineral content which drives the resulting na and cl concentration in soil water groundwater and resulting tile water several model scenarios were run see fig 5 to investigate the influence of varying nacl initial soil fractions in general comparing simulated and measured solute concentrations on a daily basis is a difficult challenge for watershed modelling in general however we conclude from these results that the model performs adequately well in simulating salt ion export from a subbasin that contains extensive tile drainage daily and annual salt fluxes kg ha are shown in fig 6 for lateral flow surface runoff groundwater flow and tile drain flow in subbasin 66 although 70 of the total salt loaded from subbasin 66 is via groundwater discharge tile drainage has high daily salt fluxes fig 6a and contributes 22 of the total salt flux from the subbasin surface runoff 6 and lateral flow 2 are minor contributors to salt loading salt export in 2002 2003 and 2012 2013 are relatively low due to drought conditions when rainfall recharge and groundwater storage were all low compared to other years the dominant salt ion in tile drainage water is so4 fig 6d due to the prevalence of the salt mineral gypsum caso4 in the region s soils this is true of soil water groundwater and surface water in the larv in general gates et al 2009 bailey et al 2019 3 5 2 impacts of tile drains on region wide salinity transport results for the region wide implementation of tile drainage in the study region are shown in figs 7 11 fig 7 shows the region wide average annual water flux mm and salt flux kg ha in surface runoff soil lateral flow groundwater discharge to streams from shallow aquifer groundwater discharge to streams from deep aquifer and tile drain flow for conditions with and without tile drainage for water flux fig 7a tile flow increases from 0 1 mm to 14 mm the 0 1 mm corresponds to the tile drainage in the fdd in subbasin 66 under the tile drain scenario however total water yield in the river system runoff lateral flow groundwater discharge tile flow is approximately the same 103 mm vs 102 mm as groundwater discharge from the shallow aquifer decreases from 77 mm to 63 mm with the water that typically would recharge the aquifer and move towards streams instead being intercepted by the tile drains therefore results show that implementing region wide tile drainage does not change the overall water yield from the watershed but likely changes the timing of flow due to the difference in travel time between groundwater flow and tile drain flow a similar relationship between groundwater and tile drains occurs for salt transport fig 7b as the increase in salt loading to streams via tile drains 6 kg ha 359 kg ha δ 353 kg ha causes a decrease in salt loading via groundwater discharge 1603 kg ha 1281 kg ha δ 322 kg ha with a net increase in total salt yield of 32 kg ha 1619 kg ha 1651 kg ha again the salt that would have leached to the water table and then been transported diffusely to nearby streams is intercepted and routed quickly to the streams via the tile drains the timing of loading via groundwater discharge and tile drain flow is demonstrated in fig 8 with daily time series kg ha whereas groundwater salt loading occurs relatively consistently throughout each growing season tile drainage provides high magnitude loads periodically often during large irrigation and or rainfall events that increase soil water flow to the tile drains therefore although region wide implementation of tile drains only slightly changes the overall salt yield from the watershed system on multi year basis pulses of high salt loading from tile drains do occur notice that the portion of total salt yield contributed by surface runoff is small see fig 7b compared to its portion of water yield see fig 7a due to lower salt ion concentrations in rainfall and irrigation water as compared to soil water and groundwater also notice that even with tile drains installed in every cultivated field in the region groundwater discharge is still the dominant pathway for salt to load to streams with annual salt fluxes of 1280 kg ha and 360 kg ha for groundwater and tile drains respectively see fig 7b the interplay between long term magnitude and short term pulses is also seen in the time series of in stream loads kg day of so4 ca and tds in the arkansas river at the outlet of the watershed shown in fig 9 for so4 the total mass export from the watershed is 1337 106 kg over the 19 year period of 2000 2018 with region wide tile drainage compared to 1315 106 kg in the baseline scenario an increase of only 1 6 however as seen in fig 9a there are days in which the so4 loads are double or triple the baseline value due to pulses from tile drain outflow these pulses can change the in stream concentration of so4 in the arkansas river as shown in fig 9d these higher concentrations can have a detrimental impact on crop yield and general soil health in downstream irrigated regions this result has been documented in australia hornbuckle et al 2005 with local benefits in tile drained areas tempered by high saline water in downstream consumptive areas similar temporal patterns of in stream loading and concentrations occur for ca fig 9b and e and tds fig 9c and f the spatial patterns of salt loading via groundwater and tile drains are shown by subbasin and hru in figs 10 and 11 respectively providing a spatial analogue to the overall salt flux changes shown in fig 7b groundwater salt loading at the subbasin level decreases when tile drains are implemented fig 10a and b due to the increase in tile drain salt loading fig 10c and d due to tile drains intercepting water and salt ion mass that otherwise would leach to the aquifer and be transported to streams via groundwater flow notice that the majority of salt flux occurs in the central area of the region due to the localized intensive cultivation practices in this area a similar spatial pattern is seen in groundwater concentration mg l at the hru level fig 11 for many of the cultivated fields in the central area of the study region the so4 concentration in the underlying aquifer decreases orange color in fig 11a changes to yellow color in b when tile drains are implemented as so4 mass is intercepted by the tile drains region wide average so4 concentration in the aquifer decreases from 2040 mg l to 1800 mg l 12 decrease when tile drains are implemented the same pattern occurs for the other 7 salt ions this can impact salt loading by groundwater irrigation if tile drains are implemented at a large scale and thereby decrease groundwater salt ion concentrations salt loading to field surfaces via groundwater pumping will be decreased leading to improved crop production and soil health again however these local benefits must be balanced with the potential of increased salinity concentrations in downstream river water leading to negative impacts on crop yield and soil health in those areas 4 limitations of using swat salt for salt transport in tile drained regions the salinity tile drain module of swat differs from other salinity models in that it accounts for salt loading for each major hydrologic pathway in a watershed setting stream groundwater lateral flow surface runoff tile drain flow for each major salt ion subject to chemical equilibrium reactions precipitation dissolution complexation cation exchange as such it can be used to estimate baseline salt loading within a watershed and also explore the impact of land management and water management scenarios to mitigate soil salinity groundwater salinity and surface water salinity however there are limitations in the processes simulated by swat salt in general the movement of salinity in the groundwater system is simulated in a simplistic manner at the hru level due to the use of steady state and lumped equations in swat s groundwater module a more accurate approach would be the use of swat modflow rt3d wei et al 2019 which uses physically based spatially distributed flow and reactive transport modeling for groundwater and associated solutes however a salinity module has not yet been included in the modeling code specific to tile drainage tile drain flow as simulated by the incorporated tile drain equations in swat occurs as pulses at the hru level rather than diffuse transport of water from the soil aquifer into individual tile drains this shortcoming can be remedied by simulating groundwater storage flow and groundwater tile drain interactions in a physically based spatially distributed manner such as with swat modflow bailey et al 2016 again however the salinity module would need to be incorported into the modeling code therefore the modeling procedures used in this study are the best available for regional scale investigations and quantifying the interplay between various salt transport pathways also this study does not include the effect of tile drainage on crop yield the export of salinity via tile drains to downstream regions is detrimental to downstream irrigation practices but tile drained areas result in less waterlogging and soil salinity build up leading to improved crop yield in the long term this balance between improved crop yield and decreased downstream water quality will be explored in future studies 5 summary and conclusions this paper introduces a new version of swat salt bailey et al 2019 that simulates the fate and transport of salt ions in irrigated watersheds drained by artificial subsurface tile drains the model simulates transport of major cations and anions in groundwater soil percolation surface runoff lateral flow streams and equilibrium chemistry reactions in soil layers and the aquifer model results are tested against salt ion concentrations in effluent from a tile drained area in the arkansas river valley colorado whereupon the model is used to assess the impact of region wide tile drain implementation on salt fluxes surface runoff lateral flow groundwater discharge tile drain outflow and watershed salt export general conclusions from the hypothetical region wide tile drain analysis include implementing region wide tile drainage increases total salt yield from the watershed by only 1 during a long simulation period 2000 2018 see fig 9c the increase in salt loaded from the landscape to stream via tile drains is balanced by the decrease in groundwater loading as the salt mass that would be transported in the aquifer is instead intercepted by the tile drains even with tile drains installed in every cultivated field in the region groundwater discharge is still the dominant pathway for salt to load to streams with annual salt fluxes of 1280 kg ha and 360 kg ha for groundwater and tile drains respectively see fig 7b although the long term watershed salt yield is approximately the same under tile drained conditions the timing of salt loading to streams changes to higher daily pulse loadings as opposed to long term diffuse loading from groundwater see fig 8 these higher daily loadings result in high in stream concentrations see fig 9d f which can lead to negative impacts on crop growth and overall soil health in downstream irrigated areas groundwater salt ion concentrations can be decreased significantly in tile drained areas see figs 10 and 11 resulting in improved crop yield for areas that pump groundwater for irrigation see fig 2b for the locations of pumping wells in the study region these results provide insights into the impact of tile drains on watershed wide salinity transport and loading and can be used to help guide salinity management in irrigated drained landscapes appropriate management at the regional scale must balance the derived local benefits crop yield soil health groundwater quality with downstream environmental conditions for instream ecosystems and water users in general the model can be a useful tool in simulating salinity transport in tile drained watersheds either irrigated or non irrigated and investigating salinity best management practices in watersheds of varying spatial scales declaration of
