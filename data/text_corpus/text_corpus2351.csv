11755,this research presents empirical evidence on what drives and inhibits cooperative behavior in groundwater management adaptive to climate change given vital character of water its availability should not be only an explanatory variable in adaptation but an issue subject to socio physical explanations on how farmers adapt to declining water stocks instead of studying if farmers relying on groundwater adapt to status quo or projected climate conditions a step forward is suggested in order to connect adaptation with sustainability water extraction caps compliance were used to test cooperation limits to aquifer withdrawals are operationalized via remaining time and quantities of water quantitative data were drawn from 668 experimental rounds in framed field experiments implemented in dry regions in ten communities exposed to climate variability in colombia empirical results suggest that socio physical setting better explain the adoption of cooperative decisions intertemporal preferences on water allocations and physical variables have dissimilar marginal effects on cooperation the deeper the water well is the less the probabilities to cooperate in water conservation notwithstanding the effect is dissimilar according to the remaining time for exhaustion of aquifer systems marginal effect is a step forward from using averages for water planning if a groundwater management plan is put in place the marginal characteristics of well depths and residual time of aquifer existence has implications for the successfulness of management strategies which in turn have implications for long term plans of water use efficiency as stated in sustainable development goals graphical abstract image 1 keywords adaptation aquifers water scarcity extraction caps sustainability field experiments colombia 1 introduction people living in dry regions for all their lives can be said to have independently developed multiple adaptation measures to water scarcity but aquifer overexploitation and surface water impairment around the world a hoekstra 2020 oecd 2017b peterson j and smith 2012 suggest the need to comprehend the effectiveness of adaptation strategies the individual and collective water scarcity adaptation mechanisms and how some communities cooperate while others fail to manage their commons in regional migration contexts where climate change affects hydric resources communities show dissimilar sizes and water constitutes a vital household and food production supply there is urgent need to better understand what drives adaptation to water scarcity the number of people relying on aquifers in rural and urban areas is still high aquifers provide fresh water for around half the global population whose demand is expected to increase by 55 from the year 2000 to mid century oecd 2017b siebert et al 2010 in colombia at least 3 million people depend on aquifer systems and more than 60 are located in the caribbean region of the country dane 2018 ideam 2019 although most people are assumed to remain in the current territories drought conditions will exacerbate and reduced precipitations are forecast for the caribbean region ideam pnud mads dnp cancilleria 2017 under this setting adaptation to groundwater resource declination and water scarcity is discussed the physical and socio institutional facets of scarcity affect people s ability to adapt to it the first second and third orders of scarcity correspond to physical engineering economic institutional and socio political issues respectively metha 2007 wolfe s brooks 2003 nonetheless water scarcity can also be classified as economic or physical in nature economic scarcity occurs when the extraction costs of the resource are higher than the benefits of extraction physical scarcity is more stringent if the water table definitely declines and is close to saturated thickness there is almost nothing to do when some water reserves remain with the existing technology and some financial capacity investing in extraction is less benefiting than leaving the resource in place in this context it is worthwhile asking what factors stimulate or prevent water users to adapt to physical scarcity 1 1 based on this question the category of drivers refers to the social institutional economic or physical factors that make water users able to adapt to physical scarcity or prevent it to happen this inquiry might be approached through a status quo water management strategy in which supply side options are provided to match the demand griffin 2006 zetland 2009 but ever since water supply is not unlimited its demand needs to be understood in terms of those decision making drivers that guide the adaptation to physical water scarcity rapid declination is the most patent evidence of the limited character of these resources groundwater table declination and droughts are pervasive phenomena in western usa australia morocco mexico iran jordan india parts of china and other areas of southern asia world bank 2018 thus the design of institutions and rules focused on halting water extraction rates in the context of physical scarcity is an urgent task in pursuing the sustainable use of groundwater resources in different regions however extraction can only be done if physical and economic conditions do not prevent it on the other hand the demand has much to do in reaching cooperative behaviors that are consequent with water declination when it comes to the sustainable use of this resource hidden cultural patterns inevitable play a role since farmers and people are not passive actors when water management plans are put in place by authorities t van der voorn 2008 aquifers are invisible and scarce nonetheless cultural factors are invisible but made patent in daily decision making on water use and consumption thus cultural dimensions are embedded in social and economic drivers of cooperation and adaptation to scarcity understanding water users willingness to cooperate in their adaptation to water scarcity is relevant because this condition might be the norm in the coming years due to the effect of climate change on hydric resources different reasons might prompt further research on cooperative behavior towards adaptation to physical water scarcity first the rapid overexploitation of groundwater resources makes it necessary to decipher the intricate nature of cooperation second water management sustainability should be approached under the limits provided by nature which is not a common approach worldwide third extant water management approaches have fallen short and inefficient to avert overexploitation sandoval 2004 world bank 2010 fourth despite the fact that copious cases of common pool resource cpr self management have been documented some caveats should be expressed for the case of aquifer resources since groundwater is an invisible resource and water users might only be familiar with water tables and well depths the intricate interactions of hydrogeological variables may catch water users unaware of aquifer exhaustion without further notice consequently a community might be successful in concocting a cpr self management scheme but if they remain unaware of aquifer status they may end up managing a source that is about to run out of water this is not to say that groundwater stocks and flows suffer abrupt or rapid alterations from one day to another but ignoring cpr hydrogeological conditions may result in unfruitful management efforts in response to the mentioned challenges a paradigm change might be necessary to promote adaptable and sustainable water management systems business as usual approaches i e central or self management do not guarantee an adequate adaptation to the scarcity of this resource since it is not unlimited and keeping in mind that hydrogeological conditions determine aquifer stocks and flows some efforts should be put in place to understand its physical and social dimensions physical or environmental dimensions refer to variables such as water tables stocks flows and recharge levels social issues make reference to extraction volumes technology and well locations to mention a few more importantly there are socio physical interactions determining the status of the whole resource system the main outcome of socio physical interactions corresponds to the water balance that results from inflows recharge and outflows water extraction if the physical conditions are not met extractions may result unproductive thus water availability and the resulting water balance are operationalized as instruments that suggest water extraction limitations to this aim adaptation to water scarcity is framed by water extraction caps which are used to signal physical scarcity as it results from climate variability and climate change thus water use sustainability should not only focus on understanding whether people adapt to scarcity or not but how they do it as well the current body of research may fall short to understand how and why water users adapt to limited water availability all the more when it is bounded by suggested upper consumption limits contributions by water management scholars usually approach water resource availability and scarcity as static issues not subjected to limits decided by users themselves water scarcity adaptation drivers have multiple facets approaches and explanations the conceptualization of water scarcity has shifted from emphasis on scientific information and specific technologies to research on cultural environments and institutions wolfe s brooks 2003 the behavioral dimensions referring to risk management routines beliefs and perceptions on adaptation to scarcity are still under construction in the literature on behavioral and institutional economics singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 underline the importance of risk perception in the implementation of strategies to adapt to water scarcity in india they highlight social discernment on the meaning of scarcity the role of memory regarding prior events of scarcity particularly more recent ones was found to play a key role in adapting to it as well as the timing of adaptation capabilities the water shortage adaptation strategies employed by communities from ghana have been observed to be most reactive ones in the short term apraku b idinoba m amisah 2008 water management has been traditionally dominated by supply side approaches asprilla echeverría 2021 griffin 2006 while water governance has been understood from a top down hierarchical regulation approach pahl wostl and knieper 2014 thus engineering solutions are usually the first options in managing scarcity that is why governments are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 no matter if the resource is scarce or plentiful notwithstanding water scarcity management alternatives to physical options have been documented in connection to the type of scarcity addressed physical scarcity is often counterbalanced by engineering processes and supply side solutions as stressed by singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 wolfe s brooks 2003 in this sense the first second and third categories of scarcity refer to physical engineering economic institutional and socio political factors respectively metha 2007 wolfe s brooks 2003 some scholars indeed depart from taking scarcity issues for granted and tend to challenge the problem through political transaction water scarcity indeed is often socially mediated thus shifting from a natural condition to the result of socio political and institutional processes metha 2007 in this context the problem of scarcity is currently being debated from the perspectives of political ecology and institutional and supply side approaches based only on the physical and observable character of water scarcity overexploitation is being noticed in different regions in places like south asia brazil mexico and other latin american countries when surface water availability declines groundwater sources are approached by pumping from water wells foster s and hirata 2011 foster stephen hirata r vidal ana schmidt gerhard garduño 2009 reliance on abating aquifers is a tough issue to manage in the research area in sucre and la guajira colombia the study is located in the north coast of colombia south america where drought events are repeated each year in this region there is a sort of invisible competition for water resources between water users and the municipal water facilities this competition is physically evident but is not necessarily socially intended in sucre 24 out of 26 municipal water facilities have built boreholes to collect water treat and distribute it through aqueduct pipes public entities in charge of water management use powerful pumps to collect water from the underground and distribute water to households notwithstanding up to 2011 there existed 1 788 wells under operation 2 2 1 713 wells reported in the jurisdiction of carsucre and 75 wells in the area of regional environmental corporation corpomojana it shows that there is not a unique centrally managed water distribution system but a collection of private and public boreholes in la guajira 33 of its15 municipalities use wells as the main or backstop source for drinking water besides there are some municipalities in which the official reports say that local water sources are river basins such as cesar river and rancheria river but observed water access practices exhibit a different history because people build their own wells on backyards this is the case for the municipalities of fonseca distraccion and barrancas extraofficial water extractions manifest that the water resources competition is even greater than official data the competition for water resources is made patent in water table declinations in the aquifer systems the main aquifer of sucre is called morroa aquifer the extraction rates of this aquifer surround 1000 to 1200 l per second but its natural recharge has been decreasing up to 75 l per second this water balance shows the high vulnerability of the aquifer due to overexploitation and progressive lowering of its reserves carsucre 2015 from the other side most of municipalities in the medium and high zones in la guajira use aquifers to satisfy domestic needs the high hydrologic deficit compels individuals communities and public entities to continuously exploit aquifers corpoguajira 2017 carsucre 2015 indicates that the intensive exploitation to which morroa aquifer has been exposed for more than 40 years is gradually running out the groundwater reserves this occurs because people annually extract more water than it seeps into the ground water imbalance between aquifers reserve levels extractions and recharge are leading to unsustainable aquifer management in the territories up to 2003 the intensive flow of some wells in the region of sucre have generated water table decreasing between 7 and 12 m per year pacheco and villegas 2003 in the past the population were able to build wells up to 100 m deep nowadays is necessary to build on average 400 m wells to extract water from the underground some wells have experienced declinations around 17 m year which threaten aquifer sustainability carsucre 2015 therefore different physical uncertainty of precipitation patterns and social factors are influencing water stocks declinations and water needs for drinking irrigation and industrial activities are exerting more pressures on remaining reserves the volatility of surface water resources for agriculture will seriously increase the use of groundwater in the current and next generations of irrigated lands thus numerous countries that do not substantially use aquifer systems for farming activities will probably face similar challenges to those currently experienced where groundwater is already used intensively oecd 2017a this situation certainly challenges water managers and policy makers in terms of institutional adequacy to adapt to pressing changes on water availability institutional adaptation arrangements to the scarcity of water resources have not been swift enough instead it has been irregular and lagged far behind institutional needs in many countries saleth 2014 currently regulations and norms aimed at ruling and controlling groundwater use to prevent exhaustion have been enforced in developing countries oecd 2015 policy measures tend to restrict water use by allocating quotas over periods of extraction and denying extraction permits when hydric resource authorities consider that certain physical hydrogeological conditions are not met however the current management approach has come to be inefficient partially due to the complexities of monitoring groundwater extraction and water users response in terms of passing over regulations sandoval 2004 therefore the institutional schemes detected in the water sector of most countries are still unsuitable and unsuccessful in resolving their water problems saleth 2014 the extant formal system of rules for water access in colombia comprise financial requirements permissions and water depletion avoidance the first legislative decision towards groundwater protection was released almost 50 years ago through decree 2811 1974 the decree 1541 1978 underlines the mandatory character of extraction permits before the environmental authorizes at best the authority grants a resource usufruct permission to a water user who pays a fee for it remarkably this norm declares that in case the authorities realize any groundwater basin depletion problem occurs the extraction permit cannot be granted more recently the decree 1640 2012 rules the environmental groundwater management plans design aimed at protecting aquifers however all policy instruments remain inefficient in driving water users to abide by the rule of extraction permits and more importantly to prevent aquifers depletion in addition while water scarcity management approaches are discussed climate change is influencing ecosystems and the water related dimensions of development hence water scarcity remains a crucial limiting factor driving farmers vulnerability mertz o halsnæs k olesen 2009 singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 the least developed countries are most vulnerable to water issues due to climate change since their water technologies and capacities are inadequate and deficient bates et al 2008 thus vulnerability of water users and more suggestively the demand side of scarcity problems certainly requires special attention in terms of pursuing feasible adaptation plans the implementation of which implies overcoming behavioral and governance barriers o brien and wolf 2010 at this point the embedded indigenous and local knowledge among the populations needs to be skillfully honored and combined with scientific knowledge to reduce the inherent uncertainty and complexity of natural resource management ostrom 2015 natural resources such as groundwater are considered to be cpr and thus subject to physical and economic changes like overexploitation and increasing extraction costs e g pumping barlow and leake 2012 stevenson 2005 it is in this context that behavioral driving forces such as individual self interest and collective initiatives aimed at resource management and conservation operate farmers might adapt by shifting to new crops drought resistant crops or adopting water efficiency irrigation equipment komba c muchapondwa 2012 mertz o halsnæs k olesen 2009 suresh kumar 2007 tirado r cotter 2010 but the question on how people perceive scarcity under a cpr setting has not been fully addressed in the literature the cpr character of aquifers entails competition for water units stock exhaustion and other socio physical issues that are worth incorporating into water scarcity analyses experiments are frequently used to improve our understanding of decision making processes related to common pool and natural resource exploitation together with those factors that affect cooperation the current research focuses on providing answers to the question on what factors stimulate or prevent farmers and rural inhabitants to adapt to physical water scarcity in order to further develop adaptable water management systems in dry regions responding to this inquiry offers key inputs to address the quest for cooperation in sustainable aquifer management socio physical relationships between actual water users acting as participants and the variables that influence cooperation are analyzed field experiments were implemented in ten communities of four municipalities in the caribbean region of colombia the municipalities of riohacha and fonseca in the department of la guajira where the homonymous desert is located and the municipalities of guamal in the department of magdalena and corozal department of sucre the latter department is characterized by being almost fully reliant on groundwater for domestic activities industries and agriculture given the distinctive characteristic of cpr i e the fact that its users are usually close neighbors and the inter temporal character of water consumption the participants of the experiments were asked to distribute extraction caps in three markets present consumption allocation to the future and allocation to neighbors the rest of this chapter contains a short description of relevant literature on water scarcity in section 1 research methodology design is addressed in section 2 including the preparation of field experiments with the corresponding institutional setting additionally a questionnaire was applied to collect qualitative data see annex section 3 presents empirical findings while the final sections tackle the discussion and conclusions 2 methods to understand groundwater cooperative behavior as an adaptation to climate variability a series of field experiments were designed as the main research method cooperation was approached in terms of people s willingness to adapt to declining water availability the actual adaptation mechanism being water extraction capping field experiments were performed by setting up cpr action situations in the referred colombian municipalities during the experiments participants were asked to make water extraction decisions which granted them the possibility to earn some payoff money relevant socio physical information provided as if coming from external institutions framed the decision making process it included data on water availability time before aquifer depletion and neighbors extraction rates every single allocation decision had implications for future availability extractions might exert negative externalities on the participants and others thus the information provided exposed farmers and rural inhabitants i e water users to social dilemma situations 3 3 social dilemmas exist when individuals interact in decision making they are challenged by options in which the short range egoistic interest produces outcomes leading all individuals in worst off condition than alternative cooperative options as part of the experimental design the implemented treatments are shortly described in fig 1 and fig 2 the treatments were featured by the type of information used to promote water conservation among water users a treatment variables and control group to test the effect of hydrogeological information i e evaluating its consequences with respect to doing nothing two treatments were designed namely one in which communication between participants was freely allowed and another one in which communication was not possible design 1 control situation actors are not exposed to hydrogeological information and are not allowed to communicate in deciding how much water to extract this corresponds to the baseline situation design 2 actors are exposed to different hydrogeological information regarding the state of aquifers three treatment groups were organized in the four municipalities three hundred and eighty three rounds were run in treatment group 1 in guamal riohacha and corozal 285 rounds were performed in treatment group 2 in the same municipalities and finally 160 rounds were performed to build a control group or baseline situation in fonseca and guamal in each treatment group 61 participants were able to reveal their water allocation decisions to the three destinations mentioned in fig 1 w p t s p t and w f t a treatment group design the treatment groups were exposed to different information frameworks before they made water allocation decisions the framing messages were announced to them through fliers different treatment groups received and read a flier some groups were informed about the remaining water quantity in the reservoir in question see second column in fig 1 other treatment groups received a different flier expressing the remaining time before aquifer exhaustion see second column in fig 1 in the control group or baseline situation participants did not receive any information prior to their decisions besides some additional information was provided to reflect changes in weather conditions the moment among the rounds to provide the new information was randomized the new information corresponded to a raining period which replenished the reservoir or a prolonged drought looming threat water could be allocated to the present the future or neighbors third column in fig 1 b participants in the experimental games in the experiments the participants formulated their decisions paper and pencil in the first place a list of 320 municipalities drawn from official reports on localities relying on aquifer systems was reviewed with this data phone calls were made to 3 out of 7 environmental entities in the colombian caribbean coast asking for the list of neighborhoods in question and the corresponding hydrogeological data on aquifer systems beneath these territories two localities in each of three municipalities were randomly chosen from the list local leaders or guides were suggested by authorities to facilitate access to the territories thus six communities were randomly chosen and upon visiting the places random selection of households was carried out with the support of local guides farmers and rural inhabitants who are actual users of local groundwater resources were invited to participate in the trials the studied communities have a long tradition in building their wells and extracting according to their needs prior to recruitment potential participants were given a brief explanation in which they were told that they would be making decisions in an economic choice situation i e choices impacting water levels as suggested by meinzen dick et al 2016 e ostrom et al 1994 they were also informed that the money they earned depended upon their own investment decisions and those of the others in the experimental group in order to design and implement the experiments a field setting resembling a microeconomic system or action situation was prepared consisting of a set of agents and institutions through which they interacted the agents were the individual participants in the local economy each agent had his her own characteristics including resource endowment cash time wealth information about others preference endowments technology production functions and preferred outcomes cassar and friedman 2004 see design of experimental sessions in the annex table 1 summarizes the data gathered during the experimental sessions since the participants representing community members had been living for a long time in their localities and were familiar with groundwater extraction after having done it for almost all their lives the experimental sessions were certainly appropriate in terms of the field context the nature of the participants and the commodity at stake harrison and list 2004 were strictly related to the research objective which would not have been the case with abstract commodities or urban dwellers having little connection with groundwater resource extraction the experimental settings involved the following elements participants treatments a payment method and water units allocated to collective goods cassar and friedman 2004 smith 1992 experiments are frequently used to get a deeper understanding of both the factors that affect cooperative choices and the way decisions on the use of natural resources are made anderies j janssen 2013 cárdenas 2009 the data used in the analysis were obtained from 668 experimental sessions in ten communities each of them resulting in a cluster of observations since each participant provided 4 data per round 2670 observations were collected during the games that is participants were able to provide information on the extraction of water in the present w p t water allocated to neighbors s p t water allotted to future consumption w f t and total extraction which was referred to as the cap the latter is considered to be additional data because people first decided if they would comply with it and then made their choices on water allocation to the three suggested goods the participants played 12 rounds on average 4 4 in some experimental sessions participants just decided to make a halt at round number 10 or 11 despite 12 rounds were informed to participants as a fixed numbers in some cases players found the game so enriching that played for 13 rounds and none of them decided to quit the experimental sessions field experiments can be designed with a twofold purpose on the one hand for collecting information on how people in facing real life challenges such as scarce water supplies behave and work together to solve collective problems meinzen dick et al 2016 and on the other hand for testing the effectiveness of alternative institutional options intended to stimulate collective action cardenas et al 2011 the five elements contemplated in the design of the field experiments were carefully applied as shortly described in table 2 individuals refer to the profile of the farmers participating as players lab experiments mostly use students in search for greater relevance experimental economics are recruiting subjects in the field rather than in the classroom harrison and list 2004 the design and application of the treatments is the way to provide different versions of the experiments rounds are series of experimental sessions in which participants make their decisions when exposed to the different treatments rounds might correspond to years or months in which participants allocate water units in respect to the payment method it is convenient to motivate the subjects by paying them in cash right after the experiment smith 1992 this will help achieving monotonicity and salience harrison and list 2004 monotonicity means that in a suitable reward medium more is always better or alternatively less is always better salience means that for each agent the reward corresponds to a clear outcome function for example profit or utility and the subject understands this cartwright 2019 cassar and friedman 2004 the field experiments proposed in this research slightly depart from extant experimental design schemes a connection is made between the purpose of understanding cooperation in groundwater management and the institutional mechanism of water extraction caps looking forward to the sustainable management of aquifers i refer to this setting as a voluntary contribution extraction capped game vcecg the voluntary character comes from the autonomous willingness to contribute by individuals while the modification with respect to vcm lays on the physical context surrounding decision making the design intends to test the extent to which individuals are willing to contribute in order to accomplish physically contextualized water conservation caps so as to adapt to water table declination thus a socio physical institutional setting is designed to understand how farmers adapt to these contextualized declinations the methodology presented above refers to data collection in the lines that follow the data analysis method is shortly described as to the logistic regression model it is worthwhile noting that in some of these prototypes the dependent variable is usually a dummy one with value 1 if an event occurs and 0 if it does not occur this is true of qualitative response models in which dependent variables fall on m mutually exclusive categories cameron c trivedi 2005 in the present model the dummy variable which assesses the fulfillment of the suggested water extraction cap was regressed against variables such as well depth gender and time living in the community among others we predicted each individual s probabilities of fulfillment which was assessed through values 0 nonfulfillment or 1 fulfillment a more appropriate model is the logit one which specifies p i pr y i 1 x i exp β 1 β 2 x i 1 e x p β 1 β 2 x i clearly ensuring that 0 p i 1 given that the present research considers two binary outcomes estimation is usually done by maximum likelihood because data distribution is necessarily defined by bernoulli s model if the probability of one outcome equals p the probability of the other outcome must be 1 p for regression applications the probability p will vary across individuals as a function of regressors cameron c trivedi 2005 there is no loss of generality in setting the values at 1 and 0 if the only parameter being modeled is p which determines the probability of the outcome a regression model is formed by parameterizing the probability p for it to depend on a regression vector x and a k x 1 parameter vector β commonly used models have a single index form whose conditional probability is given by p i pr y i 1 x f x i β where f is a specified function to ensure that 0 p 1 it is natural to specify that f is a cumulative distribution function notwithstanding interest lies on determining the marginal effect of a change in a regressor on the conditional probability that y 1 for the general probability model and assuming change in the j t h regressor to be continuous this is pr y i 1 x i x i j f x i β β j as for any linear model the marginal effects differ with respect to both evaluation point x i and the different choices made on function f 3 empirical results a descriptive statistics this section details the descriptive statistic treatment of the current findings quantitative and qualitative information are presented in order to explain adaptation to water scarcity as influenced by extraction caps special attention is paid to the dependent and explanatory variables captured through field experiments questionnaires and interviews water availability was bisected in two categories that were familiar to the participants namely time and quantity of available water which were tested as overarching dimensions denoting binding limits to resource extraction water allocation to w p t w f t or w f t was dissimilar in the remaining quantity and time before exhaustion treatment groups see table 3 and table 4 the descriptive statistics analysis suggests that when farmers are inquired on quantity allocation and informed about time before aquifer exhaustion they reflect a more cautious behavior the quantity treatment group assigned to the present somewhat more than 5000 m3 at a maximum the time treatment group distributed through utmost allocations of 1500 m3 per round this same group exerted more pressure on aquifer resources as it can be seen in the minimum available water value maximum well depth is 170 m which indicates the great effort required to build it it is worthwhile mentioning that this experimental setting allows water users to picture in their minds how deep the water table is and how deeper or shallower their wells are with respect to the other group members the average earning was almost five times the minimum hourly wage in colombia i e 19 000 per participant which were paid in cash water allocation for future consumption also revealed some differences between the quantity and time before treatment groups in the former group the maximum allocated amount was as big as the one allotted to the present in the time before exhaustion treatment group the maximum allocation to the future was almost 30 greater than the one assigned to present consumption the standard deviation values of both the present and the future allocations were greater in the remaining quantity treatment group in other words this group shows more varied allocation intentions thus it can be said that communicating water availability information in terms of either remaining time or remaining volume before aquifer exhaustion certainly activated different allocation preferences b exploring data on relationships between variables before presenting the results addressing the drivers of the adaptive water management system the question on whether there is a relationship between variables is addressed for this purpose the pearson chi square chi 2 and likelihood ratio chi 2 tests were chosen the dependent variable dep var is the mentioned dichotomous one which informs on the fulfillment of the suggested water extraction y i 0 1 this variable was regressed against all explanatory variables indep vars the null hypothesis h 0 is that there is no relationship between dep var and each of the indep vars cameron c trivedi 2005 greene 2003 in order to reject this h 0 a p r 0 05 value at a 95 confidence level was used almost for all the listed indep vars some relation with dep var was found in the quantity treatment group although the relationship between the dep var and the indep vars was found to be relevant for the model it did not provide any causal relationships yet some variables were observed to be associated with extraction capping cooperation this is the case of the personal characteristics of the participants such as age or years of education or socio physical variables such as time before exhaustion and well depth however gender did not show any relation see annex v1 table 11 regarding the social variables under the control of the participants such as water allocation to the present water allocation to the future or water left to the community and the decision to follow extraction caps are significant also in terms of personal characteristics such as age years of education and gender some relationships with the decision to follow the cap exist see table 3 another relevant topic has to do with justifying the use of the logistic regression procedure instead of the classical ordinary least regression ols this is relevant for the case since the chosen model restricts the type of statistical analysis than can be done on the data annex 1i graph 2 and graph 3 illustrate the different ways the models fit the data in expressing the willingness to conform to extraction capping the dependent variable is expressed only in terms of 0 or 1 a data pattern that ols is not able to capture contrarily logistic regression is able to model the data cloud around 0 or 1 c measures of fitness another important topic that demands careful attention refers to scalar measures of fitness the use of adequate statistics to check the goodness of the developed econometric model is assessed thus in explaining the drivers of the adaptive water management system the question on which model provides a better explanation of the causal relationships is addressed the classical statistic r2 which is usually employed in logistic regressions is not convenient for different reasons that are beyond the scope of this research an alternative approach to model fitness evaluation and comparison corresponds to information criteria which are log likelihood in nature and can have adjustable degrees of freedom in general the model with the smallest information criterion is preferred the essential intuition is that there is tension between model fitness as measured by the maximized log likelihood value and the principle of parsimony which favors a simple model although model fitness can be improved by increasing model complexity parameters are only added if the resulting improvement in fitness sufficiently compensates the loss of parsimony based on information measures the bayesian information criterion bic and the akaike information criterion aic have become common model selection tools see table 9 measures of fit for logit of followcap quantity treatment group and table 10 measures of fit for logit of followcap time treatment group in selecting the model a comparison is made between two model types which are separately presented to the remaining quantity and time before exhaustion treatment groups remaining quantity treatment group measures of fitness the first model only incorporated physical variables to explain the adoption of cooperative behavior as an adaptive management approach to water scarcity see table 5 in other words it considers that only environmental variables such as well depth and water availability lead water users to adapt to scarcity similarly two personal factors were included to explain the dependent variable the key variable determining adaptive water management corresponded to well depth for its part the variable years of education was found to negatively influence adaptive management at a 10 significance level the second model contemplates socio physical variables neighbor extraction level is significant at a 1 significance level and so is years of education time living in the community is relevant at 5 significance regarding water allocation time preferences the present and the future were observed to be dominant at a 10 level of significance whereas allocation to neighbors was not significant see table 5 in this context model fitness constitutes the selection criterion in the comparison between the bayesian information and akaike information criteria table 8 since the smallest criterion is preferred the differences between the information criteria offer a direct response for model selection in this case model 2 socio physical variables provides a better explanation of adaptive water management since a 5 336 difference between the two models in the bic supports model 2 time before exhaustion treatment group measures of fitness turning to the measures of fitness for the time before exhaustion treatment group a comparison between the physical and socio physical models was also carried out in this case 281 observations were used to build models 1 and 2 in the first model none of the explanatory variables were significant contrarily in the case of the socio physical model three relevant variables accounted for the complexity of the definition of the model time living in the community was found to positively influence the adoption of cooperative behavior towards water conservation at a 1 significance level this means that the longer a person has been living in the territory the more they will tend to conserve water resources in turn time before exhaustion was observed to negatively affect the desired outcome at a 5 level of significance additionally the income level of the participants was significant as well meaning that the more people earn the less likely they are to follow a cooperative strategy aimed at complying with extraction caps see table 6 according to the information criterion the model representing the physical variables provides a better explanation of the likeliness to adopt cooperative behavior notwithstanding a decision had to be made in terms of the capacity of the studied variables to account for a causal relationship between the explanatory and dependent variables according to table 9 a difference of 7 13 in the bic supports model 1 however table 6 shows how the variables differ in terms of significance level in both models in the socio physical model four explanatory variables were highly significant at 1 and 5 significance levels however in the first model only the constant was found to be significant which might be disregarded because it does not account for any causal relationship thus there is contrast between the information criterion and the significance of the variables for this reason model 2 was selected to carry out a deeper econometric analysis on these grounds determining the marginal effect of a change in a regressor on the conditional probability that y i 1 provides some interesting research clues the conditional probability is given by p i pr y i 1 x f x i β where x represents the regressors and β refers to the coefficients as shown in tables 5 and 6 for the general probability of this model on p i and a change in regressor j t h the marginal effect is pr y i 1 x i x i j f x i β β j cameron c trivedi 2005 greene 2003 3 1 the marginal effects the overall probability of y i 1 is 92 given that all predictors are set to their mean values as presented in table 6 however chances are to present the marginal effect on explained variable when independent variables are set at specific values for instance enquires might be defined on how the probability to adopt a cooperative behavior might change when the well depth changes from the mean value 42 7 m to 100 m or more the effect of more literate farmers or more affluent families might be modeled as well similarly marginal effects of a change of one additional unit of continuous or categorical variables might be of interest also see table 11 in annex as shown in the equation above the derivative expresses that the marginal effect corresponds to a probability change which takes place when the independent variable x i j increases by one unit as shown in table 11 in the quantity treatment group one additional year in the time living in the community variable reduces the probability to adopt cooperative behavior by almost 0 2 for each additional 1000 m3 of water that neighbors extract individuals increase the probability to follow the cooperative strategy by 4 for individuals preferring to allocate more water to the present the probability of a cooperative behavior decreases by 10 and a similar effect is observed in farmers preferring to allocate more water to the future as to the years of education variable each additional year of schooling reduces this probability by 1 3 in the time treatment group time living in the community has a positive effect on the adoption on cooperative behavior the probability of which increases by 0 1 per each additional year of life in the territory in this group the effect of income level has a negative significant effect table 7 shows the corresponding ols regression parameters each additional year lived in the community helps to increase the probability of cooperation in almost 0 0016 units for the time before exhaustion and remaining quantity treatment groups and each additional income unit reduces this probability in a small fraction however the main departure from logistic models refers to the insignificant effect that the time preferences have on the probabilities of cooperation in general ols models do not fit the data properly since less than 14 of the models are explained by the observations with respect to the marginal effect of one additional unit in the explanatory variables graph 1 illustrates the relevance of this effect when it comes to explaining the adoption of the cooperative behavior in question this example only shows this effect in the time before exhaustion treatment group the deeper the water well is the lesser the probabilities of cooperation with water conservation notwithstanding this effect changes with time before exhaustion which together with remaining water quantity actually limit aquifer resource extraction thus the marginal probabilities change depending on whether one assumes 5 15 or 30 years before aquifer exhaustion as expected when the participants knew that the aquifer system would last 5 years business as usual extraction patterns there was a 96 probability of cooperative behavior in the 10 m 250 m well depth interval however this probability dropped to 90 in the 500 m 650 m interval and to less than 80 when well depth approached 900 m in the control group allocations of water to the present and to the future were close in terms of volumes in the second half of total rounds average future assignments were slightly higher than present extractions see graph 4 in control groups intertemporal allocation preferences were not fully revealed by farmers participating in experiments in addition to this in this group the well depth variable played a role in the probability to abide by the cap see table 7 for the quantity treatment group in order of preference farmers adapt by assigning more water to the present during almost the whole experimental sessions meanwhile allocation to the future remained in second place unlike the control group during half of the experimental sessions farmers allocated almost 30 more of the cpr to the present than to the future at the start of the second half of the rounds farmers revealed abrupt responses to quantity declinations and almost doubled their allocation to the future see graph 5 in both control and quantity treatment groups allocation to neighbors shows a preference for non egoistic behavior in treatment group water allocations displayed a more elaborated decision making the intertemporal allocations seemed to be pondered since more information was provided to players participating in treatment groups when an aquifer system is alleged to last 30 years more the adoption of cooperative behavior surrounds 70 in the 10 m 60 m well depth interval but this probability falls to 50 when well depths reach 340 m 440 m additionally cooperation to preserve water resources drops to less than 20 when water well depths are higher than 800 m in the case of aquifers that are expected to last for 15 years the probability to adopt cooperative behavior is 93 in shallow wells less than 40 m depths while it drops to 90 when depths reach 150 m 200 m a strepitous decay in cooperative behavior from 76 to 54 is observed when water wells are between 600 m 900 m deep these marginal effect results can be clearer with an example situation in which water well depth is 100 m and hydro economic information on time before aquifer exhaustion is available observing graph 1 the probabilities to cooperate with aquifer conservation are 67 and 96 for 30 and 5 years before exhaustion respectively in 500 m well depths the probabilities drop from 92 to 46 when there are 5 and 30 years left before exhaustion respectively 4 discussion individual and community cooperation in adaptation to water scarcity is not straightforward different factors influence people s willingness to adapt to climate change related effects on water availability adaptation is studied here using conceptual instruments aimed at signaling water scarcity instead of studying if people relying on groundwater adapt to status quo or projected climate conditions a step forward is suggested in order to connect adaptation to sustainability for this aim water scarcity is operationalized through the binding limits of nature thus an extraction cap was suggested to the participants in the experimental sessions as a substitute for abstract situations in which experiment participants are asked to allocate tokens cardenas et al 2011 fischbacher et al 2001 gächter 2007 keser and van winden 2000 the type of good at stake and the group of subjects in this research are closely related to the research purpose harrison and list 2004 this is water units and real rural water users mostly farmers were recruited instead of university students who might not be familiar with the problem of aquifer overdraft and the deepest social problems of water scarcity extraction capping is a recently claimed approach to adapt to declining water resources by managing both water footprints and the contradiction of water use efficiency improvement grafton et al 2018 a hoekstra 2020 a y hoekstra 2013 in this respect the literature review registers few similar water extraction capping experiments to the present one threshold game models usually investigate if thresholds increase contributions ceteris paribus ledyard 1995 stock quota games which are closer to extraction capping have been used to address different issues such as the problem of competition and the strategic externality effects of cpr systems gardner et al 1997 furthermore the concept of annual quota has been suggested by those who have taken a closer look at the aquifer conservation approach smith 1977 in order to define rights over annual groundwater recharges hence extraction caps and quotas should be concocted to address the evident problem of aquifer overexploitation which is pervasive around the world based on this topic both caps and quotas should be consequent with the urgent need to avert overexploitation and recommend adequate extraction rates for this aim another modification respect to extant cpr studies on cooperation lies on the type of binding limits suggested to players in the experiments on top of the capping assumptions two information treatment groups were formed time before exhaustion and remaining water quantity were employed as limiting categories to which players were able to react differently the results indicate that cooperative behavior is more complex than just allocating a higher fraction that the one a nash equilibrium would define andreoni 1995 cardenas et al 2011 gardner et al 1997 instead it is delimited by social behavioral and institutional settings all of which might trigger the decision to conform to extraction capping thus cooperation drivers are related to socio physical variables which are in turn capable of configuring a decision making model an overarching finding on cooperation under the influence of extraction capping refers to the complexity of the interactions between those socio physical variables that explain cooperative behavior more general studies led by outstanding scholars state that cooperation is explained by reciprocity axelrod and william 1981 axelrod 1984 gächter 2007 hamilton 1964 trust on others cox 2004 ostrom 1997 communication easiness abrahamse and steg 2013 m a janssen et al 2010 m janssen lee and tyson 2014 ostrom et al 1994 sally 1995 and the ability of communities to devise proper rule systems isaac et al 1994 ostrom 2015 1990 and thus manage natural resources autonomously among others an in depth analysis of cooperation drivers under extraction capping suggests a more elaborated set of explanatory variables water availability plays a role in cooperation together with well depth in both cases the marginal effect is negative in the first case the perception of plentifulness may not activate cooperation since individuals might perceive that scarcity is still far similar results have been found when crop choice is linked to groundwater exhaustion which actually leads farmers to cooperate meinzen dick et al 2016 in the second case the deeper the well is the lesser the probability of cooperation because this parameter is perceived as the socio physical realization of scarcity another relevant variable corresponds to time living in the community in the time treatment group this variable was found to be significantly positive while in the water quantity group a negative effect was observed living in the territory for almost 30 years have set the conditions to build a connection with the territory and understand the water stocks and flows while interacting with neighboring farmers in these interactions enough time have elapsed to get rules of adaptation to scarcity built besides the socio cultural connection with the territory has a dissimilar impact on the possibilities of cooperation when water users are informed about the remaining time before aquifer exhaustion the time they have lived in the dry region plays a role in deciding whether to adapt or not to water scarcity by conforming to a water extraction cap however this adaptation is permeated by socio cultural values in time treatment situation farmers bring their past and present socio cultural heritage and values to the game and goes far from physical dimension of the problem similarly in their revealed future allocations of water during the games those customs are made patent as well since farmers belong to communities where they have lived for long time capping situations use to challenge the persistence of such a socio cultural tradition farmers by interacting with institutions gather information by learning about others and their actions and about the consequences of interacting within a specific set of rules cárdenas and ostrom 2005 notwithstanding working rules and institutions reflect hidden social and cultural values configuring communities actions and choices in water management which might be supportive or against program implementation meinzen dick et al 2016 van der voorn 2008 in this time treatment group other hidden social aspects are also revealed in respect to the intertemporal water allocations when farmers are asked about allocating water volumes for the future consumption impatience rates uncertainty cultural ties with the community and the territory are brought to their decision making scene a long term oriented society strives to achieve congruence with its variable environment van der voorn 2008 based on the marginal effect of time before aquifer exhaustion on the decision to conform to the cap this long term orientation is adjusted by the how far this future is and how scarce the water resource is becoming for people living over shallow aquifers when this resource is alleged to last 30 more years the probabilities of cooperation by conforming to the cap surrounds 70 but this probability plummets to 20 when water well depths are higher than 800 m thus cooperative behavior by conforming to the cap is possible even when long term uncertainty in water availability exists therefore decisions made by farmers in respect to abiding by a cap is consistent with the necessity of others to afford to water resources as well as suggested by van der voorn 2008 a collectivistic instead of an individualistic rationale might be present in these communities since strong ties may reinforce collectives thinking where everyone takes responsibility for fellow members of their group in the water quantity group the neighbors extraction level positively impacted the likelihood of cooperation the more water the neighbor was assumed to extract the more the individuals were willing to conform to capping this reflects a departure from reciprocal behavior falk et al 2002 milinski et al 2002 ostrom 1998 since the more water the neighbors were assumed to extract the more the individuals restricted their own extraction therefore under water scarcity conditions individuals preferred to adapt by restraining their own extraction instead of retaliating because of neighbors non cooperative behavior thus it can be said that climate change effects on the water related dimensions of development stimulate cooperation perhaps because of the woes and incumbrances entailed by water scarcity the key practical implication of neighbors extraction under the time before exhaustion and quantity treatments refers to the positive effect that this parameter had in stimulating cooperation to adapt to scarcity conditions thus water managers and policy makers are suggested to include the collection and dissemination of key socio physical information on time before aquifer exhaustion remaining underground water quantities and neighbors extraction rates despite the fact that information sharing is complex to manage this can be accomplished through innovative technological devices to make user consumption data and hydrogeological aquifer status more visible and accessible to all water users in each vicinity thus the key drivers of cooperation can be turned into institutional information working for cooperation in our adaptation to climate change finally socio economic factors halting adaptation to climate change might be managed with institutional and physical mechanisms however water availability exerts stringent limitations for livelihoods or farming ishaya s abaje 2008 komba c muchapondwa 2012 thus given the vital character of water its availability should not only be an explanatory variable in adaptation to declining water stocks but an issue subjected to socio physical explanations about said adaptation 5 conclusions this research is focused on presenting the empirical evidence on the drivers and inhibitors of adaptive groundwater management the empirical research results are mostly quantitative data used for the analysis were drawn from framed field experiments run in 10 small communities belonging to 3 municipalities of colombia the geographical setting corresponds to dry areas exposed to frequent droughts water shortages and high dependence on aquifer systems field experiments were organized in two treatment information groups namely time before exhaustion and remaining water quantity treatments these were used to differentiate the water allocation decision making process when binding limits exist another justification for delimiting the experimental sessions refers to the fact that field experiments are aimed at finding collective action alternatives when institutional settings differ the more field experiments resemble real life situations the better they will recreate practical decision making thus water table declinations and aquifer overexploitation which are real situations faced by water users have been practically addressed by the current experiments in order to capture and recreate socio physical models of reality for this reason the participants in the experiments were asked to allocate water when time before aquifer exhaustion is made public and when the remaining water quantity in aquifers is declining as observed in daily life empirical models in the time before exhaustion and quantity treatment groups were tested using the information criterion to assess regression fitness a contrast was established between physical and socio physical models to assess how the independent variables better explain the dependent variable the latter which refers to the ability of people to adopt cooperative behavior in conserving water resources was measured via the probability to comply with extraction capping the cap is consequent with the need to incorporate the limited water available units into water management systems the empirical results show that socio physical models provide a more comprehensive explanation of the drivers and inhibitors of cooperation in the remaining quantity treatment groups the longer the people have lived in the territory the less inclined they are to cooperate since one additional year reduces the probability to adopt cooperative behavior by almost 0 2 contrarily in the time before exhaustion treatment group this relationship was positively significant since one additional year living in the community was observed to increase the likelihood of cooperation by 0 1 the inter temporal preferences of water allocation were found to be significant but a clear pattern was not found in effect cooperation likeliness declined by 10 in individuals preferring to allocate water to the present or the future additional years of education did not produce the expected result since one additional year of education reduces the probability to cooperate by 1 3 in the remaining quantity group special attention was paid to the marginal effect of some variables on cooperation likeliness marginal changes in this probability were plotted against both well depth and time before aquifer exhaustion the marginal effect is a step forward from using averages for water planning if a groundwater management plan is put in place the marginal characteristics of well depth and time before aquifer exhaustion have implications for the success of management strategies differentiations should be made in terms of well depth where farmers live the probability of adopting cooperative behavior is not the same if farmers are located over a 50 m 100 m or 500 m deep water well for instance two communities led to assume they had 30 years left before aquifer exhaustion showed contrasting probabilities of cooperation 72 to and 62 in connection with well depth which was respectively 50 and 200 m these empirical results have implications when it comes to finding options for achieving sustainable development goals especially sdg 6 which is related to water use efficiency water management cooperation drivers have a bearing on efficient water use the behavioral effects that the time before exhaustion and remaining quantity approaches have on water extraction should not be overlooked if efficient water withdrawal is pursued before water is used efficiently water withdrawal should be reduced to benchmark levels these reductions are not easily attained if well depth and information on aquifer duration are not geographically contextualized within water management strategies even though the current research strategy addressed groundwater as a specific cpr it provides theoretical elements for other cpr settings such as forests fisheries and irrigation systems which are also affected by resource use dilemmas however in order to make a better contribution to the understanding of the drivers of adaptation to scarcity in other cpr more effort should be made to overcome the limitations of this research a longitudinal experimental approach was planned but the covid 19 pandemic made it impossible at this time thus more rounds of experimental sessions are suggested more field experiments with the same communities would be helpful to measure how stable the cooperation was in groundwater conservation under extraction caps from the other side varying the extraction cap level might be helpful to measure the effects of caps and thresholds on level and effectiveness of cooperation on the other hand it was not possible to introduce extraction cap level variations due to limited participant payment funds since the calculation of the extraction cap was based on agricultural activity consumption figures further research aimed at filling these gaps is suggested in the context of widespread non compliance with environmental rules or free riding further research should be focused in deepening individuals decision making processes under more barefaced free riding to see to what extent tolerance and patience are overtaken similarly another socio cultural dimension related to religious faith should be included as explanatory qualitative and quantitative variables since faith based organizations and individual faith may guide people to practice more care for the others by conserving water resources on earth and not in heaven declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

predicting probabilities of fulfilment for each individual whereas the actual values observed are 0 and 1 ii there is not guarantee that y i ˆ the predicted value of y i is going to be between 0 and 1

individuals based on their earnings during the game in line with the principles of experimental economics a real substantial incentive is provided for the decisions to be made yielding the corresponding payoffs keser and van winden 2000 meinzen dick et al 2016 participants were instructed that in each decision round they were asked to contribute to prevent aquifer deterioration before making the decisions they were informed in regard of aquifer physical characteristics and the water extraction caps to promote sustainability and avoid exhaustion of the cpr as shown in illustration 2 participants decided whether following the expected cap or consuming their preferred water quantity participants were told that the announced cap was a suggested one but not a mandatory rule annex v

11755,this research presents empirical evidence on what drives and inhibits cooperative behavior in groundwater management adaptive to climate change given vital character of water its availability should not be only an explanatory variable in adaptation but an issue subject to socio physical explanations on how farmers adapt to declining water stocks instead of studying if farmers relying on groundwater adapt to status quo or projected climate conditions a step forward is suggested in order to connect adaptation with sustainability water extraction caps compliance were used to test cooperation limits to aquifer withdrawals are operationalized via remaining time and quantities of water quantitative data were drawn from 668 experimental rounds in framed field experiments implemented in dry regions in ten communities exposed to climate variability in colombia empirical results suggest that socio physical setting better explain the adoption of cooperative decisions intertemporal preferences on water allocations and physical variables have dissimilar marginal effects on cooperation the deeper the water well is the less the probabilities to cooperate in water conservation notwithstanding the effect is dissimilar according to the remaining time for exhaustion of aquifer systems marginal effect is a step forward from using averages for water planning if a groundwater management plan is put in place the marginal characteristics of well depths and residual time of aquifer existence has implications for the successfulness of management strategies which in turn have implications for long term plans of water use efficiency as stated in sustainable development goals graphical abstract image 1 keywords adaptation aquifers water scarcity extraction caps sustainability field experiments colombia 1 introduction people living in dry regions for all their lives can be said to have independently developed multiple adaptation measures to water scarcity but aquifer overexploitation and surface water impairment around the world a hoekstra 2020 oecd 2017b peterson j and smith 2012 suggest the need to comprehend the effectiveness of adaptation strategies the individual and collective water scarcity adaptation mechanisms and how some communities cooperate while others fail to manage their commons in regional migration contexts where climate change affects hydric resources communities show dissimilar sizes and water constitutes a vital household and food production supply there is urgent need to better understand what drives adaptation to water scarcity the number of people relying on aquifers in rural and urban areas is still high aquifers provide fresh water for around half the global population whose demand is expected to increase by 55 from the year 2000 to mid century oecd 2017b siebert et al 2010 in colombia at least 3 million people depend on aquifer systems and more than 60 are located in the caribbean region of the country dane 2018 ideam 2019 although most people are assumed to remain in the current territories drought conditions will exacerbate and reduced precipitations are forecast for the caribbean region ideam pnud mads dnp cancilleria 2017 under this setting adaptation to groundwater resource declination and water scarcity is discussed the physical and socio institutional facets of scarcity affect people s ability to adapt to it the first second and third orders of scarcity correspond to physical engineering economic institutional and socio political issues respectively metha 2007 wolfe s brooks 2003 nonetheless water scarcity can also be classified as economic or physical in nature economic scarcity occurs when the extraction costs of the resource are higher than the benefits of extraction physical scarcity is more stringent if the water table definitely declines and is close to saturated thickness there is almost nothing to do when some water reserves remain with the existing technology and some financial capacity investing in extraction is less benefiting than leaving the resource in place in this context it is worthwhile asking what factors stimulate or prevent water users to adapt to physical scarcity 1 1 based on this question the category of drivers refers to the social institutional economic or physical factors that make water users able to adapt to physical scarcity or prevent it to happen this inquiry might be approached through a status quo water management strategy in which supply side options are provided to match the demand griffin 2006 zetland 2009 but ever since water supply is not unlimited its demand needs to be understood in terms of those decision making drivers that guide the adaptation to physical water scarcity rapid declination is the most patent evidence of the limited character of these resources groundwater table declination and droughts are pervasive phenomena in western usa australia morocco mexico iran jordan india parts of china and other areas of southern asia world bank 2018 thus the design of institutions and rules focused on halting water extraction rates in the context of physical scarcity is an urgent task in pursuing the sustainable use of groundwater resources in different regions however extraction can only be done if physical and economic conditions do not prevent it on the other hand the demand has much to do in reaching cooperative behaviors that are consequent with water declination when it comes to the sustainable use of this resource hidden cultural patterns inevitable play a role since farmers and people are not passive actors when water management plans are put in place by authorities t van der voorn 2008 aquifers are invisible and scarce nonetheless cultural factors are invisible but made patent in daily decision making on water use and consumption thus cultural dimensions are embedded in social and economic drivers of cooperation and adaptation to scarcity understanding water users willingness to cooperate in their adaptation to water scarcity is relevant because this condition might be the norm in the coming years due to the effect of climate change on hydric resources different reasons might prompt further research on cooperative behavior towards adaptation to physical water scarcity first the rapid overexploitation of groundwater resources makes it necessary to decipher the intricate nature of cooperation second water management sustainability should be approached under the limits provided by nature which is not a common approach worldwide third extant water management approaches have fallen short and inefficient to avert overexploitation sandoval 2004 world bank 2010 fourth despite the fact that copious cases of common pool resource cpr self management have been documented some caveats should be expressed for the case of aquifer resources since groundwater is an invisible resource and water users might only be familiar with water tables and well depths the intricate interactions of hydrogeological variables may catch water users unaware of aquifer exhaustion without further notice consequently a community might be successful in concocting a cpr self management scheme but if they remain unaware of aquifer status they may end up managing a source that is about to run out of water this is not to say that groundwater stocks and flows suffer abrupt or rapid alterations from one day to another but ignoring cpr hydrogeological conditions may result in unfruitful management efforts in response to the mentioned challenges a paradigm change might be necessary to promote adaptable and sustainable water management systems business as usual approaches i e central or self management do not guarantee an adequate adaptation to the scarcity of this resource since it is not unlimited and keeping in mind that hydrogeological conditions determine aquifer stocks and flows some efforts should be put in place to understand its physical and social dimensions physical or environmental dimensions refer to variables such as water tables stocks flows and recharge levels social issues make reference to extraction volumes technology and well locations to mention a few more importantly there are socio physical interactions determining the status of the whole resource system the main outcome of socio physical interactions corresponds to the water balance that results from inflows recharge and outflows water extraction if the physical conditions are not met extractions may result unproductive thus water availability and the resulting water balance are operationalized as instruments that suggest water extraction limitations to this aim adaptation to water scarcity is framed by water extraction caps which are used to signal physical scarcity as it results from climate variability and climate change thus water use sustainability should not only focus on understanding whether people adapt to scarcity or not but how they do it as well the current body of research may fall short to understand how and why water users adapt to limited water availability all the more when it is bounded by suggested upper consumption limits contributions by water management scholars usually approach water resource availability and scarcity as static issues not subjected to limits decided by users themselves water scarcity adaptation drivers have multiple facets approaches and explanations the conceptualization of water scarcity has shifted from emphasis on scientific information and specific technologies to research on cultural environments and institutions wolfe s brooks 2003 the behavioral dimensions referring to risk management routines beliefs and perceptions on adaptation to scarcity are still under construction in the literature on behavioral and institutional economics singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 underline the importance of risk perception in the implementation of strategies to adapt to water scarcity in india they highlight social discernment on the meaning of scarcity the role of memory regarding prior events of scarcity particularly more recent ones was found to play a key role in adapting to it as well as the timing of adaptation capabilities the water shortage adaptation strategies employed by communities from ghana have been observed to be most reactive ones in the short term apraku b idinoba m amisah 2008 water management has been traditionally dominated by supply side approaches asprilla echeverría 2021 griffin 2006 while water governance has been understood from a top down hierarchical regulation approach pahl wostl and knieper 2014 thus engineering solutions are usually the first options in managing scarcity that is why governments are told to bring abundant water to all who demand it zetland 2011 no matter if the resource is scarce or plentiful notwithstanding water scarcity management alternatives to physical options have been documented in connection to the type of scarcity addressed physical scarcity is often counterbalanced by engineering processes and supply side solutions as stressed by singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 wolfe s brooks 2003 in this sense the first second and third categories of scarcity refer to physical engineering economic institutional and socio political factors respectively metha 2007 wolfe s brooks 2003 some scholars indeed depart from taking scarcity issues for granted and tend to challenge the problem through political transaction water scarcity indeed is often socially mediated thus shifting from a natural condition to the result of socio political and institutional processes metha 2007 in this context the problem of scarcity is currently being debated from the perspectives of political ecology and institutional and supply side approaches based only on the physical and observable character of water scarcity overexploitation is being noticed in different regions in places like south asia brazil mexico and other latin american countries when surface water availability declines groundwater sources are approached by pumping from water wells foster s and hirata 2011 foster stephen hirata r vidal ana schmidt gerhard garduño 2009 reliance on abating aquifers is a tough issue to manage in the research area in sucre and la guajira colombia the study is located in the north coast of colombia south america where drought events are repeated each year in this region there is a sort of invisible competition for water resources between water users and the municipal water facilities this competition is physically evident but is not necessarily socially intended in sucre 24 out of 26 municipal water facilities have built boreholes to collect water treat and distribute it through aqueduct pipes public entities in charge of water management use powerful pumps to collect water from the underground and distribute water to households notwithstanding up to 2011 there existed 1 788 wells under operation 2 2 1 713 wells reported in the jurisdiction of carsucre and 75 wells in the area of regional environmental corporation corpomojana it shows that there is not a unique centrally managed water distribution system but a collection of private and public boreholes in la guajira 33 of its15 municipalities use wells as the main or backstop source for drinking water besides there are some municipalities in which the official reports say that local water sources are river basins such as cesar river and rancheria river but observed water access practices exhibit a different history because people build their own wells on backyards this is the case for the municipalities of fonseca distraccion and barrancas extraofficial water extractions manifest that the water resources competition is even greater than official data the competition for water resources is made patent in water table declinations in the aquifer systems the main aquifer of sucre is called morroa aquifer the extraction rates of this aquifer surround 1000 to 1200 l per second but its natural recharge has been decreasing up to 75 l per second this water balance shows the high vulnerability of the aquifer due to overexploitation and progressive lowering of its reserves carsucre 2015 from the other side most of municipalities in the medium and high zones in la guajira use aquifers to satisfy domestic needs the high hydrologic deficit compels individuals communities and public entities to continuously exploit aquifers corpoguajira 2017 carsucre 2015 indicates that the intensive exploitation to which morroa aquifer has been exposed for more than 40 years is gradually running out the groundwater reserves this occurs because people annually extract more water than it seeps into the ground water imbalance between aquifers reserve levels extractions and recharge are leading to unsustainable aquifer management in the territories up to 2003 the intensive flow of some wells in the region of sucre have generated water table decreasing between 7 and 12 m per year pacheco and villegas 2003 in the past the population were able to build wells up to 100 m deep nowadays is necessary to build on average 400 m wells to extract water from the underground some wells have experienced declinations around 17 m year which threaten aquifer sustainability carsucre 2015 therefore different physical uncertainty of precipitation patterns and social factors are influencing water stocks declinations and water needs for drinking irrigation and industrial activities are exerting more pressures on remaining reserves the volatility of surface water resources for agriculture will seriously increase the use of groundwater in the current and next generations of irrigated lands thus numerous countries that do not substantially use aquifer systems for farming activities will probably face similar challenges to those currently experienced where groundwater is already used intensively oecd 2017a this situation certainly challenges water managers and policy makers in terms of institutional adequacy to adapt to pressing changes on water availability institutional adaptation arrangements to the scarcity of water resources have not been swift enough instead it has been irregular and lagged far behind institutional needs in many countries saleth 2014 currently regulations and norms aimed at ruling and controlling groundwater use to prevent exhaustion have been enforced in developing countries oecd 2015 policy measures tend to restrict water use by allocating quotas over periods of extraction and denying extraction permits when hydric resource authorities consider that certain physical hydrogeological conditions are not met however the current management approach has come to be inefficient partially due to the complexities of monitoring groundwater extraction and water users response in terms of passing over regulations sandoval 2004 therefore the institutional schemes detected in the water sector of most countries are still unsuitable and unsuccessful in resolving their water problems saleth 2014 the extant formal system of rules for water access in colombia comprise financial requirements permissions and water depletion avoidance the first legislative decision towards groundwater protection was released almost 50 years ago through decree 2811 1974 the decree 1541 1978 underlines the mandatory character of extraction permits before the environmental authorizes at best the authority grants a resource usufruct permission to a water user who pays a fee for it remarkably this norm declares that in case the authorities realize any groundwater basin depletion problem occurs the extraction permit cannot be granted more recently the decree 1640 2012 rules the environmental groundwater management plans design aimed at protecting aquifers however all policy instruments remain inefficient in driving water users to abide by the rule of extraction permits and more importantly to prevent aquifers depletion in addition while water scarcity management approaches are discussed climate change is influencing ecosystems and the water related dimensions of development hence water scarcity remains a crucial limiting factor driving farmers vulnerability mertz o halsnæs k olesen 2009 singh ch osbarh h dorward 2018 the least developed countries are most vulnerable to water issues due to climate change since their water technologies and capacities are inadequate and deficient bates et al 2008 thus vulnerability of water users and more suggestively the demand side of scarcity problems certainly requires special attention in terms of pursuing feasible adaptation plans the implementation of which implies overcoming behavioral and governance barriers o brien and wolf 2010 at this point the embedded indigenous and local knowledge among the populations needs to be skillfully honored and combined with scientific knowledge to reduce the inherent uncertainty and complexity of natural resource management ostrom 2015 natural resources such as groundwater are considered to be cpr and thus subject to physical and economic changes like overexploitation and increasing extraction costs e g pumping barlow and leake 2012 stevenson 2005 it is in this context that behavioral driving forces such as individual self interest and collective initiatives aimed at resource management and conservation operate farmers might adapt by shifting to new crops drought resistant crops or adopting water efficiency irrigation equipment komba c muchapondwa 2012 mertz o halsnæs k olesen 2009 suresh kumar 2007 tirado r cotter 2010 but the question on how people perceive scarcity under a cpr setting has not been fully addressed in the literature the cpr character of aquifers entails competition for water units stock exhaustion and other socio physical issues that are worth incorporating into water scarcity analyses experiments are frequently used to improve our understanding of decision making processes related to common pool and natural resource exploitation together with those factors that affect cooperation the current research focuses on providing answers to the question on what factors stimulate or prevent farmers and rural inhabitants to adapt to physical water scarcity in order to further develop adaptable water management systems in dry regions responding to this inquiry offers key inputs to address the quest for cooperation in sustainable aquifer management socio physical relationships between actual water users acting as participants and the variables that influence cooperation are analyzed field experiments were implemented in ten communities of four municipalities in the caribbean region of colombia the municipalities of riohacha and fonseca in the department of la guajira where the homonymous desert is located and the municipalities of guamal in the department of magdalena and corozal department of sucre the latter department is characterized by being almost fully reliant on groundwater for domestic activities industries and agriculture given the distinctive characteristic of cpr i e the fact that its users are usually close neighbors and the inter temporal character of water consumption the participants of the experiments were asked to distribute extraction caps in three markets present consumption allocation to the future and allocation to neighbors the rest of this chapter contains a short description of relevant literature on water scarcity in section 1 research methodology design is addressed in section 2 including the preparation of field experiments with the corresponding institutional setting additionally a questionnaire was applied to collect qualitative data see annex section 3 presents empirical findings while the final sections tackle the discussion and conclusions 2 methods to understand groundwater cooperative behavior as an adaptation to climate variability a series of field experiments were designed as the main research method cooperation was approached in terms of people s willingness to adapt to declining water availability the actual adaptation mechanism being water extraction capping field experiments were performed by setting up cpr action situations in the referred colombian municipalities during the experiments participants were asked to make water extraction decisions which granted them the possibility to earn some payoff money relevant socio physical information provided as if coming from external institutions framed the decision making process it included data on water availability time before aquifer depletion and neighbors extraction rates every single allocation decision had implications for future availability extractions might exert negative externalities on the participants and others thus the information provided exposed farmers and rural inhabitants i e water users to social dilemma situations 3 3 social dilemmas exist when individuals interact in decision making they are challenged by options in which the short range egoistic interest produces outcomes leading all individuals in worst off condition than alternative cooperative options as part of the experimental design the implemented treatments are shortly described in fig 1 and fig 2 the treatments were featured by the type of information used to promote water conservation among water users a treatment variables and control group to test the effect of hydrogeological information i e evaluating its consequences with respect to doing nothing two treatments were designed namely one in which communication between participants was freely allowed and another one in which communication was not possible design 1 control situation actors are not exposed to hydrogeological information and are not allowed to communicate in deciding how much water to extract this corresponds to the baseline situation design 2 actors are exposed to different hydrogeological information regarding the state of aquifers three treatment groups were organized in the four municipalities three hundred and eighty three rounds were run in treatment group 1 in guamal riohacha and corozal 285 rounds were performed in treatment group 2 in the same municipalities and finally 160 rounds were performed to build a control group or baseline situation in fonseca and guamal in each treatment group 61 participants were able to reveal their water allocation decisions to the three destinations mentioned in fig 1 w p t s p t and w f t a treatment group design the treatment groups were exposed to different information frameworks before they made water allocation decisions the framing messages were announced to them through fliers different treatment groups received and read a flier some groups were informed about the remaining water quantity in the reservoir in question see second column in fig 1 other treatment groups received a different flier expressing the remaining time before aquifer exhaustion see second column in fig 1 in the control group or baseline situation participants did not receive any information prior to their decisions besides some additional information was provided to reflect changes in weather conditions the moment among the rounds to provide the new information was randomized the new information corresponded to a raining period which replenished the reservoir or a prolonged drought looming threat water could be allocated to the present the future or neighbors third column in fig 1 b participants in the experimental games in the experiments the participants formulated their decisions paper and pencil in the first place a list of 320 municipalities drawn from official reports on localities relying on aquifer systems was reviewed with this data phone calls were made to 3 out of 7 environmental entities in the colombian caribbean coast asking for the list of neighborhoods in question and the corresponding hydrogeological data on aquifer systems beneath these territories two localities in each of three municipalities were randomly chosen from the list local leaders or guides were suggested by authorities to facilitate access to the territories thus six communities were randomly chosen and upon visiting the places random selection of households was carried out with the support of local guides farmers and rural inhabitants who are actual users of local groundwater resources were invited to participate in the trials the studied communities have a long tradition in building their wells and extracting according to their needs prior to recruitment potential participants were given a brief explanation in which they were told that they would be making decisions in an economic choice situation i e choices impacting water levels as suggested by meinzen dick et al 2016 e ostrom et al 1994 they were also informed that the money they earned depended upon their own investment decisions and those of the others in the experimental group in order to design and implement the experiments a field setting resembling a microeconomic system or action situation was prepared consisting of a set of agents and institutions through which they interacted the agents were the individual participants in the local economy each agent had his her own characteristics including resource endowment cash time wealth information about others preference endowments technology production functions and preferred outcomes cassar and friedman 2004 see design of experimental sessions in the annex table 1 summarizes the data gathered during the experimental sessions since the participants representing community members had been living for a long time in their localities and were familiar with groundwater extraction after having done it for almost all their lives the experimental sessions were certainly appropriate in terms of the field context the nature of the participants and the commodity at stake harrison and list 2004 were strictly related to the research objective which would not have been the case with abstract commodities or urban dwellers having little connection with groundwater resource extraction the experimental settings involved the following elements participants treatments a payment method and water units allocated to collective goods cassar and friedman 2004 smith 1992 experiments are frequently used to get a deeper understanding of both the factors that affect cooperative choices and the way decisions on the use of natural resources are made anderies j janssen 2013 cárdenas 2009 the data used in the analysis were obtained from 668 experimental sessions in ten communities each of them resulting in a cluster of observations since each participant provided 4 data per round 2670 observations were collected during the games that is participants were able to provide information on the extraction of water in the present w p t water allocated to neighbors s p t water allotted to future consumption w f t and total extraction which was referred to as the cap the latter is considered to be additional data because people first decided if they would comply with it and then made their choices on water allocation to the three suggested goods the participants played 12 rounds on average 4 4 in some experimental sessions participants just decided to make a halt at round number 10 or 11 despite 12 rounds were informed to participants as a fixed numbers in some cases players found the game so enriching that played for 13 rounds and none of them decided to quit the experimental sessions field experiments can be designed with a twofold purpose on the one hand for collecting information on how people in facing real life challenges such as scarce water supplies behave and work together to solve collective problems meinzen dick et al 2016 and on the other hand for testing the effectiveness of alternative institutional options intended to stimulate collective action cardenas et al 2011 the five elements contemplated in the design of the field experiments were carefully applied as shortly described in table 2 individuals refer to the profile of the farmers participating as players lab experiments mostly use students in search for greater relevance experimental economics are recruiting subjects in the field rather than in the classroom harrison and list 2004 the design and application of the treatments is the way to provide different versions of the experiments rounds are series of experimental sessions in which participants make their decisions when exposed to the different treatments rounds might correspond to years or months in which participants allocate water units in respect to the payment method it is convenient to motivate the subjects by paying them in cash right after the experiment smith 1992 this will help achieving monotonicity and salience harrison and list 2004 monotonicity means that in a suitable reward medium more is always better or alternatively less is always better salience means that for each agent the reward corresponds to a clear outcome function for example profit or utility and the subject understands this cartwright 2019 cassar and friedman 2004 the field experiments proposed in this research slightly depart from extant experimental design schemes a connection is made between the purpose of understanding cooperation in groundwater management and the institutional mechanism of water extraction caps looking forward to the sustainable management of aquifers i refer to this setting as a voluntary contribution extraction capped game vcecg the voluntary character comes from the autonomous willingness to contribute by individuals while the modification with respect to vcm lays on the physical context surrounding decision making the design intends to test the extent to which individuals are willing to contribute in order to accomplish physically contextualized water conservation caps so as to adapt to water table declination thus a socio physical institutional setting is designed to understand how farmers adapt to these contextualized declinations the methodology presented above refers to data collection in the lines that follow the data analysis method is shortly described as to the logistic regression model it is worthwhile noting that in some of these prototypes the dependent variable is usually a dummy one with value 1 if an event occurs and 0 if it does not occur this is true of qualitative response models in which dependent variables fall on m mutually exclusive categories cameron c trivedi 2005 in the present model the dummy variable which assesses the fulfillment of the suggested water extraction cap was regressed against variables such as well depth gender and time living in the community among others we predicted each individual s probabilities of fulfillment which was assessed through values 0 nonfulfillment or 1 fulfillment a more appropriate model is the logit one which specifies p i pr y i 1 x i exp β 1 β 2 x i 1 e x p β 1 β 2 x i clearly ensuring that 0 p i 1 given that the present research considers two binary outcomes estimation is usually done by maximum likelihood because data distribution is necessarily defined by bernoulli s model if the probability of one outcome equals p the probability of the other outcome must be 1 p for regression applications the probability p will vary across individuals as a function of regressors cameron c trivedi 2005 there is no loss of generality in setting the values at 1 and 0 if the only parameter being modeled is p which determines the probability of the outcome a regression model is formed by parameterizing the probability p for it to depend on a regression vector x and a k x 1 parameter vector β commonly used models have a single index form whose conditional probability is given by p i pr y i 1 x f x i β where f is a specified function to ensure that 0 p 1 it is natural to specify that f is a cumulative distribution function notwithstanding interest lies on determining the marginal effect of a change in a regressor on the conditional probability that y 1 for the general probability model and assuming change in the j t h regressor to be continuous this is pr y i 1 x i x i j f x i β β j as for any linear model the marginal effects differ with respect to both evaluation point x i and the different choices made on function f 3 empirical results a descriptive statistics this section details the descriptive statistic treatment of the current findings quantitative and qualitative information are presented in order to explain adaptation to water scarcity as influenced by extraction caps special attention is paid to the dependent and explanatory variables captured through field experiments questionnaires and interviews water availability was bisected in two categories that were familiar to the participants namely time and quantity of available water which were tested as overarching dimensions denoting binding limits to resource extraction water allocation to w p t w f t or w f t was dissimilar in the remaining quantity and time before exhaustion treatment groups see table 3 and table 4 the descriptive statistics analysis suggests that when farmers are inquired on quantity allocation and informed about time before aquifer exhaustion they reflect a more cautious behavior the quantity treatment group assigned to the present somewhat more than 5000 m3 at a maximum the time treatment group distributed through utmost allocations of 1500 m3 per round this same group exerted more pressure on aquifer resources as it can be seen in the minimum available water value maximum well depth is 170 m which indicates the great effort required to build it it is worthwhile mentioning that this experimental setting allows water users to picture in their minds how deep the water table is and how deeper or shallower their wells are with respect to the other group members the average earning was almost five times the minimum hourly wage in colombia i e 19 000 per participant which were paid in cash water allocation for future consumption also revealed some differences between the quantity and time before treatment groups in the former group the maximum allocated amount was as big as the one allotted to the present in the time before exhaustion treatment group the maximum allocation to the future was almost 30 greater than the one assigned to present consumption the standard deviation values of both the present and the future allocations were greater in the remaining quantity treatment group in other words this group shows more varied allocation intentions thus it can be said that communicating water availability information in terms of either remaining time or remaining volume before aquifer exhaustion certainly activated different allocation preferences b exploring data on relationships between variables before presenting the results addressing the drivers of the adaptive water management system the question on whether there is a relationship between variables is addressed for this purpose the pearson chi square chi 2 and likelihood ratio chi 2 tests were chosen the dependent variable dep var is the mentioned dichotomous one which informs on the fulfillment of the suggested water extraction y i 0 1 this variable was regressed against all explanatory variables indep vars the null hypothesis h 0 is that there is no relationship between dep var and each of the indep vars cameron c trivedi 2005 greene 2003 in order to reject this h 0 a p r 0 05 value at a 95 confidence level was used almost for all the listed indep vars some relation with dep var was found in the quantity treatment group although the relationship between the dep var and the indep vars was found to be relevant for the model it did not provide any causal relationships yet some variables were observed to be associated with extraction capping cooperation this is the case of the personal characteristics of the participants such as age or years of education or socio physical variables such as time before exhaustion and well depth however gender did not show any relation see annex v1 table 11 regarding the social variables under the control of the participants such as water allocation to the present water allocation to the future or water left to the community and the decision to follow extraction caps are significant also in terms of personal characteristics such as age years of education and gender some relationships with the decision to follow the cap exist see table 3 another relevant topic has to do with justifying the use of the logistic regression procedure instead of the classical ordinary least regression ols this is relevant for the case since the chosen model restricts the type of statistical analysis than can be done on the data annex 1i graph 2 and graph 3 illustrate the different ways the models fit the data in expressing the willingness to conform to extraction capping the dependent variable is expressed only in terms of 0 or 1 a data pattern that ols is not able to capture contrarily logistic regression is able to model the data cloud around 0 or 1 c measures of fitness another important topic that demands careful attention refers to scalar measures of fitness the use of adequate statistics to check the goodness of the developed econometric model is assessed thus in explaining the drivers of the adaptive water management system the question on which model provides a better explanation of the causal relationships is addressed the classical statistic r2 which is usually employed in logistic regressions is not convenient for different reasons that are beyond the scope of this research an alternative approach to model fitness evaluation and comparison corresponds to information criteria which are log likelihood in nature and can have adjustable degrees of freedom in general the model with the smallest information criterion is preferred the essential intuition is that there is tension between model fitness as measured by the maximized log likelihood value and the principle of parsimony which favors a simple model although model fitness can be improved by increasing model complexity parameters are only added if the resulting improvement in fitness sufficiently compensates the loss of parsimony based on information measures the bayesian information criterion bic and the akaike information criterion aic have become common model selection tools see table 9 measures of fit for logit of followcap quantity treatment group and table 10 measures of fit for logit of followcap time treatment group in selecting the model a comparison is made between two model types which are separately presented to the remaining quantity and time before exhaustion treatment groups remaining quantity treatment group measures of fitness the first model only incorporated physical variables to explain the adoption of cooperative behavior as an adaptive management approach to water scarcity see table 5 in other words it considers that only environmental variables such as well depth and water availability lead water users to adapt to scarcity similarly two personal factors were included to explain the dependent variable the key variable determining adaptive water management corresponded to well depth for its part the variable years of education was found to negatively influence adaptive management at a 10 significance level the second model contemplates socio physical variables neighbor extraction level is significant at a 1 significance level and so is years of education time living in the community is relevant at 5 significance regarding water allocation time preferences the present and the future were observed to be dominant at a 10 level of significance whereas allocation to neighbors was not significant see table 5 in this context model fitness constitutes the selection criterion in the comparison between the bayesian information and akaike information criteria table 8 since the smallest criterion is preferred the differences between the information criteria offer a direct response for model selection in this case model 2 socio physical variables provides a better explanation of adaptive water management since a 5 336 difference between the two models in the bic supports model 2 time before exhaustion treatment group measures of fitness turning to the measures of fitness for the time before exhaustion treatment group a comparison between the physical and socio physical models was also carried out in this case 281 observations were used to build models 1 and 2 in the first model none of the explanatory variables were significant contrarily in the case of the socio physical model three relevant variables accounted for the complexity of the definition of the model time living in the community was found to positively influence the adoption of cooperative behavior towards water conservation at a 1 significance level this means that the longer a person has been living in the territory the more they will tend to conserve water resources in turn time before exhaustion was observed to negatively affect the desired outcome at a 5 level of significance additionally the income level of the participants was significant as well meaning that the more people earn the less likely they are to follow a cooperative strategy aimed at complying with extraction caps see table 6 according to the information criterion the model representing the physical variables provides a better explanation of the likeliness to adopt cooperative behavior notwithstanding a decision had to be made in terms of the capacity of the studied variables to account for a causal relationship between the explanatory and dependent variables according to table 9 a difference of 7 13 in the bic supports model 1 however table 6 shows how the variables differ in terms of significance level in both models in the socio physical model four explanatory variables were highly significant at 1 and 5 significance levels however in the first model only the constant was found to be significant which might be disregarded because it does not account for any causal relationship thus there is contrast between the information criterion and the significance of the variables for this reason model 2 was selected to carry out a deeper econometric analysis on these grounds determining the marginal effect of a change in a regressor on the conditional probability that y i 1 provides some interesting research clues the conditional probability is given by p i pr y i 1 x f x i β where x represents the regressors and β refers to the coefficients as shown in tables 5 and 6 for the general probability of this model on p i and a change in regressor j t h the marginal effect is pr y i 1 x i x i j f x i β β j cameron c trivedi 2005 greene 2003 3 1 the marginal effects the overall probability of y i 1 is 92 given that all predictors are set to their mean values as presented in table 6 however chances are to present the marginal effect on explained variable when independent variables are set at specific values for instance enquires might be defined on how the probability to adopt a cooperative behavior might change when the well depth changes from the mean value 42 7 m to 100 m or more the effect of more literate farmers or more affluent families might be modeled as well similarly marginal effects of a change of one additional unit of continuous or categorical variables might be of interest also see table 11 in annex as shown in the equation above the derivative expresses that the marginal effect corresponds to a probability change which takes place when the independent variable x i j increases by one unit as shown in table 11 in the quantity treatment group one additional year in the time living in the community variable reduces the probability to adopt cooperative behavior by almost 0 2 for each additional 1000 m3 of water that neighbors extract individuals increase the probability to follow the cooperative strategy by 4 for individuals preferring to allocate more water to the present the probability of a cooperative behavior decreases by 10 and a similar effect is observed in farmers preferring to allocate more water to the future as to the years of education variable each additional year of schooling reduces this probability by 1 3 in the time treatment group time living in the community has a positive effect on the adoption on cooperative behavior the probability of which increases by 0 1 per each additional year of life in the territory in this group the effect of income level has a negative significant effect table 7 shows the corresponding ols regression parameters each additional year lived in the community helps to increase the probability of cooperation in almost 0 0016 units for the time before exhaustion and remaining quantity treatment groups and each additional income unit reduces this probability in a small fraction however the main departure from logistic models refers to the insignificant effect that the time preferences have on the probabilities of cooperation in general ols models do not fit the data properly since less than 14 of the models are explained by the observations with respect to the marginal effect of one additional unit in the explanatory variables graph 1 illustrates the relevance of this effect when it comes to explaining the adoption of the cooperative behavior in question this example only shows this effect in the time before exhaustion treatment group the deeper the water well is the lesser the probabilities of cooperation with water conservation notwithstanding this effect changes with time before exhaustion which together with remaining water quantity actually limit aquifer resource extraction thus the marginal probabilities change depending on whether one assumes 5 15 or 30 years before aquifer exhaustion as expected when the participants knew that the aquifer system would last 5 years business as usual extraction patterns there was a 96 probability of cooperative behavior in the 10 m 250 m well depth interval however this probability dropped to 90 in the 500 m 650 m interval and to less than 80 when well depth approached 900 m in the control group allocations of water to the present and to the future were close in terms of volumes in the second half of total rounds average future assignments were slightly higher than present extractions see graph 4 in control groups intertemporal allocation preferences were not fully revealed by farmers participating in experiments in addition to this in this group the well depth variable played a role in the probability to abide by the cap see table 7 for the quantity treatment group in order of preference farmers adapt by assigning more water to the present during almost the whole experimental sessions meanwhile allocation to the future remained in second place unlike the control group during half of the experimental sessions farmers allocated almost 30 more of the cpr to the present than to the future at the start of the second half of the rounds farmers revealed abrupt responses to quantity declinations and almost doubled their allocation to the future see graph 5 in both control and quantity treatment groups allocation to neighbors shows a preference for non egoistic behavior in treatment group water allocations displayed a more elaborated decision making the intertemporal allocations seemed to be pondered since more information was provided to players participating in treatment groups when an aquifer system is alleged to last 30 years more the adoption of cooperative behavior surrounds 70 in the 10 m 60 m well depth interval but this probability falls to 50 when well depths reach 340 m 440 m additionally cooperation to preserve water resources drops to less than 20 when water well depths are higher than 800 m in the case of aquifers that are expected to last for 15 years the probability to adopt cooperative behavior is 93 in shallow wells less than 40 m depths while it drops to 90 when depths reach 150 m 200 m a strepitous decay in cooperative behavior from 76 to 54 is observed when water wells are between 600 m 900 m deep these marginal effect results can be clearer with an example situation in which water well depth is 100 m and hydro economic information on time before aquifer exhaustion is available observing graph 1 the probabilities to cooperate with aquifer conservation are 67 and 96 for 30 and 5 years before exhaustion respectively in 500 m well depths the probabilities drop from 92 to 46 when there are 5 and 30 years left before exhaustion respectively 4 discussion individual and community cooperation in adaptation to water scarcity is not straightforward different factors influence people s willingness to adapt to climate change related effects on water availability adaptation is studied here using conceptual instruments aimed at signaling water scarcity instead of studying if people relying on groundwater adapt to status quo or projected climate conditions a step forward is suggested in order to connect adaptation to sustainability for this aim water scarcity is operationalized through the binding limits of nature thus an extraction cap was suggested to the participants in the experimental sessions as a substitute for abstract situations in which experiment participants are asked to allocate tokens cardenas et al 2011 fischbacher et al 2001 gächter 2007 keser and van winden 2000 the type of good at stake and the group of subjects in this research are closely related to the research purpose harrison and list 2004 this is water units and real rural water users mostly farmers were recruited instead of university students who might not be familiar with the problem of aquifer overdraft and the deepest social problems of water scarcity extraction capping is a recently claimed approach to adapt to declining water resources by managing both water footprints and the contradiction of water use efficiency improvement grafton et al 2018 a hoekstra 2020 a y hoekstra 2013 in this respect the literature review registers few similar water extraction capping experiments to the present one threshold game models usually investigate if thresholds increase contributions ceteris paribus ledyard 1995 stock quota games which are closer to extraction capping have been used to address different issues such as the problem of competition and the strategic externality effects of cpr systems gardner et al 1997 furthermore the concept of annual quota has been suggested by those who have taken a closer look at the aquifer conservation approach smith 1977 in order to define rights over annual groundwater recharges hence extraction caps and quotas should be concocted to address the evident problem of aquifer overexploitation which is pervasive around the world based on this topic both caps and quotas should be consequent with the urgent need to avert overexploitation and recommend adequate extraction rates for this aim another modification respect to extant cpr studies on cooperation lies on the type of binding limits suggested to players in the experiments on top of the capping assumptions two information treatment groups were formed time before exhaustion and remaining water quantity were employed as limiting categories to which players were able to react differently the results indicate that cooperative behavior is more complex than just allocating a higher fraction that the one a nash equilibrium would define andreoni 1995 cardenas et al 2011 gardner et al 1997 instead it is delimited by social behavioral and institutional settings all of which might trigger the decision to conform to extraction capping thus cooperation drivers are related to socio physical variables which are in turn capable of configuring a decision making model an overarching finding on cooperation under the influence of extraction capping refers to the complexity of the interactions between those socio physical variables that explain cooperative behavior more general studies led by outstanding scholars state that cooperation is explained by reciprocity axelrod and william 1981 axelrod 1984 gächter 2007 hamilton 1964 trust on others cox 2004 ostrom 1997 communication easiness abrahamse and steg 2013 m a janssen et al 2010 m janssen lee and tyson 2014 ostrom et al 1994 sally 1995 and the ability of communities to devise proper rule systems isaac et al 1994 ostrom 2015 1990 and thus manage natural resources autonomously among others an in depth analysis of cooperation drivers under extraction capping suggests a more elaborated set of explanatory variables water availability plays a role in cooperation together with well depth in both cases the marginal effect is negative in the first case the perception of plentifulness may not activate cooperation since individuals might perceive that scarcity is still far similar results have been found when crop choice is linked to groundwater exhaustion which actually leads farmers to cooperate meinzen dick et al 2016 in the second case the deeper the well is the lesser the probability of cooperation because this parameter is perceived as the socio physical realization of scarcity another relevant variable corresponds to time living in the community in the time treatment group this variable was found to be significantly positive while in the water quantity group a negative effect was observed living in the territory for almost 30 years have set the conditions to build a connection with the territory and understand the water stocks and flows while interacting with neighboring farmers in these interactions enough time have elapsed to get rules of adaptation to scarcity built besides the socio cultural connection with the territory has a dissimilar impact on the possibilities of cooperation when water users are informed about the remaining time before aquifer exhaustion the time they have lived in the dry region plays a role in deciding whether to adapt or not to water scarcity by conforming to a water extraction cap however this adaptation is permeated by socio cultural values in time treatment situation farmers bring their past and present socio cultural heritage and values to the game and goes far from physical dimension of the problem similarly in their revealed future allocations of water during the games those customs are made patent as well since farmers belong to communities where they have lived for long time capping situations use to challenge the persistence of such a socio cultural tradition farmers by interacting with institutions gather information by learning about others and their actions and about the consequences of interacting within a specific set of rules cárdenas and ostrom 2005 notwithstanding working rules and institutions reflect hidden social and cultural values configuring communities actions and choices in water management which might be supportive or against program implementation meinzen dick et al 2016 van der voorn 2008 in this time treatment group other hidden social aspects are also revealed in respect to the intertemporal water allocations when farmers are asked about allocating water volumes for the future consumption impatience rates uncertainty cultural ties with the community and the territory are brought to their decision making scene a long term oriented society strives to achieve congruence with its variable environment van der voorn 2008 based on the marginal effect of time before aquifer exhaustion on the decision to conform to the cap this long term orientation is adjusted by the how far this future is and how scarce the water resource is becoming for people living over shallow aquifers when this resource is alleged to last 30 more years the probabilities of cooperation by conforming to the cap surrounds 70 but this probability plummets to 20 when water well depths are higher than 800 m thus cooperative behavior by conforming to the cap is possible even when long term uncertainty in water availability exists therefore decisions made by farmers in respect to abiding by a cap is consistent with the necessity of others to afford to water resources as well as suggested by van der voorn 2008 a collectivistic instead of an individualistic rationale might be present in these communities since strong ties may reinforce collectives thinking where everyone takes responsibility for fellow members of their group in the water quantity group the neighbors extraction level positively impacted the likelihood of cooperation the more water the neighbor was assumed to extract the more the individuals were willing to conform to capping this reflects a departure from reciprocal behavior falk et al 2002 milinski et al 2002 ostrom 1998 since the more water the neighbors were assumed to extract the more the individuals restricted their own extraction therefore under water scarcity conditions individuals preferred to adapt by restraining their own extraction instead of retaliating because of neighbors non cooperative behavior thus it can be said that climate change effects on the water related dimensions of development stimulate cooperation perhaps because of the woes and incumbrances entailed by water scarcity the key practical implication of neighbors extraction under the time before exhaustion and quantity treatments refers to the positive effect that this parameter had in stimulating cooperation to adapt to scarcity conditions thus water managers and policy makers are suggested to include the collection and dissemination of key socio physical information on time before aquifer exhaustion remaining underground water quantities and neighbors extraction rates despite the fact that information sharing is complex to manage this can be accomplished through innovative technological devices to make user consumption data and hydrogeological aquifer status more visible and accessible to all water users in each vicinity thus the key drivers of cooperation can be turned into institutional information working for cooperation in our adaptation to climate change finally socio economic factors halting adaptation to climate change might be managed with institutional and physical mechanisms however water availability exerts stringent limitations for livelihoods or farming ishaya s abaje 2008 komba c muchapondwa 2012 thus given the vital character of water its availability should not only be an explanatory variable in adaptation to declining water stocks but an issue subjected to socio physical explanations about said adaptation 5 conclusions this research is focused on presenting the empirical evidence on the drivers and inhibitors of adaptive groundwater management the empirical research results are mostly quantitative data used for the analysis were drawn from framed field experiments run in 10 small communities belonging to 3 municipalities of colombia the geographical setting corresponds to dry areas exposed to frequent droughts water shortages and high dependence on aquifer systems field experiments were organized in two treatment information groups namely time before exhaustion and remaining water quantity treatments these were used to differentiate the water allocation decision making process when binding limits exist another justification for delimiting the experimental sessions refers to the fact that field experiments are aimed at finding collective action alternatives when institutional settings differ the more field experiments resemble real life situations the better they will recreate practical decision making thus water table declinations and aquifer overexploitation which are real situations faced by water users have been practically addressed by the current experiments in order to capture and recreate socio physical models of reality for this reason the participants in the experiments were asked to allocate water when time before aquifer exhaustion is made public and when the remaining water quantity in aquifers is declining as observed in daily life empirical models in the time before exhaustion and quantity treatment groups were tested using the information criterion to assess regression fitness a contrast was established between physical and socio physical models to assess how the independent variables better explain the dependent variable the latter which refers to the ability of people to adopt cooperative behavior in conserving water resources was measured via the probability to comply with extraction capping the cap is consequent with the need to incorporate the limited water available units into water management systems the empirical results show that socio physical models provide a more comprehensive explanation of the drivers and inhibitors of cooperation in the remaining quantity treatment groups the longer the people have lived in the territory the less inclined they are to cooperate since one additional year reduces the probability to adopt cooperative behavior by almost 0 2 contrarily in the time before exhaustion treatment group this relationship was positively significant since one additional year living in the community was observed to increase the likelihood of cooperation by 0 1 the inter temporal preferences of water allocation were found to be significant but a clear pattern was not found in effect cooperation likeliness declined by 10 in individuals preferring to allocate water to the present or the future additional years of education did not produce the expected result since one additional year of education reduces the probability to cooperate by 1 3 in the remaining quantity group special attention was paid to the marginal effect of some variables on cooperation likeliness marginal changes in this probability were plotted against both well depth and time before aquifer exhaustion the marginal effect is a step forward from using averages for water planning if a groundwater management plan is put in place the marginal characteristics of well depth and time before aquifer exhaustion have implications for the success of management strategies differentiations should be made in terms of well depth where farmers live the probability of adopting cooperative behavior is not the same if farmers are located over a 50 m 100 m or 500 m deep water well for instance two communities led to assume they had 30 years left before aquifer exhaustion showed contrasting probabilities of cooperation 72 to and 62 in connection with well depth which was respectively 50 and 200 m these empirical results have implications when it comes to finding options for achieving sustainable development goals especially sdg 6 which is related to water use efficiency water management cooperation drivers have a bearing on efficient water use the behavioral effects that the time before exhaustion and remaining quantity approaches have on water extraction should not be overlooked if efficient water withdrawal is pursued before water is used efficiently water withdrawal should be reduced to benchmark levels these reductions are not easily attained if well depth and information on aquifer duration are not geographically contextualized within water management strategies even though the current research strategy addressed groundwater as a specific cpr it provides theoretical elements for other cpr settings such as forests fisheries and irrigation systems which are also affected by resource use dilemmas however in order to make a better contribution to the understanding of the drivers of adaptation to scarcity in other cpr more effort should be made to overcome the limitations of this research a longitudinal experimental approach was planned but the covid 19 pandemic made it impossible at this time thus more rounds of experimental sessions are suggested more field experiments with the same communities would be helpful to measure how stable the cooperation was in groundwater conservation under extraction caps from the other side varying the extraction cap level might be helpful to measure the effects of caps and thresholds on level and effectiveness of cooperation on the other hand it was not possible to introduce extraction cap level variations due to limited participant payment funds since the calculation of the extraction cap was based on agricultural activity consumption figures further research aimed at filling these gaps is suggested in the context of widespread non compliance with environmental rules or free riding further research should be focused in deepening individuals decision making processes under more barefaced free riding to see to what extent tolerance and patience are overtaken similarly another socio cultural dimension related to religious faith should be included as explanatory qualitative and quantitative variables since faith based organizations and individual faith may guide people to practice more

mechanism to motivate the participation and to connect it with the market system in which every decision implies economic consequences see third column in illustration 1 most field experiments pay individuals based on their earnings during the game in line with the principles of experimental economics a real substantial incentive is provided for the decisions to be made yielding the corresponding payoffs keser and van winden 2000 meinzen dick et al 2016 participants were instructed that in each decision round they were asked to contribute to prevent aquifer deterioration before making the decisions they were informed in regard of aquifer physical characteristics and the water extraction caps to promote sustainability and avoid exhaustion of the cpr as shown in illustration 2 participants decided whether following the expected cap or consuming their preferred water quantity participants were told that the announced cap was a suggested one but not a mandatory rule annex v

11756,this study aims to analyze rainfall data series of four hydrometric stations in a mountainous context in morocco over the period 1970 2017 periods of disruption were identified through statistical approaches based on rupture detection the pettitt test the bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian and the buishand test the results show that the studied series are characterized by several breaks which indicate a variation in the overall trend of the rainfall regime during 1980 1995 2000 and around 2010 in addition a diagnostic of dry and wet years is carried out by applying the standardized precipitation index spi a prolonged period of drought was observed from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of several short term rainy events such as in 1994 1996 and the early 2000s the variability of spring discharge indicates an evolution consistent with that of rainfall the largest decrease in flow rates was recorded during the period from 1980 to 1993 in addition periods of abrupt increases were identified with a maximum recorded in 1994 1996 the phase opposition showed a marked consistency between the north atlantic oscillation nao the spi and the variability of spring discharge which provides an overview of the influence of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and consequently on the availability of water resources in the area graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate variability rainfall dynamics spring water flows dynamics statistical analysis drought 1 introduction recently climate variability in morocco has become a major concern in many debates on development strategies schilling et al 2012 hssaisoune et al 2020 in morocco the notion of climate variability and water resource scarcity is not a recent phenomenon the rainfall distribution has been studied since the 1940s through the research studies conducted by emberger 1955 where the first rainfall maps of morocco were produced these were supplemented by other authors meko 1985 badri et al 1994 revealing that the climate in morocco is irregular with two distinct seasons i a wet season from october to april when almost all of the rainy episodes take place and accounting for 86 92 of the annual rainfall and ii a dry season from may to september with only 8 14 of the annual rainfall thereafter several authors have attempted to analyze the rainfall variability safi 1990 bouchaou et al 1997 2017 amraoui et al 2004 stour and agoumi 2009 chamchati and bahir 2011 sebbar et al 2012 babqiqi 2014 all of these works have confirmed that recent decades have been characterized by a net irregularity in the distribution of precipitation and highlighted a significant decrease in rainfall inputs since 1980 with significant depletion in the quantity and deterioration in the quality of water resources yacoubi 2001 sinan et al 2009 babqiqi and messouli 2013 sinan and belhouji 2016 furthermore during the past few decades morocco has also experienced storms with extreme rainfall and higher volumes of rain in short time periods resulting in significant human losses and economic damage e g ourika valley in 1995 and casablanca rabat in 2002 daoudi and saidi 2008 the geographical situation of morocco in the subtropical subsidence belt generates a climate mainly regulated by the combination of two main poles of influence the azores anticyclone and the saharan depression schilling et al 2012 agoussine 2003 this situation between two climatic belts one temperate in the north and the other tropical in the south leads to a large spatio temporal variability of the climate with a rainfall pattern that fluctuates from more than 1000 mm per year on the northern reliefs to less than 25 mm on the desert plains in the south sebbar et al 2011 ait brahim et al 2017 large scale atmospheric circulation patterns further contribute to the understanding of this variability one such pattern is the north atlantic oscillation nao which depicts a broad oscillation of the atmospheric mass between the north atlantic regions of the subtropical anti cyclone close to the azores and the sub polar low pressure system around iceland corte real et al 1995 previous studies have shown that the nao index significantly influences the rainfall regime in the mediterranean region hurrell 1995 wanner et al 2001 knippertz et al 2003 driouech 2010 lópez moreno et al 2011 kjellström 2016 hence a judicious understanding of the consistency between the nao index rainfall and discharge patterns could improve the understanding of climate variability in connection with water resource availability in climatology the statistical analysis of time series is a key element to detect potential changes in hydro climatic patterns in morocco most research based on statistical tests for the detection of modifications in climatic patterns have been conducted at broad national and regional scales sebbar et al 2011 2012 knippertz et al 2003 driouech 2010 aoubouazza and rajel 2013 filahi et al 2015 bouaich and benabdelfadel 2010 zhao et al 2019 recently investigations have focused on the catchment scale with a special focus on rainfall to address the various challenges facing the moroccan water sector which are widely different from one basin to another zamrane et al 2016 seif ennasr et al 2017 abahous et al 2017 ouatiki et al 2019 in the current study the focus is on the mountainous area of oum er rabiaa basin in order to clearly identify the extent of climate variability and its impact on the availability of water resources we note that the climate variability in this area is poorly understood moreover it is important to point out that climatic fluctuations are likely to induce several forms of damage notably on the socioeconomic level the mountainous areas are one of the most sensitive contexts and slight changes in climate have a serious impact on the availability of water resources thus generating a real obstacle for all development strategies and influencing the vital sectors of activity agriculture tourism parish and funnell 1999 balaghi et al 2013 taking into consideration all of these issues the link between climate variability rainfall distribution and water resource availability requires consideration not only as a natural event that must be endured but as a phenomenon that needs to be examined and explained in this study the use of statistical approaches in the analysis of annual rainfall and spring discharge time series allows recognition of the variability of rainfall patterns and its impact on the flow fluctuations the expected information regarding dry and wet sequences and their temporal evolution could provide a key element for decision makers and managers for the elaboration of strategies and policies to preserve and manage water resources of the area 2 study area 2 1 general location the study area corresponds to the upper basin of oum er rabiaa covering an area of about 3400 km2 it is located in the south western part of the middle atlas mountains in the province of khenifra and drained by oum er rabiaa the largest river in morocco the geographical coordinates range from the longitudes 5 05 and 5 50 west and the latitudes 32 35 and 33 north fig 1 the basin is characterized by a complex morphology and structure due to the existence of tabular and rugged areas the maximum altitude reaches 2400 m above sea level m a s l at hayane mountain the annual rainfall in the oum er rabiaa basin varies from 800 mm in the upstream middle atlas mountains to 300 mm in the downstream part with an average of 500 mm snow cover occurs on average on 20 days year above an elevation of 800 m a s l the temperature values vary between 10 and 50 c and the potential evaporation is around 2000 mm year with a maximum of 300 mm in july and august oum er rbiaa hydraulic basin agency 2009 the high temperatures and the lack of precipitation in summer as well as the high evaporation rates highlight the important water needs in this area 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics 2 2 1 surface water in terms of hydrology this area is an important water reservoir with an extensive hydrographic network comprising the oum er rabiaa river and its main tributaries srou chbouka and ouaoumana fig 1 2 2 2 groundwater the upper basin of oum er rabiaa contains an aquifer system consisting mainly of several springs of varying discharge and quality the fresh springs are the most abundant 600 m3 s with a mineralization rate generally lower than 0 5 g l these are mainly exploited for drinking water supply and irrigation the second group is of poor quality 17 g l with a lower flow rate 0 15 m3 s oum er rbiaa hydraulic basin agency 2009 2 3 sub basins the study area includes the oum er rabiaa river and its tributaries the hydrographic network is represented linearly by hydraulic axes cut into sections to which the elementary watersheds have been associated this hydrographic division was carried out using the topographic maps of khenifra and mrirt at a scale of 1 100 000 ministry of equipment transport logistics and water 1965 in such a manner that all runoff waters converge towards the main river of oum er rabiaa the study area is subdivided into four sub basins as shown in fig 1 the sub basin of oum er rabiaa located in the north is the largest with a surface area of about 1400 km2 it intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of tarhat and its contribution to the total river flow is estimated at around 46 the middle part is occupied by the chbouka sub basin which intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of el heri and has a surface area of about 186 km2 the srou sub basin intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of chacha nmellah and covers the southern part of the study area with a surface area of roughly 1066 km2 with an important contribution estimated at about 38 of the total flow the ouaoumana in the far west of the study area with a surface area of about 766 km2 intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of taghzout 3 meteorological data the main data employed in this study are rainfall and spring discharge time series and the nao climate index 3 1 rainfall and spring discharge data the precipitation and spring discharge data used in this study are complete data series and the oldest recorded climate variables for the studied region for this reason they are important indicators on which this hydro climatic variation study was based several additional reasons justify the focus on these two parameters i rainfall is the most powerful parameter in the analysis of climate variability assani 1999 barbé et al 2002 halmstad et al 2012 ii rainfall plays a determining role in the sustainable planning and management of water resources in hydrological basins particularly in the management of flood risks and the size of dams and iii because agriculture is the major activity practiced by the local population and the surface water of oum er rabiaa river is the unique source of irrigation in the area a statistical description of the rainfall is shown in table 1 the minimum values recorded during the studied period range between 75 and 193 mm while the maximum values fluctuate between 511 and 600 mm the coefficient of variation varies between 33 and 52 indicating that the studied rainfall series are characterized by a significant inter annual variation 3 2 nao climate index the north atlantic oscillation nao index is generally measured as the difference in atmospheric pressure between the north atlantic regions of the subtropical anticyclone close to the azores and the sub polar low pressure system around iceland corte real et al 1995 the nao index values used in the current study were retrieved from the national weather service s website https www cpc ncep noaa gov products precip cwlink pna norm nao monthly b5001 current ascii table accessed on 02 march 2020 4 problematic and method fig 2 shows graphical representations of the studied rainfall series for all series it is noted that there is a global downward trend in rainfall and the slopes of the regression lines show negative values ranging from 1 88 to 0 52 however the main question proposed at the beginning of this study is do these slope values observed on the distributions of rainfall time series meaningfully reflect the climate reality this question is particularly relevant in a climatic context characterized by abrupt and extreme events which influence the rainfall regime and the real evolutionary trends fig 3 highlights the significant inter annual variability in rainfall and spring discharge the flows are low in the years in which recorded rainfall was less than 250 mm 1982 1990 and 2012 in addition it can be seen that the wet periods are sudden events with very short durations not exceeding 3 4 years nevertheless there is a significant increase in water flows during these short periods such as in the wettest year of 1994 1995 this first assessment therefore requires a careful consideration of the relationship between the rainfall regime and the spring discharge in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa considering the context outlined above the present study is based on the analysis of sub period dynamics using a set of indicators that make it possible on one hand to highlight the different evolutionary trends existing within the series and the fluctuations around the central tendency and on the other hand to separate the impact of extreme events all of these considerations fully justify the use of the statistical methods in this study in order to identify the hydro climatic fluctuations throughout statistical distribution assumptions 4 1 basic principle of break detection a statistical approach to detect breaks is used in this work to analyze the chronological precipitation series and identify the periods of their disruption a break is defined by a change in the probability law of the random variables whose successive realizations define the chronological precipitation series lubes et al 1994 the statistical approach adopted in this work provides a better characterization and identification of the pivotal sub episodes of the climate fluctuations their adoption in the current study is justified beyond their robustness by their successful implementation in various previous studies aka et al 1996 paturel et al 1997 servat et al 1997 shanshan et al 2019 hanane et al 2020 kanani et al 2020 4 2 statistical tests the significance of breaks depends mainly on the tests that have detected the change in series a break detected by a single test indicates a lower probability of a break or an event with low amplitude a probable break means that it is detected by at least two statistical tests a certain break means that it is detected by all the tests thus indicating a high probability of a break or a large amplitude event 4 2 1 pettitt statistical test the pettitt approach is derived from the mann whitney test the pettitt test considers a sequence of independent random variables x1 x2 xn the use of the test supposes that for any time t with a value between 1 and n a break occurs if the distribution function f1 x of the random variables xi i 1to t is different from the distribution function f2 x of the random variables xi i t 1 to n pettitt 1979 demarée 1990 sutherland et al 1991 vannitsem and demarée 1991 to identify the point of disturbance a statistical analysis is performed by calculating the index ut n which is defined as follows l hote et al 2002 1 u t n i 1 t j t 1 n d i j 2 di j sgn x sgn x i x j with sgn x 1 if x 0 1 if x 0 0 if x 0 k n is the variable defined by the maximum absolute values of u t n for t varying from 1 to n and k designates the value of k n taken from the studied series under the null hypothesis the probability of exceeding the value k according to a two sided test is given by the following equation rosine et al 2014 3 prob k n k 2 exp 6 k 2 n 3 n 2 given a certain significance level α if prob 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected then an estimation of the date of the break is provided by the moment t defining the maximum in absolute terms of the ut n variable xie et al 2013 4 k t max u t n 4 2 2 bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian this procedure is applied under the assumption that the studied series is normally distributed the method aims to confirm or disprove the hypothesis of a change in the mean of the studied series lee and heghinian 1977 bruneau and rassam 1983 chaouche 1988 the basic model of the procedure is as follows 5 x i n x i μ 1 σ 2 i 1 τ x i n x i μ δ σ 2 i τ 1 n where x i is a random variable with characteristic data of mean μ and variance σ 2 at the moment i n τ and δ represent respectively the length of the observation the position of the break in time and the amplitude of the change in the mean taking into account their a priori distributions and supposing that the break time follows a uniform distribution the method therefore defines the a posteriori probability distribution 4 2 3 buishand test the buishand statistic is derived from an original formulation given by gardner 1969 the gardner statistic used for a two tailed test of the break in the mean is written 6 g k 1 n 1 p k s k σ x 2 where pk designates the probability that the break will occur after k observations the terms sk and σx represent the partial sum and the standard deviation defined by the following equations respectively 7 s k i 1 k x i x for k 1 n and σ x i 1 n x i x n finally the buishand u statistic is defined as follows buishand 1982 8 u k 1 n 1 s k σ x 2 n n 1 it should be noted that the test allows the construction of a control ellipse associated with a confidence threshold consisting of a graphical complement to buishand s u statistic the limits of the ellipse are based on the sum of cumulative deviations from average sk the series sk follows a normal distribution with a variance defined as follows bois 1971 1986 9 σ 2 k n k n where n is the length of the observation and k is the number of observations k 1 to n it is therefore possible to plot the confidence intervals of these cumulative deviations for a given confidence level 1 α 2 then the confidence thresholds are defined as follows 10 u 1 α 2 k n k n 1 in this study the control ellipse was used to graphically assess the importance of deviations breaks 4 3 drought severity 4 3 1 dry and wet sub periods the standardized precipitation index spi was designed to study drought or humidity at different time scales for a defined area mckee et al 1993 it was officially adopted and recommended in 2012 by the world meteorological organization wmo as a tool for calculating the distribution of dry and wet cycles world meteorological organization 2012 to calculate the spi index it is necessary to have monthly rainfall data covering a period of at least 20 years guttman 1994 for this study the index was calculated according to the following procedure firstly the monthly data for the monitored period 1970 2017 were adjusted to a gamma probability distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution mckee et al 1995 edwards and mckee 1997 zarei and eslamian 2017 to identify the intensity of dry and wet episodes it is possible to refer to the classification shown below table 2 mckee et al 1993 a drought period occurs when the index has continuously negative values whereas wet periods are characterized by positive values it should be noted that for this study the calculation was made according to a 12 month scale this made it possible to compare the precipitation for 12 consecutive months with that recorded in the same 12 consecutive months in all previous years of the available data the calculation of the index according to this range made it possible to associate the information provided by the index with trends and anomalies in the study area s spring discharges 4 3 2 seasonal variation the monthly rainfall index method was applied in order to assess the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern this method has the advantage of highlighting the periods of abundance and deficit in rainfall regime at a monthly scale the monthly rainfall index is defined by the following equation odekunle 2005 11 i xi xm σ where xi is the precipitation recorded in month i xm is the inter monthly average precipitation values over the considered period and σ is the standard deviation corresponding to the root mean square of the deviations from the mean value of precipitation recorded during the considered period 4 3 3 hydrological drought the method allows a distinction to be made between wet and dry periods through the fluctuations of the water flow regime the model is based on the deviations ec occurring between the annual qma and the inter annual qmi mean flows according to the following formula probst 1989 haida et al 1999 12 e c q m a q m i q m i x 100 wet periods are marked by positive values of ec ec 0 while the negative values ec 0 indicate dry periods probst 1989 4 4 sub period dynamics annual analysis of the rainfall time series available in this basin was used to place the climate variability in a historical perspective the precession of this information and its assessment allows the identification of the alternation of dry and wet sub periods in order to clearly define the connection between the rainfall variability and the water resource availability in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa the fluctuation rates of the hydro climatic variables on both sides of the identified breaks were calculated using the following equation mestre 2000 13 d x j x i 1 where d is the variation rate x j is the sub period average after the break and x i is the sub period average before the break the units of x i and x j were expressed in mm for rainfall data and l s for spring discharges 5 results 5 1 rainfall dynamics 5 1 1 pettitt test the statistical analysis using the pettitt test allowed the definition of the rainfall dynamics in the four monitoring stations the main finding is that the appearance of the curves varies with sudden and clear changes according to the principle of the test a time series is considered homogeneous if it does not contain any fluctuation points in contrast a break is defined by a sudden change in the probability distribution at a given time this change is marked by positive peaks pointing to a maximum value of the pettitt u statistic and indicating the onset of a significant change in the rainfall dynamics conversely minimum values indicate that the series tends to regain the central tendency xie et al 2013 hawkins 2001 in this way the entire series is segmented into several sub periods according to the location of the fluctuation points the indications of the different change points are illustrated in fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the years 1980 1993 1994 2001 and 2010 triggered the beginning of a change in the rainfall dynamics it can also be noted that the most significant breaks are those produced in 1980 and the early 2000s where the values of pettitt s u statistic reached u umax implying a significant decrease in the rainfall pattern on the other hand it is clearly noted that the ruptures occurred in the mid 1990s and around 2010 are pursued by negative values below the zero u line indicating that the rainfall series were able to reach the central trend as a result of an intensification of rainfall in a relatively short period of time storm events which made it possible to compensate the deviation with respect to the distribution function pettitt 1979 5 1 2 bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian fig 5 shows the results of the application of the lee and heghinian method the years of break are defined by calculating the break probabilities throughout the monitoring period it appears that the density of probability follows a similar trend and that the breaks occur in a specific dates in the studied stations for the results presented in fig 5 the maximum mode of the distribution of the probability density is used as the breakpoint estimate booth and smith 1982 szentimrey 1996 graphically it can be noted that the values classes are potentially concentrated in the early 1980s and around 2002 and 2010 indicating a significant change in the means compared to the stationary model of the studied series lee and heghinian 1977 it can also be noted that a slight change in the probability density is shown in the mid 1990s in both el heri and tarhat stations implying the occurrence of an event of short duration which allowed the series to balance the average and restore the stationary pattern 5 1 3 buishand test the application of the buishand test with the positioning of a control ellipse allowed the monitoring of the rainfall regime variability and definition of the years of break for this test the break periods correspond to the positive peaks indicating a trend reversal in the precipitation time series according to the graphical representation fig 6 it is noted that for all the studied stations the breaks with the most significant confidence level are those produced in the early 1980s and 2000s and around 2010 with a confidence threshold ranging from 90 to 95 on the other hand it is clear that the event occurring in the mid 1990s can be considered a break but at a lower confidence level than the other breaks this could be explained by the fact that this break corresponds to an event of very short duration but which nonetheless sufficiently influenced the global trend of the studied series bois 1971 1986 alexandersson 1986 throughout the monitoring period of 1970 2017 the curves presenting the results of the statistical tests have the same shape and synchronization which means that the different methods used in this work indicate similar evolutional trends across the upper basin of oum er rabiaa fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the point clouds for the different breaks which helps to clearly identify the years of major breaks according to this graphical representation the four break years of 1980 1995 2000 and 2010 were most clearly detected by the statistical tests 5 2 drought severity 5 2 1 dry and wet sub periods the calculation of the standardized precipitation index spi allowed the identification of the distribution of dry and wet sub periods in the study area fig 8 as well as the frequencies of dry and wet years for the whole monitoring period fig 9 the main findings can be summarized as follows the first sub period can be considered a normal period starting in 1970 with an spi index balanced between negative and positive values this equilibrium phase was interrupted around 1976 with a slight upward trend in rainfall subsequently a prolonged period of drought was observed in the study area from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of two short term events the first was extremely rainy spi 4 3 occurring between 1994 and 1996 in the midst of the drought crisis while the second took place in the early 2000s the index variation also revealed a third period from 2010 to 2012 that can be considered a wet period spi 2 5 from 2012 onwards the observed trend indicates that a moderately dry period with low rainfall intensity took place 5 2 2 seasonal variation in this section an assessment of the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern was carried out by studying the monthly rainfall variability it should be noted that the two decades of 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 were chosen as a reference periods for this seasonal variation analysis this choice was reinforced by the results obtained in the present study in particular through the subdivision based on the standardized precipitation index spi which revealed that the first period 1970 1980 corresponds to a balanced period while the second 1980 1990 corresponds to the occurrence of a long drought phase the graphical representations fig 10 make it possible to define the seasonal pattern of the two periods considered as references it should be noted that a rainy season is defined by the position of the curve within the range of positive values while a dry season is defined by the position of the curve in the range of negative values it emerges from the graphical representations that the 1970 1980 decade before the occurrence of the drought crisis is characterized on one hand by an early start of the rainy season around september and on the other hand by a late end of this season around april with about seven months of rain in contrast during the second phase 1980 1990 it can be clearly noted that the length of the rainy season was significantly reduced with a belated beginning in october and an early end around the beginning of march about four months 5 2 3 hydrological drought the inter annual flows variations were used to characterize the hydrological drought over the monitoring period of 1970 2017 according to the graphical representation fig 11 it can be noted that for both springs fresh and salt the water flow dynamics varied similarly the period from 1980 to 1993 recorded the largest decrease in the flow compared to the inter annual average with a minimum recorded around 1990 1991 the results also show periods of abrupt increases in the flow rates with a maximum recorded in 1994 1995 overall the hydrological drought dynamics in this basin follow almost the same trends as those identified in the rainfall series using the spi index nevertheless it should be noted that during some periods the hydrological response of these two groups of springs showed slight variations such as in 2003 this could be explained by the fact that these two groups of springs are not exploited with the same intensity and that the effect of drought is sometimes combined with the overexploitation of these water bodies in addition this slight difference could also be related to the variation in groundwater flow trajectories from the immediate or distant areas feeding these outlets 5 3 rainfall and water flow matching the correlation between rainfall and spring discharge from fresh and salt springs in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa allowed an assessment of the adequacy of the model in relation to the observed data the coefficient of determination for both springs was about 0 76 however from fig 12 it can be noted that the scatter plot is not adjusted perfectly around the regression line this could be explained by the fact that the hydrological response of the basin is influenced by other factors this could include the climatic conditions of the area such as inputs due to snow melt providing support to the spring discharges and therefore the recorded flows do not fully correspond to the rainfall in addition it could be caused by the underground geomorphology of the basin in particular the presence of triassic clay formations with low porosity in juxtaposition with liassic carbonate formations which minimize the ability of the basin to deliver water 5 4 sub period dynamics a summary of the different subdivisions obtained for all the studied stations as well as the variations in the rainfall and the water flow rates are summarized in tables 3 and 4 these tables show that the averages established before and after the break for each sub period indicate a change in the rainfall and the hydrological regime furthermore it can be noted that the deficit is large and sometimes exceeds 50 thus initiating the beginning of a global change in the climate regime in addition it can be clearly noted that the rainfall variability was reflected in the flow rates following the same trend and that the flow deficits reached a threshold of 45 on the other hand the extreme events also presented another aspect of climate variability as highlighted throughout this study these short duration events were characterized by an intensification of rainfall in a relatively short period of time with a pronounced variation in the rainfall dynamics exceeding 100 and resulting in abundant runoffs with nearly the same level of intensity 6 discussion the results obtained in this study show that the precipitation and the runoff patterns experienced different periods of disturbance indicating a change in the climate dynamics furthermore the analysis of drought severity showed that the area has experienced a long period of drought during recent decades the analysis at a seasonal scale also showed that during these drought periods the rainy season was reduced considerably previous studies carried out in other areas in morocco seem to indicate similar fluctuations in the hydro climatic regime as those identified in this study the studies carried out in the northern part of the country highlighted several periods of disruption particularly in 1984 sebbar et al 2011 this break period was accompanied by a rainfall deficit varying between 15 and 25 in the southern atlantic part and around 30 in the eastern region in addition in the fes saiss plain and the liasic karstic aquifer the long period of drought initiated in 1980 resulted in a significant decrease in the flow rates amraoui et al 2004 bouchaou et al 1997 on the other hand the phase between 1994 and 1996 was extremely wet and reflects the same level of intensity as the one identified in the eastern atlas mountains and in the tizin isly area daoudi and saidi 2008 driouech 2010 ouatiki et al 2019 these indications show a clear link implying that the study area is part of a global climatic dynamic previously observed in other areas of morocco and that the rainfall breaks and the flow regime fluctuations highlighted in this study were derived from an irregular climatic dynamic where climate change is tending towards aridity this finding is also reinforced by a comparison with previous studies on a regional scale notably with some studies conducted in neighboring countries in algeria a previous study showed a decrease in the annual rainfall exceeding 36 in the mascara region and in the extreme west around 1980 meddi and meddi 2009 research studies conducted in the north western part of algeria demonstrated that since the 1980s aquifer output has decreased by more than 50 khaldi 2005 nekkache and megnounif 2013 from the same perspective a study carried out in central tunisia revealed a significant decrease with a break in the annual rainfall series distribution between 1979 and 1985 kingumbi et al 2000 the aforementioned findings require linking these results with regional phenomena at a broad scale one such pattern is the north atlantic oscillation nao the choice of this index is justified by the geographical position of morocco which is mainly located in the subtropical subsidence belt with a climate regime largely regulated by the influence of the azores anticyclone agoussine 2003 knippertz et al 2003 fig 13 shows the opposing phases of the nao index the spi index and the spring discharge variability during the monitoring period 1970 2017 from the graphical representation it appears that the evolutionary trends are clearly identifiable from the 1980s onwards a strongly positive phase of the nao index was established with a clear succession of several years in which the index was positive indicating a persistence of the azores anticyclone and elevated values of pressure on the atlantic ocean around the azores corte real et al 1995 hurrell 1995 this led to a northward deviation of the atmospheric circulation and consequently contributed to the onset of a long period of drought in the study area fig 13a in contrast the most negative values of the nao index reflect rainy climatic conditions with sometimes extreme events and abundant runoffs as was the case for the 1994 1996 phase fig 13 b c this could be attributed to the fact that the attenuation of the pressure gradient allows the transition of the atlantic disturbances towards the south which is advantageous for the rainfall in the study area our finding therefore leads to the hypothesis that the breaks and the sub period dynamics detected are mainly due to the regional atmospheric circulation which in turn is largely attributed to the changes in the nao phases this implies that mountainous regions and their water balance are not immune to climate variability contrary to what has been previously considered 7 conclusions the data used in this work was drawn from four hydrometric monitoring stations for a long period ranging from 1970 to 2017 the study identified the main fluctuations in rainfall and spring discharge data and helped to trace their evolutionary trends the main conclusions can be outlined as follows the statistical methods pettitt buishand and lee and heghinian clearly identified the climate instability at the four monitoring stations with four major breaks in 1980 1995 2000 and 2010 the use of the standardized precipitation index spi allowed characterization of the extent of dry and wet periods as well as their intensity a prolonged period of drought was observed in the study area from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of several short term rainy events such as in the 1994 1996 phase and the early 2000s the monthly rainfall index method allowed assessment of the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern it was noted that the length of the rainy season was significantly reduced with a belated beginning in october and an early end around the beginning of march the variation of spring discharge highlighted a relevant finding namely that the analysis of climate fluctuations based on the water flows indicates a trend and evolution consistent with those of rainfall the period from 1980 to 1993 recorded the largest decrease in the flow and results also revealed periods of abrupt increases in the flow rates with a maximum recorded in 1994 1996 the phase opposition between the spi the nao index and the spring discharge variability during the period 1970 2017 allowed the determination of the influence of the atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and the availability of water resources in the area overall these results indicate that water resource availability in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa is mainly related to precipitation which is in turn significantly influenced by climate variability consequently it is strongly recommended to take into consideration several measures to adapt the water sector in this basin to this climate variability firstly to cope with the periods of dryness it is necessary to develop more efforts to save water used in irrigation which uses 80 of the annual mobilized water resources in the area e g by developing the artificial recharge of the over exploited groundwater secondly it would be of interest to realize projects to improve protection against extreme and unforeseen floods funding this work was partially

11756,this study aims to analyze rainfall data series of four hydrometric stations in a mountainous context in morocco over the period 1970 2017 periods of disruption were identified through statistical approaches based on rupture detection the pettitt test the bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian and the buishand test the results show that the studied series are characterized by several breaks which indicate a variation in the overall trend of the rainfall regime during 1980 1995 2000 and around 2010 in addition a diagnostic of dry and wet years is carried out by applying the standardized precipitation index spi a prolonged period of drought was observed from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of several short term rainy events such as in 1994 1996 and the early 2000s the variability of spring discharge indicates an evolution consistent with that of rainfall the largest decrease in flow rates was recorded during the period from 1980 to 1993 in addition periods of abrupt increases were identified with a maximum recorded in 1994 1996 the phase opposition showed a marked consistency between the north atlantic oscillation nao the spi and the variability of spring discharge which provides an overview of the influence of atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and consequently on the availability of water resources in the area graphical abstract image 1 keywords climate variability rainfall dynamics spring water flows dynamics statistical analysis drought 1 introduction recently climate variability in morocco has become a major concern in many debates on development strategies schilling et al 2012 hssaisoune et al 2020 in morocco the notion of climate variability and water resource scarcity is not a recent phenomenon the rainfall distribution has been studied since the 1940s through the research studies conducted by emberger 1955 where the first rainfall maps of morocco were produced these were supplemented by other authors meko 1985 badri et al 1994 revealing that the climate in morocco is irregular with two distinct seasons i a wet season from october to april when almost all of the rainy episodes take place and accounting for 86 92 of the annual rainfall and ii a dry season from may to september with only 8 14 of the annual rainfall thereafter several authors have attempted to analyze the rainfall variability safi 1990 bouchaou et al 1997 2017 amraoui et al 2004 stour and agoumi 2009 chamchati and bahir 2011 sebbar et al 2012 babqiqi 2014 all of these works have confirmed that recent decades have been characterized by a net irregularity in the distribution of precipitation and highlighted a significant decrease in rainfall inputs since 1980 with significant depletion in the quantity and deterioration in the quality of water resources yacoubi 2001 sinan et al 2009 babqiqi and messouli 2013 sinan and belhouji 2016 furthermore during the past few decades morocco has also experienced storms with extreme rainfall and higher volumes of rain in short time periods resulting in significant human losses and economic damage e g ourika valley in 1995 and casablanca rabat in 2002 daoudi and saidi 2008 the geographical situation of morocco in the subtropical subsidence belt generates a climate mainly regulated by the combination of two main poles of influence the azores anticyclone and the saharan depression schilling et al 2012 agoussine 2003 this situation between two climatic belts one temperate in the north and the other tropical in the south leads to a large spatio temporal variability of the climate with a rainfall pattern that fluctuates from more than 1000 mm per year on the northern reliefs to less than 25 mm on the desert plains in the south sebbar et al 2011 ait brahim et al 2017 large scale atmospheric circulation patterns further contribute to the understanding of this variability one such pattern is the north atlantic oscillation nao which depicts a broad oscillation of the atmospheric mass between the north atlantic regions of the subtropical anti cyclone close to the azores and the sub polar low pressure system around iceland corte real et al 1995 previous studies have shown that the nao index significantly influences the rainfall regime in the mediterranean region hurrell 1995 wanner et al 2001 knippertz et al 2003 driouech 2010 lópez moreno et al 2011 kjellström 2016 hence a judicious understanding of the consistency between the nao index rainfall and discharge patterns could improve the understanding of climate variability in connection with water resource availability in climatology the statistical analysis of time series is a key element to detect potential changes in hydro climatic patterns in morocco most research based on statistical tests for the detection of modifications in climatic patterns have been conducted at broad national and regional scales sebbar et al 2011 2012 knippertz et al 2003 driouech 2010 aoubouazza and rajel 2013 filahi et al 2015 bouaich and benabdelfadel 2010 zhao et al 2019 recently investigations have focused on the catchment scale with a special focus on rainfall to address the various challenges facing the moroccan water sector which are widely different from one basin to another zamrane et al 2016 seif ennasr et al 2017 abahous et al 2017 ouatiki et al 2019 in the current study the focus is on the mountainous area of oum er rabiaa basin in order to clearly identify the extent of climate variability and its impact on the availability of water resources we note that the climate variability in this area is poorly understood moreover it is important to point out that climatic fluctuations are likely to induce several forms of damage notably on the socioeconomic level the mountainous areas are one of the most sensitive contexts and slight changes in climate have a serious impact on the availability of water resources thus generating a real obstacle for all development strategies and influencing the vital sectors of activity agriculture tourism parish and funnell 1999 balaghi et al 2013 taking into consideration all of these issues the link between climate variability rainfall distribution and water resource availability requires consideration not only as a natural event that must be endured but as a phenomenon that needs to be examined and explained in this study the use of statistical approaches in the analysis of annual rainfall and spring discharge time series allows recognition of the variability of rainfall patterns and its impact on the flow fluctuations the expected information regarding dry and wet sequences and their temporal evolution could provide a key element for decision makers and managers for the elaboration of strategies and policies to preserve and manage water resources of the area 2 study area 2 1 general location the study area corresponds to the upper basin of oum er rabiaa covering an area of about 3400 km2 it is located in the south western part of the middle atlas mountains in the province of khenifra and drained by oum er rabiaa the largest river in morocco the geographical coordinates range from the longitudes 5 05 and 5 50 west and the latitudes 32 35 and 33 north fig 1 the basin is characterized by a complex morphology and structure due to the existence of tabular and rugged areas the maximum altitude reaches 2400 m above sea level m a s l at hayane mountain the annual rainfall in the oum er rabiaa basin varies from 800 mm in the upstream middle atlas mountains to 300 mm in the downstream part with an average of 500 mm snow cover occurs on average on 20 days year above an elevation of 800 m a s l the temperature values vary between 10 and 50 c and the potential evaporation is around 2000 mm year with a maximum of 300 mm in july and august oum er rbiaa hydraulic basin agency 2009 the high temperatures and the lack of precipitation in summer as well as the high evaporation rates highlight the important water needs in this area 2 2 hydrogeological characteristics 2 2 1 surface water in terms of hydrology this area is an important water reservoir with an extensive hydrographic network comprising the oum er rabiaa river and its main tributaries srou chbouka and ouaoumana fig 1 2 2 2 groundwater the upper basin of oum er rabiaa contains an aquifer system consisting mainly of several springs of varying discharge and quality the fresh springs are the most abundant 600 m3 s with a mineralization rate generally lower than 0 5 g l these are mainly exploited for drinking water supply and irrigation the second group is of poor quality 17 g l with a lower flow rate 0 15 m3 s oum er rbiaa hydraulic basin agency 2009 2 3 sub basins the study area includes the oum er rabiaa river and its tributaries the hydrographic network is represented linearly by hydraulic axes cut into sections to which the elementary watersheds have been associated this hydrographic division was carried out using the topographic maps of khenifra and mrirt at a scale of 1 100 000 ministry of equipment transport logistics and water 1965 in such a manner that all runoff waters converge towards the main river of oum er rabiaa the study area is subdivided into four sub basins as shown in fig 1 the sub basin of oum er rabiaa located in the north is the largest with a surface area of about 1400 km2 it intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of tarhat and its contribution to the total river flow is estimated at around 46 the middle part is occupied by the chbouka sub basin which intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of el heri and has a surface area of about 186 km2 the srou sub basin intercepts the main river at the hydrometric station of chacha nmellah and covers the southern part of the study area with a surface area of roughly 1066 km2 with an important contribution estimated at about 38 of the total flow the ouaoumana in

rainfall and spring discharge time series and the nao climate index 3 1 rainfall and spring discharge data the precipitation and spring discharge data used in this study are complete data series and the oldest recorded climate variables for the studied region for this reason they are important indicators on which this hydro climatic variation study was based several additional reasons justify the focus on these two parameters i rainfall is the most powerful parameter in the analysis of climate variability assani 1999 barbé et al 2002 halmstad et al 2012 ii rainfall plays a determining role in the sustainable planning and management of water resources in hydrological basins particularly in the management of flood risks and the size of dams and iii because agriculture is the major activity practiced by the local population and the surface water of oum er rabiaa river is the unique source of irrigation in the area a statistical description of the rainfall is shown in table 1 the minimum values recorded during the studied period range between 75 and 193 mm while the maximum values fluctuate between 511 and 600 mm the coefficient of variation varies between 33 and 52 indicating that the studied rainfall series are characterized by a significant inter annual variation 3 2 nao climate index the north atlantic oscillation nao index is generally measured as the difference in atmospheric pressure between the north atlantic regions of the subtropical anticyclone close to the azores and the sub polar low pressure system around iceland corte real et al 1995 the nao index values used in the current study were retrieved from the national weather service s website https www cpc ncep noaa gov products precip cwlink pna norm nao monthly b5001 current ascii table accessed on 02 march 2020 4 problematic and method fig 2 shows graphical representations of the studied rainfall series for all series it is noted that there is a global downward trend in rainfall and the slopes of the regression lines show negative values ranging from 1 88 to 0 52 however the main question proposed at the beginning of this study is do these slope values observed on the distributions of rainfall time series meaningfully reflect the climate reality this question is particularly relevant in a climatic context characterized by abrupt and extreme events which influence the rainfall regime and the real evolutionary trends fig 3 highlights the significant inter annual variability in rainfall and spring discharge the flows are low in the years in which recorded rainfall was less than 250 mm 1982 1990 and 2012 in addition it can be seen that the wet periods are sudden events with very short durations not exceeding 3 4 years nevertheless there is a significant increase in water flows during these short periods such as in the wettest year of 1994 1995 this first assessment therefore requires a careful consideration of the relationship between the rainfall regime and the spring discharge in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa considering the context outlined above the present study is based on the analysis of sub period dynamics using a set of indicators that make it possible on one hand to highlight the different evolutionary trends existing within the series and the fluctuations around the central tendency and on the other hand to separate the impact of extreme events all of these considerations fully justify the use of the statistical methods in this study in order to identify the hydro climatic fluctuations throughout statistical distribution assumptions 4 1 basic principle of break detection a statistical approach to detect breaks is used in this work to analyze the chronological precipitation series and identify the periods of their disruption a break is defined by a change in the probability law of the random variables whose successive realizations define the chronological precipitation series lubes et al 1994 the statistical approach adopted in this work provides a better characterization and identification of the pivotal sub episodes of the climate fluctuations their adoption in the current study is justified beyond their robustness by their successful implementation in various previous studies aka et al 1996 paturel et al 1997 servat et al 1997 shanshan et al 2019 hanane et al 2020 kanani et al 2020 4 2 statistical tests the significance of breaks depends mainly on the tests that have detected the change in series a break detected by a single test indicates a lower probability of a break or an event with low amplitude a probable break means that it is detected by at least two statistical tests a certain break means that it is detected by all the tests thus indicating a high probability of a break or a large amplitude event 4 2 1 pettitt statistical test the pettitt approach is derived from the mann whitney test the pettitt test considers a sequence of independent random variables x1 x2 xn the use of the test supposes that for any time t with a value between 1 and n a break occurs if the distribution function f1 x of the random variables xi i 1to t is different from the distribution function f2 x of the random variables xi i t 1 to n pettitt 1979 demarée 1990 sutherland et al 1991 vannitsem and demarée 1991 to identify the point of disturbance a statistical analysis is performed by calculating the index ut n which is defined as follows l hote et al 2002 1 u t n i 1 t j t 1 n d i j 2 di j sgn x sgn x i x j with sgn x 1 if x 0 1 if x 0 0 if x 0 k n is the variable defined by the maximum absolute values of u t n for t varying from 1 to n and k designates the value of k n taken from the studied series under the null hypothesis the probability of exceeding the value k according to a two sided test is given by the following equation rosine et al 2014 3 prob k n k 2 exp 6 k 2 n 3 n 2 given a certain significance level α if prob 0 05 the null hypothesis is rejected then an estimation of the date of the break is provided by the moment t defining the maximum in absolute terms of the ut n variable xie et al 2013 4 k t max u t n 4 2 2 bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian this procedure is applied under the assumption that the studied series is normally distributed the method aims to confirm or disprove the hypothesis of a change in the mean of the studied series lee and heghinian 1977 bruneau and rassam 1983 chaouche 1988 the basic model of the procedure is as follows 5 x i n x i μ 1 σ 2 i 1 τ x i n x i μ δ σ 2 i τ 1 n where x i is a random variable with characteristic data of mean μ and variance σ 2 at the moment i n τ and δ represent respectively the length of the observation the position of the break in time and the amplitude of the change in the mean taking into account their a priori distributions and supposing that the break time follows a uniform distribution the method therefore defines the a posteriori probability distribution 4 2 3 buishand test the buishand statistic is derived from an original formulation given by gardner 1969 the gardner statistic used for a two tailed test of the break in the mean is written 6 g k 1 n 1 p k s k σ x 2 where pk designates the probability that the break will occur after k observations the terms sk and σx represent the partial sum and the standard deviation defined by the following equations respectively 7 s k i 1 k x i x for k 1 n and σ x i 1 n x i x n finally the buishand u statistic is defined as follows buishand 1982 8 u k 1 n 1 s k σ x 2 n n 1 it should be noted that the test allows the construction of a control ellipse associated with a confidence threshold consisting of a graphical complement to buishand s u statistic the limits of the ellipse are based on the sum of cumulative deviations from average sk the series sk follows a normal distribution with a variance defined as follows bois 1971 1986 9 σ 2 k n k n where n is the length of the observation and k is the number of observations k 1 to n it is therefore possible to plot the confidence intervals of these cumulative deviations for a given confidence level 1 α 2 then the confidence thresholds are defined as follows 10 u 1 α 2 k n k n 1 in this study the control ellipse was used to graphically assess the importance of deviations breaks 4 3 drought severity 4 3 1 dry and wet sub periods the standardized precipitation index spi was designed to study drought or humidity at different time scales for a defined area mckee et al 1993 it was officially adopted and recommended in 2012 by the world meteorological organization wmo as a tool for calculating the distribution of dry and wet cycles world meteorological organization 2012 to calculate the spi index it is necessary to have monthly rainfall data covering a period of at least 20 years guttman 1994 for this study the index was calculated according to the following procedure firstly the monthly data for the monitored period 1970 2017 were adjusted to a gamma probability distribution which was then transformed into a normal distribution mckee et al 1995 edwards and mckee 1997 zarei and eslamian 2017 to identify the intensity of dry and wet episodes it is possible to refer to the classification shown below table 2 mckee et al 1993 a drought period occurs when the index has continuously negative values whereas wet periods are characterized by positive values it should be noted that for this study the calculation was made according to a 12 month scale this made it possible to compare the precipitation for 12 consecutive months with that recorded in the same 12 consecutive months in all previous years of the available data the calculation of the index according to this range made it possible to associate the information provided by the index with trends and anomalies in the study area s spring discharges 4 3 2 seasonal variation the monthly rainfall index method was applied in order to assess the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern this method has the advantage of highlighting the periods of abundance and deficit in rainfall regime at a monthly scale the monthly rainfall index is defined by the following equation odekunle 2005 11 i xi xm σ where xi is the precipitation recorded in month i xm is the inter monthly average precipitation values over the considered period and σ is the standard deviation corresponding to the root mean square of the deviations from the mean value of precipitation recorded during the considered period 4 3 3 hydrological drought the method allows a distinction to be made between wet and dry periods through the fluctuations of the water flow regime the model is based on the deviations ec occurring between the annual qma and the inter annual qmi mean flows according to the following formula probst 1989 haida et al 1999 12 e c q m a q m i q m i x 100 wet periods are marked by positive values of ec ec 0 while the negative values ec 0 indicate dry periods probst 1989 4 4 sub period dynamics annual analysis of the rainfall time series available in this basin was used to place the climate variability in a historical perspective the precession of this information and its assessment allows the identification of the alternation of dry and wet sub periods in order to clearly define the connection between the rainfall variability and the water resource availability in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa the fluctuation rates of the hydro climatic variables on both sides of the identified breaks were calculated using the following equation mestre 2000 13 d x j x i 1 where d is the variation rate x j is the sub period average after the break and x i is the sub period average before the break the units of x i and x j were expressed in mm for rainfall data and l s for spring discharges 5 results 5 1 rainfall dynamics 5 1 1 pettitt test the statistical analysis using the pettitt test allowed the definition of the rainfall dynamics in the four monitoring stations the main finding is that the appearance of the curves varies with sudden and clear changes according to the principle of the test a time series is considered homogeneous if it does not contain any fluctuation points in contrast a break is defined by a sudden change in the probability distribution at a given time this change is marked by positive peaks pointing to a maximum value of the pettitt u statistic and indicating the onset of a significant change in the rainfall dynamics conversely minimum values indicate that the series tends to regain the central tendency xie et al 2013 hawkins 2001 in this way the entire series is segmented into several sub periods according to the location of the fluctuation points the indications of the different change points are illustrated in fig 4 it can be clearly seen that the years 1980 1993 1994 2001 and 2010 triggered the beginning of a change in the rainfall dynamics it can also be noted that the most significant breaks are those produced in 1980 and the early 2000s where the values of pettitt s u statistic reached u umax implying a significant decrease in the rainfall pattern on the other hand it is clearly noted that the ruptures occurred in the mid 1990s and around 2010 are pursued by negative values below the zero u line indicating that the rainfall series were able to reach the central trend as a result of an intensification of rainfall in a relatively short period of time storm events which made it possible to compensate the deviation with respect to the distribution function pettitt 1979 5 1 2 bayesian procedure of lee and heghinian fig 5 shows the results of the application of the lee and heghinian method the years of break are defined by calculating the break probabilities throughout the monitoring period it appears that the density of probability follows a similar trend and that the breaks occur in a specific dates in the studied stations for the results presented in fig 5 the maximum mode of the distribution of the probability density is used as the breakpoint estimate booth and smith 1982 szentimrey 1996 graphically it can be noted that the values classes are potentially concentrated in the early 1980s and around 2002 and 2010 indicating a significant change in the means compared to the stationary model of the studied series lee and heghinian 1977 it can also be noted that a slight change in the probability density is shown in the mid 1990s in both el heri and tarhat stations implying the occurrence of an event of short duration which allowed the series to balance the average and restore the stationary pattern 5 1 3 buishand test the application of the buishand test with the positioning of a control ellipse allowed the monitoring of the rainfall regime variability and definition of the years of break for this test the break periods correspond to the positive peaks indicating a trend reversal in the precipitation time series according to the graphical representation fig 6 it is noted that for all the studied stations the breaks with the most significant confidence level are those produced in the early 1980s and 2000s and around 2010 with a confidence threshold ranging from 90 to 95 on the other hand it is clear that the event occurring in the mid 1990s can be considered a break but at a lower confidence level than the other breaks this could be explained by the fact that this break corresponds to an event of very short duration but which nonetheless sufficiently influenced the global trend of the studied series bois 1971 1986 alexandersson 1986 throughout the monitoring period of 1970 2017 the curves presenting the results of the statistical tests have the same shape and synchronization which means that the different methods used in this work indicate similar evolutional trends across the upper basin of oum er rabiaa fig 7 illustrates the distribution of the point clouds for the different breaks which helps to clearly identify the years of major breaks according to this graphical representation the four break years of 1980 1995 2000 and 2010 were most clearly detected by the statistical tests 5 2 drought severity 5 2 1 dry and wet sub periods the calculation of the standardized precipitation index spi allowed the identification of the distribution of dry and wet sub periods in the study area fig 8 as well as the frequencies of dry and wet years for the whole monitoring period fig 9 the main findings can be summarized as follows the first sub period can be considered a normal period starting in 1970 with an spi index balanced between negative and positive values this equilibrium phase was interrupted around 1976 with a slight upward trend in rainfall subsequently a prolonged period of drought was observed in the study area from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of two short term events the first was extremely rainy spi 4 3 occurring between 1994 and 1996 in the midst of the drought crisis while the second took place in the early 2000s the index variation also revealed a third period from 2010 to 2012 that can be considered a wet period spi 2 5 from 2012 onwards the observed trend indicates that a moderately dry period with low rainfall intensity took place 5 2 2 seasonal variation in this section an assessment of the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern was carried out by studying the monthly rainfall variability it should be noted that the two decades of 1970 1980 and 1980 1990 were chosen as a reference periods for this seasonal variation analysis this choice was reinforced by the results obtained in the present study in particular through the subdivision based on the standardized precipitation index spi which revealed that the first period 1970 1980 corresponds to a balanced period while the second 1980 1990 corresponds to the occurrence of a long drought phase the graphical representations fig 10 make it possible to define the seasonal pattern of the two periods considered as references it should be noted that a rainy season is defined by the position of the curve within the range of positive values while a dry season is defined by the position of the curve in the range of negative values it emerges from the graphical representations that the 1970 1980 decade before the occurrence of the drought crisis is characterized on one hand by an early start of the rainy season around september and on the other hand by a late end of this season around april with about seven months of rain in contrast during the second phase 1980 1990 it can be clearly noted that the length of the rainy season was significantly reduced with a belated beginning in october and an early end around the beginning of march about four months 5 2 3 hydrological drought the inter annual flows variations were used to characterize the hydrological drought over the monitoring period of 1970 2017 according to the graphical representation fig 11 it can be noted that for both springs fresh and salt the water flow dynamics varied similarly the period from 1980 to 1993 recorded the largest decrease in the flow compared to the inter annual average with a minimum recorded around 1990 1991 the results also show periods of abrupt increases in the flow rates with a maximum recorded in 1994 1995 overall the hydrological drought dynamics in this basin follow almost the same trends as those identified in the rainfall series using the spi index nevertheless it should be noted that during some periods the hydrological response of these two groups of springs showed slight variations such as in 2003 this could be explained by the fact that these two groups of springs are not exploited with the same intensity and that the effect of drought is sometimes combined with the overexploitation of these water bodies in addition this slight difference could also be related to the variation in groundwater flow trajectories from the immediate or distant areas feeding these outlets 5 3 rainfall and water flow matching the correlation between rainfall and spring discharge from fresh and salt springs in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa allowed an assessment of the adequacy of the model in relation to the observed data the coefficient of determination for both springs was about 0 76 however from fig 12 it can be noted that the scatter plot is not adjusted perfectly around the regression line this could be explained by the fact that the hydrological response of the basin is influenced by other factors this could include the climatic conditions of the area such as inputs due to snow melt providing support to the spring discharges and therefore the recorded flows do not fully correspond to the rainfall in addition it could be caused by the underground geomorphology of the basin in particular the presence of triassic clay formations with low porosity in juxtaposition with liassic carbonate formations which minimize the ability of the basin to deliver water 5 4 sub period dynamics a summary of the different subdivisions obtained for all the studied stations as well as the variations in the rainfall and the water flow rates are summarized in tables 3 and 4 these tables show that the averages established before and after the break for each sub period indicate a change in the rainfall and the hydrological regime furthermore it can be noted that the deficit is large and sometimes exceeds 50 thus initiating the beginning of a global change in the climate regime in addition it can be clearly noted that the rainfall variability was reflected in the flow rates following the same trend and that the flow deficits reached a threshold of 45 on the other hand the extreme events also presented another aspect of climate variability as highlighted throughout this study these short duration events were characterized by an intensification of rainfall in a relatively short period of time with a pronounced variation in the rainfall dynamics exceeding 100 and resulting in abundant runoffs with nearly the same level of intensity 6 discussion the results obtained in this study show that the precipitation and the runoff patterns experienced different periods of disturbance indicating a change in the climate dynamics furthermore the analysis of drought severity showed that the area has experienced a long period of drought during recent decades the analysis at a seasonal scale also showed that during these drought periods the rainy season was reduced considerably previous studies carried out in other areas in morocco seem to indicate similar fluctuations in the hydro climatic regime as those identified in this study the studies carried out in the northern part of the country highlighted several periods of disruption particularly in 1984 sebbar et al 2011 this break period was accompanied by a rainfall deficit varying between 15 and 25 in the southern atlantic part and around 30 in the eastern region in addition in the fes saiss plain and the liasic karstic aquifer the long period of drought initiated in 1980 resulted in a significant decrease in the flow rates amraoui et al 2004 bouchaou et al 1997 on the other hand the phase between 1994 and 1996 was extremely wet and reflects the same level of intensity as the one identified in the eastern atlas mountains and in the tizin isly area daoudi and saidi 2008 driouech 2010 ouatiki et al 2019 these indications show a clear link implying that the study area is part of a global climatic dynamic previously observed in other areas of morocco and that the rainfall breaks and the flow regime fluctuations highlighted in this study were derived from an irregular climatic dynamic where climate change is tending towards aridity this finding is also reinforced by a comparison with previous studies on a regional scale notably with some studies conducted in neighboring countries in algeria a previous study showed a decrease in the annual rainfall exceeding 36 in the mascara region and in the extreme west around 1980 meddi and meddi 2009 research studies conducted in the north western part of algeria demonstrated that since the 1980s aquifer output has decreased by more than 50 khaldi 2005 nekkache and megnounif 2013 from the same perspective a study carried out in central tunisia revealed a significant decrease with a break in the annual rainfall series distribution between 1979 and 1985 kingumbi et al 2000 the aforementioned findings require linking these results with regional phenomena at a broad scale one such pattern is the north atlantic oscillation nao the choice of this index is justified by the geographical position of morocco which is mainly located in the subtropical subsidence belt with a climate regime largely regulated by the influence of the azores anticyclone agoussine 2003 knippertz et al 2003 fig 13 shows the opposing phases of the nao index the spi index and the spring discharge variability during the monitoring period 1970 2017 from the graphical representation it appears that the evolutionary trends are clearly identifiable from the 1980s onwards a strongly positive phase of the nao index was established with a clear succession of several years in which the index was positive indicating a persistence of the azores anticyclone and elevated values of pressure on the atlantic ocean around the azores corte real et al 1995 hurrell 1995 this led to a northward deviation of the atmospheric circulation and consequently contributed to the onset of a long period of drought in the study area fig 13a in contrast the most negative values of the nao index reflect rainy climatic conditions with sometimes extreme events and abundant runoffs as was the case for the 1994 1996 phase fig 13 b c this could be attributed to the fact that the attenuation of the pressure gradient allows the transition of the atlantic disturbances towards the south which is advantageous for the rainfall in the study area our finding therefore leads to the hypothesis that the breaks and the sub period dynamics detected are mainly due to the regional atmospheric circulation which in turn is largely attributed to the changes in the nao phases this implies that mountainous regions and their water balance are not immune to climate variability contrary to what has been previously considered 7 conclusions the data used in this work was drawn from four hydrometric monitoring stations for a long period ranging from 1970 to 2017 the study identified the main fluctuations in rainfall and spring discharge data and helped to trace their evolutionary trends the main conclusions can be outlined as follows the statistical methods pettitt buishand and lee and heghinian clearly identified the climate instability at the four monitoring stations with four major breaks in 1980 1995 2000 and 2010 the use of the standardized precipitation index spi allowed characterization of the extent of dry and wet periods as well as their intensity a prolonged period of drought was observed in the study area from 1980 to 2010 with the exception of several short term rainy events such as in the 1994 1996 phase and the early 2000s the monthly rainfall index method allowed assessment of the impact of drought severity on the seasonal rainfall pattern it was noted that the length of the rainy season was significantly reduced with a belated beginning in october and an early end around the beginning of march the variation of spring discharge highlighted a relevant finding namely that the analysis of climate fluctuations based on the water flows indicates a trend and evolution consistent with those of rainfall the period from 1980 to 1993 recorded the largest decrease in the flow and results also revealed periods of abrupt increases in the flow rates with a maximum recorded in 1994 1996 the phase opposition between the spi the nao index and the spring discharge variability during the period 1970 2017 allowed the determination of the influence of the atmospheric circulation on the evolution of precipitation and the availability of water resources in the area overall these results indicate that water resource availability in the upper basin of oum er rabiaa is mainly related to precipitation which is in turn significantly influenced by climate variability consequently it is strongly recommended to take into consideration several measures to adapt the water sector in this basin to this climate variability firstly to cope with the periods of dryness it is necessary to develop more efforts to save water used in irrigation which uses 80 of the annual mobilized water resources in the area e g by developing the artificial recharge of the over exploited groundwater secondly it would be of interest to realize projects to improve protection against extreme and unforeseen floods funding this work was partially

climate variability döll 2009 has resulted in water scarcity and unsustainable use as a result knowing contributing factors affecting groundwater occurrence and spatio temporal variation is essential for exploration and sustainable management of groundwater resources owing to vast disparity between regions the identification of groundwater potential zones under various interacting drivers is vital for any particular area due to improper allocation of boreholes debre markos town the province of eastern gojjam faces a drinking water shortage and hence boreholes are drying moreover the hidden

too costly and time consuming and resulted in developmental failure enormous costs and drying up of wells vanum et al 2016 thus situations are disappointing frustrating and sometimes shocking for numerous groundwater users and planners and lead to the need to apply new technologies such as rs and gis the application of rs and gis a contemporary advanced technology to identify and map the potential zones of groundwater it is a quicker and more cost effective alternative technique to map various factors relevant to groundwater potential identification hammouri et al 2012 thapa et al

dd calculated as the ratio of total stream length km to drainage basin area km2 watershed delineation procedures were carried out including filling the sink flow direction flow accumulation stream link stream feature and stream polyline stream length as a result dd is computed using equation 2 horton 1932 2 d d σ l a where dd drainage density σl the total length of streams in km a the area of the drainage basin in km 2 2 4 lineaments and land use land cover sentinel hub usgs earth explorer sentinel 2a https copernicus eu was used to obtain land use land cover data from sentinel 2a satellite images table 2 all tiles namely t37pbm t37pdm t37pdn t37pcm t37pcn and t37pcl were mosaicked to perform principal component analysis pca hence the mosaic image tiff file was imported into envi 5 3 software the pca output was saved as tiff geotiff data to make it more manageable for pci geomatica 2018 software pca data was used to automatically generate lineaments in pci geomatica 2018 lineaments were split in arcgis 10 7 1 using the vertices toolbox s split line lineament densities were calculated using equation 3 by adding the total length of the lineaments and dividing by the area thus the lineament density was reclassified into five classes and lineament density map was prepared see table 3 3 l d i 1 i n l i a where ld lineament density li length of lineaments a area n number of lineaments all the spectral bands of sentinel 2a data were layer stacked to get better or improved result in classification accuracy assessment zhang et al 2019 six tiles were mosaicked and sub setted with erdas imagine 2014 supervised classification with maximum likelihood classification algorithm was conducted by developing training areas as a signature campbell and wynne 2011 land

reference and information center isric data hub world soil information and africa soil profiles database afsp version 1 2 it is based on the usda soil texture classification derived from sand silt and clay at six depth intervals 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 to 30 30 to 60 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm deep 2 7 geology the geological data of eastern gojjam zone was organized from four adjoining scanned geological data sheets 1 250000 map scale obtained from the ethiopia mapping agency the geological map sheets of debre tabor nc37 2 debre markos nc37 6 burie nc37 5 and addis ababa nc37 10 were geo referenced by taking four points in arcgis 10 7 1 with a root mean square error rmse of 0 952 0 54 0 86 and 1 00 respectively erdas imagine 2014 used to mosaic the four map sheets with a mosaic image tool the eastern gojjam zone geological map was extracted by mask and digitization was done by the editor toolbox in arcgis 2 8 rainfall daily rainfall data was collected from twenty three meteorological stations monthly and annual rainfall data have been computed from the daily recorded data annual rainfall data from ten years to thirty three years of debre markos lumame motta rebu gebeya amber and eighteen other stations were interpolated to find unknown values of rainfall data from known values inverse distance weight idw analysis was applied to interpolate rainfall data during selection of interpolation method there is no rule of thumb to use which one is accurate and appropriate for a certain analysis however idw is simple easy to understand and efficient in arcgis environment wu and hung 2016 2 9 aquifer productivity classification aquifer productivity in africa is characterized based on a synthesis of drill yield data which is the most widely available data for aquifers according to the british geological survey 2019 based on the approximate ranges of borehole yields liters s 1 five basic types have been identified table 4 aquifer productivity levels are classified as very high 20 l s 1 high 5 20 l s 1 moderate 2 5 l s 1 low 0 1 2 l s 1 and very low 0 1 l s 1 as a result ranges are presumed to refer to the average discharge that would be achieved from a single well placed and constructed borehole in the research area s relevant aquifer see table 5 2 10 multi criteria decision making mcdm the weights of all the detected groundwater contributing elements in themed map layers would be different as a result a multi criteria decision analysis mcda malczewski 1999 method was used in conjunction with an analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 ahp aids in the capturing of objective evaluation metrics and provides a valuable technique for ensuring that the evaluations are consistent hence reducing decision making bias ishizaka alessio and lusti markus 2003 to determine the relative importance or weight of the decision criteria ahp used a pairwise comparisons matrix which entails three steps 1 at each level of the hierarchy beginning at the top create a comparison matrix 2 calculation of consistency ratio and 3 computation of relative importance or weights for each member in the hierarchy c r consistency ratio can be used to assess inconsistency of judgments in criterion weighting through pairwise comparison c r c r is a metric that determines how far a matrix deviates from consistency with a c r value of 10 0 1 or less deemed acceptable saaty 1980 consistency index c i calculated as 6 c i λ max n n 1 c r for each matrix in the hierarchy computed by using the following formula 7 c r c i r i 100 where n is the number of input factors used r i is the random consistency index λ max is the biggest eigenvalue and c r is consistency ratio random index is the average consistency index of a randomly generated comparison matrix as shown in table 6 saaty s ratio index is not functional for n less than two for example when the numbers of input factors are seven ri value is 1 32 finally all thematic map layers analyzed using the weighted sum overlay analysis tool in arcgis 10 7 1 environment based on their weight given 8 g w p i n 1 7 w i x i where gwpi groundwater potential wi weight of criteria factor weight xi assigned reclassified pixel value n number of contributing factors 2 11 validation of groundwater potential the results of identifying and mapping groundwater potential zones were validated using boreholes data obtained from east gojjam zone towns and zonal water resource bureau extracting multi values by bilinear interpolation methods of values at point locations was applied in arcmap 10 7 1 this method aided in the validation of the borehole point in the nearest pixel class value 9 gwva tnvb tnbn tnvb 100 where gwva is groundwater validation accuracy tnbn is total number of boreholes disagree with the identification groundwater potential zones tnvb is total number of validation boreholes 2 12 conceptual framework of the study conceptual framework design of groundwater potential zones identification of eastern gojjam using remote sensing and gis technologies shown in fig 2 below 3 results and discussion 3 1 thematic layers 3 1 1 soil texture map soils have diverse water infiltration and storage capacity that depends on the soil texture soil structure and porosity of the soil four soil texture classes such as clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam soil were found in the area the afsp classified soil depth in to six classes 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm deep soil texture classes clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam for first up to third depth and clay clay loam and sandy clay loam for each 4th 5th and 6th soil depth fig 3 a shows the plateau of choke mountain shield made up of clay loam and loam type of soil texture that helps water to infiltrate and conduit easily it contributes to highest groundwater discharge obtained in the foothill of choke mountain however the circular belt of eastern gojjam has a clay soil texture which had less infiltration and high water storage capacity since clay soil has a wide range of clay silt and sand proportion it is important to notice that not all area has black cotton clay soil with high clay proportion therefore the soil texture reclassified as clay low infiltration clay loam moderate sandy clay loam high and loam very high infiltration rate as shown in table 8 3 1 2 rainfall map inverse distance weighted idw is a method of determining unknown stations using known values nearby stations of rainfall data obtained from meteorological station the mean annual rainfall of all the stations interpolated with idw high rainfall receiver areas 1514 1750 mm yr 1 such as debre elias amanuel digo tsion gendeywoyen and robu gebeya stations and some parts of debre markos are classified as very high potential while the most eastern part of the study area relatively receives low rainfall and is classified as low to very low potential 898 1150 mm yr 1 most of debre markos yejube amber kuye and felege birhan stations receive high to moderate rainfall and are classified as well according to mwega et al 2013 comparatively areas that receive higher rainfall have greater recharge rates than those with less rainfall received areas 3 1 3 geological map naturally geological formations of the study area are very complex thirty four different types of geology in the study area were identified the major types are choke trachytic plugs choke rhyolite kutye basalt rob gebeya basalts arat mekeraker basalt gypsum bed limestone lower sand stone adigrat sand stone abay sandstone yejube basalt arero gedabo basalt debre markos basalts lumame basalts alluvial soil elluvial soil and lower basalt most geology in the highlands of the study area has moderate to high hydraulic conductivity or productivity on the other hand the aquifer is low in most parts of the abay gorge geology however some geology has highly productive porous and or fissured aquifers and karstified aquifers ferede 2015 because of the detailed geological map scale 1 250 000 the types of geology fig 5 in the study area are numerous lumame basalt yejube basalt and lower lava flow rank first second and third in terms of area coverage respectively fig 5 depicts the identification of thirty four different geological types as depicted in fig 7 geological types have been reclassified with their corresponding class value of very high high moderate low and very low groundwater potential and detailed reclassified information provided in table 8 see figs 6 and 9 3 1 4 drainage density map drainage density dd map shows the landscape dissection runoff potential infiltration capacity of the land climatic conditions and vegetation cover of the basin high dd is the result of weak or impermeable subsurface material sparse vegetation and mountainous relief low drainage density leads to coarse drainage texture while high dd leads to fine drainage texture kanth and hassan 2012 the slope of the land lithology and structure influences dd it affects the runoff pattern if there is a high prescribed amount then the runoff water will drain quickly thus it will have less opportunity to infiltrate into the soil the drainage pattern of the eastern gojjam zone has a radial arrangement starting from the two mountain shields the first and most prominent mountain chain found in the zone is the choke mountain volcanic shield most rivers of abay tributaries starts in a radial arrangement secondly the islamo mountain volcanic rock found in the northeastern part of the study area around mertu lemariam the dd of the study area ranges from 0 175 to 3 74 as shown in fig 4 f the highest value was recorded at the turning point commencement of the abay gorge area while the lowest value was obtained in the study area s eastern region the lower value of dd 0 17 1 assigned to the very high potential of groundwater and given the number 1 dd from 1 to 1 36 given high potential and from 1 36 to 1 72 is moderate 1 72 to 2 23 low and above 2 23 is very low groundwater potential as shown in table 8 as shown in fig 3 d the majority of high temperatures and low rainfall were recorded in the southern southwestern and eastern parts these regions are at the initial point at which a very steep slope begins of the abay river gorge 3 1 5 slope map the slope takes an input surface raster and calculates an output raster containing the slope of each cell the higher the slope value the steeper the terrain and the lower the slope value the flatter the terrain a slope range of 0 77 5 was recorded the slope of the land was reclassified as 0 to 8 5 very high 8 5 to 14 5 high 14 5 to 21 8 moderate 21 8 to 62 4 low and 62 4 to 77 5 very low contribution to groundwater potential table 8 slopes with a flat to gentle slope 0 to 8 5 slope covers first rank and very steep slopes 62 4 77 5 ranks fifth in area coverage table 8 most flat to gentle slopes originated between the edge of abbay gorge and the nearby foot of choke mountain with some undulating low terrain 3 1 6 lineament density ld map lineament density is the total length of lineaments per unit area as expressed in equation 3 yeh et al 2016 lineaments are one important factor for the identification of groundwater potential zones due to their faults and fractures formed by the lithology of the earth sankar 2002 ld ranges from 0 05 to 1 69 and it was reclassified into five different classes the highest value of ld has a high potential for groundwater and vice versa as shown in table 8 areas having the highest ld 1 14 1 69 have a very high contribution to groundwater potential however the lowest ld 0 06 0 42 has a very low groundwater potential contribution as fig 3 c shows ld is within the range of high to very high in northern portion of the study area these areas are the source of river abay in the eastern gojjam zone however at the ending flow out point of the river the lineaments are very low that indicates there is very low to insignificant fracture and faults 3 1 7 land use land cover thematic map sentinel 2a image of the study area was classified into twelve land cover types to make it clear for classification these are forest land grassland agriculture land relay cropping crop grown by retention moisture water bodies built up area bare land river sand abbay limestone reddish rocks abbay white rocks and abbay dark rocks because some land cover features have nearly similar reflectance value which makes supervised classification difficult for instance agricultural lands having a relay cropping seems like grassland and forest accuracy assessment was conducted by taking 249 ground truth points the overall accuracy assessment report of the classification and kappa coefficient was 84 34 and 0 825 respectively and shown in table 7 owing to the vastness of the study area and the closeness of the reflectance value of some land features objects such as limestones looks settlements and some rocks too there are twelve land cover classes for example river dyke sands bear a resemblance to settlements relay cropping areas also have nearly similar reflectance value with grasslands and small shrubs in addition most areas in the study area are covered with cultivation lands agricultural land and relay cropping land whereas water body has lowest area coverage land use land cover classes were classified based on their contribution to groundwater level in the aquifer accordingly forestland grassland and water bodies belongs to very high while relay cropping land and river dyke sands have high contribution the agricultural land and bareland regions have moderate to low groundwater contribution however land uses such as white rocks built up areas abay limestone abay reddish rocks and abay dark colored rocks that have acquitard nature are belongs to very low contribution for groundwater potential as shown in table 8 3 1 8 pairwise comparison matrix of groundwater contributing factors the identified contributing factors of groundwater potential pairwise comparison matrix shown in table 9 below in the pairwise comparison matrix the column of criteria weight of geology slope rainfall lineament density soil drainage density and land cover in their descending order accounts 21 54 16 94 15 37 13 82 12 3 11 21 and 9 24 ranks from one up to seven respectively the calculated λmax value of 7 0774 consistency index ci value of 0 0129 and the random index ri is 1 32 since the n value is seven therefore a consistency ratio cr 0 0098 which is less than 0 1 and acceptable 3 1 9 groundwater potential zones map seven groundwater contributing factors geology slope rainfall lineament density soil drainage density and land cover overlaid by multiplying their corresponding criteria weight table 9 with the assigned raster class value finally a groundwater potential area map was developed as shown in fig 8 below the south western part of the study area has very high groundwater potential as compared to others owing to its very high productive aquifer nature of the geology quaternary basalts receives up to 1750 mm yr 1 rainfall which is the maximum annual rainfall of the area gentle slope topography and better lineament density according to kebede 2013 most very high discharge springs are found in the foothill of the choke mountain chain such as jiga spring which has a discharge of 400 liters s 1 moreover in the study area at sentra wellfield a discharge of 34 37 and 39 5 l s 1 recorded at debre markos town water service borehole 6 10 and 11 respectively most foothills of choke mountain shield volcano extended from north to south part of the zone have high groundwater potential discharged 5 20 liters s 1 despite this fact the eastern part of the study area has moderate to low and very low groundwater potential this is due to very low lineament density aquitard nature of geology heavy clay soil with very low hydraulic conductivity high drainage density very low rainfall receiver areas bichena mertu lemariam and debre work stations and discontinuous and undulated slope nature associated with bare land and large extent of abay gorge rock formations one third of the area of east gojjam zone is within the range of low to very low groundwater potential the area covered by abay gorge drainage characterized by a very steep slope high drainage density very complex geology with hard rocks limestones sandstones and gypsum their hydrogeological nature extends from low very low to aquitard aquifer productivity however it is important to notice that the lineament density of these regions northern eastern to southern is very high approximately 13 and 24 spatial coverage of the study area has very high and high groundwater potential respectively moderate groundwater potential contributes the highest spatial area coverage around 29 2 of the study area above one third nearly 34 of the area is covered with low and very low groundwater potential from which most of the area is found in the belt of abbay gorge area as shown in table 10 3 2 validation of results the results validated using deep well boreholes dug by the government for different towns these boreholes supplied fresh drinking water services for the dwellers living in towns and cities out of six very high discharge boreholes having greater than 20 l s 1 five boreholes validated correctly 83 33 see table 11 on the other hand only 5 high discharged boreholes are in disagreement while 95 validated correctly in moderate discharge boreholes eights are in agreement with the analysis conducted which has 80 accuracy low discharged boreholes have 66 67 accuracy there is no very low borehole drilled in the study area the overall accuracy of the validation result is 87 5 thirty four boreholes from thirty nine boreholes are accurately placed and kappa coefficient k of 0 86 4 conclusions the application of remote sensing and gis is a newly emerged and powerful tool in the area identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones in ancient times groundwater potential was determined and identified by direct checking of hand drilling which is a very costly and time consuming activity as a result drying up of boreholes failure may come across after spending huge money subsequently other methods of determination of groundwater potential zones using only the type of geology and lineaments would not have always positive results for example in the study area at debre markos town wutern wellfield site most boreholes having a productive erosional sediment nature of geology and high lineament density but their groundwater discharge is less than those having less lineament density in the sentera wellfield the application of rs and gis technologies is prominent for groundwater exploration particularly in least developing countries like ethiopia to achieve sdgs in water related policy making planning and development activities therefore this study used seven groundwater contributing factors as an input and integrated application of rs and gis with ahp to determine the groundwater potential zones of eastern gojjam in conclusion about 12 78 179040 6 ha and 24 1 337575 5 ha of the total area found on the foothill side of choke mountain has very high and high groundwater potential respectively approximately two thirds 63 22 of the total area of the eastern gojjam zone has moderate 408965 8 ha low 339759 8 ha and very low 135104 3 ha groundwater potential most of it being found on the steep slope of the abbay gorge area the overall accuracy of the validation result was 87 2 from thirty nine boreholes having spatial referenced data thirty four boreholes correctly matched with the weighted sum overlay

identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones in this study digital elevation model dem data used to prepare a slope and drainage density map lineaments automatically extracted with pci geomatica and land use land cover maps were derived from sentinel 2a data supervised classification maximum likelihood classifier was applied with an overall accuracy of 84 34 and kappa coefficient of 0 825 rainfall data from twenty two meteorological stations was used to prepare rainfall thematic map using inverse distance weight interpolation method all factors were reclassified based on their class value into five classes namely very high high moderate low and very low a multi criteria decision analysis with analytical hierarchy process was implemented with a consistency ratio cr value of 0 0098 which is 0 1 findings were obtained using a weighted sum overlay analysis of each factor s value multiplied by its corresponding weight therefore 12 78 and 24 1 of the total area has very high and high potential for groundwater respectively whereas 29 2 24 26 and 9 65 of the zone have moderate low and very low potential respectively finally the result was validated with borehole data and the overall accuracy was found to be 87 17 in conclusion the application of rs and gis are powerful tools to identify and map groundwater potential areas with a combination of different groundwater contributing factors graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater rs and gis multi criteria decision analysis weighted sum overlay 1 introduction water is an indispensable natural resource that is required by all living things it is at the core of sustainable and socio economic development healthy ecosystems and human survival connor 2015 globally both surface and groundwater are supplied for agriculture municipal and industrial consumption loucks and van beek 2017 however groundwater is a principal resource as a source of freshwater supply throughout the world guillaume et al 2012 in sub saharan africa increasing spatiotemporal variability in precipitation expected to increase reliance on groundwater resources the primary source of water for domestic use addressing food insecurity sustaining rapid economic growth and improving the continent s living standards and irrigation schemes ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 taylor et al 2010 macdonald et al 2012 ethiopia with an entire area of approximately 1 13 million km2 has a total groundwater reserve of 185 billion cubic meters spread over an area of 924 140 km2 alemeyahu 2006 melesse et al 2014 the country has significant surface water potential from its twelve major river basins however due to its complex geological landscapes and erratic rainfall distribution across regions the resource fluctuates with high spatio temporal variability mowr 2002 awulachew et al 2007 worqlul et al 2015 ayalew 2018 in ethiopia many urban and rural areas about 70 of the drinking water supply of the country have augmented the use of groundwater resources kebede 2013 ethiopia is experiencing high population growth as well as double digit economic growth the steady growth in the population and the economy coupled with global climate variability döll 2009 has resulted in water scarcity and unsustainable use as a result knowing contributing factors affecting groundwater occurrence and spatio temporal variation is essential for exploration and sustainable management of groundwater resources owing to vast disparity between regions the identification of groundwater potential zones under various interacting drivers is vital for any particular area due to improper allocation of boreholes debre markos town the province of eastern gojjam faces a drinking water shortage and hence boreholes are drying moreover the hidden nature of the resource and application of conventional methods of preparing groundwater potential zones are primarily based on ground surveys ganapuram et al 2009 falowo et al 2019 such study usually too costly and time consuming and resulted in developmental failure enormous costs and drying up of wells vanum et al 2016 thus situations are disappointing frustrating and sometimes shocking for numerous groundwater users and planners and lead to the need to apply new technologies such as rs and gis the application of rs and gis a contemporary advanced technology to identify and map the potential zones of groundwater it is a quicker and more cost effective alternative technique to map various factors relevant to groundwater potential identification hammouri et al 2012 thapa et al 2017 allafta et al 2020 therefore the advancements in rs and gis provide effective tools for groundwater survey and mapping nikolakopoulos and oikonomidis 2015 senanayake et al 2016 the integration of numerous conventional methods with rs techniques and gis technology helps to rise the accuracy of results in identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones and also to diminish partiality on any single method rao et al 2003 the spatio temporal distribution of groundwater not well known in recent years yet though its demand significantly increased in the last couple of decades therefore comprehensive evaluation and identification of available groundwater potentials using advanced technologies such as rs and gis become indispensable before groundwater planning and development programs researchers attempt to use rs and gis in mapping and exploring groundwater potential zones using a variety of techniques such as fuzzy logic analysis fla aouragh et al 2017 tiwari et al 2017 s singha

considering lineaments of the geological structure however in this study among all the above mentioned variety of techniques mcda multi contributing factors integrated with rs and gis as well as ahp were used the objective of this study was to quantify identify and map the spatial coverage of groundwater potential zone this study will also contribute extracting multi values by bilinear interpolation methods of values at point locations for validation which differ from others study to the global community 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study was

clay at six depth intervals 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 to 30 30 to 60 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm deep 2 7 geology the geological data of eastern gojjam zone was organized from four adjoining scanned geological data sheets 1 250000 map scale obtained from the ethiopia mapping agency the geological map sheets of debre tabor nc37 2 debre markos nc37 6 burie nc37 5 and addis ababa nc37 10 were geo referenced by taking four points in arcgis 10 7 1 with a root mean square error rmse of 0 952 0 54 0 86 and 1 00 respectively erdas imagine 2014 used to mosaic the four map sheets with a mosaic image tool the eastern gojjam zone geological map was extracted by mask and digitization was done by the editor toolbox in arcgis 2 8 rainfall daily rainfall data was collected from twenty three meteorological stations monthly and annual rainfall data have been computed from the daily recorded data annual rainfall data from ten years to thirty three years of debre markos lumame motta rebu gebeya amber and eighteen other stations were interpolated to find unknown values of rainfall data from known values inverse distance weight idw analysis was applied to interpolate rainfall data during selection of interpolation method there is no rule of thumb to use which one is accurate and appropriate for a certain analysis however idw is simple easy to understand and efficient in arcgis environment wu and hung 2016 2 9 aquifer productivity classification aquifer productivity in africa is characterized based on a synthesis of drill yield data which is the most widely available data for aquifers according to the british geological survey 2019 based on the approximate ranges of borehole yields liters s 1 five basic types have been identified table 4 aquifer productivity levels are classified as very high 20 l s 1 high 5 20 l s 1 moderate 2 5 l s 1 low 0 1 2 l s 1 and very low 0 1 l s 1 as a result ranges are presumed to refer to the average discharge that would be achieved from a single well placed and constructed borehole in the research area s relevant aquifer see table 5 2 10 multi criteria decision making mcdm the weights of all the detected groundwater contributing elements in themed map layers would be different as a result a multi criteria decision analysis mcda malczewski 1999 method was used in conjunction with an analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 1980 ahp aids in the capturing of objective evaluation metrics and provides a valuable technique for ensuring that the evaluations are consistent hence reducing decision making bias ishizaka alessio and lusti markus 2003 to determine the relative importance or weight of the decision criteria ahp used a pairwise comparisons matrix which entails three steps 1 at each level of the hierarchy beginning at the top create a comparison matrix 2 calculation of consistency ratio and 3 computation of relative importance or weights for each member in the hierarchy c r consistency ratio can be used to assess inconsistency of judgments in criterion weighting through pairwise comparison c r c r is a metric that determines how far a matrix deviates from consistency with a c r value of 10 0 1 or less deemed acceptable saaty 1980 consistency index c i calculated as 6 c i λ max n n 1 c r for each matrix in the hierarchy computed by using the following formula 7 c r c i r i 100 where n is the number of input factors used r i is the random consistency index λ max is the biggest eigenvalue and c r is consistency ratio random index is the average consistency index of a randomly generated comparison matrix as shown in table 6 saaty s ratio index is not functional for n less than two for example when the numbers of input factors are seven ri value is 1 32 finally all thematic map layers analyzed

assigned reclassified pixel value n number of contributing factors 2 11 validation of groundwater potential the results of identifying and mapping groundwater potential zones were validated using boreholes data obtained from east gojjam zone towns and zonal water resource bureau extracting multi values by bilinear interpolation methods of values at point locations was applied in arcmap 10 7 1

zones identification of eastern gojjam using remote sensing and gis technologies shown in fig 2 below 3 results and discussion 3 1 thematic layers 3 1 1 soil texture map soils have diverse water infiltration and storage capacity that depends on the soil texture soil structure and porosity of the soil four soil texture classes such as clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam soil were found in the area the afsp classified soil depth in to six classes 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 60 cm 60 100 cm and 100 200 cm deep soil texture classes clay clay loam sandy clay loam and loam for first up to third depth and clay clay loam and sandy clay loam for each 4th 5th and 6th soil depth fig 3 a shows the plateau of choke mountain shield made up of clay loam and loam type of soil texture that helps water to infiltrate and conduit easily it contributes to highest groundwater discharge obtained in the foothill of choke mountain however the circular belt of eastern gojjam has a clay soil texture which had less infiltration and high water storage capacity since clay soil has a wide range of clay silt and sand proportion it is important to notice that not all area has black cotton clay soil with high clay proportion therefore the soil texture reclassified as clay low infiltration clay loam moderate sandy clay loam high and loam very high infiltration rate as shown in table 8 3 1 2 rainfall map inverse distance weighted idw is a method of determining unknown stations using known values nearby stations of rainfall data obtained from meteorological station the mean annual rainfall of all the stations interpolated with idw high rainfall receiver areas 1514 1750 mm yr 1 such as debre elias amanuel digo tsion gendeywoyen and robu gebeya stations and some parts of debre markos are classified as very high potential while the most eastern part of the study area relatively receives low rainfall and is classified as low to very low potential 898 1150 mm yr 1 most of debre markos yejube amber kuye and felege birhan stations receive high to moderate rainfall and are classified as well according to mwega et al 2013 comparatively areas that receive higher rainfall have greater recharge rates than those with less rainfall received areas 3 1 3 geological map naturally geological formations of the study area are very complex thirty four different types of geology in the study area were identified the major types are choke trachytic plugs choke rhyolite kutye basalt rob gebeya basalts arat mekeraker basalt gypsum bed limestone lower sand stone adigrat sand stone abay sandstone yejube basalt arero gedabo basalt debre markos basalts lumame basalts alluvial soil elluvial soil and lower basalt most geology in the highlands of the study area has moderate to high hydraulic conductivity or productivity on the other hand the aquifer is low in most parts of the abay gorge geology however some geology has highly productive porous and or fissured aquifers and karstified aquifers ferede 2015 because of the detailed geological map scale 1 250 000 the types of geology fig 5 in the study area are numerous lumame basalt yejube basalt and lower lava flow rank first second and third in terms of area coverage respectively fig 5 depicts the identification of thirty four different geological types as depicted in fig 7 geological types have been reclassified with their corresponding class value of very high high moderate low and very low groundwater potential and detailed reclassified information provided in table 8 see figs 6 and 9 3 1 4 drainage density map drainage density dd map shows the landscape dissection runoff potential infiltration capacity of the land climatic conditions and vegetation cover of the basin high dd is the result of weak or impermeable subsurface material sparse vegetation and mountainous relief low drainage density leads to coarse drainage texture while high dd leads to fine drainage texture kanth and hassan 2012 the slope of the land lithology and structure influences dd it affects the runoff pattern if there is a high prescribed amount then the runoff water will drain quickly thus it will have less opportunity to infiltrate into the soil the drainage pattern of the eastern gojjam zone has a radial arrangement starting from the two mountain shields the first and most prominent mountain chain found in the zone is the choke mountain volcanic shield most rivers of abay tributaries starts in a radial arrangement secondly the islamo mountain volcanic rock found in the northeastern part of the study area around mertu lemariam the dd of the study area ranges from 0 175 to 3 74 as shown in fig 4 f the highest value was recorded at the turning point commencement of the abay gorge area while the lowest value was obtained in the study area s eastern region the lower value of dd 0 17 1 assigned to the very high potential of groundwater and given the number 1 dd from 1 to 1 36 given high potential and from 1 36 to 1 72 is moderate 1 72 to 2 23 low and above 2 23 is very low groundwater potential as shown in table 8 as shown in fig 3 d the majority of high temperatures and low rainfall were recorded in the southern southwestern and eastern parts these regions are at the initial point at which a very steep slope begins of the abay river gorge 3 1 5 slope map the slope takes an input surface raster and calculates an output raster containing the slope of each cell the higher the slope value the steeper the terrain and the lower the slope value the flatter the terrain a slope range of 0 77 5 was recorded the slope of the land was reclassified as 0 to 8 5 very high 8 5 to 14 5 high 14 5 to 21 8 moderate 21 8 to 62 4 low and 62 4 to 77 5 very low contribution to groundwater potential table 8 slopes with a flat to gentle slope 0 to 8 5 slope covers first rank and very steep slopes 62 4 77 5 ranks fifth in area coverage table 8 most flat to gentle slopes originated between the edge of abbay gorge and the nearby foot of choke mountain with some undulating low terrain 3 1 6 lineament density ld map lineament density is the total length of lineaments per unit area as expressed in equation 3 yeh et al 2016 lineaments are one important factor for the identification of groundwater potential zones due to their faults and fractures formed by the lithology of the earth sankar 2002 ld ranges from 0 05 to 1 69 and it was reclassified into five different classes the highest value of ld has a high potential for groundwater and vice versa as shown in table 8 areas having the highest ld 1 14 1 69 have a very high contribution to groundwater potential however the lowest ld 0 06 0 42 has a very low groundwater potential contribution as fig 3 c shows ld is within the range of high to very high in northern portion of the study area these areas are the source of river abay in the eastern gojjam zone however at the ending flow out point of the river the lineaments are very low that indicates there is very low to insignificant fracture and faults 3 1 7 land use land cover thematic map sentinel 2a image of the study area was classified into twelve land cover types to make it clear for classification these are forest land grassland agriculture land relay cropping crop grown by retention moisture water bodies built up area bare land river sand abbay limestone reddish rocks abbay white rocks and abbay dark rocks because some land cover features have nearly similar reflectance value which makes supervised classification difficult for instance agricultural lands having a relay cropping seems like grassland and forest accuracy assessment was conducted by taking 249 ground truth points the overall accuracy assessment report of the classification and kappa coefficient was 84 34 and 0 825 respectively and shown in table 7 owing to the vastness of the study area and the closeness of the reflectance value of some land features objects such as limestones looks settlements and some rocks too there are twelve land cover classes for example river dyke sands bear a resemblance to settlements relay cropping areas also have nearly similar reflectance value with grasslands and small shrubs in addition most areas in the study area are covered with cultivation lands agricultural land and relay cropping land whereas water body has lowest area coverage land use land cover classes were classified based on their contribution to groundwater level in the aquifer accordingly forestland grassland and water bodies belongs to very high while relay cropping land and river dyke sands have high contribution the agricultural land and bareland regions have moderate to low groundwater contribution however land uses such as white rocks built up areas abay limestone abay reddish rocks and abay dark colored rocks that have acquitard nature are belongs to very low contribution for groundwater potential as shown in table 8 3 1 8 pairwise comparison matrix of groundwater contributing factors the identified contributing factors of groundwater potential pairwise comparison matrix shown in table 9 below in the pairwise comparison matrix the column of criteria weight of geology slope rainfall lineament density soil drainage density and land cover in their descending order accounts 21 54 16 94 15 37 13 82 12 3 11 21 and 9 24 ranks from one up to seven respectively the calculated λmax value of 7 0774 consistency index ci value of 0 0129 and the random index ri is 1 32 since the n value is seven therefore a consistency ratio cr 0 0098 which is less than 0 1 and acceptable 3 1 9 groundwater potential zones map seven groundwater contributing factors geology slope rainfall lineament density soil drainage density and land cover overlaid by multiplying their corresponding criteria weight table 9 with the assigned raster class value finally a groundwater potential area map was developed as shown in fig 8 below the south western part of the study area has very high groundwater potential as compared to others owing to its very high productive aquifer nature of the geology quaternary basalts receives up to 1750 mm yr 1 rainfall which is the maximum annual rainfall of the area gentle slope topography and better lineament density according to kebede 2013 most very high discharge springs are found in the foothill of the choke mountain chain such as jiga spring which has a discharge of 400 liters s 1 moreover in the study area at sentra wellfield a discharge of 34 37 and 39 5 l s 1 recorded at debre markos town water service borehole 6 10 and 11 respectively most foothills of choke mountain shield volcano extended from north to south part of the zone have high groundwater potential discharged 5 20 liters s 1 despite this fact the eastern part of the study area has moderate to low and very low groundwater potential this is due to very low lineament density aquitard nature of geology heavy clay soil with very low hydraulic conductivity high drainage density very low rainfall receiver areas bichena mertu lemariam and debre work stations and discontinuous and undulated slope nature associated with bare land and large extent of abay gorge rock formations one third of the area of east gojjam zone is within the range of low to very low groundwater potential the area covered by abay gorge drainage characterized by a very steep slope high drainage density very complex geology with hard rocks limestones sandstones and gypsum their hydrogeological nature extends from low very low to aquitard aquifer productivity however it is important to notice that the lineament density of these regions northern eastern to southern is very high approximately 13 and 24 spatial coverage of the study area has very high and high groundwater potential respectively moderate groundwater potential contributes the highest spatial area coverage around 29 2 of the study area above one third nearly 34 of the area is covered with low and very low groundwater potential from which most of the area is found in the belt of abbay gorge area as shown in table 10 3 2 validation of results the results validated using deep well boreholes dug by the government for different towns these boreholes supplied fresh drinking water services for the dwellers living in towns and cities out of six very high discharge boreholes having greater than 20 l s 1 five boreholes validated correctly 83 33 see table 11 on the other hand only 5 high discharged boreholes are in disagreement while 95 validated correctly in moderate discharge boreholes eights are in agreement with the analysis conducted which has 80 accuracy low discharged boreholes have 66 67 accuracy there is no very low borehole drilled in the study area the overall accuracy of the validation result is 87 5 thirty four boreholes from thirty nine boreholes are accurately placed and kappa coefficient k of 0 86 4 conclusions the application of remote sensing and gis is a newly emerged and powerful tool in the area identification and mapping of groundwater potential zones in ancient times groundwater potential was determined and identified by direct checking of hand drilling which is a very costly and time consuming activity as a result drying up of boreholes failure may come across after spending huge money subsequently other methods of determination of groundwater potential zones using only the type of geology and lineaments would not have always positive results for example in the study area at debre markos town wutern wellfield site most boreholes having a productive erosional sediment nature of geology and high lineament density but their groundwater discharge is less than those having less lineament density in the sentera wellfield the application of rs and gis technologies is prominent for groundwater exploration particularly in least developing countries like ethiopia to achieve sdgs in water related policy making planning and development activities therefore this study used seven groundwater contributing factors as an input and integrated application of rs and gis with ahp to determine the groundwater potential zones of eastern gojjam in conclusion about 12 78 179040 6 ha and 24 1 337575 5 ha of the total area found on the foothill side of choke mountain has very high and high groundwater potential respectively approximately two thirds 63 22 of the total area of the eastern gojjam zone has moderate 408965 8 ha low 339759 8 ha and very low 135104 3 ha groundwater potential most of it being found on the steep slope of the abbay gorge area the overall accuracy of the validation result was 87 2 from thirty nine boreholes having spatial referenced data thirty four boreholes correctly matched with the weighted sum overlay

11758,coastal freshwater aquifers are under threat and in many cases gradually decline due to climate change and over extraction of water with the rapidly expanding human activities including agriculture and tourism in this study coastal sedimentary aquifer systems in northern sri lanka were characterized by integrated approaches such as mass balance calculations seawater mixing index smi and water quality index wqi a total of 34 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for field parameters ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen and temperature their major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 no 3 hco 3 and selected trace elements sr ba b as well as stable water isotopes δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o the ec in investigated groundwater samples ranged from 81 to 5690 μs cm mean 1260 μs cm and served as the first indication of seawater intrusion the study region consists of predominantly ca2 hco 3 and na cl water types indicating freshening and seawater intrusions as revealed by a hydrogeochemical facies evaluation hfe diagram the wqi and smi approach indicated that in the study region 50 58 of samples are affected by seawater intrusion up to 28 of seawater admixture was noted based on the mass balance calculation using cl 0 55 156 meq l as a conservative tracer this result significantly correlates with the calculated wqi r 0 944 p 0 000 water isotope values indicated that most of the groundwater in the area is recharged directly from precipitation while some samples showed influences of evaporation and also mixing with seawater in summary the investigated coastal sedimentary aquifer system in the northern part of sri lanka is already severely affected by seawater intrusion however as marked by the dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of monsoonal rains leads to the freshening of groundwater this study showed that wqi combined with mass balance calculations is useful in assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary aquifers mass balance calculation hydrogeochemical facies evaluation diagram water isotopes arid and semi arid zone aquifers 1 introduction at present over 50 of the world s population depends on groundwater as their main source of potable water however contamination of groundwater is becoming a serious issue that reduces the safety and availability of water resources in addition to anthropogenic activities the composition of groundwater is mainly governed by natural processes such as water rock interactions cation exchange processes mineral dissolutions and mixing with saline water appelo and postma 2004 in the meantime over 40 of the world s population centers within 100 km of the coast and most of them rely on coastal aquifers for their domestic and agricultural water requirements un 2017 although coastal aquifers are an important source of fresh water they are under increasing threat of seawater intrusions key pressures on coastal aquifers include over extraction and global climate change which leads to sea level rise and reduction of rainfall ketabchi et al 2016 klassen and allen 2017 due to global climate change the mean sea level of the world rose 11 16 cm in the last century hay et al 2015 several studies predicted that 0 5 1 2 m sea level rises could occur in the 21st century at a rate of 4 mm a kopp et al 2014 siegert et al 2020 this will mobilize the seawater freshwater interface further towards the inland and consequently threatens to contaminate productive aquifers the problem of seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers may become more critical in island nations located in the tropical equatorial belt where rainfall is restricted to limited months of the year holding and allen 2015 in particular seawater intrusion is a major problem in areas with highly permeable sedimentary formations jayathunga et al 2020 mohanty and rao 2019 hence with its growing water demand the recharging and storage mechanisms of groundwater in coastal sedimentary aquifers are of increasing interest anders et al 2014 jayathunga et al 2020 li et al 2017 this also demands an improved understanding of aquifer processes in sedimentary systems to maintain the supply of potable water for basic human needs in coastal regions geochemical and isotope studies in coastal aquifers have been used widely to delineate groundwater recharge zones outline seawater intrusion and evaluate its rates versus groundwater renewal by precipitation cartwright et al 2012 clark and fritz 2013 the applications of such techniques have been shown as attractive tools for evaluations of groundwater systems and for quantifying the mixing between sea and freshwater traditionally more conservative geochemical tracers in groundwater such as cl and water isotopes δ18oh 2 o and δ2hh2o have helped to assess seawater intrusions via mass balance mixing calculations chandrajith et al 2014 2016 han et al 2015 jayathunga et al 2020 mohanty and rao 2019 mondal et al 2011 seddique et al 2019 in addition the water quality index wqi together with a seawater mixing index smi are popular tools for delineating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers gopinath et al 2019 han et al 2015 kanagaraj et al 2018 mondal et al 2011 park et al 2012 seddique et al 2019 shin et al 2020 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 the wqi was first introduced by horton 1965 and is a widely used tool for assessing the suitability of water mainly for human consumption it can help to delineate seawater freshwater interactions in coastal aquifers in the calculation of the wqi major hydrogeochemical parameters such as ph ec or tds cl so 4 2 no 3 and po 4 3 na ca2 etc are often used to obtain an integrated single non dimensional value that provides an overall view of the suitability of water for different purposes in general wqi calculates using drinking water quality standards set by either world health organization who or any other national level standards however such standards are set for drinking purposes and hence cannot be used directly for assessing seawater intrusions or determining the suitability of water for irrigation to overcome this disadvantage many authors employed a ranking of water quality parameters depending on their role in the evaluation purpose gopinath et al 2019 idowu et al 2022 for instance species such as no 3 f hco 3 and po 4 3 play a less significant role in the seawater freshwater mixing process hence least weightage can be assigned parameters such as na ca2 cl and so 4 2 can be assigned a higher weightage due to their significant role in the seawater mixing process sri lanka is a small island located in the indian ocean with a coastal belt of 1620 km in which over 33 of the country s population lives world bank 2017 therefore the coastal region is one of the most important socio economic hubs of the country and important for agriculture industries and also tourism all these factors lead to high water demands the island of sri lanka is also considered a vulnerability hotspot for the predicted climate change marambe et al 2015 it was estimated that the mean annual ambient temperature will increase from 0 9 to 4 c by the year 2100 from 1961 to 1990 the annual rainfall of the country reduced by 144 mm baba 2010 pressure from both anthropogenic activities and the consequences of climate change could enhance the seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers in the coastal region of sri lanka the situation is more critical in the northernmost parts of the island where coastal aquifers are highly permeable and mostly consist of sedimentary sequences and unconsolidated sediments when compared to the rest of the island where crystalline rocks are predominant interestingly the northern terrain of the island is the driest area of the country this aridity exists even though annual average rainfall can reach 1000 mm that is however restricted to monsoon events between october and december on the other hand sedimentary aquifers in this region are the major source of groundwater and become increasingly threatened by seawater intrusions for instance a 1 6 fold increase in groundwater salinity was recorded over the last two decades in the northern region of sri lanka gopalakrishnan et al 2020 these pressures persist because in recent years the northern area of sri lanka has rapidly increased its population densities and agricultural activities the degree of groundwater deterioration due to over extraction for domestic and agricultural activities is yet unknown this also applies to the study region of kilinochchi pooneryn where unconsolidated marine and fluvial aeolian deposits such as red earth yellow brown sands dune and beach sands and lagoonal deposits make patchworks on miocene limestone sequences fig 1 such unconsolidated sedimentary sequences are highly vulnerable to pollution and seawater intrusion bandara et al 2018 chandrajith et al 2014 2016 jayathunga et al 2020 thilakerathne et al 2015 this study aimed to quantify the seawater intrusion in the kilinochchi pooneryn k p region based on geochemical and isotope signatures of groundwater from unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer systems in this context approaches such as calculating ion mass balances and wqi together with facies diagrams are promising to assess mixing mechanisms in this study we aimed to test how robust and easy to apply these methods are for characterizing seawater freshwater interactions the development of such knowledge for coastal aquifers is essential for future management of water resources particularly when facing ever accelerating climate and land use changes and their impacts 2 materials and methods the coastal area of kilinochchi pooneryn k p lies in the northernmost part of the main island of sri lanka fig 1 the area drains by a few small and intermittent streams and has several irrigation reservoirs located mainly on the southern border of the study area these reservoirs retain water for agriculture mostly for rice paddy cultivation the area predominantly consists of quaternary sediments that overlay miocene limestone sequences red and brown earth ferruginous gravel and beach sands are predominant in the study area besides these aquifer materials lagoonal and alluvial deposits are also widely distributed close to the coastal stretch these sediments were likely formed during transgressions and regressions of the ocean during the quaternary period dune sands and red earth deposits are mostly wind blown deposits koralegedara et al 2021 the area is generally flat however a few dunes rise to a height of about 10 m above the mean sea level groundwater in the region is mainly extracted from aquifers in unconsolidated sediments however some deep wells penetrate down to the limestone beds that were encountered 9 22 m below the surface drill log data indicated that the underlain sedimentary rock sequences are tilted towards the north over 84 of the households in the region obtain water from shallow dug wells that are constructed in unconsolidated sediments water scarcity becomes an increasing problem particularly during dry spells that often seriously affect the quality of life in the area punniyarajah 2022 this also puts increasing pressure on the regional groundwater system that becomes mainly recharged during the winter monsoon and to a lesser extent from infiltration residues from the irrigation reservoirs particularly in the southernmost part of the study area for this study groundwater samples were collected during the dry season june 2019 from 34 water supply wells fig 1 before collecting samples wells were pumped at least for 10 min and water temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined in situ using a calibrated hanna hi9828 portable multi parameter device with an uncertainty of 0 1 the total alkalinity of samples was analyzed within 1 h after the sampling by titrating with a 1 6n h2so4 and adding bromocresolgreen methylred indicator with a relative standard deviation of 2 a set of samples were collected into pre cleaned high density polypropylene bottles after passing water through 0 45 μm pore size disposable syringe filters for laboratory analyses of major ions and water isotopes one set of the samples for cation analyses was acidified immediately after the collection to a ph value of about 2 with ultra pure nitric acid non acidified samples were used to measure the anions cl br f so 4 2 no 3 and po 4 3 by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 major cations na k ca2 mg2 and some selected trace elements fe mn sr b ba sr were quantified by icp ms thermo icapq with appropriate quality control the limit of detection of the icp measurements was 0 01 μg l the ion balance error was calculated to determine the analytical precision 75 of all samples had an ion balance error of 5 while the rest were within 10 the higher ion balance error is possibly due to other ions such as fe2 mn2 or from organic loadings that may have been present in samples samples for water isotopes δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o were collected into 15 ml falcon tubes that were sealed tightly with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the dark until their analyses these were carried out using wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy l1102i picarro inc santa clara ca usa and values were reported in a δ notation in per mille against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow coplen 2011 each sample was measured four times sequentially and raw data were corrected for internal memory effects repeat analyses of control samples yielded standard deviations of 0 05 and 0 5 1σ for δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o respectively details of the isotope analyses are available in van geldern and barth 2012 and hemmerle et al 2021 the hydrochemical facies evaluation hfe diagram was constructed using the excel macro introduced by giménez forcada and sánchez san román 2015 all statistical calculations and descriptive statistics including pearson s correlations were calculated using originpro 2020 originlab co for the statistical calculations half of the detection limit was assigned for samples that were reported with values below the quantification limit 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical composition summary results obtained from the analyzed groundwater samples are presented in table 1 and the complete data set is provided as a supplement supplement 1 the depth of the groundwater table from the surface in investigated wells varied from 1 0 m vn 26 28 to 20 m vn32 the mean ph and ec of groundwater in the study region were 7 10 and 1260 μs cm these field data are the first indications of the wide range of geochemical quality variations in the region chloride and so 4 2 are other important indicators of the impact of seawater intrusion the mean cl and so 4 2 of the studied groundwater were 526 and 133 mg l respectively the highest so 4 2 value was found in well vn31 one sample vn38 showed an extremely high value of cl 5516 mg l both these sampling points are located a few meters away from the coast and likely experienced seawater admixtures well as influences of sea spray with subsequent evaporation enrichment among the cations na mean 279 mg l ca2 mean 123 mg l and mg2 mean 43 mg l dominated in the investigated groundwater table 1 the highest na value was also observed in well vn38 as in the case of cl note that in the dry zone regions of sri lanka particularly groundwater extracted from high grade metamorphic aquifers excessive content of f is the most common problem that leads to health issues such as dental and bone fluorosis chandrajith et al 2020 however in the study area where groundwater is obtained from recent sedimentary aquifers the f content varied from 0 01 to 1 98 mg l mean 0 39 mg l while only 2 samples exceeded the threshold value 1 0 mg l recommended for tropical terrains who 2017 interestingly higher levels of f were also noted in wells located close to the coastal stretch boron fe mn sr and ba were other dominant trace elements with mean contents of 313 104 159 1069 and 193 μg l respectively particularly arsenic as is an element of concern that is frequently found in elevated levels in coastal aquifer systems in sri lanka amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 for instance mannar island located close to the study area with similar geology showed up to 75 μg l as in groundwater bandara et al 2018 in the k p aquifers system the total as contents varied from 0 10 to 21 6 μg l with an average value of 2 4 μg l the highest as value was found in a well located very close to the sea vn25 a previous study showed that most of the sand grains in sedimentary coastal aquifer materials in sri lanka are coated with fe and mn oxides and oxyhydroxides which incorporate as and are then released into groundwater under reductive dissolution processes amarathunga et al 2019 3 2 graphical groundwater characterization different graphical techniques are widely used to characterize and categorize groundwaters into different facies appelo and postma 2004 in our study we chose the hydrogeochemical facies evolution hfe diagram proposed by giménez forcada 2010 as the best way of presenting geochemical data it is also widely used for delineating groundwater salinization processes in coastal aquifers aladejana et al 2021 bahir et al 2020 giménez forcada 2019 han et al 2015 seddique et al 2019 in this diagram major anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and cations ca2 mg2 na k highlight both intrusion and freshening phases in coastal aquifers in addition a conservative mixing line can be drawn to differentiate water samples belonging to the freshening phase from those subject to seawater intrusion the freshening phase occurs through four sub stages before discriminating the freshwater fw samples falling on sub stages and freshwater correspond to water unaffected by seawater intrusion the seawater intrusion phase also considers evaluative sub stages preceding the saltwater condition sw water samples plotted on seawater intrusion sub stages and saltwater correspond to water affected by seawater intrusion samples plotted in the center of the hfe diagram belong to either the freshening or intrusion phases based on their position relative to the mixing line the diagram also allows the grouping of groundwater into different facies bahir et al 2020 giménez forcada 2010 2019 in the hfe diagram the mixing of seawater and freshwater is represented in relative percentages of major anions and cations in which hco 3 shows the dominant anions in freshwater while cl indicates the saline water the base exchange reactions in groundwater are shown by the na k and ca2 by abscissas giménez forcada 2019 the hfe diagram constructed for the k p aquifers indicated that the majority of groundwater samples were either na cl type seawater facies or ca2 hco 3 freshwater facies fig 2 in the hfe diagram facies types represented in the central part can be considered as mixing phases of seawater and freshwater aladejana et al 2021 only a few wells with mixed ca2 cl type waters likely represent the inland saline wedge accordingly some samples showed a transformation phase with either intrusion or freshening of groundwater some wells in the study area were represented by ca2 mg2 hco 3 the type that represents freshwater e g well nos vn 2 3 28 31 32 and 35 usually freshwater groundwaters are characterized by ca2 mg2 hco 3 facies in which ca2 predominates compared to mg2 this is likely a result of the dissolution of calcite appelo and postma 2004 with the advancing intrusion of seawater na cl water transforms into ca2 cl type due to ion exchange of na with ca2 provided that enough ca2 is present in minerals in sandy aquifers on the other hand freshening can occur in aquifers that may release na from exchange sites of minerals leading to the formation of na hco 3 waters appelo 1994 additionally in terrains that are underlain by carbonate rocks salinized groundwater can also be buffered due to the upward discharge of ca2 rich groundwater reversing na cl type water to ca2 cl or ca2 hco 3 water bandara et al 2018 this may have been the case with some of the samples in which ec may serve as an additional indicator of seawater inputs 3 3 ion exchange in groundwater one of the distinguishing features of coastal alluvial aquifers is the ion exchange between the solute and aquifer minerals which can be characterized through ionic ratios ionic ratios such as na cl ca2 mg2 cl hco 3 and cl br are widely used in delineating salinization processes in coastal aquifer systems gopinath et al 2019 han et al 2015 senthilkumar and gnanasundar 2021 among investigated anionic constituents cl br and so 4 2 play an important role in groundwater seawater interaction cl hco 3 molar ratios with values higher than 1 5 usually indicate seawater intrusion mahesha and lakshmikant 2014 as indicated by the cl hco 3 molar ratios of our sample population 47 of samples were moderate to severely influenced by seawater while 6 had ratios higher than 6 6 and counted as extremely affected in addition when the cl hco 3 was higher than 1 3 the na cl molar ratio also fell near the composition of seawater with na cl 0 86 fig 3 a only groundwaters with cl hco 3 ratios below 1 3 showed a wider variety of the na cl molar ratios these samples were likely influenced by reverse cation exchange processes a strong positive correlation was also obtained between na and cl r 0 919 p 0 00 thus indicating their common sources chloride is a ubiquitous component in many groundwaters but it is the dominating ion in seawater moreover the concentration of br is mostly low in freshwater but it is an important trace ion to ascertain the possible salinization in coastal aquifers senthilkumar and gnanasundar 2021 usually cl and br are significantly and positively correlated in coastal aquifers the person s correlation obtained for cl and br in the k p aquifer system was 0 957 thus suggesting their similar source of origin the br cl molar ratios in our groundwater samples varied from 7 0 10 5 to 7 8 10 2 molar ratios above 1 5 10 3 are an indication of marine origin seddique et al 2019 vengosh 2003 accordingly samples with a lower ratio are representing groundwaters of freshwater origin in our case nearly 24 of samples showed freshwater conditions on the other hand the dominance of ions such as cl and br fig 3b and higher ec that increased with cl in some of the groundwater samples from the k p terrain indicated the significant impact or direct mixing of seawater fig 3c 3 4 water isotopes in coastal groundwater the stable isotope composition of water is widely used for obtaining information on precipitation evaporation and mixing of groundwater clark and fritz 2013 the isotopic composition of the groundwater collected from the study region ranged from 6 4 to 2 7 for δ18oh2o and from 40 5 to 18 4 for δ2hh2o table 2 fig 4a the local meteoric water line lmwl defined for the region is δ2hh2o 7 8 δ18oh2o 10 3 r2 0 98 edirisinghe et al 2020 most groundwater isotope values were plotted below the lmwl and yielded a regression of δ2hh2o 5 85 δ18oh2o 1 97 r2 0 978 fig 4 a unless evaporated during the irrigation water isotopes are considered to be conservative in shallow aquifers and therefore can be used to estimate saline water intrusions and groundwater mineralization in coastal aquifers bahir et al 2020 chandrajith et al 2014 jayathunga et al 2020 in the study region some of the samples plotted on the lmwl indicating their meteoric origin with negligible modification before infiltration however some samples subjected to both evaporative enrichment and seawater mixing as shown in the cl and δ18oh2o plot fig 4b higher values in both cl and δ18oh2o that approach those of seawater δ18oh2o 4 3 in palk bay are characteristic features of seawater intrusion enriched values of δ18oh2o can however also indicate evaporative losses of water the area is a semi arid region of the country and extensive evaporative losses can be expected from the unsaturated zone before or during irrigation or from the nearby reservoirs the latter process seems to have played a minor role because water isotope values of wells located close to the irrigation reservoirs matched rainwater isotope values and thus indicated rapid infiltration without any further modifications this picture may however change when including future measurements of the reservoir and irrigation waters after long dry spells 3 5 mass balance calculation in this study a two component mass balance model was used to estimate the seawater freshwater mixing considering δ18oh2o and cl as conservative traces the sample with the lowest ec values vn 23 was considered the most unaffected groundwater the δ18oh2o value 4 3 obtained from a seawater sample collected from palk bay was used as the seawater endmember for the calculation the mixing of groundwater with seawater was calculated by the following equation appelo and postma 2004 f x g w x f w x s w x f w 100 where f is the proportion of intruded seawater x gw is the cl content or δ18oh2o in each selected groundwater sample x fw is the average of cl content or δ18oh2o composition in the end member sample and x sw is the cl content or δ18oh2o composition nearby saltwater in this case the average sea water cl content 19 400 mg l was considered as clsw in the calculation when considering cl as a tracer 0 28 of sweater mixing was observed while it was 0 34 when using the δ18oh2o values table 2 this is generally a good agreement and minor mismatches between these two approaches may be due to the enrichment of heavy isotopes during evaporation under semi arid to arid conditions during non monsoon times another reason might be additional cl inputs to groundwater via anthropogenic activities such as the contaminations from sewage disposals or fertilizers applications chandrajith et al 2016 3 6 seawater mixing index smi this index also serves as an effective tool for investigating the influences of seawater on freshwater aladejana et al 2021 kanagaraj et al 2018 park et al 2005 2012 seddique et al 2019 in this approach important major ions of seawater na cl mg2 and so 4 2 are considered for the calculation the smi can be written as follows park et al 2005 smi a c na t na b c mg t mg c c cl t cl d c so 4 t s o 4 where a b c and d are the relative concentration fractions of na mg2 cl and so 4 2 in seawater that are usually associated with factors of 0 31 0 04 0 57 and 0 08 respectively aladejana et al 2021 seddique et al 2019 c is the concentration of a respective parameter in the groundwater sample in mg l and t represents the regional threshold values of the particular ion obtained from cumulative probability curves park et al 2005 according to this scheme smi values higher than 1 indicate influences of seawater park et al 2005 in this study the first reflection point in the cumulative frequency curves supplement fig s1 was considered as the regional threshold values t which were 109 6 12 95 318 9 and 48 8 mg l for na mg2 cl and so 4 2 respectively for the studied groundwater na and so 4 2 showed two threshold values however the upper values seemed too high and therefore the lower reflection value was considered as suggested by seddique et al 2019 based on the calculated smi for the k p region nearly half of the samples fell into the non mixed category table 2 these results were nearly comparable with the results obtained from cl hco 3 molar ratios moreover our smi index values correlated significantly r 0 978 p 0 000 with the mixing percentages calculated using cl as a tracer 3 7 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi is a widely used tool in which a single figure is obtained using the weighted average of different water quality parameters such as ph ec major anions and cations it is employed widely for rating water for drinking purposes but can also be used for assessing irrigation suitability and possible health risks of consumption wu et al 2018 so far few studies used the wqi for rating coastal groundwater that may be contaminated by seawater intrusions gopinath et al 2019 idowu et al 2022 in most cases the calculation of the wqi involves direct usage of water quality guideline limits recommended by the who or any other national or international organizations couillard and lefebvre 1985 however in the calculation of the wqi different weights for selected water quality parameters can be assigned by considering their importance for different purposes such as drinking or irrigation in this study the weighting for each parameter has been assigned on a 1 to 5 scale based on their significance during the seawater freshwater mixing processes in this study ec cl so 4 2 ca2 mg2 and na were assigned with a maximum weight of 5 and hco 3 with 4 the parameters ph f and k were assigned a score of 3 as they are less affected during mixing processes table 1 in wqi calculation the weights can be incorporated with the water quality parameters and weights can be chosen based on the importance of the individual parameters therefore the wqi method offers an attractive alternative in water quality assessment programs in this study we considered ec as it is the very first indication and also an easily measurable parameter to assess the mixing of different waters compared to the total dissolved solids tds both these are inter correlated measures and are often used as water quality parameters to indicate salinity levels in coastal aquafers appelo and postma 2004 the ec is a measure of the capacity to conduct electrical charges which depend on the temperature ion concentration and the ionic strength in the solution whereas tds is a measure of the dissolved ion concentration hem 1985 however ec does not include any natural species but can be determined on site by portable devices compared to tds which required laboratory testing hence being time consuming in the other hand ec values can be converted to the tds by using a simple empirical equation therefore both parameters mostly have a linear relationship appelo and postma 2004 in this study we considered ec which is a simple and direct indication of mixing different waters in the wqi calculation the weights of each parameter wi were used to obtain the normalized relative weight wi by 1 w i w i i n w i the concentrations of each parameter ci in mg l were then standardized concerning who threshold levels si who 2011 to obtain the partial wqi score qi for each parameter i q i c i s i 100 in this case si of ph was considered as 7 and the overall wqi for each sampling location was obtained by wqi i 1 m w i q i based on the values obtained from the calculation water samples can be categorized into five groups as no contamination of seawater 50 slightly impacted 50 100 moderately impacted 100 200 highly impacted 200 300 and extremely impacted 300 according to this scheme about 29 of the studied samples can be categorized as water without any impact on seawater while 58 fell into the moderate and high impact groups only one sample was heavily influenced by seawater table 2 the wqi calculated was based on the ranking of parameters and also a significant correlation was obtained with the mixing percentage calculated using cl r 0 944 p 0 000 as the tracer but lesser correlation with δ18o this indicates that at least for our study cl is a more robust tracer of the seawater intrusion when compared to water isotopes which are readily modified during evaporation the wqi also significantly correlates with the smi r 0 965 p 0 000 fig 5 a in addition the wqi decreases with the increasing distance from the coast fig 5b therefore the ranked wqi method is a useful technique and a more appropriate method for identifying coastal regions where seawater intrusions are possible 4 conclusions groundwater in coastal aquifers are highly vulnerable due to seawater intrusions that occur with overexploitation and sea level rise salinization processes in the sedimentary coastal aquifer system in the kilinochchi pooneryn region of northern sri lanka were studied based on its hydrogeochemical characteristics as indicated in the ca2 hco 3 ratios mixing calculations using cl as a conservative tracer saltwater mixing and water quality indices yielded matching results on the degree of seawater intrusion in the studied aquifer systems although mass balance calculations carried out using cl and δ18o as tracers showed closely similar results cl may be a better tracer especially when secondary influences such as sewage or fertilizers are minor this indicates that modifications of water isotope composition ratios by evaporation in semi arid and arid areas may be more sensitive to water isotopes than to solute contents among many other methods used in evaluating aquifer salinization processes the wqi calculation integrating with mass balance calculation proved a robust way of delineating the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi arid regions in the wqi calculations ranking of parameters considering their importance in the mixing processes is an important aspect rather than directly using water quality standards alone the main disadvantage in wqi calculation is the use of water quality guideline values that are described mainly for health concerns funding this work was financially supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation germany under the institutional partnership

11758,coastal freshwater aquifers are under threat and in many cases gradually decline due to climate change and over extraction of water with the rapidly expanding human activities including agriculture and tourism in this study coastal sedimentary aquifer systems in northern sri lanka were characterized by integrated approaches such as mass balance calculations seawater mixing index smi and water quality index wqi a total of 34 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for field parameters ph electrical conductivity ec dissolved oxygen and temperature their major ions ca2 mg2 na k cl so4 2 no 3 hco 3 and selected trace elements sr ba b as well as stable water isotopes δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o the ec in investigated groundwater samples ranged from 81 to 5690 μs cm mean 1260 μs cm and served as the first indication of seawater intrusion the study region consists of predominantly ca2 hco 3 and na cl water types indicating freshening and seawater intrusions as revealed by a hydrogeochemical facies evaluation hfe diagram the wqi and smi approach indicated that in the study region 50 58 of samples are affected by seawater intrusion up to 28 of seawater admixture was noted based on the mass balance calculation using cl 0 55 156 meq l as a conservative tracer this result significantly correlates with the calculated wqi r 0 944 p 0 000 water isotope values indicated that most of the groundwater in the area is recharged directly from precipitation while some samples showed influences of evaporation and also mixing with seawater in summary the investigated coastal sedimentary aquifer system in the northern part of sri lanka is already severely affected by seawater intrusion however as marked by the dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of monsoonal rains leads to the freshening of groundwater this study showed that wqi combined with mass balance calculations is useful in assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi arid regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords sedimentary aquifers mass balance calculation hydrogeochemical facies evaluation diagram water isotopes arid and semi arid zone aquifers 1 introduction at present over 50 of the world s population depends on groundwater as their main source of potable water however contamination of groundwater is becoming a serious issue that reduces the safety and availability of water resources in addition to anthropogenic activities the composition of groundwater is mainly governed by natural processes such as water rock interactions cation exchange processes mineral dissolutions and mixing with saline water appelo and postma 2004 in the meantime over 40 of the world s population centers within 100 km of the coast and most of them rely on coastal aquifers for their domestic and agricultural water requirements un 2017 although coastal aquifers are an important source of fresh water they are under increasing threat of seawater intrusions key pressures on coastal aquifers include over extraction and global climate change which leads to sea level rise and reduction of rainfall ketabchi et al 2016 klassen and allen 2017 due to global climate change the mean sea level of the world rose 11 16 cm in the last century hay et al 2015 several studies predicted that 0 5 1 2 m sea level rises could occur in the 21st century at a rate of 4 mm a kopp et al 2014 siegert et al 2020 this will mobilize the seawater freshwater interface further towards the inland and consequently threatens to contaminate productive aquifers the problem of seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers may become more critical in island nations located in the tropical equatorial belt where rainfall is restricted to limited months of the year holding and allen 2015 in particular seawater intrusion is a major problem in areas with highly permeable sedimentary formations jayathunga et al 2020 mohanty and rao 2019 hence with its growing water demand the recharging and storage mechanisms of groundwater in coastal sedimentary aquifers are of increasing interest anders et al 2014 jayathunga et al 2020 li et al 2017 this also demands an improved understanding of aquifer processes in sedimentary systems to maintain the supply of potable water for basic human needs in coastal regions geochemical and isotope studies in coastal aquifers have been used widely to delineate groundwater recharge zones outline seawater intrusion and evaluate its rates versus groundwater renewal by precipitation cartwright et al 2012 clark and fritz 2013 the applications of such techniques have been shown as attractive tools for evaluations of groundwater systems and for quantifying the mixing between sea and freshwater traditionally more conservative geochemical tracers in groundwater such as cl and water isotopes δ18oh 2 o and δ2hh2o have helped to assess seawater intrusions via mass balance mixing calculations chandrajith et al 2014 2016 han et al 2015 jayathunga et al 2020 mohanty and rao 2019 mondal et al 2011 seddique et al 2019 in addition the water quality index wqi together with a seawater mixing index smi are popular tools for delineating seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers gopinath et al 2019 han et al 2015 kanagaraj et al 2018 mondal et al 2011 park et al 2012 seddique et al 2019 shin et al 2020 tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 the wqi was first introduced by horton 1965 and is a widely used tool for assessing the suitability of water mainly for human consumption it can help to delineate seawater freshwater interactions in coastal aquifers in the calculation of the wqi major hydrogeochemical parameters such as ph ec or tds cl so 4 2 no 3 and po 4 3 na ca2 etc are often used to obtain an integrated single non dimensional value that provides an overall view of the suitability of water for different purposes in general wqi calculates using drinking water quality standards set by either world health organization who or any other national level standards however such standards are set for drinking purposes and hence cannot be used directly for assessing seawater intrusions or determining the suitability of water for irrigation to overcome this disadvantage many authors employed a ranking of water quality parameters depending on their role in the evaluation purpose gopinath et al 2019 idowu et al 2022 for instance species such as no 3 f hco 3 and po 4 3 play a less significant role in the seawater freshwater mixing process hence least weightage can be assigned parameters such as na ca2 cl and so 4 2 can be assigned a higher weightage due to their significant role in the seawater mixing process sri lanka is a small island located in the indian ocean with a coastal belt of 1620 km in which over 33 of the country s population lives world bank 2017 therefore the coastal region is one of the most important socio economic hubs of the country and important for agriculture industries and also tourism all these factors lead to high water demands the island of sri lanka is also considered a vulnerability hotspot for the predicted climate change marambe et al 2015 it was estimated that the mean annual ambient temperature will increase from 0 9 to 4 c by the year 2100 from 1961 to 1990 the annual rainfall of the country reduced by 144 mm baba 2010 pressure from both anthropogenic activities and the consequences of climate change could enhance the seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers in the coastal region of sri lanka the situation is more critical in the northernmost parts of the island where coastal aquifers are highly permeable and mostly consist of sedimentary sequences and unconsolidated sediments when compared to the rest of the island where crystalline rocks are predominant interestingly the northern terrain of the island is the driest area of the country this aridity exists even though annual average rainfall can reach 1000 mm that is however restricted to monsoon events between october and december on the other hand sedimentary aquifers in this region are the major source of groundwater and become increasingly threatened by seawater intrusions for instance a 1 6 fold increase in groundwater salinity was recorded over the last two decades in the northern region of sri lanka gopalakrishnan et al 2020 these pressures persist because in recent years the northern area of sri lanka has rapidly increased its population densities and agricultural activities the degree of groundwater deterioration due to over extraction for domestic and agricultural activities is yet unknown this also applies to the study region of kilinochchi pooneryn where unconsolidated marine and fluvial aeolian deposits such as red earth yellow brown sands dune and beach sands and lagoonal deposits make patchworks on miocene limestone sequences fig 1 such unconsolidated sedimentary sequences are highly vulnerable to pollution and seawater intrusion bandara et al 2018 chandrajith et al 2014 2016 jayathunga et al 2020 thilakerathne et al 2015 this study aimed to quantify the seawater intrusion in the kilinochchi pooneryn k p region based on geochemical and isotope signatures of groundwater from unconsolidated sedimentary aquifer systems in this context approaches such as calculating ion mass balances and wqi together with facies diagrams are promising to assess mixing mechanisms in this study we aimed to test how robust and easy to apply these methods are for characterizing seawater freshwater interactions the development of such knowledge for coastal aquifers is essential for future management of water resources particularly when facing ever accelerating climate and land use changes and their impacts 2 materials and methods the coastal area of kilinochchi pooneryn k p lies in the northernmost part of the main island of sri lanka fig 1 the area drains by a few small and intermittent streams and has several irrigation reservoirs located mainly on the southern border of the study area these reservoirs retain water for agriculture mostly for rice paddy cultivation the area predominantly consists of quaternary sediments that overlay miocene limestone sequences red and brown earth ferruginous gravel and beach sands are predominant in the study area besides these aquifer materials lagoonal and alluvial deposits are also widely distributed close to the coastal stretch these sediments were likely formed during transgressions and regressions of the ocean during the quaternary period dune sands and red earth deposits are mostly wind blown deposits koralegedara et al 2021 the area is generally flat however a few dunes rise to a height of about 10 m above the mean sea level groundwater in the region is mainly extracted from aquifers in unconsolidated sediments however some deep wells penetrate down to the limestone beds that were encountered 9 22 m below the surface drill log data indicated that the underlain sedimentary rock sequences are tilted towards the north over 84 of the households in the region obtain water from shallow dug wells that are constructed in unconsolidated sediments water scarcity becomes an increasing problem particularly during dry spells that often seriously affect the quality of life in the area punniyarajah 2022 this also puts increasing pressure on the regional groundwater system that becomes mainly recharged during the winter monsoon and to a lesser extent from infiltration residues from the irrigation reservoirs particularly in the southernmost part of the study area for this study groundwater samples were collected during the dry season june 2019 from 34 water supply wells fig 1 before collecting samples wells were pumped at least for 10 min and water temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were determined in situ using a calibrated hanna hi9828 portable multi parameter device with an uncertainty of 0 1 the total alkalinity of samples was analyzed within 1 h after the sampling by titrating with a 1 6n h2so4 and adding bromocresolgreen methylred indicator with a relative standard deviation of 2 a set of samples were collected into pre cleaned high density polypropylene bottles after passing water through 0 45 μm pore size disposable syringe filters for laboratory analyses of major ions and water isotopes one set of the samples for cation analyses was acidified immediately after the collection to a ph value of about 2 with ultra pure nitric acid non acidified samples were used to measure the anions cl br f so 4 2 no 3 and po 4 3 by ion chromatography dionex ics 1100 major cations na k ca2 mg2 and some selected trace elements fe mn sr b ba sr were quantified by icp ms thermo icapq with appropriate quality control the limit of detection of the icp measurements was 0 01 μg l the ion balance error was calculated to determine the analytical precision 75 of all samples had an ion balance error of 5 while the rest were within 10 the higher ion balance error is possibly due to other ions such as fe2 mn2 or from organic loadings that may have been present in samples samples for water isotopes δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o were collected into 15 ml falcon tubes that were sealed tightly with parafilm and stored at 4 c in the dark until their analyses these were carried out using wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy l1102i picarro inc santa clara ca usa and values were reported in a δ notation in per mille against the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow coplen 2011 each sample was measured four times sequentially and raw data were corrected for internal memory effects repeat analyses of control samples yielded standard deviations of 0 05 and 0 5 1σ for δ18oh2o and δ2hh2o respectively details of the isotope analyses are available in van geldern and barth 2012 and hemmerle et al 2021 the hydrochemical facies evaluation hfe diagram was constructed using the excel macro introduced by giménez forcada and sánchez san román 2015 all statistical calculations and descriptive statistics including pearson s correlations were calculated using originpro 2020 originlab co for the statistical calculations half of the detection limit was assigned for samples that were reported with values below the quantification limit 3 results and discussion 3 1 geochemical composition summary results obtained from the analyzed groundwater samples are presented in table 1 and the complete data set is provided as a supplement supplement 1 the depth of the groundwater table from the surface in investigated wells varied from 1 0 m vn 26 28 to 20 m vn32 the mean ph and ec of groundwater in the study region were 7 10 and 1260 μs cm these field data are the first indications of the wide range of geochemical quality variations in the region chloride and so 4 2 are other important indicators of the impact of seawater intrusion the mean cl and so 4 2 of the studied groundwater were 526 and 133 mg l respectively the highest so 4 2 value was found in well vn31 one sample vn38 showed an extremely high value of cl 5516 mg l both these sampling points are located a few meters away from the coast and likely experienced seawater admixtures well as influences of sea spray with subsequent evaporation enrichment among the cations na mean 279 mg l ca2 mean 123 mg l and mg2 mean 43 mg l dominated in the investigated groundwater table 1 the highest na value was also observed in well vn38 as in the case of cl note that in the dry zone regions of sri lanka particularly groundwater extracted from high grade metamorphic aquifers excessive content of f is the most common problem that leads to health issues such as dental and bone fluorosis chandrajith et al 2020 however in the study area where groundwater is obtained from recent sedimentary aquifers the f content varied from 0 01 to 1 98 mg l mean 0 39 mg l while only 2 samples exceeded the threshold value 1 0 mg l recommended for tropical terrains who 2017 interestingly higher levels of f were also noted in wells located close to the coastal stretch boron fe mn sr and ba were other dominant trace elements with mean contents of 313 104 159 1069 and 193 μg l respectively particularly arsenic as is an element of concern that is frequently found in elevated levels in coastal aquifer systems in sri lanka amarathunga et al 2019 bandara et al 2018 for instance mannar island located close to the study area with similar geology showed up to 75 μg l as in groundwater bandara et al 2018 in the k p aquifers system the total as contents varied from 0 10 to 21 6 μg l with an average value of 2 4 μg l the highest as value was found in a well located very close to the sea vn25 a previous study showed that most of the sand grains in sedimentary coastal aquifer materials in sri lanka are coated with fe and mn oxides and oxyhydroxides which incorporate as and are then released into groundwater under reductive dissolution processes amarathunga et al 2019 3 2 graphical groundwater characterization different graphical techniques are widely used to characterize and categorize groundwaters into different facies appelo and postma 2004 in our study we chose the hydrogeochemical facies evolution hfe diagram proposed by giménez forcada 2010 as the best way of presenting geochemical data it is also widely used for delineating groundwater salinization processes in coastal aquifers aladejana et al 2021 bahir et al 2020 giménez forcada 2019 han et al 2015 seddique et al 2019 in this diagram major anions hco 3 cl so 4 2 and cations ca2 mg2 na k highlight both intrusion and freshening phases in coastal aquifers in addition a conservative mixing line can be drawn to differentiate water samples belonging to the freshening phase from those subject to seawater intrusion the freshening phase occurs through four sub stages before discriminating the freshwater fw samples falling on sub stages and freshwater correspond to water unaffected by seawater intrusion the seawater intrusion phase also considers evaluative sub stages preceding the saltwater condition sw water samples plotted on seawater intrusion sub stages and saltwater correspond to water affected by seawater intrusion samples plotted in the center of the hfe diagram belong to either the freshening or intrusion phases based on their position relative to the mixing line the diagram also allows the grouping of groundwater into different facies bahir et al 2020 giménez forcada 2010 2019 in the hfe diagram the mixing of seawater and freshwater is represented in relative percentages of major anions and cations in which hco 3 shows the dominant anions in freshwater while cl indicates the saline water the base exchange reactions in groundwater are shown by the na k and ca2 by abscissas giménez forcada 2019 the hfe diagram constructed for the k p aquifers indicated that the majority of groundwater samples were either na cl type seawater facies or ca2 hco 3 freshwater facies fig 2 in the hfe diagram facies types represented in the central part can be considered as mixing phases of seawater and freshwater aladejana et al 2021 only a few wells with mixed ca2 cl type waters likely represent the inland saline wedge accordingly some samples showed a transformation phase with either intrusion or freshening of groundwater some wells in the study area were represented by ca2 mg2 hco 3 the type that represents freshwater e g well nos vn 2 3 28 31 32 and 35 usually freshwater groundwaters are characterized by ca2 mg2 hco 3 facies in which ca2 predominates compared to mg2 this is likely a result of the dissolution of calcite appelo and postma 2004 with the advancing intrusion of seawater na cl water transforms into ca2 cl type due to ion exchange of na with ca2 provided that enough ca2 is present in minerals in sandy aquifers on the other hand freshening can occur in aquifers that may release na from exchange sites of minerals leading to the formation of na hco 3 waters appelo 1994 additionally in terrains that are underlain by carbonate rocks salinized groundwater can also be buffered due to the upward discharge of ca2 rich groundwater reversing na cl type water to ca2 cl or ca2 hco 3 water bandara et al 2018 this may have been the case with some of the samples in which ec may serve as an additional indicator of seawater inputs 3 3 ion exchange in groundwater one of the distinguishing features of coastal alluvial aquifers is the ion exchange between the solute and aquifer minerals which can be characterized through ionic ratios ionic ratios such as na cl ca2 mg2 cl hco 3 and cl br are widely used in delineating salinization processes in coastal aquifer systems gopinath et al 2019 han et al 2015 senthilkumar and gnanasundar 2021 among investigated anionic constituents cl br and so 4 2 play an important role in groundwater seawater interaction cl hco 3 molar ratios with values higher than 1 5 usually indicate seawater intrusion mahesha and lakshmikant 2014 as indicated by the cl hco 3 molar ratios of our sample population 47 of samples were moderate to severely influenced by seawater while 6 had ratios higher than 6 6 and counted as extremely affected in addition when the cl hco 3 was higher than 1 3 the na cl molar ratio also fell near the composition of seawater with na cl 0 86 fig 3 a only groundwaters with cl hco 3 ratios below 1 3 showed a wider variety of the na cl molar ratios these samples were likely influenced by reverse cation exchange processes a strong positive correlation was also obtained between na and cl r 0 919 p 0 00 thus indicating their common sources chloride is a ubiquitous component in many groundwaters but it is the dominating ion in seawater moreover the concentration of br is mostly low in freshwater but it is an important trace ion to ascertain the possible salinization in coastal aquifers senthilkumar and gnanasundar 2021 usually cl and br are significantly and positively correlated in coastal aquifers the person s correlation obtained for cl and br in the k p aquifer system was 0 957 thus suggesting their similar source of origin the br cl molar ratios in our groundwater samples varied from 7 0 10 5 to 7 8 10 2 molar ratios above 1 5 10 3 are an indication of marine origin seddique et al 2019 vengosh 2003 accordingly samples with a lower ratio are representing groundwaters of freshwater origin in our case nearly 24 of samples showed freshwater conditions on the other hand the dominance of ions such as cl and br fig 3b and higher ec that increased with cl in some of the groundwater samples from the k p terrain indicated the significant impact or direct mixing of seawater fig 3c 3 4 water isotopes in coastal groundwater the stable isotope composition of water is widely used for obtaining information on precipitation evaporation and mixing of groundwater clark and fritz 2013 the isotopic composition of the groundwater collected from the study region ranged from 6 4 to 2 7 for δ18oh2o and from 40 5 to 18 4 for δ2hh2o table 2 fig 4a the local meteoric water line lmwl defined for the region is δ2hh2o 7 8 δ18oh2o 10 3 r2 0 98 edirisinghe et al 2020 most groundwater isotope values were plotted below the lmwl and yielded a regression of δ2hh2o 5 85 δ18oh2o 1 97 r2 0 978 fig 4 a unless evaporated during the irrigation water isotopes are considered to be conservative in shallow aquifers and therefore can be used to estimate saline water intrusions and groundwater mineralization in coastal aquifers bahir et al 2020 chandrajith et al 2014 jayathunga et al 2020 in the study region some of the samples plotted on the lmwl indicating their meteoric origin with negligible modification before infiltration however some samples subjected to both evaporative enrichment and seawater mixing as shown in the cl and δ18oh2o plot fig 4b higher values in both cl and δ18oh2o that approach those of seawater δ18oh2o 4 3 in palk bay are characteristic features of seawater intrusion enriched values of δ18oh2o can however also indicate evaporative losses of water the area is a semi arid region of the country and extensive evaporative losses can be expected from the unsaturated zone before or during irrigation or from the nearby reservoirs the latter process seems to have played a minor role because water isotope values of wells located close to the irrigation reservoirs matched rainwater isotope values and thus indicated rapid infiltration without any further modifications this picture may however change when including future measurements of the reservoir and irrigation waters after long dry spells 3 5 mass balance calculation in this study a two component mass balance model was used to estimate the seawater freshwater mixing considering δ18oh2o and cl as conservative traces the sample with the lowest ec values vn 23 was considered the most unaffected groundwater the δ18oh2o value 4 3 obtained from a seawater sample collected from palk bay was used as the seawater endmember for the calculation the mixing of groundwater with seawater was calculated by the following equation appelo and postma 2004 f x g w x f w x s w x f w 100 where f is the proportion of intruded seawater x gw is the cl content or δ18oh2o in each selected groundwater sample x fw is the average of cl content or δ18oh2o composition in the end member sample and x sw is the cl content or δ18oh2o composition nearby saltwater in this case the average sea water cl content 19 400 mg l was considered as clsw in the calculation when considering cl as a tracer 0 28 of sweater mixing was observed while it was 0 34 when using the δ18oh2o values table 2 this is generally a good agreement and minor mismatches between these two approaches may be due to the enrichment of heavy isotopes during evaporation under semi arid to arid conditions during non monsoon times another reason might be additional cl inputs to groundwater via anthropogenic activities such as the contaminations from sewage disposals or fertilizers applications chandrajith et al 2016 3 6 seawater mixing index smi this index also serves as an effective tool for investigating the influences of seawater on freshwater aladejana et al 2021 kanagaraj et al 2018 park et al 2005 2012 seddique et al 2019 in this approach important major ions of seawater na cl mg2 and so 4 2 are considered for the calculation the smi can be written as follows park et al 2005 smi a c na t na b c mg t mg c c cl t cl d c so 4 t s o 4 where a b c and d are the relative concentration fractions of na mg2 cl and so 4 2 in seawater that are usually associated with factors of 0 31 0 04 0 57 and 0 08 respectively aladejana et al 2021 seddique et al 2019 c is the concentration of a respective parameter in the groundwater sample in mg l and t represents the regional threshold values of the particular ion obtained from cumulative probability curves park et al 2005 according to this scheme smi values higher than 1 indicate influences of seawater park et al 2005 in this study the first reflection point in the cumulative frequency curves supplement fig s1 was considered as the regional threshold values t which were 109 6 12 95 318 9 and 48 8 mg l for na mg2 cl and so 4 2 respectively for the studied groundwater na and so 4 2 showed two threshold values however the upper values seemed too high and therefore the lower reflection value was considered as suggested by seddique et al 2019 based on the calculated smi for the k p region nearly half of the samples fell into the non mixed category table 2 these results were nearly comparable with the results obtained from cl hco 3 molar ratios moreover our smi index values correlated significantly r 0 978 p 0 000 with the mixing percentages calculated using cl as a tracer 3 7 water quality index wqi water quality index wqi is a widely used tool in which a single figure is obtained using the weighted average of different water quality parameters such as ph ec major anions and cations it is employed widely for rating water for drinking purposes but can also be used for assessing irrigation suitability and possible health risks of consumption wu et al 2018 so far few studies used the wqi for rating coastal groundwater that may be contaminated by seawater intrusions gopinath et al 2019 idowu et al 2022 in most cases the calculation of the wqi involves direct usage of water quality guideline limits recommended by the who or any other national or international organizations couillard and lefebvre 1985 however in the calculation of the wqi different weights for selected water quality parameters can be assigned by considering their importance for different purposes such as drinking or irrigation in this study the weighting for each parameter has been assigned on a 1 to 5 scale based on their significance during the seawater freshwater mixing processes in this study ec cl so 4 2 ca2 mg2 and na were assigned with a maximum weight of 5 and hco 3 with 4 the parameters ph f and k were assigned a score of 3 as they are less affected during mixing processes table 1 in wqi calculation the weights can be incorporated with the water quality parameters and weights can be chosen based on the importance of the individual parameters therefore the wqi method offers an attractive alternative in water quality assessment programs in this study we considered ec as it is the very first indication and also an easily measurable parameter to assess the mixing of different waters compared to the total dissolved solids tds both these are inter correlated measures and are often used as water quality parameters to indicate salinity levels in coastal aquafers appelo and postma 2004 the ec is a measure of the capacity to conduct electrical charges which depend on the temperature ion concentration and the ionic strength in the solution whereas tds is a measure of the dissolved ion concentration hem 1985 however ec does not include any natural species but can be determined on site by portable devices compared to tds which required laboratory testing hence being time consuming in the other hand ec values can be converted to the tds by using a simple empirical equation therefore both parameters mostly have a linear relationship appelo and postma 2004 in this study we considered ec which is a simple and direct indication of mixing different waters in the wqi calculation the weights of each parameter wi were used to obtain the normalized relative weight wi by 1 w i w i i n w i the concentrations of each parameter ci in mg l were then standardized concerning who threshold levels si who 2011 to obtain the partial wqi score qi for each parameter i q i c i s i 100 in this case si of ph was considered as 7 and the overall wqi for each sampling location was obtained by wqi i 1 m w i q i based on the values obtained from the calculation water samples can be categorized into five groups as no contamination of seawater 50 slightly impacted 50 100 moderately impacted 100 200 highly impacted 200 300 and extremely impacted 300 according to this scheme about 29 of the studied samples can be categorized as water without any impact on seawater while 58 fell into the moderate and high impact groups only one sample was heavily influenced by seawater table 2 the wqi calculated was based on the ranking of parameters and also a significant correlation was obtained with the mixing percentage calculated using cl r 0 944 p 0 000 as the tracer but lesser correlation with δ18o this indicates that at least for our study cl is a more robust tracer of the seawater intrusion when compared to water isotopes which are readily modified during evaporation the wqi also significantly correlates with the smi r 0 965 p 0 000 fig 5 a in addition the wqi decreases with the increasing distance from the coast fig 5b therefore the ranked wqi method is a useful technique and a more appropriate method for identifying coastal regions where seawater intrusions are possible 4 conclusions groundwater in coastal aquifers are highly vulnerable due to seawater intrusions that occur with overexploitation and sea level rise salinization processes in the sedimentary coastal aquifer system in the kilinochchi pooneryn region of northern sri lanka were studied based on its hydrogeochemical characteristics as indicated in the ca2 hco 3 ratios mixing calculations using cl as a conservative tracer saltwater mixing and water quality indices yielded matching results on the degree of seawater intrusion in the studied aquifer systems although mass balance calculations carried out using cl and δ18o as tracers showed closely similar results cl may be a better tracer especially when secondary influences such as sewage or fertilizers are minor this indicates that modifications of water isotope composition ratios by evaporation in semi arid and arid areas may be more sensitive to water isotopes than to solute contents among many other methods used in evaluating aquifer salinization processes the wqi calculation integrating with mass balance calculation proved a robust way of delineating the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi arid regions in the wqi calculations ranking of parameters considering their importance in the mixing processes is an important aspect rather than directly using water quality standards alone the main disadvantage in wqi calculation is the use of water quality guideline values that are described mainly for health concerns funding this work was financially supported by the alexander von humboldt foundation germany under the institutional partnership

11759,the objectives of the study are i to assess arsenic immobilization efficiency by in situ synthesized fes within the porous media under varying solution chemistry and ii the performance evaluation of fes sand matrix in removing arsenic under natural groundwater conditions to achieve the objectives column experiments were performed where fes was synthesized within the porous media in situ then the as iii or as v solution was injected within the column and the effluents were collected to measure arsenic as and iron fe concentrations the groundwater samples were collected from seventeen locations in west bengal india and were characterized the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix from the selected groundwater samples was studied in the batch and column system the result showed that a significant amount of arsenite as iii 71 7 74 9 was immobilized in the fes synthesized porous media the solution ph and the concentration of as iii have an insignificant effect on immobilizing as iii in the porous media system in the ph range of 6 8 arsenate as v immobilization was not very promising under the reducing condition by in situ synthesized fes in the porous media the as v removal was slightly better at ph 6 26 9 compared to ph 8 11 7 the occurrence of as in the groundwater ranging from 0 78 μg l to 376 μg l of the region was found to be associated with aluminum al and fe the as removal by fes sand matrix showed better performance at ph 6 40 7 8 6 compared to that of ph 8 29 2 15 6 in the batch system the immobilization of as increased significantly 83 when the as contaminated groundwater 376 μg l was injected into the porous media containing in situ synthesized fes the concentration of fe also reduced significantly 160 μg l at the effluent after 2 pvs indicating a limited risk of release of fe overall it could be stated that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media has the potential to immobilize as under a reducing environment within a range of ph under the groundwater conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenite arsenate aquifer groundwater in situ remediation west bengal 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater is a well known problem the severity of the problem is alarming in bangladesh and west bengal state of india apart from those places the trace amount of as is also identified in several parts in china latin america and the few locations of north america smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2004 bundschuh et al 2012 inorganic arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most abundant species of as amongst those as iii is likely to be found in the reducing environment in the deep aquifer which is toxic and can be transported easily in the groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2004 thus the occurrence of as in the form of as iii in the groundwater withdrawn from deep aquifers has become a trivial issue numerous studies have focused on as removal using different sorbents relevant for ex situ treatment thus most of those studies have dealt with the removal of as v from the contaminated water in situ remediation of as is also recognized as a promising alternative there are mainly two approaches one is as immobilization under the oxic condition and the other under reducing environment in the last few decades some studies explored the possibilities of treating as in situ under the oxic condition luong et al 2018 the main concept of those reported studies is to create an oxic environment in the aquifer system by aeration and oxygen purging in the porous media van halem et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 yang et al 2018 in several occasions suitable oxidants are also injected along with oxygen in this process the iron fe is transformed in the form of ferric fe iii which can precipitate in the porous media then using the remaining oxidant the as iii can be oxidized to as v which subsequently can get sorbed on the ferric precipitate luong et al 2018 the main limitations of this process are i the limited transformation of as iii to as v and ii the presence of other reducing agents such as ammonia methane sulfide etc those compounds can reduce the efficiency of the process by utilizing the injected oxygen or oxidant iii moreover in the longer duration the fate of the oxidized form of fe and as v is a matter of concern given the aquatic environment in the subsurface tends to be reducing luong et al 2018 few recent studies have also explored the possibility of in situ remediation of as iii under anoxic conditions by injecting the reduced form of fe such as zero valent iron zvi kanel et al 2007 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 or iron sulfide fes han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 pi et al 2017 tiwari et al 2020 abass et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii could be converted into as 0 in the presence of nanoscale zvi nzvi which subsequently get adsorbed on the surface of nzvi furthermore sorption of as is reported to be extensively high on the surface of the iron oxide shell of zvi guo et al 2016 and the surface of fes coated sand han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 few studies han et al 2011 pi et al 2017 xie et al 2016 showed that fes could immobilize as iii under anoxic conditions one of our recent studies tiwari et al 2020 assessed the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as iii under varying injection schedules the result showed that almost 73 of injected as iii was immobilized in the fes containing porous media under the optimal injection schedule the reported studies have suggested that coprecipitation and adsorption are the major mechanisms for as uptake by fes sand matrix the literature review suggests fe based reagents such as fes or zvi have extensive potential for treating as iii especially under anoxic conditions however the performance of the in situ remedial process is dependent on the solution chemistry and natural groundwater conditions several studies have investigated the effect of solution chemistry as speciation gallegos et al 2008 han et al 2011 park et al 2018 on removing as by fes based adsorbent in the batch system and most of the studies have suggested the significant influence of solution chemistry on as fes interaction the concentration of as is another parameter that is likely to vary in the natural system and influences the as uptake efficiency han et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2015 some of the studies park et al 2018 showed the effects of competing anions on as uptake by fes in the batch system the presence of specific anions i e phosphate and chromate are found to have inhibitory effects on as adsorption by fe based adsorbent su and puls 2001 cations can also affect as uptake by fes through adsorption or coprecipitation co presence of several ions along with as in the groundwater is likely impacting the as immobilization efficiency the majority of the reported studies have focused on as iii or as v removal in the batch system and under controlled laboratory conditions the immobilization of as in the porous media under varying solution conditions i e ph as concentration and speciation of as are suggested and under natural groundwater is likely to be influenced by different processes compared to that of the batch system to the best of the authors knowledge not many studies have investigated the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as under varying solution conditions in the packed bed porous media system which is relevant for in situ remediation of as furthermore the performance of the fes sand matrix in removing as under natural groundwater conditions is a critical issue that needs systematic investigation which is not reported widely given the background the objectives of the study are therefore i to assess arsenic immobilization efficiency by in situ synthesized fes within the porous media under varying solution chemistry i e ph arsenic concentration species and ii to evaluate the performance of fes sand matrix in removing arsenic under natural groundwater condition to achieve the objectives column experiments are performed where fes is synthesized within the porous media in situ then the as iii or as v solution is injected within the column from one end and the effluents are collected from the other end for measuring as and fe concentrations furthermore the groundwater samples were collected from seventeen different locations in west bengal india and are characterized the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix from the selected groundwater samples is studied in the batch and column system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 reagents ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o was procured from nice chemicals p ltd and sodium sulphide na2s 9h2o was procured from rfcl ltd india sodium arsenite naaso2 90 and sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o 98 was obtained from sigma aldrich the solution of analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh was used for ph adjustment milli q deionized di water was used for all purpose all the solutions and water except as v water was purged with n2 for deoxygenation the feso4 and na2s solutions 20 mm were prepared prior to injection by dissolving appropriate moles of feso4 na2s salts in 10 ml of n2 purged di water 2 1 2 model subsurface porous media the sand collected from the son river bed bihar india was used as the model subsurface porous media for the 1 d column experiment the sand was also used for the batch experiment where it was mixed with reagents to prepare fes coated sand the sand was sieved using the sieve size of 600 μm 425 μm 300 μm and 150 μm and the sand grain within the size range of 150 μm 600 μm was used as the model porous media the grain size distribution of the porous media is also presented in the supporting material fig s1 the average grain size of the porous media is 0 5 mm and the porosity is 0 42 the detailed protocol for preparing porous media and its characteristics is reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 2 2 column experiments in this study the sand was packed in a 1 d glass column kontes chromeflex having an inner diameter id of 1 cm and a length of 15 cm to represent the model subsurface porous media the column was wet packed with the sand for entire length of the column 15 cm following the protocol reported elsewhere dibyanshu and raychoudhury 2019 dibyanshu et al 2021 the sand was saturated with respective as spiked water or as contaminanted groundwater in each casesfor a duration of 24 h prior to packing after column packing 15 pore volumes pvs of as iii or as v containing water was flushed through the porous media under varying conditions i e the concentration range of 100 μg l 350 μg l ph of 6 and 8 corresponding to the experimental scenarios adopted in different cases as presented in table 1 the porous media was pre saturated with as spiked water or as contaminated groundwater given the aquifer porous media was expected to contain as before injecting reagents once the porous media is pre saturated with as reagents feso4 and na2s were injected to synthesize fes in situ in this study 20 mm of feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternately 0 25 pvs of each reagent in each cycle for a total duration of 1 5 pvs at the column inlet with the help of a peristaltic pump 77120 42 masterflex at a flow rate of 2 58 ml min the above injection schedule for the reagents was adopted in this study because it was identified as the optimal condition for immobilization of as iii as reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 the schematic of entire experimental set up is presented in fig 1 after synthesizing fes within the porous media as spiked water as iii or as v or as contaminated groundwater was injected into the column under the constant head condition where the as spiked water or or as contaminated groundwater was kept in the overhead tank fig 1 the flow rate of as spiked water or as contaminated groundwater was maintained in the range of 0 336 0 03 ml min by placing the overhead tank at a suitable height the flow rate was maintained to ensure laminar flow conditions which is the case for the groundwater flow regime the overhead tank except as v was constantly purged with n2 gas during the entire course of the experiment to maintain anoxic conditions the column was placed horizontally during the injection of the reagents and as the schematic of the experimental set up was presented in fig 1 the experiments were conducted under varying as concentrations ph conditions and in the solution prepared with as iii and as v table 1 case 1 represents 350 μg l of as iii at ph 8 case 2 represents 350 μg l of as iii at ph 6 case 3 represents 100 μg l of as iii at ph 8 case 4 represents 100 μg l of as iii at ph 6 case 5 represents 100 μg l of as v at ph 8 case 6 represents 100 μg l of as v at ph 6 and case 7 represents groundwater containing 376 μg l of as at ph 6 the effluent was collected at regular intervals up to 35 pvs duration 17 h for analysis of total as and fe the concentration of total as and fe were measured using icp ms 7800 icp ms agilent technologies and aas atomic absorption spectroscopy aasice 3000 series thermoscientific respectively the samples collected at the outlet were digested directly by adding 2 v v concentrated nitric acid for 12 h the digested samples were then diluted and filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filter before analysis the detail of the sample analysis protocol was reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 the as and fe concentration at the effluents is represented in the form of a breakthrough curve btc where y axis represents the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 and the x axis represents pv vt εl a dimensionless parameter to represent time t here v is darcy s velocity ε is porosity and l is the length of the porous media packed column the result is also presented by the percentage of retained mass where the percentage of retained mass of as was calculated by deducting the total mass of as eluted at the outlet at different pvs from the total mass of injected as up to that point similarly for the mass balance of fe the total eluted mass of fe at different pvs was calculated from the breakthrough curves and was deducted from the total mass of fe injected up to 1 5 pvs percentage mass retained 100x mass injected mass eluted mass injected 2 3 groundwater sampling and characterization groundwater samples were collected from seventeen different locations in the state of west bengal india the samples were collected from hand pumps and stored in the pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in which 1 of hno3 was added to stabilize the as species smedley and kinniburgh 2002 details of sampling location and corresponding well numbers are indicated in fig 2 and table s1 the collected groundwater samples were analyzed for different cations following the method epa 3015 a where the groundwater sample was first digested in 2 acid for analysis of fe the digestion was done in an acid matrix of hno3 and hcl 4 1 whereas for as and other cations the samples were digested using 2 hno3 for 8 h then the disgested samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm filter after filtration the samples were diluted and the concentration of fe was measured using aas aasice 3000 series thermo scientific the concentration of as and other cations such as aluminum al manganese mn zinc zn copper cu lead pb etc were measured using icp ms 7800 icp ms agilent technologies 2 4 batch experiments with groundwater sample arsenic removal efficiency from the natural groundwater by the fes sand matrix was assessed in the batch system groundwater samples with as concentration exiting 10 μg l no of samples is 11 fig 2 were selected for batch experiments the batch experiments were done for the removal of as at two different ph ph 6 and ph 8 to prepare the fes sand mix 2 g of pre saturated sand was poured in a series of glass vials then 0 25 ml of 20 mm feso4 and 0 25 ml of 20 mm na2s solutions were added alternatively to the sand and were mixed well 50 ml of as contaminated groundwater were then added to each of those vials and the solution was mixed using an end on end rotor at a speed of 30 rpm for 24 h given that duration likely to be sufficient to reach equilibrium condition raychoudhury et al 2015 xie et al 2016 at the end of the experiment samples were collected centrifuged and filtered before digestion then the digested samples are analyzed for total as following the protocol discussed above all the batch experiments were done in duplicate and the average values were presented to better understand the as fes interactions processes the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp or eh of the as contaminated groundwater in the selected batch systems were monitored over time eh orp of the sample was measured by orp meter orion star a214 thermo scientific the data indicating pe calculated from eh with respect to ph of as containing groundwater in the presence and absence of fes coated sand were plotted and the same were superimposed with ph pe diagram of as presented in different forms at equilibrium panagiotaras et al 2012 2 5 correlation analysis pearson s correlation is the test statistic that measures the association between two variables in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to understand the possible association of the presence of as in the groundwater with the other co existing cations secondly to understand the possible influence of the presence of cations on the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix the correlation coefficient between as removal efficiency and the concentration of other cations present in the groundwater sample was calculated pearson s correlation coefficients and correlation matrix were obtained by the available data using the past 2 0 multivariate statistical analysis software as described elsewhere uddameri et al 2014 inanya and raychoudhury 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 immobilization of arsenic under different conditions through porous media containing in situ synthesized fes 3 1 1 effect of ph on immobilization of as iii the effect of ph at ph 6 and 8 on the immobilization of as iii at different concentrations case 1 to case 4 was investigated as summarized in table 1 the normalized effluent concentration of as and fe with respect to pvs is presented in fig 3 the result indicates that for case 2 c 0 350 μg l ph 6 the concentration of as at the outlet is less c c 0 ranges between 0 1 to 0 2 at the initial stage up to 15 pvs compared to that of case 1 c 0 350 μg l ph 8 average c c 0 is approximately 0 26 up to 15 pvs however towards the later stage 15 pv to 35pv a more rapid increase in c c 0 from 0 2 to 0 48 is observed in the case of 2 the effluent as concentration is comparatively less and consistent with a c c 0 value ranging between 0 20 and 0 33 over the entiref duration of as iii injection up to 35 pvs in the case of 1 where the solution ph is maintained at 8 in the case of 4 c 0 100 μg l ph 6 relatively low as iii concentration at the effluent during the first 10 pvs is observed with a c c 0 value of 0 16 however at the later stage a rapid increase in the c c 0 is observed which reaches 0 54 at 35 pvs on the other hand in the case of 3 c 0 100 μg l ph 8 the effluent concentration shows a steady plateau where the c c 0 values vary from 0 20 to 0 30 over the entire experimental duration of 35 pvs the mass balance calculations indicating the percentage of the injected mass of as immobilized in the fes containing porous media are presented in table 1 the results show that the overall as retention is highest 74 9 in the case of 3 c 0 100 μg l ph 8 the percentage of retained mass of as iii for case 1 c 0 350 μg l ph 8 case 2 c 0 350 μg l 6 and case 4 c 0 100 μg l ph 6 are 72 9 71 7 and 73 5 respectively a negligible 1 2 1 4 increase in the as iii retention is observed when the ph decreases from 8 to 6 for both the concentrations as iii immobilization by fes containing porous media was likely to be attributed by the synergistic effect of coprecipitation and chemical reaction bostick and fendorf 2003 gallegos et al 2008 xie et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2007 tiwari et al 2020 han et al 2011 reported that precipitation was a predominant mechanism that leads to the formation of orpiment at ph 5 whereas adsorption is the dominant mechanism for immobilization of as iii at ph 9 by fes coated sand few studies gallegos et al 2008 han et al 2011 have suggested that as iii removal mechanism shifts from precipitation to adsorption when the solution shifts from acidic to basic condition in this study it is observed that there is a limited effect of ph study conducted as ph 6 and ph 8 on as iii immobilization in the concentration range of 100 μg l 1 4 to 350 μg l 1 2 in the porous media system the possibility of release of fe during the synthesis of fes and during immobilization of as was monitored the result fig s2a supplementary material suggests that during the in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting approximately beyond 1 pv for all the cases case 1 to 4 the fe concentration reaches the highest value in the case of 1 as iii c 0 350 μg l ph 8 with a c c 0 value of around 0 24 at 1 5 pv in all other cases cases 2 3 and 4 the c c 0 value lies within a range of0 10 0 13 at 1 5 pv overall more than 93 of injected fe 93 5 94 6 97 5 and 93 6 for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively is retained in the porous media that is used for synthesizing fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as iii is presented in fig 3b at the initial stage 3 4 pvs the concentration of fe is found to be significantly high c c 0 value ranging between 0 02 and 0 12 for all the cases case 1 to 4 however eventually the concentration of fe is reduced significantly and became negligible beyond 15 to18 pvs throughout the column experiment almost 58 9 65 1 66 0 and 48 4 of injected fe are retained within the porous media for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively overall the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that the release of fe might not be a serious concern in the long run during the immobilization of as iii different studies gallegos et al 2008 rickard 2006 have suggested that the solubility of fes increases below a ph value of 6 and was independent above ph 6 thus it could be said that in the ph range of 6 8 which is also relevant for groundwater ph the solubility of fes might not influence the performance of as iii immobilization and are more stable in the form of a precipitate 3 1 2 effect of as iii concentration on immobilization of as iii effect of concentration 100 μg l and 350 μg l on the immobilization of as iii by fes containing porous media under constant ph was also investigated the normalized concentration of as iii and fe with respect to pvs are presented in fig 3 the result indicates that at ph 8 case 1 vs case 3 the c c 0 values for as iii at effluent are slightly less for most of the data points for case 3 c0 350 μg l compared to that of case 1 c0 100 μg l in the majority of the cases the c c 0 values are under 0 2 for the case of 1 c0 100 μg l ph 8 which corresponds to an effluent as concentration of 20 μg l at ph 6 case 2 100 μg l vs case 4 350 μg l the c c 0 values for both the cases are under 0 2 for the first 10 pvs and then the effluent concentration increases steadily up to 35 pvs mass balance calculations indicate that percentage of the retained mass of as is slightly higher around 2 when the concentration of as iii inject low 100 μg l case 3 74 9 at ph 8 and case 4 73 5 at ph 6 compared to that of when the concentration of influent as iii is slightly higher 350 μg l case 1 72 9 at ph 8 and case 2 71 7 at ph 6 though the percentage of removal of as iii does not depend on the initial concentration of as however the sorption and precipitation of as iii per g of fe is higher when the concentration of as iii is high 350 μg l case 1 9 02 mg as g of fe case 2 8 03 mg as g of fe compared to that when as iii is injected at lower concentration 100 μg l case 3 2 36 mg as g fe case 4 3 16 mg as g of fe this observation was in accordance with the equilibrium isotherm trend as observed for other fe based adsorbents raychoudhury et al 2015 han et al 2011 the retained mass of fe is also not correlated with influent as iii concentration the immobilized mass of as iii per g of fe in the porous media as observed in this study 2 36 9 02 mg as g of fe is in the range reported in other studies 9 8 mg g 11 mg g under similar ph conditions han et al 2011 tiwari et al 2020 3 1 3 immobilization of as v under varying ph the performance of in situ synthesized fes in the porous media for immobilization of as v is also assessed in this set of experiments the influent as v concentration was maintained at 100 μg l and the solution ph was varied from 6 to 8 the result fig 4 a indicates that the c c 0 values for as v at effluent reaches a peak value c c 0 1 73 at 4 pvs in the case of 5 as v c 0 100 μg l ph 8 and then it gets stabilized at around a c c 0 value of 0 77 in case 6 as v c 0 100 μg l ph 6 a peak with c c 0 values of 1 2 at 4 pvs is observed and then it gets stabilized at around c c 0 value of 0 61 the c c 0 values for as v become greater than one at a few time points at the initial stage this observation probably implies that the as v retained in the column gets released at the initial stage which is likely to be associated with a high concentration of fe at the outlet fig 4b the mass balance calculation shows that a comparatively high amount of as v is retained at lower ph of 6 26 7 in case 6 compared to that of higher ph of 8 11 7 in case 5 higher sorption of as v at lower ph by iron based adsorbent was suggested in several works of literature dixit and hering 2003 gu et al 2007 raychoudhury et al 2015 speciation of as v and inner sphere surface complexation are likely to be the major factors contributing to a higher degree of as v retention at lower ph for example at lower ph as v is likely to be present in the form of h2aso4 which is expected to be adsorbed better than haso4 2 that are likely to be present at higher ph i e ph 8 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 yan et al 2000 dixit and hering et al 2003 overall the result suggests that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media is not efficient in removing as v under a ph range of 6 8 the fe at the effluent during the synthesis of fes and immobilization of as v was monitored the result fig s2b suggests that during the in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting from 1 2 pvs the c c 0 value reaches 0 03 and 0 11 at 1 5 pvs for case 5 and case 6 respectively more than 95 0 98 7 in case 5 and 95 9 in case 6 of fe is retained in the porous media during the synthesis of fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as v is presented in fig 4b during the immobilization of as v at the initial 1 pv the concentration of fe is found to be significantly high c c 0 value ranging between 0 08 and 0 10 then the fe concentration is reduced and the c c 0 value lies within a range of 0 042 to 0 002 for both cases the negligible concentration of fe is observed beyond 16 pvs throughout the column experiment overall 44 2 and 46 6 of injected fe are retained within the porous media for case 5 and case 6 respectively overall the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that the release of fe is moderate during immobilization of as v 3 2 performance of fes containing porous media in removing arsenic under natural groundwater condition 3 2 1 field sampling from arsenic contaminated region and characterization of groundwater samples the groundwater samples from seventeen locations were collected from the state of west bengal the detail of the sampling location and the concentration of as is presented in fig 2 and table s1 supplementary material the concentration of other cations is also measured and presented in table s2 supplementary data within seventeen wells from where the samples are collected the concentration of as in eleven wells well no 1 5 6 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 and 17 are detected above the permissible limit of 10 μg l who 2017 the concentrations of as in six wells are found to be higher than the permissible limits without any alternative source of 50 μg l as specified in beauro of indian standard bis amongst all the wells the total as concentration in well number 9 is the highest with a value of 376 μg l fig 2 the concentration of several co existing cations i e aluminium al barium ba boron b copper cu iron fe manganese mn lead pb strontium sr and zinc zn were measured for all the samples table s2 supplementary material the result indicates the high range of average concentration of fe 4 24 3 46 mg l zn 1 07 1 26 mg l and mn 0 65 0 35 mg l with a significantly high value of standard deviation table s3 supplementary material the observation suggests an abundance of fe zn and mn along with as in the groundwater of that region high standard deviation indicates higher spatial variability for fe and zn in the groundwater to better understand the correlation between the presence of as and other ions pearson s correlation analysis was carried out table s4 supplementary material as described earlier the result table 2 indicates that al r 0 42 and fe r 0 25 are positively correlated with as whereas zn r 0 37 is negatively correlated with as this observation suggests that the occurrence of as is probably associated with the presence of al and fe in the sediment and groundwater the source and geochemistry of as in the contaminated aquifer were very complex and dynamic bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 the positive correlation between as and fe in a few locations in the bengal delta was reported elsewhere smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the association of as with al and fe is probably suggesting that as is likely to be present in the alluvial sediment with those metal based minerals the release of as in the groundwater was likely to be attributed by reductive desorption along with dissolution from the clays and minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2007 3 2 2 arsenic removal by fes sand matrix from the contaminated groundwater in the batch system under varying ph as removal efficiencies by fes sand matrix from the groundwater samples collected from those eleven wells in which the as concentration exits the permissible limit of 10 μg l were assessed the experiments were conducted in the batch system under varying ph of 6 and 8 the result fig 5 a indicates reasonably good as removal from the groundwater samples by the fes sand matrix for most of the cases as removal efficiency from the groundwater samples is slightly better at ph 6 40 7 8 6 compared to that of ph 8 29 2 15 6 the removal percentage of as varies more widely when the ph was maintained at 8 ranging between 8 and 58 compared to that of ph 6 ranging between 30 and 56 this observation is in accordance with the result reported in han et al 2011 which shows high as removal by fes at lower ph than that of higher ph precipitation and formation of orpiment at lower ph are likely to be more efficient in removing as compared to adsorption to better understand the interdependency of the presence of different ions on as removal efficiency pearson s correlation analysis was carried out between the percentage of as removed and the occurrence of different co existing cations the correlation matrix is presented in table s5 ph 6 and table s6 ph 8 in supplementary material the correlation coefficient between as removal and the other ions in two different ph are also summarized in table 2 the results show that co presence of fe r 0 55 at ph 6 and r 0 53 at ph 8 and cu r 0 60 at ph 6 and r 0 61 at ph 8 are positively correlated with the percentage of as removed in addition to that the presence of zn r 0 44 and pb r 0 58 has shown a reasonably good positive correlation with the removal of as from the groundwater sample at ph 6 the as mineral interaction mechanisms were very complex in nature bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 however the observation suggests that in the ph values of 6 and 8 the as removal is likely to be associated with fe and cu and also with zn and pb at ph 6 those metals might have reacted with sulfide in the reducing environment to form metal sulfide i e fes cus at both the ph and zns and pbs at ph 6 and as removal eventually might have attributed by both chemical reaction and subsequent coprecipitation smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bostick and fendorf 2003 bhattacharya et al 2007 gallegos et al 2008 xie et al 2016 han et al 2011 tiwari et al 2020 3 2 3 performance of in situ synthesized fes in the porous media for immobilization of as from groundwater the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as from the groundwater sample was assessed following the protocol described above in this experiment the groundwater sample having maximum concentration case 7 c 0 376 μg l ph 6 well no 9 was selected for the column experiment the ph of the solution was maintained at ph 6 given that the as removal by fes sand matrix is better at ph 6 figs 5a and 29 compared to that of ph 8 12 the concentration of as and fe is measured at the effluent after synthesizing fes in situ as presented in fig 5b the result fig 5b indicates that the concentration of as at the effluent is below 50 μg l until 16 pvs and then the concentration of as rises gradually and reaches a value of 100 μg l at 32 pvs and 132 μg l at 50 pvs the mass balance calculation shows that a significant amount 83 8 table 1 of injected as is immobilized under the natural groundwater condition both redox potential and ph influence the as speciations in this study redox sensitive elements are fe sulfur s and as the ferric fe iii sulfate so4 2 and as v species are dominant in oxidizing conditions whereas ferrous fe ii hs or s2 and as iii species are dominant in reducing condition in the ph range of 6 8 ph 9 the as iii is likely to be present in the form of uncharged arsenite h3aso3 under reducing conditions and negatively charge arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 under oxidizing condition yan et al 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 raychoudhury et al 2015 generally groundwater is present in the suboxic condition eh ranging between 200 mv and 200 mv and ph in the range of 6 8 fig 5c in this study though the speciations of as is not analyzed however hinkle and polette 1999 suggested that as iii species was usually prominent in well water and accounted for 68 99 of total arsenic the pe and ph over time are measured of as containing groundwater at ph 6 similar to the condition adopted for the column transport experiment the pe ph plot fig 5c indicates that the as is likely to be present as trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate at ph 6 the possible fraction of as v species present in well water is expected to coprecipitate and the fraction of as iii species present in groundwater is likely to get adsorbed on the surface of fes coated porous media the higher percentage of as immobilization in the column system 83 compared to the batch system around 30 under the same groundwater condition is probably attributed to the fact that i the fes sand to contaminated water ratio is different in batch and column system and ii in the column experiment advection dispersion mechanism along with chemical reaction coprecipitation and sorption might have enhanced the immobilization of as the retained percentage of as is better in the case of 7 compared to that of case 3 71 7 even though the concentration of as and ph is similar for both the cases the presence of metal ions in the groundwater is likely to enhance the as immobilization efficiency this observation also supports the fact that the selected metal ions fe cu pb and zn may have reacted with sulfide which attributed to more as immobilization by the combined effect of chemical reaction and coprecipitation the fe at the effluent during the synthesis of fes and immobilization of as was also measured the result fig s2b suggests that during in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting from 1 2 pvs the c c 0 value reaches 1 2 at 1 5 pvs almost 99 3 of fe is retained in the porous media which is likely to be used for synthesizing fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as is also presented in fig 5b it is important to note that in addition to the injection of reagent feso4 the groundwater also contains fe ions the concentration of fe in the groundwater sample well no 9 is 4 49 mg l at initial 1 2 pvs the concentration of fe is observed to be extremely high ranging 6 5 1 7 mg l however beyond 2 pvs the concentration of fe reduced drastically and it falls within a range of 0 16 mg l to 0 03 mg l throughout the column experiment overall 98 of injected fe is retained within the porous for case 7 the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that a significant amount of injected fe gets immobilized in the porous media the result also indicates that the fe which occurs in the groundwater is probably associated with sulfide and as and gets immobilized in the porous media the fes was likely to be stable in the form of precipitate at the working ph of 6 under groundwater conditions gallegos et al 2008 rickard 2006 thus it could be inferred that there is a limited risk of release of fe under this specific groundwater condition with the ph range of 6 8 4 conclusion the focus of the study is to evaluate the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as under different water chemistry and under groundwater conditions in the reducing environment the result suggests that a significant amount of arsenite as iii 71 7 74 9 is immobilized in the fes synthesized porous media where the immobilization of arsenate as v 11 7 26 9 is not very promising solution ph and as concentration have an insignificant effect on the immobilizing as the concentration of as in several samples collected from the as contaminated region of west bengal india was found to be more than the permissible limit of 10 μg l the occurrence of as in the groundwater of the region is associated with the presence of al and fe the as removal by fes sand matrix is better at ph 6 compared to that of ph 8 the as immobilization has increased significantly 83 under groundwater 376 μg l conditions in the porous media furthermore the concentration of fe is also reduced significantly 160 μg l at the effluent after 2 pvs indicating a limited risk of release of fe in this study only one groundwater sample is subjected to the column experiment however it is important to note that as the removal of that sample in the batch system is only 29 which shows lower removal in comparison with other samples at ph 6 thus it could be inferred that the as removal from other samples through the fes synthesized porous media might be similar or better than that observed in this study arsenic immobilization in the real field system is likely to be very complex and dynamic however this study which assessed the performance of the proposed techniques under varying solution chemistry and groundwater condition indicates promising performance thus it could be stated that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media has potential in immobilizing as under reducing environment

11759,the objectives of the study are i to assess arsenic immobilization efficiency by in situ synthesized fes within the porous media under varying solution chemistry and ii the performance evaluation of fes sand matrix in removing arsenic under natural groundwater conditions to achieve the objectives column experiments were performed where fes was synthesized within the porous media in situ then the as iii or as v solution was injected within the column and the effluents were collected to measure arsenic as and iron fe concentrations the groundwater samples were collected from seventeen locations in west bengal india and were characterized the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix from the selected groundwater samples was studied in the batch and column system the result showed that a significant amount of arsenite as iii 71 7 74 9 was immobilized in the fes synthesized porous media the solution ph and the concentration of as iii have an insignificant effect on immobilizing as iii in the porous media system in the ph range of 6 8 arsenate as v immobilization was not very promising under the reducing condition by in situ synthesized fes in the porous media the as v removal was slightly better at ph 6 26 9 compared to ph 8 11 7 the occurrence of as in the groundwater ranging from 0 78 μg l to 376 μg l of the region was found to be associated with aluminum al and fe the as removal by fes sand matrix showed better performance at ph 6 40 7 8 6 compared to that of ph 8 29 2 15 6 in the batch system the immobilization of as increased significantly 83 when the as contaminated groundwater 376 μg l was injected into the porous media containing in situ synthesized fes the concentration of fe also reduced significantly 160 μg l at the effluent after 2 pvs indicating a limited risk of release of fe overall it could be stated that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media has the potential to immobilize as under a reducing environment within a range of ph under the groundwater conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenite arsenate aquifer groundwater in situ remediation west bengal 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater is a well known problem the severity of the problem is alarming in bangladesh and west bengal state of india apart from those places the trace amount of as is also identified in several parts in china latin america and the few locations of north america smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2004 bundschuh et al 2012 inorganic arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most abundant species of as amongst those as iii is likely to be found in the reducing environment in the deep aquifer which is toxic and can be transported easily in the groundwater smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2004 thus the occurrence of as in the form of as iii in the groundwater withdrawn from deep aquifers has become a trivial issue numerous studies have focused on as removal using different sorbents relevant for ex situ treatment thus most of those studies have dealt with the removal of as v from the contaminated water in situ remediation of as is also recognized as a promising alternative there are mainly two approaches one is as immobilization under the oxic condition and the other under reducing environment in the last few decades some studies explored the possibilities of treating as in situ under the oxic condition luong et al 2018 the main concept of those reported studies is to create an oxic environment in the aquifer system by aeration and oxygen purging in the porous media van halem et al 2010 rahman et al 2014 yang et al 2018 in several occasions suitable oxidants are also injected along with oxygen in this process the iron fe is transformed in the form of ferric fe iii which can precipitate in the porous media then using the remaining oxidant the as iii can be oxidized to as v which subsequently can get sorbed on the ferric precipitate luong et al 2018 the main limitations of this process are i the limited transformation of as iii to as v and ii the presence of other reducing agents such as ammonia methane sulfide etc those compounds can reduce the efficiency of the process by utilizing the injected oxygen or oxidant iii moreover in the longer duration the fate of the oxidized form of fe and as v is a matter of concern given the aquatic environment in the subsurface tends to be reducing luong et al 2018 few recent studies have also explored the possibility of in situ remediation of as iii under anoxic conditions by injecting the reduced form of fe such as zero valent iron zvi kanel et al 2007 liu et al 2016 wu et al 2018 or iron sulfide fes han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 pi et al 2017 tiwari et al 2020 abass et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii could be converted into as 0 in the presence of nanoscale zvi nzvi which subsequently get adsorbed on the surface of nzvi furthermore sorption of as is reported to be extensively high on the surface of the iron oxide shell of zvi guo et al 2016 and the surface of fes coated sand han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 few studies han et al 2011 pi et al 2017 xie et al 2016 showed that fes could immobilize as iii under anoxic conditions one of our recent studies tiwari et al 2020 assessed the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as iii under varying injection schedules the result showed that almost 73 of injected as iii was immobilized in the fes containing porous media under the optimal injection schedule the reported studies have suggested that coprecipitation and adsorption are the major mechanisms for as uptake by fes sand matrix the literature review suggests fe based reagents such as fes or zvi have extensive potential for treating as iii especially under anoxic conditions however the performance of the in situ remedial process is dependent on the solution chemistry and natural groundwater conditions several studies have investigated the effect of solution chemistry as speciation gallegos et al 2008 han et al 2011 park et al 2018 on removing as by fes based adsorbent in the batch system and most of the studies have suggested the significant influence of solution chemistry on as fes interaction the concentration of as is another parameter that is likely to vary in the natural system and influences the as uptake efficiency han et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2015 some of the studies park et al 2018 showed the effects of competing anions on as uptake by fes in the batch system the presence of specific anions i e phosphate and chromate are found to have inhibitory effects on as adsorption by fe based adsorbent su and puls 2001 cations can also affect as uptake by fes through adsorption or coprecipitation co presence of several ions along with as in the groundwater is likely impacting the as immobilization efficiency the majority of the reported studies have focused on as iii or as v removal in the batch system and under controlled laboratory conditions the immobilization of as in the porous media under varying solution conditions i e ph as concentration and speciation of as are suggested and under natural groundwater is likely to be influenced by different processes compared to that of the batch system to the best of the authors knowledge not many studies have investigated the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as under varying solution conditions in the packed bed porous media system which is relevant for in situ remediation of as furthermore the performance of the fes sand matrix in removing as under natural groundwater conditions is a critical issue that needs systematic investigation which is not reported widely given the background the objectives of the study are therefore i to assess arsenic immobilization efficiency by in situ synthesized fes within the porous media under varying solution chemistry i e ph arsenic concentration species and ii to evaluate the performance of fes sand matrix in removing arsenic under natural groundwater condition to achieve the objectives column experiments are performed where fes is synthesized within the porous media in situ then the as iii or as v solution is injected within the column from one end and the effluents are collected from the other end for measuring as and fe concentrations furthermore the groundwater samples were collected from seventeen different locations in west bengal india and are characterized the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix from the selected groundwater samples is studied in the batch and column system 2 material and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 reagents ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o was procured from nice chemicals p ltd and sodium sulphide na2s 9h2o was procured from rfcl ltd india sodium arsenite naaso2 90 and sodium arsenate na2haso4 7h2o 98 was obtained from sigma aldrich the solution of analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh was used for ph adjustment milli q deionized di water was used for all purpose all the solutions and water except as v water was purged with n2 for deoxygenation the feso4 and na2s solutions 20 mm were prepared prior to injection by dissolving appropriate moles of feso4 na2s salts in 10 ml of n2 purged di water 2 1 2 model subsurface porous media the sand collected from the son river bed bihar india was used as the model subsurface porous media for the 1 d column experiment the sand was also used for the batch experiment where it was mixed with reagents to prepare fes coated sand the sand was sieved using the sieve size of 600 μm 425 μm 300 μm and 150 μm and the sand grain within the size range of 150 μm 600 μm was used as the model porous media the grain size distribution of the porous media is also presented in the supporting material fig s1 the average grain size of the porous media is 0 5 mm and the porosity is 0 42 the detailed protocol for preparing porous media and its characteristics is reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 2 2 column experiments in this study the sand was packed in a 1 d glass column kontes chromeflex having an inner diameter id of 1 cm and a length of 15 cm to represent the model subsurface porous media the column was wet packed with the sand for entire length of the column 15 cm following the protocol reported elsewhere dibyanshu and raychoudhury 2019 dibyanshu et al 2021 the sand was saturated with respective as spiked water or as contaminanted groundwater in each casesfor a duration of 24 h prior to packing after column packing 15 pore volumes pvs of as iii or as v containing water was flushed through the porous media under varying conditions i e the concentration range of 100 μg l 350 μg l ph of 6 and 8 corresponding to the experimental scenarios adopted in different cases as presented in table 1 the porous media was pre saturated with as spiked water or as contaminated groundwater given the aquifer porous media was expected to contain as before injecting reagents once the porous media is pre saturated with as reagents feso4 and na2s were injected to synthesize fes in situ in this study 20 mm of feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternately 0 25 pvs of each reagent in each cycle for a total duration of 1 5 pvs at the column inlet with the help of a peristaltic pump 77120 42 masterflex at a flow rate of 2 58 ml min the above injection schedule for the reagents was adopted in this study because it was identified as the optimal condition for immobilization of as iii as reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 the schematic of entire experimental set up is presented in fig 1 after synthesizing fes within the porous media as spiked water as iii or as v or as contaminated groundwater was injected into the column under the constant head condition where the as spiked water or or as contaminated groundwater was kept in the overhead tank fig 1 the flow rate of as spiked water or as contaminated groundwater was maintained in the range of 0 336 0 03 ml min by placing the overhead tank at a suitable height the flow rate was maintained to ensure laminar flow conditions which is the case for the groundwater flow regime the overhead tank except as v was constantly purged with n2 gas during the entire course of the experiment to maintain anoxic conditions the column was placed horizontally during the injection of the reagents and as the schematic of the experimental set up was presented in fig 1 the experiments were conducted under varying as concentrations ph conditions and in the solution prepared with as iii and as v table 1 case 1 represents 350 μg l of as iii at ph 8 case 2 represents 350 μg l of as iii at ph 6 case 3 represents 100 μg l of as iii at ph 8 case 4 represents 100 μg l of as iii at ph 6 case 5 represents 100 μg l of as v at ph 8 case 6 represents 100 μg l of as v at ph 6 and case 7 represents groundwater containing 376 μg l of as at ph 6 the effluent was collected at regular intervals up to 35 pvs duration 17 h for analysis of total as and fe the concentration of total as and fe were measured using icp ms 7800 icp ms agilent technologies and aas atomic absorption spectroscopy aasice 3000 series thermoscientific respectively the samples collected at the outlet were digested directly by adding 2 v v concentrated nitric acid for 12 h the digested samples were then diluted and filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filter before analysis the detail of the sample analysis protocol was reported elsewhere tiwari et al 2020 the as and fe concentration at the effluents is represented in the form of a breakthrough curve btc where y axis represents the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 and the x axis represents pv vt εl a dimensionless parameter to represent time t here v is darcy s velocity ε is porosity and l is the length of the porous media packed column the result is also presented by the percentage of retained mass where the percentage of retained mass of as was calculated by deducting the total mass of as eluted at the outlet at different pvs from the total mass of injected as up to that point similarly for the mass balance of fe the total eluted mass of fe at different pvs was calculated from the breakthrough curves and was deducted from the total mass of fe injected up to 1 5 pvs percentage mass retained 100x mass injected mass eluted mass injected 2 3 groundwater sampling and characterization groundwater samples were collected from seventeen different locations in the state of west bengal india the samples were collected from hand pumps and stored in the pre cleaned polyethylene bottles in which 1 of hno3 was added to stabilize the as species smedley and kinniburgh 2002 details of sampling location and corresponding well numbers are indicated in fig 2 and table s1 the collected groundwater samples were analyzed for different cations following the method epa 3015 a where the groundwater sample was first digested in 2 acid for analysis of fe the digestion was done in an acid matrix of hno3 and hcl 4 1 whereas for as and other cations the samples were digested using 2 hno3 for 8 h then the disgested samples were filtered using a 0 22 μm filter after filtration the samples were diluted and the concentration of fe was measured using aas aasice 3000 series thermo scientific the concentration of as and other cations such as aluminum al manganese mn zinc zn copper cu lead pb etc were measured using icp ms 7800 icp ms agilent technologies 2 4 batch experiments with groundwater sample arsenic removal efficiency from the natural groundwater by the fes sand matrix was assessed in the batch system groundwater samples with as concentration exiting 10 μg l no of samples is 11 fig 2 were selected for batch experiments the batch experiments were done for the removal of as at two different ph ph 6 and ph 8 to prepare the fes sand mix 2 g of pre saturated sand was poured in a series of glass vials then 0 25 ml of 20 mm feso4 and 0 25 ml of 20 mm na2s solutions were added alternatively to the sand and were mixed well 50 ml of as contaminated groundwater were then added to each of those vials and the solution was mixed using an end on end rotor at a speed of 30 rpm for 24 h given that duration likely to be sufficient to reach equilibrium condition raychoudhury et al 2015 xie et al 2016 at the end of the experiment samples were collected centrifuged and filtered before digestion then the digested samples are analyzed for total as following the protocol discussed above all the batch experiments were done in duplicate and the average values were presented to better understand the as fes interactions processes the ph and oxidation reduction potential orp or eh of the as contaminated groundwater in the selected batch systems were monitored over time eh orp of the sample was measured by orp meter orion star a214 thermo scientific the data indicating pe calculated from eh with respect to ph of as containing groundwater in the presence and absence of fes coated sand were plotted and the same were superimposed with ph pe diagram of as presented in different forms at equilibrium panagiotaras et al 2012 2 5 correlation analysis pearson s correlation is the test statistic that measures the association between two variables in this study pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to understand the possible association of the presence of as in the groundwater with the other co existing cations secondly to understand the possible influence of the presence of cations on the as removal efficiency by fes sand matrix the correlation coefficient between as removal efficiency and the concentration of other cations present in the groundwater sample was calculated pearson s correlation coefficients and correlation matrix were obtained by the available data using the past 2 0 multivariate statistical analysis software as described elsewhere uddameri et al 2014 inanya and raychoudhury 2018 3 result and discussion 3 1 immobilization of arsenic under different conditions through porous media containing in situ synthesized fes 3 1 1 effect of ph on immobilization of as iii the effect of ph at ph 6 and 8 on the immobilization of as iii at different concentrations case 1 to case 4 was investigated as summarized in table 1 the normalized effluent concentration of as and fe with respect to pvs is presented in fig 3 the result indicates that for case 2 c 0 350 μg l ph 6 the concentration of as at the outlet is less c c 0 ranges between 0 1 to 0 2 at the initial stage up to 15 pvs compared to that of case 1 c 0 350 μg l ph 8 average c c 0 is approximately 0 26 up to 15 pvs however towards the later stage 15 pv to 35pv a more rapid increase in c c 0 from 0 2 to 0 48 is observed in the case of 2 the effluent as concentration is comparatively less and consistent with a c c 0 value ranging between 0 20 and 0 33 over the entiref duration of as iii injection up to 35 pvs in the case of 1 where the solution ph is maintained at 8 in the case of 4 c 0 100 μg l ph 6 relatively low as iii concentration at the effluent during the first 10 pvs is observed with a c c 0 value of 0 16 however at the later stage a rapid increase in the c c 0 is observed which reaches 0 54 at 35 pvs on the other hand in the case of 3 c 0 100 μg l ph 8 the effluent concentration shows a steady plateau where the c c 0 values vary from 0 20 to 0 30 over the entire experimental duration of 35 pvs the mass balance calculations indicating the percentage of the injected mass of as immobilized in the fes containing porous media are presented in table 1 the results show that the overall as retention is highest 74 9 in the case of 3 c 0 100 μg l ph 8 the percentage of retained mass of as iii for case 1 c 0 350 μg l ph 8 case 2 c 0 350 μg l 6 and case 4 c 0 100 μg l ph 6 are 72 9 71 7 and 73 5 respectively a negligible 1 2 1 4 increase in the as iii retention is observed when the ph decreases from 8 to 6 for both the concentrations as iii immobilization by fes containing porous media was likely to be attributed by the synergistic effect of coprecipitation and chemical reaction bostick and fendorf 2003 gallegos et al 2008 xie et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2007 tiwari et al 2020 han et al 2011 reported that precipitation was a predominant mechanism that leads to the formation of orpiment at ph 5 whereas adsorption is the dominant mechanism for immobilization of as iii at ph 9 by fes coated sand few studies gallegos et al 2008 han et al 2011 have suggested that as iii removal mechanism shifts from precipitation to adsorption when the solution shifts from acidic to basic condition in this study it is observed that there is a limited effect of ph study conducted as ph 6 and ph 8 on as iii immobilization in the concentration range of 100 μg l 1 4 to 350 μg l 1 2 in the porous media system the possibility of release of fe during the synthesis of fes and during immobilization of as was monitored the result fig s2a supplementary material suggests that during the in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting approximately beyond 1 pv for all the cases case 1 to 4 the fe concentration reaches the highest value in the case of 1 as iii c 0 350 μg l ph 8 with a c c 0 value of around 0 24 at 1 5 pv in all other cases cases 2 3 and 4 the c c 0 value lies within a range of0 10 0 13 at 1 5 pv overall more than 93 of injected fe 93 5 94 6 97 5 and 93 6 for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively is retained in the porous media that is used for synthesizing fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as iii is presented in fig 3b at the initial stage 3 4 pvs the concentration of fe is found to be significantly high c c 0 value ranging between 0 02 and 0 12 for all the cases case 1 to 4 however eventually the concentration of fe is reduced significantly and became negligible beyond 15 to18 pvs throughout the column experiment almost 58 9 65 1 66 0 and 48 4 of injected fe are retained within the porous media for case 1 case 2 case 3 and case 4 respectively overall the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that the release of fe might not be a serious concern in the long run during the immobilization of as iii different studies gallegos et al 2008 rickard 2006 have suggested that the solubility of fes increases below a ph value of 6 and was independent above ph 6 thus it could be said that in the ph range of 6 8 which is also relevant for groundwater ph the solubility of fes might not influence the performance of as iii immobilization and are more stable in the form of a precipitate 3 1 2 effect of as iii concentration on immobilization of as iii effect of concentration 100 μg l and 350 μg l on the immobilization of as iii by fes containing porous media under constant ph was also investigated the normalized concentration of as iii and fe with respect to pvs are presented in fig 3 the result indicates that at ph 8 case 1 vs case 3 the c c 0 values for as iii at effluent are slightly less for most of the data points for case 3 c0 350 μg l compared to that of case 1 c0 100 μg l in the majority of the cases the c c 0 values are under 0 2 for the case of 1 c0 100 μg l ph 8 which corresponds to an effluent as concentration of 20 μg l at ph 6 case 2 100 μg l vs case 4 350 μg l the c c 0 values for both the cases are under 0 2 for the first 10 pvs and then the effluent concentration increases steadily up to 35 pvs mass balance calculations indicate that percentage of the retained mass of as is slightly higher around 2 when the concentration of as iii inject low 100 μg l case 3 74 9 at ph 8 and case 4 73 5 at ph 6 compared to that of when the concentration of influent as iii is slightly higher 350 μg l case 1 72 9 at ph 8 and case 2 71 7 at ph 6 though the percentage of removal of as iii does not depend on the initial concentration of as however the sorption and precipitation of as iii per g of fe is higher when the concentration of as iii is high 350 μg l case 1 9 02 mg as g of fe case 2 8 03 mg as g of fe compared to that when as iii is injected at lower concentration 100 μg l case 3 2 36 mg as g fe case 4 3 16 mg as g of fe this observation was in accordance with the equilibrium isotherm trend as observed for other fe based adsorbents raychoudhury et al 2015 han et al 2011 the retained mass of fe is also not correlated with influent as iii concentration the immobilized mass of as iii per g of fe in the porous media as observed in this study 2 36 9 02 mg as g of fe is in the range reported in other studies 9 8 mg g 11 mg g under similar ph conditions han et al 2011 tiwari et al 2020 3 1 3 immobilization of as v under varying ph the performance of in situ synthesized fes in the porous media for immobilization of as v is also assessed in this set of experiments the influent as v concentration was maintained at 100 μg l and the solution ph was varied from 6 to 8 the result fig 4 a indicates that the c c 0 values for as v at effluent reaches a peak value c c 0 1 73 at 4 pvs in the case of 5 as v c 0 100 μg l ph 8 and then it gets stabilized at around a c c 0 value of 0 77 in case 6 as v c 0 100 μg l ph 6 a peak with c c 0 values of 1 2 at 4 pvs is observed and then it gets stabilized at around c c 0 value of 0 61 the c c 0 values for as v become greater than one at a few time points at the initial stage this observation probably implies that the as v retained in the column gets released at the initial stage which is likely to be associated with a high concentration of fe at the outlet fig 4b the mass balance calculation shows that a comparatively high amount of as v is retained at lower ph of 6 26 7 in case 6 compared to that of higher ph of 8 11 7 in case 5 higher sorption of as v at lower ph by iron based adsorbent was suggested in several works of literature dixit and hering 2003 gu et al 2007 raychoudhury et al 2015 speciation of as v and inner sphere surface complexation are likely to be the major factors contributing to a higher degree of as v retention at lower ph for example at lower ph as v is likely to be present in the form of h2aso4 which is expected to be adsorbed better than haso4 2 that are likely to be present at higher ph i e ph 8 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 yan et al 2000 dixit and hering et al 2003 overall the result suggests that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media is not efficient in removing as v under a ph range of 6 8 the fe at the effluent during the synthesis of fes and immobilization of as v was monitored the result fig s2b suggests that during the in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting from 1 2 pvs the c c 0 value reaches 0 03 and 0 11 at 1 5 pvs for case 5 and case 6 respectively more than 95 0 98 7 in case 5 and 95 9 in case 6 of fe is retained in the porous media during the synthesis of fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as v is presented in fig 4b during the immobilization of as v at the initial 1 pv the concentration of fe is found to be significantly high c c 0 value ranging between 0 08 and 0 10 then the fe concentration is reduced and the c c 0 value lies within a range of 0 042 to 0 002 for both cases the negligible concentration of fe is observed beyond 16 pvs throughout the column experiment overall 44 2 and 46 6 of injected fe are retained within the porous media for case 5 and case 6 respectively overall the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that the release of fe is moderate during immobilization of as v 3 2 performance of fes containing porous media in removing arsenic under natural groundwater condition 3 2 1 field sampling from arsenic contaminated region and characterization of groundwater samples the groundwater samples from seventeen locations were collected from the state of west bengal the detail of the sampling location and the concentration of as is presented in fig 2 and table s1 supplementary material the concentration of other cations is also measured and presented in table s2 supplementary data within seventeen wells from where the samples are collected the concentration of as in eleven wells well no 1 5 6 8 9 11 13 14 15 16 and 17 are detected above the permissible limit of 10 μg l who 2017 the concentrations of as in six wells are found to be higher than the permissible limits without any alternative source of 50 μg l as specified in beauro of indian standard bis amongst all the wells the total as concentration in well number 9 is the highest with a value of 376 μg l fig 2 the concentration of several co existing cations i e aluminium al barium ba boron b copper cu iron fe manganese mn lead pb strontium sr and zinc zn were measured for all the samples table s2 supplementary material the result indicates the high range of average concentration of fe 4 24 3 46 mg l zn 1 07 1 26 mg l and mn 0 65 0 35 mg l with a significantly high value of standard deviation table s3 supplementary material the observation suggests an abundance of fe zn and mn along with as in the groundwater of that region high standard deviation indicates higher spatial variability for fe and zn in the groundwater to better understand the correlation between the presence of as and other ions pearson s correlation analysis was carried out table s4 supplementary material as described earlier the result table 2 indicates that al r 0 42 and fe r 0 25 are positively correlated with as whereas zn r 0 37 is negatively correlated with as this observation suggests that the occurrence of as is probably associated with the presence of al and fe in the sediment and groundwater the source and geochemistry of as in the contaminated aquifer were very complex and dynamic bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 the positive correlation between as and fe in a few locations in the bengal delta was reported elsewhere smedley and kinniburgh 2002 the association of as with al and fe is probably suggesting that as is likely to be present in the alluvial sediment with those metal based minerals the release of as in the groundwater was likely to be attributed by reductive desorption along with dissolution from the clays and minerals smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bhattacharya et al 2007 3 2 2 arsenic removal by fes sand matrix from the contaminated groundwater in the batch system under varying ph as removal efficiencies by fes sand matrix from the groundwater samples collected from those eleven wells in which the as concentration exits the permissible limit of 10 μg l were assessed the experiments were conducted in the batch system under varying ph of 6 and 8 the result fig 5 a indicates reasonably good as removal from the groundwater samples by the fes sand matrix for most of the cases as removal efficiency from the groundwater samples is slightly better at ph 6 40 7 8 6 compared to that of ph 8 29 2 15 6 the removal percentage of as varies more widely when the ph was maintained at 8 ranging between 8 and 58 compared to that of ph 6 ranging between 30 and 56 this observation is in accordance with the result reported in han et al 2011 which shows high as removal by fes at lower ph than that of higher ph precipitation and formation of orpiment at lower ph are likely to be more efficient in removing as compared to adsorption to better understand the interdependency of the presence of different ions on as removal efficiency pearson s correlation analysis was carried out between the percentage of as removed and the occurrence of different co existing cations the correlation matrix is presented in table s5 ph 6 and table s6 ph 8 in supplementary material the correlation coefficient between as removal and the other ions in two different ph are also summarized in table 2 the results show that co presence of fe r 0 55 at ph 6 and r 0 53 at ph 8 and cu r 0 60 at ph 6 and r 0 61 at ph 8 are positively correlated with the percentage of as removed in addition to that the presence of zn r 0 44 and pb r 0 58 has shown a reasonably good positive correlation with the removal of as from the groundwater sample at ph 6 the as mineral interaction mechanisms were very complex in nature bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 however the observation suggests that in the ph values of 6 and 8 the as removal is likely to be associated with fe and cu and also with zn and pb at ph 6 those metals might have reacted with sulfide in the reducing environment to form metal sulfide i e fes cus at both the ph and zns and pbs at ph 6 and as removal eventually might have attributed by both chemical reaction and subsequent coprecipitation smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bostick and fendorf 2003 bhattacharya et al 2007 gallegos et al 2008 xie et al 2016 han et al 2011 tiwari et al 2020 3 2 3 performance of in situ synthesized fes in the porous media for immobilization of as from groundwater the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as from the groundwater sample was assessed following the protocol described above in this experiment the groundwater sample having maximum concentration case 7 c 0 376 μg l ph 6 well no 9 was selected for the column experiment the ph of the solution was maintained at ph 6 given that the as removal by fes sand matrix is better at ph 6 figs 5a and 29 compared to that of ph 8 12 the concentration of as and fe is measured at the effluent after synthesizing fes in situ as presented in fig 5b the result fig 5b indicates that the concentration of as at the effluent is below 50 μg l until 16 pvs and then the concentration of as rises gradually and reaches a value of 100 μg l at 32 pvs and 132 μg l at 50 pvs the mass balance calculation shows that a significant amount 83 8 table 1 of injected as is immobilized under the natural groundwater condition both redox potential and ph influence the as speciations in this study redox sensitive elements are fe sulfur s and as the ferric fe iii sulfate so4 2 and as v species are dominant in oxidizing conditions whereas ferrous fe ii hs or s2 and as iii species are dominant in reducing condition in the ph range of 6 8 ph 9 the as iii is likely to be present in the form of uncharged arsenite h3aso3 under reducing conditions and negatively charge arsenate h2aso4 and haso4 2 under oxidizing condition yan et al 2000 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 raychoudhury et al 2015 generally groundwater is present in the suboxic condition eh ranging between 200 mv and 200 mv and ph in the range of 6 8 fig 5c in this study though the speciations of as is not analyzed however hinkle and polette 1999 suggested that as iii species was usually prominent in well water and accounted for 68 99 of total arsenic the pe and ph over time are measured of as containing groundwater at ph 6 similar to the condition adopted for the column transport experiment the pe ph plot fig 5c indicates that the as is likely to be present as trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate at ph 6 the possible fraction of as v species present in well water is expected to coprecipitate and the fraction of as iii species present in groundwater is likely to get adsorbed on the surface of fes coated porous media the higher percentage of as immobilization in the column system 83 compared to the batch system around 30 under the same groundwater condition is probably attributed to the fact that i the fes sand to contaminated water ratio is different in batch and column system and ii in the column experiment advection dispersion mechanism along with chemical reaction coprecipitation and sorption might have enhanced the immobilization of as the retained percentage of as is better in the case of 7 compared to that of case 3 71 7 even though the concentration of as and ph is similar for both the cases the presence of metal ions in the groundwater is likely to enhance the as immobilization efficiency this observation also supports the fact that the selected metal ions fe cu pb and zn may have reacted with sulfide which attributed to more as immobilization by the combined effect of chemical reaction and coprecipitation the fe at the effluent during the synthesis of fes and immobilization of as was also measured the result fig s2b suggests that during in situ synthesis of fes the fe starts eluting from 1 2 pvs the c c 0 value reaches 1 2 at 1 5 pvs almost 99 3 of fe is retained in the porous media which is likely to be used for synthesizing fes the effluent concentration of fe during immobilization of as is also presented in fig 5b it is important to note that in addition to the injection of reagent feso4 the groundwater also contains fe ions the concentration of fe in the groundwater sample well no 9 is 4 49 mg l at initial 1 2 pvs the concentration of fe is observed to be extremely high ranging 6 5 1 7 mg l however beyond 2 pvs the concentration of fe reduced drastically and it falls within a range of 0 16 mg l to 0 03 mg l throughout the column experiment overall 98 of injected fe is retained within the porous for case 7 the concentration of fe at the effluent suggests that a significant amount of injected fe gets immobilized in the porous media the result also indicates that the fe which occurs in the groundwater is probably associated with sulfide and as and gets immobilized in the porous media the fes was likely to be stable in the form of precipitate at the working ph of 6 under groundwater conditions gallegos et al 2008 rickard 2006 thus it could be inferred that there is a limited risk of release of fe under this specific groundwater condition with the ph range of 6 8 4 conclusion the focus of the study is to evaluate the performance of in situ synthesized fes for immobilization of as under different water chemistry and under groundwater conditions in the reducing environment the result suggests that a significant amount of arsenite as iii 71 7 74 9 is immobilized in the fes synthesized porous media where the immobilization of arsenate as v 11 7 26 9 is not very promising solution ph and as concentration have an insignificant effect on the immobilizing as the concentration of as in several samples collected from the as contaminated region of west bengal india was found to be more than the permissible limit of 10 μg l the occurrence of as in the groundwater of the region is associated with the presence of al and fe the as removal by fes sand matrix is better at ph 6 compared to that of ph 8 the as immobilization has increased significantly 83 under groundwater 376 μg l conditions in the porous media furthermore the concentration of fe is also reduced significantly 160 μg l at the effluent after 2 pvs indicating a limited risk of release of fe in this study only one groundwater sample is subjected to the column experiment however it is important to note that as the removal of that sample in the batch system is only 29 which shows lower removal in comparison with other samples at ph 6 thus it could be inferred that the as removal from other samples through the fes synthesized porous media might be similar or better than that observed in this study arsenic immobilization in the real field system is likely to be very complex and dynamic however this study which assessed the performance of the proposed techniques under varying solution chemistry and groundwater condition indicates promising performance thus it could be stated that in situ synthesized fes in the porous media has potential in immobilizing as under reducing environment
