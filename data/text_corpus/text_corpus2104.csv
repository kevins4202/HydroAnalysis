10520,the optimization of irrigation strategies with the goal of increasing water utilization efficiency and achieving higher yield is an important farming practice that helps balance groundwater use and food security during water shortage periods in the north china plain ncp in the present study the aquacrop model was used to simulate winter wheat yield evapotranspiration et water productivity wpet and irrigation water productivity iwp under seven irrigation strategy scenarios and three precipitation categories the results revealed that the annual precipitation fluctuated significantly over the past 35 years 1981 2015 leading to considerably varied irrigation water requirements with an average of 292 mm the water consumption intensity of winter wheat tended to shift to the middle growing stage with an increase during the tillering stem elongation stage and stem elongation anthesis stage two irrigations at the stem elongation and anthesis stages significantly increased yield wpet and iwp with values of 7 79 t ha 1 1 72 kg m 3 and 2 20 kg m 3 respectively compared with those under lower irrigation frequency treatments however a significant decrease in iwp and nonsignificant difference in yield was found when further increasing the irrigation frequency combining the yield wpet and iwp results the recommended optimal irrigation strategies for different precipitation categories are one irrigation at the anthesis stage for wet years with yield wpet and iwp values of 6 95 t ha 1 1 49 kg m 3 and 1 73 kg m 3 respectively two irrigations at the stem elongation and anthesis stages for normal years which emphasizes meeting the water requirement during the tillering stem elongation and heading milk stages and two irrigations for dry conditions low precipitation with emphasis on water requirements during the tillering stem elongation stage in conclusion optimizing irrigation strategies according to precipitation categories can synchronously achieve the goals of increasing water utilization efficiency and achieving higher yield with respect to interannual precipitation variability which promises to be a sustainable agricultural practice keywords aquacrop model winter wheat irrigation strategy precipitation variabity water productivity 1 introduction water shortages are an important factor limiting crop production throughout the world shahbaz et al 2009 dong et al 2011 araya et al 2019 winter wheat is one of the most widely grown crops in the north china plain ncp supplying more than 72 of china s wheat production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 however annual precipitation varies considerably between 500 and 600 mm with a standard deviation of 48 mm of the annual precipitation 70 80 is concentrated in the summertime july to september and thus the precipitation received during the wheat growth period can meet only 25 40 of a crop s water requirements leaving a 200 300 mm water deficit in the ncp liu et al 2001 cao et al 2013 therefore irrigation is critical for maintaining high wheat yield approximately 75 of the agricultural land is irrigated and consumes 70 80 of the total water resource allocation in the ncp khan et al 2009 fang et al 2010 the region s farmers typically irrigate 3 5 times during the winter wheat growing season and sometimes irrigate as much as 6 7 times using flood irrigation techniques zhang et al 2005 overirrigation frequently occurs a lack of adequate surface water sources leads to the extensive use of groundwater for irrigation in a majority of the ncp groundwater pumping has resulted in approximately a 1 0 1 5 m per year decline in the groundwater table over the entire ncp in the past 20 years fang et al 2010 yuan and shen 2013 kong et al 2016 in addition aridification trends and an increased spatial and temporal variation in precipitation throughout the ncp as a result of climate change have aggravated the conflict between water supply and demand wang et al 2008 luo et al 2015 mo et al 2016 therefore it is important to improve grain yield and water productivity when growing winter wheat in the ncp region regulated deficit irrigation rdi typically defined as an irrigation strategy whereby a crop is irrigated with an amount of water less than the full requirement for optimal plant growth is a promising approach to improve a crop s water utilization du et al 2015 chai et al 2016 kang et al 2017 growth stage based deficit irrigation which applies rdi to meet full crop water requirements at critical growth stages and allows a certain degree of water stress at noncritical growth stages have been gradually adopted as a means for optimizing winter wheat irrigation strategies kang et al 2002 chai et al 2016 field experiments were recently conducted to examine the effect of rdi on winter wheat growth grain yield and water productivity rdi with optimized timing and water amount such as critical irrigation irrigating twice at presowing and stem elongation and minimum irrigation irrigating once at presowing significantly reduced irrigation water uses without jeopardizing grain yield in the ncp s piedmont plain zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 however based on an evaluation of the effect of different irrigation strategies on winter wheat grain yield and water utilization in the ncp s primary main alluvial plain inconsistent irrigation strategies are recommended such as a single irrigation of 60 mm applied at elongation xu et al 2016 two irrigations of 150 mm applied at stem elongation and anthesis xu et al 2018 or disposable presowing irrigation of 75 mm sun et al 2019 these differences may be attributed to large interannual precipitation variability thus irrigation regime optimization must be evaluated under long term weather uncertainty and requires an understanding of how crop production can be impacted by reduced irrigation field experiments are effective methods to study the response of yield and water use efficiency of crops zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a however field experiments are time consuming costly difficult to maintain over long timelines and field data results are affected by agronomic soil and weather conditions during the experimental period opportunities exist to examine the effects of water management practices under long term interannual climate variability using process based crop models steduto et al 2009 patil et al 2014 mancosu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b crop models can accurately simulate major field management practices based on the input of weather soil and crop parameters and can quantitatively export physiological and ecological indicators of each growing stage jones et al 1998 sun et al 2017 thus crop models are powerful tools with which to explore the optimization of irrigation strategies under long term weather conditions the cropwat model can estimate crop evapotranspiration effective precipitation and soil water balance and has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation strategies and the evaluation of crop yields under rain fed or full irrigation regimes patil et al 2014 however similar to many other models the cropwat model can only simulate crop water demand it cannot accurately uncover crop water relations under varied water conditions in 2009 the fao organized a meeting of experts from different countries and fields to develop a new aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 a new concept crop water productivity was added to this model which features a water driven growth engine aquacrop simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed supplemental deficit and full irrigation conditions steduto et al 2009 at present aquacrop has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation regimes of wheat corn rice tomato potato cotton and other crops and it plays an important role in improving traditional irrigation strategies and conserving water resources andarzian et al 2011 garc√≠a vila and fereres 2012 teng et al 2015 linker et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2018 understanding the water supply water requirements and water deficits during winter wheat growth periods under precipitation variability is critical for optimal water use in the ncp region mei et al 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2015 optimization of irrigation strategies for irrigation water allocation is of great importance in balancing groundwater use and winter wheat production considering the water shortage challenges in the ncp the aquacrop model validated in a prior study for winter wheat han et al 2019 was used in this study with the objectives to 1 analyze the trends of winter wheat water requirements and water consumption intensity in wuqiao county over the past 35 years 2 simulate and evaluate wheat yield wpet and iwp under different precipitation regimes and different irrigation strategies and 3 propose optimal irrigation strategies applicable to different precipitation categories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wuqiao county is located in cangzhou city hebei province which is the hinterland of the ncp fig 1 the terrain is characteristically low flat land with an average elevation of 16 m the climate is warm temperate and continental monsoon typically with hot rainy summers and dry cold winters the average annual temperature is 12 6 c the average annual precipitation is 552 mm 1981 2015 the average annual evaporation is 1 190 mm the annual accumulated temperature is 4 862 9 c and the frost free period is 192 days winter wheat summer maize rotation two harvests per year is the dominant cropping system in this area however during the winter wheat growing season from mid october to early june the precipitation in wuqiao county is approximately 134 mm which only accounts for 24 of the total annual precipitation fig 2 therefore the exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes is a common practice for wheat production 2 2 aquacrop model description the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated in a previous study han et al 2019 the field experiment used for model calibration and validation was conducted at the wuqiao experimental station of the china agricultural university in wuqiao county which is the most representative of the study region in terms of climate soil and crop management the model validation results revealed that the simulated canopy coverage and yield matched the measured data well the model performance using different statistic parameters was satisfactory for the validation period aquacrop assesses the response of crop yield to water by calculating crop water use efficiency aquacrop is driven by daily soil water balance to simulate crop growth then transpiration is translated into biomass using a normalized biomass water productivity parameter crop yield is simulated using four phases crop development crop transpiration biomass production and yield formation raes et al 2009 yield can then be obtained from the correlation between biomass and the harvest index hi aquacrop is a canopy level model because it simulates crop development through the canopy s expansion aging conductance and senescence the crop s stomata conductance canopy senescence leaf growth and yield response to water stress are modeled using four stress coefficients stomata closure leaf expansion canopy senescence and change in hi this principle makes aquacrop a useful tool to simulate crop productivity under water stress and rain fed conditions steduto et al 2009 in the aquacrop model the crop evapotranspiration is divided into two parts soil evaporation e and crop transpiration tr to avoid confusing the effects of nonproductive water and productive water transpiration is correlated with canopy cover which is proportional to the degree of soil cover and evaporation is proportional to the area of soil not covered by vegetation the final yield is divided into biomass b and the hi to highlight the different responses of b and the hi to water stress the relationships between crop yield and crop evapotranspiration are described in eq s 1 3 1 y f h i h i 0 b 2 b w p t r where y is the final crop yield kg m 2 f h i is a multiplier that considers the stresses that adjust the hi from its reference value h i 0 is the reference hi b is the total aboveground biomass kg m 2 wp is the normalized water productivity kg m 2 mm 1 and tr is the crop transpiration mm tr is described as follows using the crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 3 t r k s k c t r x c c e t 0 where k s is the stress coefficient k c t r x is the crop coefficient for maximum crop transpiration c c is the canopy cover adjusted for microadvective effects and e t 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm as determined by the fao penman monteith equation the crop water requirement cwr is the amount of evapotranspiration for crops from planting to harvest under ideal growing conditions ideal conditions signifies that precipitation or irrigation can ensure adequate soil moisture without affecting crop growth or crop yield due to moisture constraints the crop water requirement is equal to the standard crop evapotranspiration etc i e cwr etc egan 2011 2 3 data collection and preparation weather data were obtained from the china meteorological science sharing service network https data cma cn en daily weather data include average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation sunshine hours relative humidity and average wind speed the required input soil data for aquacrop are the saturated hydraulic conductivity volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point the groundwater depth in wuqiao county exceeds the maximum value in the aquacrop model by 30 m thus it was not considered in this study soil in the top layer 0 100 cm was classified as loam soil the 100 120 cm layer was classified as clay and soil below 120 cm was classified as sandy soil some soil layers were mixed with a small amount of clay the topsoil 0 20 cm consisted of organic matter 14 7 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 96 g kg 1 alkaline nitrogen 64 2 g kg 1 available phosphorus 14 8 mg kg 1 and available potassium 123 5 mg kg 1 2 4 water consumption intensity water consumption intensity wci is the water consumption per unit area of the plant population per unit time the common unit of which is mm d 1 the wci of the crop is the ratio of water demand at each stage of the crop growth period to the number of days in the corresponding stage wang et al 2013 which reflects the intensity of crop water requirements at different growth stages the formula is 4 w c i e t c d where wci is the daily water consumption intensity of a specific growth period of the crop mm d 1 etc is the water requirement of the growth period mm and d is the length of the growth period d 2 5 precipitation scenario analysis precipitation category years are a reflection of the precipitation during crop growth we used empirical frequency analysis efa to classify precipitation category years according to the precipitation amount in each winter wheat growing season for the period 1981 to 2015 previous studies demonstrated that the empirical probability calculated by the efa method agrees well with the theoretical probability from the pearson type iii distribution providing confidence in using efa to determine precipitation category years zhang et al 2007 2016 zhao et al 2018 the steps of the efa method are as follows a rank precipitation in the wheat growing season of each year in descending order based on the total number of growing seasons n b assign each descending order as a rank m with the largest as 1 and the smallest as n c calculate the empirical probability p using the weibull equation chow et al 1988 5 p m n 1 100 d divide n observations into precipitation category years according to their p value zhang et al 2016 the precipitation years are divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separating points of 25 50 and 75 p values respectively 2 6 irrigation strategy evaluation 2 6 1 different irrigation scenarios the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was used to investigate changes in yield potential and water productivity of winter wheat under different irrigation management scenarios according to the water demand and the growth and development stage of winter wheat in wuqiao county over a 35 year period crop phenology was defined by the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 according to the average phenology of the field observation when 50 of shoots reached the main developmental stage critical water requirement stages for winter wheat include tillering z26 stem elongation z31 the beginning of anthesis z61 and early milk z73 thus the corresponding dates when irrigation occurred in the aquacrop model are march 15 april 10 may 2 and may 15 seven different stage based irrigation scheduling scenarios were evaluated including ta nonirrigation tb presowing irrigation only tc irrigated at the stem elongation stage td irrigated at the anthesis stage te irrigated at the stem elongation and anthesis stages tf irrigated at the stem elongation anthesis and early milk stages and tg irrigated at the tillering stem elongation anthesis and early milk stages table 1 2 6 2 water productivity crop water productivity wpet also known as crop water use efficiency is the grain yield produced by crop consumption per unit water consumption it is a comprehensive physiological indicator for assessing the appropriateness of crop growth and water use in this study wpet is defined as the ratio of grain yield to actual evapotranspiration as shown in eq 6 lorite et al 2013 6 w p e t g y 10 e t where wpet is the water productivity kg m 3 gy is the final grain yield of wheat kg ha 1 and et is the total daily evapotranspiration over winter wheat growing season mm i e the water consumption of wheat during the entire growth period the number 10 is the conversion parameter 2 6 3 irrigation water productivity to evaluate the effect of irrigation water consumption on yield and evaluate the effectiveness on enhancing yield irrigation water productivity iwp unit kg m 3 was introduced and is defined as attia et al 2016 7 i w p g y g y w 10 w i r r where gy is the grain yield under irrigation kg ha 1 gyw is the grain yield under rain fed conditions kg ha 1 and wirr is the amount of irrigation water mm 10 is the conversion parameter 3 results 3 1 evaluation of fluctuations in water demand for winter wheat the precipitation empirical probability was calculated by empirical frequency analysis using the historical weather data of wuqiao county and the growth period data of winter wheat in the 35 year period studied nine seventeen and nine years were considered to be wet normal and dry years respectively we evaluated the water requirement of winter wheat referencing weather and growth period data from 1981 to 2015 fig 3 the results revealed that the water requirement of winter wheat during the entire growing period in wuqiao county ranged from 363 to 481 mm and the average crop water requirement was 427 mm precipitation ranged from 44 to 312 mm with an average value of 135 mm the amount of water deficit varied between 136 and 387 mm with an average value of 292 mm for the study period precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat exhibited a higher variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 and could not meet the crop s water demand therefore irrigation was essential to meeting the water requirement of winter wheat furthermore we analyzed the water consumption intensity wci of winter wheat in different growth stages for the 35 year period fig 4 the wci of winter wheat in different growth stages exhibited different variation trends an increasing trend was present during the tillering stem elongation and stem elongation anthesis stages whereas a decreasing trend was observed during the sowing tillering and anthesis ripening stages the highest wci was observed during the stem elongation anthesis stage and the lowest was detected during the seeding tillering stage these results indicated that the wci of winter wheat tends to shift to a middle growing stage an anthesis stage in april 3 2 wheat yield water productivity wpet and irrigation water productivity iwp under different irrigation scenarios irrigation amount and timing significantly affected wheat yield as shown in table 2 wheat yield was greatly affected by irrigation when there was less irrigation during the entire growth period the rain fed ta yield was only 2 82 t ha 1 presowing irrigation significantly improved soil moisture during winter wheat sowing and significantly increased wheat yield to 3 38 t ha 1 irrigation at the stem elongation stage tb or anthesis stage tc significantly increased wheat yield two fold compared to ta and a greater increase in yield was observed in tc than tb the yield was 7 79 t ha 1 under two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and the anthesis stages which was similar to the wheat yield under full irrigation significant differences were observed in the water productivity wpet of winter wheat subjected different irrigation treatments table 2 the wpet in tb tc and td were 0 99 kg m 3 1 41 kg m 3 and 1 52 kg m 3 which were 0 90 1 71 and 1 92 times higher than that in ta 0 52 kg m 3 respectively irrigation at the stem elongation and anthesis stages te significantly increased the wpet by 3 31 times to 1 72 kg m 3 furthermore there was no difference in wheat yield and wpet among te and those under sufficient irrigation conditions tf and tg the iwp in tb was 0 78 kg m 3 which was the lowest among all the irrigation treatments indicating that presowing irrigation had limited potential to increase wheat yield among the irrigation treatments during the wheat growing period the iwp in tg was the lowest and that in td was the highest with an average multiyear value of 1 47 and 2 29 kg m 3 respectively furthermore the difference in iwp between td and te was not significant and both were 50 0 55 8 higher than in tg these results suggest that te had advantages in improving the wheat yield and iwp 3 3 wheat yield wpet and iwp under different precipitation category and irrigation strategy combinations the winter wheat yield under different precipitation category years was simulated and is presented in fig 5 a the average winter wheat yields in ta during dry normal and wet years were 0 56 2 67 and 3 11 t ha 1 respectively td significantly increased the yield by 110 and 113 in normal and wet category years respectively compared to ta the yield in dry category years increased eight times compared to the ta scenario indicating that irrigation had a significant effect on improving wheat yield especially in dry years the average yield of te that included increased irrigation times tended to be similar over the three precipitation category years more irrigation time did not increase the yield suggesting that full irrigation can weaken the effect of precipitation on wheat yield and two irrigations during the wheat growth period could achieve a comparable yield to that under full irrigation furthermore in wet years two irrigations during the wheat growth period also produced a higher yield level the results of simulated wpet are presented in fig 5b tb increased the wpet by 95 109 and 55 in the dry normal and wet years respectively compared to ta the highest wpet values of 1 79 1 72 and 1 69 kg m 3 were observed in te during the dry normal and wet years respectively the wpet of te was similar to tb in the normal and wet years but it was 188 higher than tb in the dry years therefore the optimal yield and wpet were obtained in te and an increase in irrigation timing have limited potential for increasing yield but reduces the wpet there were significant differences in iwp among the three precipitation category years fig 5c the highest iwp under tb occurred in wet years with an average value of 1 41 kg m 3 which is approximately twice the value during normal years in dry years irrigation during the wheat growing period greatly increased iwp which was consistent with the changes in yield the highest iwp was observed in te in all three precipitation years and further increases in the irrigation amount and time reduced the iwp 4 discussion 4 1 trend in water requirements under interannual precipitation variability in this study we found that precipitation during the winter wheat growing season exhibited large variability 44 312 mm among different weather years leading to differences in water requirements 363 481 mm and irrigation water demand 136 387 mm during the 35 year study period sun et al 2010 found that the total water and irrigation water requirements were approximately 430 mm and 247 330 mm respectively which is consistent with our results these large variations could be the result of different optimal irrigation strategies of the field experiments as they were conducted for a short duration typically 2 4 years for example xu et al 2018 suggest that two irrigations of 150 mm at stem elongation and anthesis is the optimal limited irrigation practice for winter wheat production in the ncp but sun et al 2019 advocate that disposable presowing irrigation of 75 mm is a promising water management strategy in increasing water use efficiency and maintaining a high yield of winter wheat therefore based on historical weather data during a 35 year period the results in this study are more robust and reliable because interannual precipitation variation is considered moreover we found that precipitation during the winter wheat growing season exhibited a slow downward trend whereas the water requirements and irrigation water demand presented an increasing trend which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2017 the wci of winter wheat slightly increased during the tillering stem elongation stages and shifted to the mid growing stage anthesis stage in late april similarly yuan and shen 2013 reported that the total net irrigation water requirement in april increases by 20 9 103 8 mm in this region our findings are helpful for informing decision making pertaining to stage based deficit irrigation strategies for winter wheat chai et al 2016 4 2 impacts of irrigation strategies on wheat yield and water productivity the potential winter wheat yield varied significantly among different irrigation treatments particularly during dry category years the stem elongation stage is crucial for vegetative growth and canopy development and a water deficit during this stage has considerable effects on yield li et al 2010 the anthesis stage of winter wheat is an important period for reproductive growth and yield formation a sufficient water supply to meet the water demands during this period is critical to increasing yield sun et al 2006 in normal years two irrigation treatments irrigated at the stem elongation and anthesis stages during the winter wheat growing season can meet the high water productivity requirements the wpet and iwp will decrease in all precipitation category years when irrigation treatments occur more than twice two irrigation treatments are able to maintain a relatively high yield and contribute to production in all three precipitation category years with the exception of extreme drought conditions previous studies revealed that irrigating winter wheat four times each season did not produce as high a yield as three irrigations during dry years or a single irrigation treatment during wet years zhang et al 2003 li et al 2005 chen et al 2014 consistent with our modeling results xu et al 2016 found that one irrigation treatment applied during the stem elongation stage is the best irrigation scheme for efficient water use xu et al 2018 found that two irrigation treatments applied during the stem elongation and anthesis stages resulted in the highest grain yield and wpet therefore one or two irrigation treatments of 75 150 mm are considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat production in this area in terms of both crop yield and wpet 4 3 irrigation strategies alleviate the negative effects of precipitation fluctuations optimization in irrigation regimes that are characterized by precipitation variability is necessary for adapting to water scarcity and is also beneficial for wheat production and water conservation strategies in the ncp a shortage of irrigation water resources is presenting more challenges due to the long term cultivation of high water consumptive crops therefore reducing the exploitation of groundwater for winter wheat irrigation is an effective way to conserve groundwater in this area in the present study one irrigation treatment at the anthesis stage was found to improve the wheat yield and water productivity to 6 95 t ha 1 and 1 49 kg m 3 respectively during wet years this result supports experimental evidence that one irrigation treatment can potentially be the best irrigation scheme for achieving efficient water use and relatively high yield during years characterized by typical climate conditions xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in normal years two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages resulted in the optimum wheat yield and wpet with values of 7 648 t ha 1 and 1 72 kg m 3 respectively our results agree with the findings based on a multiyear field experiment in wuqiao county wang et al 2006 xu et al 2018 wang et al found that two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages 75 mm each time contributed to the best wheat yield and wpet wang et al 2006 which is similar to the result of te in our study during dry years water deficits typically occur during the tillering stages and irrigation during the stem elongation stage to meet the water demands of wheat plays an important role in yield optimization therefore irrigation at the stem elongation stage during dry years could contribute to a stabilized yield and increase the iwp this agrees with the regional limited irrigation modeling of li and ren 2019 based on an agrohydrological model where irrigation treatment during the booting to anthesis stage or two irrigation treatments during the booting to anthesis and early milk stages served as an optimized irrigation scheme for reducing deep groundwater exploitation qin et al 2018 also confirmed that yield reduction was the lowest when irrigating during the stem elongation and milk development stages in water deficient areas adopting an appropriate irrigation strategy according to interannual precipitation variability can reduce the regional irrigation water amount and water consumption optimizing the precipitation that occurs during the winter wheat growing season and leading to overall sustainable agricultural practices 5 conclusion precipitation during the winter wheat growing season fluctuated greatly during the recent 35 year period considered in the present study interannual precipitation variability affected the water requirement of winter wheat and contributed to the water consumption intensity trend shifting from the tillering stem elongation stage to the stem elongation anthesis stage water is the most limiting factor affecting wheat yield which has differential impacts on yield under different levels of water deficit the multiyear average of potential wheat yield under rain fed conditions is 2 82 t ha 1 and the yield potential can reach 7 79 t ha 1 under water deficit irrigation conditions two irrigation treatments can achieve a comparable yield to that under full irrigation in any precipitation conditions wpet and iwp exhibited single peak curves with an increase in irrigation times and were highest under two irrigation treatments we recommend an optimized irrigation strategy under different precipitation conditions to maximize wheat yield wpet and iwp during wet years one irrigation treatment at the anthesis stage can achieve a wheat yield wpet and iwp of 6 95 t ha 1 1 49 kg m 3 and 1 73 kg m 3 respectively during normal years two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages can achieve an optimal wheat yield and wpet during dry years two irrigation treatments at the tillering and stem elongation stages performed the best with respect to wheat yield and wpet in summary optimization of an irrigation strategy according to precipitation category years should be adopted to sustain stable wheat production and water conservation under interannual precipitation

10520,the optimization of irrigation strategies with the goal of increasing water utilization efficiency and achieving higher yield is an important farming practice that helps balance groundwater use and food security during water shortage periods in the north china plain ncp in the present study the aquacrop model was used to simulate winter wheat yield evapotranspiration et water productivity wpet and irrigation water productivity iwp under seven irrigation strategy scenarios and three precipitation categories the results revealed that the annual precipitation fluctuated significantly over the past 35 years 1981 2015 leading to considerably varied irrigation water requirements with an average of 292 mm the water consumption intensity of winter wheat tended to shift to the middle growing stage with an increase during the tillering stem elongation stage and stem elongation anthesis stage two irrigations at the stem elongation and anthesis stages significantly increased yield wpet and iwp with values of 7 79 t ha 1 1 72 kg m 3 and 2 20 kg m 3 respectively compared with those under lower irrigation frequency treatments however a significant decrease in iwp and nonsignificant difference in yield was found when further increasing the irrigation frequency combining the yield wpet and iwp results the recommended optimal irrigation strategies for different precipitation categories are one irrigation at the anthesis stage for wet years with yield wpet and iwp values of 6 95 t ha 1 1 49 kg m 3 and 1 73 kg m 3 respectively two irrigations at the stem elongation and anthesis stages for normal years which emphasizes meeting the water requirement during the tillering stem elongation and heading milk stages and two irrigations for dry conditions low precipitation with emphasis on water requirements during the tillering stem elongation stage in conclusion optimizing irrigation strategies according to precipitation categories can synchronously achieve the goals of increasing water utilization efficiency and achieving higher yield with respect to interannual precipitation variability which promises to be a sustainable agricultural practice keywords aquacrop model winter wheat irrigation strategy precipitation variabity water productivity 1 introduction water shortages are an important factor limiting crop production throughout the world shahbaz et al 2009 dong et al 2011 araya et al 2019 winter wheat is one of the most widely grown crops in the north china plain ncp supplying more than 72 of china s wheat production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 however annual precipitation varies considerably between 500 and 600 mm with a standard deviation of 48 mm of the annual precipitation 70 80 is concentrated in the summertime july to september and thus the precipitation received during the wheat growth period can meet only 25 40 of a crop s water requirements leaving a 200 300 mm water deficit in the ncp liu et al 2001 cao et al 2013 therefore irrigation is critical for maintaining high wheat yield approximately 75 of the agricultural land is irrigated and consumes 70 80 of the total water resource allocation in the ncp khan et al 2009 fang et al 2010 the region s farmers typically irrigate 3 5 times during the winter wheat growing season and sometimes irrigate as much as 6 7 times using flood irrigation techniques zhang et al 2005 overirrigation frequently occurs a lack of adequate surface water sources leads to the extensive use of groundwater for irrigation in a majority of the ncp groundwater pumping has resulted in approximately a 1 0 1 5 m per year decline in the groundwater table over the entire ncp in the past 20 years fang et al 2010 yuan and shen 2013 kong et al 2016 in addition aridification trends and an increased spatial and temporal variation in precipitation throughout the ncp as a result of climate change have aggravated the conflict between water supply and demand wang et al 2008 luo et al 2015 mo et al 2016 therefore it is important to improve grain yield and water productivity when growing winter wheat in the ncp region regulated deficit irrigation rdi typically defined as an irrigation strategy whereby a crop is irrigated with an amount of water less than the full requirement for optimal plant growth is a promising approach to improve a crop s water utilization du et al 2015 chai et al 2016 kang et al 2017 growth stage based deficit irrigation which applies rdi to meet full crop water requirements at critical growth stages and allows a certain degree of water stress at noncritical growth stages have been gradually adopted as a means for optimizing winter wheat irrigation strategies kang et al 2002 chai et al 2016 field experiments were recently conducted to examine the effect of rdi on winter wheat growth grain yield and water productivity rdi with optimized timing and water amount such as critical irrigation irrigating twice at presowing and stem elongation and minimum irrigation irrigating once at presowing significantly reduced irrigation water uses without jeopardizing grain yield in the ncp s piedmont plain zhang et al 2013 sun et al 2015 however based on an evaluation of the effect of different irrigation strategies on winter wheat grain yield and water utilization in the ncp s primary main alluvial plain inconsistent irrigation strategies are recommended such as a single irrigation of 60 mm applied at elongation xu et al 2016 two irrigations of 150 mm applied at stem elongation and anthesis xu et al 2018 or disposable presowing irrigation of 75 mm sun et al 2019 these differences may be attributed to large interannual precipitation variability thus irrigation regime optimization must be evaluated under long term weather uncertainty and requires an understanding of how crop production can be impacted by reduced irrigation field experiments are effective methods to study the response of yield and water use efficiency of crops zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a however field experiments are time consuming costly difficult to maintain over long timelines and field data results are affected by agronomic soil and weather conditions during the experimental period opportunities exist to examine the effects of water management practices under long term interannual climate variability using process based crop models steduto et al 2009 patil et al 2014 mancosu et al 2016 zhao et al 2019b crop models can accurately simulate major field management practices based on the input of weather soil and crop parameters and can quantitatively export physiological and ecological indicators of each growing stage jones et al 1998 sun et al 2017 thus crop models are powerful tools with which to explore the optimization of irrigation strategies under long term weather conditions the cropwat model can estimate crop evapotranspiration effective precipitation and soil water balance and has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation strategies and the evaluation of crop yields under rain fed or full irrigation regimes patil et al 2014 however similar to many other models the cropwat model can only simulate crop water demand it cannot accurately uncover crop water relations under varied water conditions in 2009 the fao organized a meeting of experts from different countries and fields to develop a new aquacrop model steduto et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 a new concept crop water productivity was added to this model which features a water driven growth engine aquacrop simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed supplemental deficit and full irrigation conditions steduto et al 2009 at present aquacrop has been widely used in the optimization of irrigation regimes of wheat corn rice tomato potato cotton and other crops and it plays an important role in improving traditional irrigation strategies and conserving water resources andarzian et al 2011 garc√≠a vila and fereres 2012 teng et al 2015 linker et al 2016 tsakmakis et al 2018 understanding the water supply water requirements and water deficits during winter wheat growth periods under precipitation variability is critical for optimal water use in the ncp region mei et al 2013 liu et al 2013 li et al 2015 optimization of irrigation strategies for irrigation water allocation is of great importance in balancing groundwater use and winter wheat production considering the water shortage challenges in the ncp the aquacrop model validated in a prior study for winter wheat han et al 2019 was used in this study with the objectives to 1 analyze the trends of winter wheat water requirements and water consumption intensity in wuqiao county over the past 35 years 2 simulate and evaluate wheat yield wpet and iwp under different precipitation regimes and different irrigation strategies and 3 propose optimal irrigation strategies applicable to different precipitation categories 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area wuqiao county is located in cangzhou city hebei province which is the hinterland of the ncp fig 1 the terrain is characteristically low flat land with an average elevation of 16 m the climate is warm temperate and continental monsoon typically with hot rainy summers and dry cold winters the average annual temperature is 12 6 c the average annual precipitation is 552 mm 1981 2015 the average annual evaporation is 1 190 mm the annual accumulated temperature is 4 862 9 c and the frost free period is 192 days winter wheat summer maize rotation two harvests per year is the dominant cropping system in this area however during the winter wheat growing season from mid october to early june the precipitation in wuqiao county is approximately 134 mm which only accounts for 24 of the total annual precipitation fig 2 therefore the exploitation of groundwater for irrigation purposes is a common practice for wheat production 2 2 aquacrop model description the aquacrop model was calibrated and validated in a previous study han et al 2019 the field experiment used for model calibration and validation was conducted at the wuqiao experimental station of the china agricultural university in wuqiao county which is the most representative of the study region in terms of climate soil and crop management the model validation results revealed that the simulated canopy coverage and yield matched the measured data well the model performance using different statistic parameters was satisfactory for the validation period aquacrop assesses the response of crop yield to water by calculating crop water use efficiency aquacrop is driven by daily soil water balance to simulate crop growth then transpiration is translated into biomass using a normalized biomass water productivity parameter crop yield is simulated using four phases crop development crop transpiration biomass production and yield formation raes et al 2009 yield can then be obtained from the correlation between biomass and the harvest index hi aquacrop is a canopy level model because it simulates crop development through the canopy s expansion aging conductance and senescence the crop s stomata conductance canopy senescence leaf growth and yield response to water stress are modeled using four stress coefficients stomata closure leaf expansion canopy senescence and change in hi this principle makes aquacrop a useful tool to simulate crop productivity under water stress and rain fed conditions steduto et al 2009 in the aquacrop model the crop evapotranspiration is divided into two parts soil evaporation e and crop transpiration tr to avoid confusing the effects of nonproductive water and productive water transpiration is correlated with canopy cover which is proportional to the degree of soil cover and evaporation is proportional to the area of soil not covered by vegetation the final yield is divided into biomass b and the hi to highlight the different responses of b and the hi to water stress the relationships between crop yield and crop evapotranspiration are described in eq s 1 3 1 y f h i h i 0 b 2 b w p t r where y is the final crop yield kg m 2 f h i is a multiplier that considers the stresses that adjust the hi from its reference value h i 0 is the reference hi b is the total aboveground biomass kg m 2 wp is the normalized water productivity kg m 2 mm 1 and tr is the crop transpiration mm tr is described as follows using the crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 3 t r k s k c t r x c c e t 0 where k s is the stress coefficient k c t r x is the crop coefficient for maximum crop transpiration c c is the canopy cover adjusted for microadvective effects and e t 0 is the reference evapotranspiration mm as determined by the fao penman monteith equation the crop water requirement cwr is the amount of evapotranspiration for crops from planting to harvest under ideal growing conditions ideal conditions signifies that precipitation or irrigation can ensure adequate soil moisture without affecting crop growth or crop yield due to moisture constraints the crop water requirement is equal to the standard crop evapotranspiration etc i e cwr etc egan 2011 2 3 data collection and preparation weather data were obtained from the china meteorological science sharing service network https data cma cn en daily weather data include average temperature maximum temperature minimum temperature precipitation sunshine hours relative humidity and average wind speed the required input soil data for aquacrop are the saturated hydraulic conductivity volumetric water content at saturation field capacity and permanent wilting point the groundwater depth in wuqiao county exceeds the maximum value in the aquacrop model by 30 m thus it was not considered in this study soil in the top layer 0 100 cm was classified as loam soil the 100 120 cm layer was classified as clay and soil below 120 cm was classified as sandy soil some soil layers were mixed with a small amount of clay the topsoil 0 20 cm consisted of organic matter 14 7 g kg 1 total nitrogen 0 96 g kg 1 alkaline nitrogen 64 2 g kg 1 available phosphorus 14 8 mg kg 1 and available potassium 123 5 mg kg 1 2 4 water consumption intensity water consumption intensity wci is the water consumption per unit area of the plant population per unit time the common unit of which is mm d 1 the wci of the crop is the ratio of water demand at each stage of the crop growth period to the number of days in the corresponding stage wang et al 2013 which reflects the intensity of crop water requirements at different growth stages the formula is 4 w c i e t c d where wci is the daily water consumption intensity of a specific growth period of the crop mm d 1 etc is the water requirement of the growth period mm and d is the length of the growth period d 2 5 precipitation scenario analysis precipitation category years are a reflection of the precipitation during crop growth we used empirical frequency analysis efa to classify precipitation category years according to the precipitation amount in each winter wheat growing season for the period 1981 to 2015 previous studies demonstrated that the empirical probability calculated by the efa method agrees well with the theoretical probability from the pearson type iii distribution providing confidence in using efa to determine precipitation category years zhang et al 2007 2016 zhao et al 2018 the steps of the efa method are as follows a rank precipitation in the wheat growing season of each year in descending order based on the total number of growing seasons n b assign each descending order as a rank m with the largest as 1 and the smallest as n c calculate the empirical probability p using the weibull equation chow et al 1988 5 p m n 1 100 d divide n observations into precipitation category years according to their p value zhang et al 2016 the precipitation years are divided into three classes wet year normal year and dry year with separating points of 25 50 and 75 p values respectively 2 6 irrigation strategy evaluation 2 6 1 different irrigation scenarios the calibrated and validated aquacrop model was used to investigate changes in yield potential and water productivity of winter wheat under different irrigation management scenarios according to the water demand and the growth and development stage of winter wheat in wuqiao county over a 35 year period crop phenology was defined by the zadoks scale zadoks et al 1974 according to the average phenology of the field observation when 50 of shoots reached the main developmental stage critical water requirement stages for winter wheat include tillering z26 stem elongation z31 the beginning of anthesis z61 and early milk z73 thus the corresponding dates when irrigation occurred in the aquacrop model are march 15 april 10 may 2 and may 15 seven different stage based irrigation scheduling scenarios were evaluated including ta nonirrigation tb presowing irrigation only tc irrigated at the stem elongation stage td irrigated at the anthesis stage te irrigated at the stem elongation and anthesis stages tf irrigated at the stem elongation anthesis and early milk stages and tg irrigated at the tillering stem elongation anthesis and early milk stages table 1 2 6 2 water productivity crop water productivity wpet also known as crop water use efficiency is the grain yield produced by crop consumption per unit water consumption it is a comprehensive physiological indicator for assessing the appropriateness of crop growth and water use in this study wpet is defined as the ratio of grain yield to actual evapotranspiration as shown in eq 6 lorite et al 2013 6 w p e t g y 10 e t where wpet is the water productivity kg m 3 gy is the final grain yield of wheat kg ha 1 and et is the total daily evapotranspiration over winter wheat growing season mm i e the water consumption of wheat during the entire growth period the number 10 is the conversion parameter 2 6 3 irrigation water productivity to evaluate the effect of irrigation water consumption on yield and evaluate the effectiveness on enhancing yield irrigation water productivity iwp unit kg m 3 was introduced and is defined as attia et al 2016 7 i w p g y g y w 10 w i r r where gy is the grain yield under irrigation kg ha 1 gyw is the grain yield under rain fed conditions kg ha 1 and wirr is the amount of irrigation water mm 10 is the conversion parameter 3 results 3 1 evaluation of fluctuations in water demand for winter wheat the precipitation empirical probability was calculated by empirical frequency analysis using the historical weather data of wuqiao county and the growth period data of winter wheat in the 35 year period studied nine seventeen and nine years were considered to be wet normal and dry years respectively we evaluated the water requirement of winter wheat referencing weather and growth period data from 1981 to 2015 fig 3 the results revealed that the water requirement of winter wheat during the entire growing period in wuqiao county ranged from 363 to 481 mm and the average crop water requirement was 427 mm precipitation ranged from 44 to 312 mm with an average value of 135 mm the amount of water deficit varied between 136 and 387 mm with an average value of 292 mm for the study period precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat exhibited a higher variability with a coefficient of variation of 42 and could not meet the crop s water demand therefore irrigation was essential to meeting the water requirement of winter wheat furthermore we analyzed the water consumption intensity wci of winter wheat in different growth stages for the 35 year period fig 4 the wci of winter wheat in different growth stages exhibited different variation trends an increasing trend was present during the tillering stem elongation and stem elongation anthesis stages whereas a decreasing trend was observed during the sowing tillering and anthesis ripening stages the highest wci was observed during the stem elongation anthesis stage and the lowest was detected during the seeding tillering stage these results indicated that the wci of winter wheat tends to shift to a middle growing stage an anthesis stage in april 3 2 wheat yield water productivity wpet and irrigation water productivity iwp under different irrigation scenarios irrigation amount and timing significantly affected wheat yield as shown in table 2 wheat yield was greatly affected by irrigation when there was less irrigation during the entire growth period the rain fed ta yield was only 2 82 t ha 1 presowing irrigation significantly improved soil moisture during winter wheat sowing and significantly increased wheat yield to 3 38 t ha 1 irrigation at the stem elongation stage tb or anthesis stage tc significantly increased wheat yield two fold compared to ta and a greater increase in yield was observed in tc than tb the yield was 7 79 t ha 1 under two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and the anthesis stages which was similar to the wheat yield under full irrigation significant differences were observed in the water productivity wpet of winter wheat subjected different irrigation treatments table 2 the wpet in tb tc and td were 0 99 kg m 3 1 41 kg m 3 and 1 52 kg m 3 which were 0 90 1 71 and 1 92 times higher than that in ta 0 52 kg m 3 respectively irrigation at the stem elongation and anthesis stages te significantly increased the wpet by 3 31 times to 1 72 kg m 3 furthermore there was no difference in wheat yield and wpet among te and those under sufficient irrigation conditions tf and tg the iwp in tb was 0 78 kg m 3 which was the lowest among all the irrigation treatments indicating that presowing irrigation had limited potential to increase wheat yield among the irrigation treatments during the wheat growing period the iwp in tg was the lowest and that in td was the highest with an average multiyear value of 1 47 and 2 29 kg m 3 respectively furthermore the difference in iwp between td and te was not significant and both were 50 0 55 8 higher than in tg these results suggest that te had advantages in improving the wheat yield and iwp 3 3 wheat yield wpet and iwp under different precipitation category and irrigation strategy combinations the winter wheat yield under different precipitation category years was simulated and is presented in fig 5 a the average winter wheat yields in ta during dry normal and wet years were 0 56 2 67 and 3 11 t ha 1 respectively td significantly increased the yield by 110 and 113 in normal and wet category years respectively compared to ta the yield in dry category years increased eight times compared to the ta scenario indicating that irrigation had a significant effect on improving wheat yield especially in dry years the average yield of te that included increased irrigation times tended to be similar over the three precipitation category years more irrigation time did not increase the yield suggesting that full irrigation can weaken the effect of precipitation on wheat yield and two irrigations during the wheat growth period could achieve a comparable yield to that under full irrigation furthermore in wet years two irrigations during the wheat growth period also produced a higher yield level the results of simulated wpet are presented in fig 5b tb increased the wpet by 95 109 and 55 in the dry normal and wet years respectively compared to ta the highest wpet values of 1 79 1 72 and 1 69 kg m 3 were observed in te during the dry normal and wet years respectively the wpet of te was similar to tb in the normal and wet years but it was 188 higher than tb in the dry years therefore the optimal yield and wpet were obtained in te and an increase in irrigation timing have limited potential for increasing yield but reduces the wpet there were significant differences in iwp among the three precipitation category years fig 5c the highest iwp under tb occurred in wet years with an average value of 1 41 kg m 3 which is approximately twice the value during normal years in dry years irrigation during the wheat growing period greatly increased iwp which was consistent with the changes in yield the highest iwp was observed in te in all three precipitation years and further increases in the irrigation amount and time reduced the iwp 4 discussion 4 1 trend in water requirements under interannual precipitation variability in this study we found that precipitation during the winter wheat growing season exhibited large variability 44 312 mm among different weather years leading to differences in water requirements 363 481 mm and irrigation water demand 136 387 mm during the 35 year study period sun et al 2010 found that the total water and irrigation water requirements were approximately 430 mm and 247 330 mm respectively which is consistent with our results these large variations could be the result of different optimal irrigation strategies of the field experiments as they were conducted for a short duration typically 2 4 years for example xu et al 2018 suggest that two irrigations of 150 mm at stem elongation and anthesis is the optimal limited irrigation practice for winter wheat production in the ncp but sun et al 2019 advocate that disposable presowing irrigation of 75 mm is a promising water management strategy in increasing water use efficiency and maintaining a high yield of winter wheat therefore based on historical weather data during a 35 year period the results in this study are more robust and reliable because interannual precipitation variation is considered moreover we found that precipitation during the winter wheat growing season exhibited a slow downward trend whereas the water requirements and irrigation water demand presented an increasing trend which is consistent with the findings of zhang et al 2017 the wci of winter wheat slightly increased during the tillering stem elongation stages and shifted to the mid growing stage anthesis stage in late april similarly yuan and shen 2013 reported that the total net irrigation water requirement in april increases by 20 9 103 8 mm in this region our findings are helpful for informing decision making pertaining to stage based deficit irrigation strategies for winter wheat chai et al 2016 4 2 impacts of irrigation strategies on wheat yield and water productivity the potential winter wheat yield varied significantly among different irrigation treatments particularly during dry category years the stem elongation stage is crucial for vegetative growth and canopy development and a water deficit during this stage has considerable effects on yield li et al 2010 the anthesis stage of winter wheat is an important period for reproductive growth and yield formation a sufficient water supply to meet the water demands during this period is critical to increasing yield sun et al 2006 in normal years two irrigation treatments irrigated at the stem elongation and anthesis stages during the winter wheat growing season can meet the high water productivity requirements the wpet and iwp will decrease in all precipitation category years when irrigation treatments occur more than twice two irrigation treatments are able to maintain a relatively high yield and contribute to production in all three precipitation category years with the exception of extreme drought conditions previous studies revealed that irrigating winter wheat four times each season did not produce as high a yield as three irrigations during dry years or a single irrigation treatment during wet years zhang et al 2003 li et al 2005 chen et al 2014 consistent with our modeling results xu et al 2016 found that one irrigation treatment applied during the stem elongation stage is the best irrigation scheme for efficient water use xu et al 2018 found that two irrigation treatments applied during the stem elongation and anthesis stages resulted in the highest grain yield and wpet therefore one or two irrigation treatments of 75 150 mm are considered suitable and recommended for winter wheat production in this area in terms of both crop yield and wpet 4 3 irrigation strategies alleviate the negative effects of precipitation fluctuations optimization in irrigation regimes that are characterized by precipitation variability is necessary for adapting to water scarcity and is also beneficial for wheat production and water conservation strategies in the ncp a shortage of irrigation water resources is presenting more challenges due to the long term cultivation of high water consumptive crops therefore reducing the exploitation of groundwater for winter wheat irrigation is an effective way to conserve groundwater in this area in the present study one irrigation treatment at the anthesis stage was found to improve the wheat yield and water productivity to 6 95 t ha 1 and 1 49 kg m 3 respectively during wet years this result supports experimental evidence that one irrigation treatment can potentially be the best irrigation scheme for achieving efficient water use and relatively high yield during years characterized by typical climate conditions xu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in normal years two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages resulted in the optimum wheat yield and wpet with values of 7 648 t ha 1 and 1 72 kg m 3 respectively our results agree with the findings based on a multiyear field experiment in wuqiao county wang et al 2006 xu et al 2018 wang et al found that two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages 75 mm each time contributed to the best wheat yield and wpet wang et al 2006 which is similar to the result of te in our study during dry years water deficits typically occur during the tillering stages and irrigation during the stem elongation stage to meet the water demands of wheat plays an important role in yield optimization therefore irrigation at the stem elongation stage during dry years could contribute to a stabilized yield and increase the iwp this agrees with the regional limited irrigation modeling of li and ren 2019 based on an agrohydrological model where irrigation treatment during the booting to anthesis stage or two irrigation treatments during the booting to anthesis and early milk stages served as an optimized irrigation scheme for reducing deep groundwater exploitation qin et al 2018 also confirmed that yield reduction was the lowest when irrigating during the stem elongation and milk development stages in water deficient areas adopting an appropriate irrigation strategy according to interannual precipitation variability can reduce the regional irrigation water amount and water consumption optimizing the precipitation that occurs during the winter wheat growing season and leading to overall sustainable agricultural practices 5 conclusion precipitation during the winter wheat growing season fluctuated greatly during the recent 35 year period considered in the present study interannual precipitation variability affected the water requirement of winter wheat and contributed to the water consumption intensity trend shifting from the tillering stem elongation stage to the stem elongation anthesis stage water is the most limiting factor affecting wheat yield which has differential impacts on yield under different levels of water deficit the multiyear average of potential wheat yield under rain fed conditions is 2 82 t ha 1 and the yield potential can reach 7 79 t ha 1 under water deficit irrigation conditions two irrigation treatments can achieve a comparable yield to that under full irrigation in any precipitation conditions wpet and iwp exhibited single peak curves with an increase in irrigation times and were highest under two irrigation treatments we recommend an optimized irrigation strategy under different precipitation conditions to maximize wheat yield wpet and iwp during wet years one irrigation treatment at the anthesis stage can achieve a wheat yield wpet and iwp of 6 95 t ha 1 1 49 kg m 3 and 1 73 kg m 3 respectively during normal years two irrigation treatments at the stem elongation and anthesis stages can achieve an optimal wheat yield and wpet during dry years two irrigation treatments at the tillering and stem elongation stages performed the best with respect to wheat yield and wpet in summary optimization of an irrigation strategy according to precipitation category years should be adopted to sustain stable wheat production and water conservation under interannual precipitation

implemented using the nlme library pinheiro et al 2019 in r programming language r core team 2017 dunnett contrast with control treatment 100 etc reference coding was performed with the emmeans r package lenth 2019 to monitor soil water content volumetric soil moisture was measured using a time domain reflectometry system campbell scientific inc usa data was recorded at three hours interval and aggregated to daily averaged values probes of 15 cm long were installed under the drippers at four depths 10 20 30 and 45 cm for a tomato plant located in a mid irrigation line a total of four probes per experimental plot were installed 2 2 multispectral imagery and unmanned aerial vehicle u a v missions a multispectral parrot sequoia camera parrot drones sas france with a coupled sunshine radiation sensor onboard of the u a v was used to capture the images this camera allows capturing green g red r red edge r e and near infra red n i r bands with 1 2 mpx 10 bit spectral images in t i f f format the bands wavelength widths are 530 570 640 680 730 740 and 770 810 n m respectively the sunshine sensor allows correcting the imagery radiometrically using the incoming radiation information a total of 10 u a v flights were performed during the tomato growth cycle the first flight was achieved at 11 d a t and the last one at 86 d a t once the plant senescence started maturity stage all the u a v flight missions were accomplished at a similar average altitude of 25 m along with the sunshine sensor radiometric calibration targets were used to accurately obtain the reflectance of the imagery ground control points gcp were fixed in the experimental field to establish georeferencing of the images the orthomosaic for every single band was build based on structure from motion and bundle block adjustment algorithms using pix4dmapper software pix4d sa switzerland individual orthomosaic bands were aligned based on the gcp and converted into a reflectance image finally reflectance images were combined into a single 4 band multispectral orthomosaic with 3 cm resolution for each u a v flight mission 2 3 plant canopy reflectance information extraction individual plant delineation and identification were performed based on oversegmented superpixel extraction and posterior cluster implementation for each image first a tiling process based on the plant density for each individual plant was performed to reduce computation time second the simple linear iterative cluster s l i c method achanta et al 2012 was used to segment individual tiles and to delineate individual plants s l i c is a local k means clustering adaptation to generate superpixels i e compact atomic regions based on spectral and spatial information simultaneously in this study n i r r and g bands were used to generate the superpixels then the affinity propagation algorithm frey and dueck 2007 was implemented to cluster the superpixels the affinity propagation is a relatively new non hierarchical clustering method that uses a message passing algorithm this method takes as input measures of similarity e g negative euclidean distance between pairs of data points e g superpixels real valued messages are iteratively exchanged between data points superpixels until a good set of representative points and corresponding clusters are found frey and dueck 2007 an additional specific explanation can be found in brusco et al 2018 the clusters belonging to the plant were extracted based on the centroid of each individual plant this semi supervised method was applied for the 3 mid row irrigation lines and limited to 15 central plants per row in order to avoid border effect errors on these individual delineated plants the averaged normalized difference vegetation index n d v i rouse et al 1974 per pixel was calculated this quantitative expression of vegetation vigor was estimated using the following formula 3 n d v i n i r r n i r r where n i r is near infra red band and r is the red band reflectance values as a consequence tomato canopy n d v i values per plant were obtained for each specific u a v image at each time representing typical longitudinal or repeated measures data a preliminary linear mixed model was implemented to contrast the irrigation effects i e fixed effects on ndvi versus the control treatment 100 etc the dynamics of the n d v i values were modeled with g d d nested in the treatment while individual plants were considered as the experimental unit i e random effects the linear mixed model was fit using the nlme r package pinheiro et al 2019 dunnett contrasts with the control treatment 100 etc reference coding was performed with the emmeans r library lenth 2019 2 4 nonlinear mixed modeling of the n d v i data a three parameter logistic growth function archontoulis and miguez 2015 was adopted for the nonlinear mixed model after preliminary initial parameter estimation with nonlinear function fits the three parameter logistic model is applicable as it predicts n d v i as function of œï 1 horizontal upper asymptotic œï 2 inflection point abscissa and œï 3 numeric scale parameter on the x axis the three parameter logistic growth curve is described in the following equation 4 n d v i j œï 1 1 e œï 2 g d d j œï 3 where g d d was defined as cumulative growing degree days g d d at day j after transplanting i e time scale of crop phenology given by 5 g d d j i 1 j t i t b where t i is the average daily temperature c t b is the base temperature assumed to be 10 c for tomato scholberg et al 2000 and j is the days number of the temperature observations 1 86 d a t the treatment effect on parameter estimates of eq 4 was tested against the control estimates 100 etc by specifying water treatments as a fixed effect plant specific parameters for the logistic growth curve were specified as a random effect therefore the model fit included a mean fixed effect growth function per treatment best linear unbiased estimates blue and plant specific growth curves with random effect parameters best linear unbiased predictions blup which are assumed to be normally distributed model goodness of fit was evaluated by observing predicted versus observed values and calculating prediction intervals of fixed effects confidence intervals at 95 normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were assessed with q q residuals plot and residuals versus fitted values scatter plots the wald test was used to assess the significance of the fixed effect parameters and dunnett contrasts to distinguish the treatment effects from the control the three parameter logistic model equation specifying the fixed and random terms is provided in the supplementary material equation s1 the nlme library pinheiro et al 2019 in r r core team 2017 was used to fit the nonlinear mixed model by maximum likelihood m l estimation based on the lindstrom and bates algorithm lindstrom and bates 1990 pinheiro and bates 2000 this approximation estimates the model parameters alternating between a penalized non linear least square gauss newton algorithm to estimate the fixed and random components and a linear mixed effect hybrid approach of expectation maximisation and newton raphson iterations to return the estimators procedures until the convergence criterion is obtained pinheiro and bates 2000 significance levels for the main effects were estimated with the wald test dunnett contrasts were performed with the emmeans r package lenth 2019 the overall workflow analysis of the study is depicted in the following graphic fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation effects on ground measurements fig 2 shows in panel a l a i and in panel b e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 in function of the growing degree days g d d c for the irrigation treatments l a i of deficit irrigation treatments obtained significantly lower values p 0 05 than the control 100 etc between 800 and 1600 g d d c fig 2a comparing the lai values among the treatments 70 and 50 etc did not obtain statistically significant differences treatment 85 etc obtained systematically higher values than 70 etc however the difference was significantly different only from 50 etc all the treatments achieved their saturation l a i maximum growth at 1300 g d d 6 11 50 etc 4 14 70 etc 3 14 85 etc and 3 07 100 etc fig 2a the growth curve of e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 fig 2b shows a similar trend to the development of l a i fig 2a treatments 50 70 and 85 etc generated significant differences p 0 05 and lower values than 100 etc for the e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 between 800 and 1600 g d d c fig 2b e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 values from treatment 50 etc were not significantly different p 0 05 from 70 etc following the same tendency as l a i fig 2a treatment 85 etc was statistically significant different p 0 05 from 70 and 50 etc maximum e w t c a n o p y values for treatments 70 85 and 100 etc were attained at 1500 g d d when the treatment 50 etc had started senescence fig 2b l a i and e w t c a n o p y were lower for 50 70 and 85 etc treatments than the control from 800 to 1600 g d d due to a lower leaf area expansion it is well known that plant response to a particular irrigation level varies with the plant growth stage climatic conditions cultivar and agronomic management practices khapte et al 2019 as it was shown in fig 2 the highest deficit irrigation treatment 50 etc started senescence earlier than the other treatments 1500 g d d similar results were also found in other studies where water deficit leads to a significant reduction in the vegetative growth and other tomato growth functions i e aboveground biomass and fruit ku≈ü√ßu et al 2014 patan√® et al 2011 patan√® and cosentino 2010 favati et al 2009 underlying mechanisms under deficit irrigation cause reduction in leaf water content and leaf water potential p√©rez pastor et al 2014 liu et al 2006 lowering stomatal conductance and transpiration rates badr et al 2018 hence diminishing leaf area expansion and plant growth shahnazari et al 2007 in addition deficit irrigation applications induce early plant senescence hanson et al 2006 favati et al 2009 related to the structural and physiological effect of the water shortage our research applied the irrigation treatments across the growing season i e along all phenological stages however other studies have shown that flowering and fruit setting stages are most sensitive to irrigation doses in tomato nangare et al 2016 kuscu et al 2014 this was clearly the case for our study where relevant differences in l a i and e w t c a n o p y were noticed from 800 to 1600 g d d regarding the control treatment however as reported by other studies zhang et al 2017 nangare et al 2016 high water deficit treatments not necessarily different from each other e w t c a n o p y has proven to be positively correlated not only with plant biomass and l a i champagne et al 2003 but also to vegetation water content indexes for horticultural crops yilmaz et al 2008 the relationship between l a i and e w t c a n o p y is inherent e w t is an optical thickness measure of water in the leaves therefore an increase in leaves biomass increases both the l a i and the e w t hence e w t c a n o p y champagne et al 2003 3 2 irrigation effects on n d v i and volumetric soil moisture conditions fig 3 a depicts the n d v i and cumulative irrigation mm in function of the growing degree days c for the irrigation treatments the influence of irrigation treatments was positively related to their n d v i values deficit irrigation treatments 50 etc 219 mm 70 etc 289 mm and 85 etc 360 mm obtained lower n d v i values fig 3a than the control 430 mm being more evident once n d v i reached saturation around 900 g d d n d v i values from treatments 50 and 75 etc were not statistically different showing the difficulty to obtain reflectance differences for low water requirements similar to on ground plant measurements fig 2 similarly n d v i of 50 and 85 etc were only statistically different from 1100 to 1500 g d d n d v i s of treatment 70 and 85 etc were significantly at 400 700 900 1300 and 1500 g d d small fluctuations in n d v i were observed when n d v i reached its maximum fig 3a from 900 g d d this might be attributed to the influence of diverse factors in the plant canopy reflectance leaf orientation canopy architecture leaf area and soil background once the tomato plants stop growing maximum averaged n d v i values were 0 731 0 753 0 783 and 0 813 for 50 70 85 and 100 etc treatments fig 3a respectively n d v i probability distribution showing the plant variability in function of growing degree days c for each irrigation treatment is provided in supplementary material fig s2a volumetric soil water content for the irrigation treatments is presented in fig 3b the values represent the average over the soil profile 15 20 30 and 45 cm on daily basis soil water content generally decreased with decreasing water application fig 3a with 100 and 50 etc resulting in the highest and lowest values of soil water content respectively fig 3b a comparison of different water stress conditions showed that volumetric soil moisture was low in high stressed conditions 50 etc which values fluctuated from 0 22 to 0 25 volumetric soil moisture remained relatively low for treatments 70 etc 0 21 0 26 and 85 etc 0 22 0 29 due to insufficient supplementary irrigation while the soil water content for 100 etc treatment was systematically maintained at a high level during the growing season fig 3b n d v i has proven to be important water content sensitive index at plant and canopy scale gerhards et al 2016 genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 roberts et al 1997 and is positively related to e w t c a n o p y for agricultural crops champagne et al 2003 treatments 50 70 and 85 etc obtained systematically lower n d v i values than control across the growing season fig 3a a lower level of n d v i is associated with a slower growth rate and lower biomass accumulation during the vegetative stage hassan et al 2019 in addition healthy plants 100 etc absorb less visible light for photosynthesis i e photosynthetic pigment concentration increase leading to decreased reflectance in the visible band and increased reflectance in the n i r range ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 the opposite occurs for stressed plants treatment 50 70 and 85 etc for this reason canopy n d v i obtained high positive correlation not only with plant biomass chlorophyll leaf area and l a i leroux et al 2016 huang et al 2014 panigada et al 2014 rinaldi et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 k√∂ksal 2011 jones et al 2004 2007 liu et al 2004 but also with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance poblete et al 2017 gago et al 2015 marino et al 2014 shimada et al 2012 baluja et al 2012 genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 n d v i differences among the irrigation treatments were more obvious once the tomato plants reached maturity from 900 g d d than at the initial stages from 0 to 600 g d d fig 3a due to the accumulated effect on the plant physiology fig 2 k√∂ksal 2011 attributed these findings to the effects of water stress doses on the crop canopy caused partially by changes in leaf structure and composition similarly ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 obtained a good correlation between plant water status and structural indices specifically during the tomato late maturity stage when the water stress effects on the plants were already established however canopy n d v i sensitivity becomes weaker with increasing values of l a i due to the asymptotic saturation of n d v i at high l a i liu et al 2012 carlson and ripley 1997 small fluctuations on n d v i once the tomato plants reached maximum growth i e high l a i values might be attributed to n d v i sensitivity to background factors such as the brightness and shade of the vegetation canopy and soil background brightness gago et al 2015 3 3 suitability of nonlinear mixed model fig 4 depicts the nonlinear mixed modeling results for a random coefficient logistic n d v i fit table 1 shows the nonlinear mixed model parameters for the tomato n d v i for the irrigation treatments the three parameter logistic growth model described adequately the n d v i in function of g d d c and was capable to discriminate the deficit irrigation effects on the n d v i growth curves fig 4a results in the following discussion are reported in function of the control treatment standard error of the mean obtained from table 1 and noticed in the panels of fig 4 for œï 1 representing the asymptote value treatment 50 etc obtained a decreased mean of 92 48 0 35 similarly a decreased mean for 70 etc 93 7 0 3 and 85 etc 96 1 0 4 were achieved fig 4b and table 1 the œï 1 fixed effect parameter of the treatments were significantly different p 0 05 from the control fig 4b and between each other p 0 05 for œï 2 representing the inflection point value 50 etc 96 0 0 9 and 85 etc 94 6 0 9 obtained a significant decreased mean from 100 etc p 0 05 fig 4c and table 1 for the extra œï 2 pairwise comparisons the 50 85 etc and 70 100 etc contrasts were not statistically different the scale parameter œï 3 of treatments 50 etc 82 5 3 0 70 etc 94 8 2 2 and 85 etc 97 1 3 0 achieved a significantly decreased mean from control p 0 05 fig 4d and table 1 for the additional œï 3 pairwise comparisons only 70 85 etc contrast was not significant the standard deviation of the random components was 0 019 œï 1 20 608 œï 2 12 581 œï 3 whereas the within plant standard error was 0 05 random coefficient parameters and plant specific three parameter growth curves are provided in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2b respectively fig 4 showed that a nonlinear mixed model can be applied to assess water treatment effect on n d v i growth analysis the implementation of the three parameter logistic model revealed that differences can be captured for the irrigation treatments on tomato canopy n d v i the major advantage of considering the nonlinear mixed model is that it can address not only the irrigation treatment effects on mean n d v i but also its temporal characteristic along the growing season the mixed model was well suited to capture the n d v i differences during the maturity stage i e œï 1 parameter when the cumulative effects of irrigation doses were well defined fig 4a fig 4b and table 1 and n d v i reached its asymptote deficit irrigation doses obtained lower n d v i values than the control captured by the œï 1 parameter during the vegetative stage the inflection point i e œï 2 parameter marked the fastest n d v i growth rate for 100 etc fig 4c and table 1 however the difference from the control regarding the œï 2 parameter was difficult to capture for 70 etc since the difference in the inflection point value table 1 was 5 c g d d representing one d a t 1 g d d 10 c tomato base temperature this can be attributed to the limited number of measurements before n d v i reached its saturation level at high l a i and e w t c a n o p y 800 c g d d the scale parameter œï 3 which is the point where the n d v i value is œï 1 1 e 1 0 73 œï 1 was consistent with œï 1 in function of the irrigation doses since it depended on the saturated n d v i values fig 4d and table 1 this time scale parameter œï 3 accurately characterized how quickly the n d v i growth increased from the initial value to the asymptote œï 1 however œï 3 differences of treatments 70 and 85 etc from control were not significant due to the difficulty of capturing relevant differences in function of growing degree days fig 4d and table 1 fig 5 depicts the goodness of fit and diagnosis figures of the nonlinear mixed model fitting of the logistic growth model prediction intervals for fixed effects i e confidence limits at 95 indicated that the variability of the model predictions was acceptable fig 5a fitted n d v i values were closely matching mean observed n d v i for the water treatments fig 5b the root mean squared error r m s e of the residual n d v i values was 4 9 5 1 5 0 and 3 9 for treatment 50 70 85 and 100 etc respectively normality assumptions for model residuals were satisfied since a linear trend can be noticed in fig 5c being symmetrically distributed around zero additionally no clear systematic pattern in the fitted versus model residual plot was found fig 5d overall the water doses effects on n d v i considering the treatment level i e fixed effects and within plant i e random effects predictions were adequately estimated by the three parameter logistic growth model with a nonlinear mixed model fig 5 the confidence limits for the fixed effects indicated that the variability in predicted n d v i was adequate fig 5a while the fitted n d v i values were similar to the observed n d v i fig 5b moreover the root mean square error linked to the random effects i e plants was admissible 0 049 50 etc 0 051 70 etc 0 050 85 etc and 0 039 100 etc fig 5b the prediction of n d v i is important for the estimation of vegetation fraction cover fc and actual basal crop coefficient kcb the empirical relation of n d v i with fc and kcb along the growing season is defined by the crop phenological development calera et al 2017 the fc and kcb are relevant parameters used with the conventional fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for estimating etc ihuoma and madramootoo 2020 saadi et al 2015 enabling the assessment of crop water requirements for scheduling irrigation jones 2014 the application of three parameter logistic mixed model to assess and predict the effects of deficit irrigation treatment on tomato canopy n d v i provided meaningful outcomes this approach is a mechanistic and integral methodology allowing to study the crop along the growing season under a repeated measures scheme similarly this framework considers not only the irrigation treatment structure but also the variability at plant level simultaneously however the potential for using nonlinear mixed models to expand the assessment of irrigation doses should be complemented based on narrow band hyperspectral and thermal indexes while more sophisticated models can be proposed including spectral autocorrelation or spatial correlation model complexity can make the interpretation of the parameters a difficult task this research showed as study case deficit irrigation treatments solely however the framework can be adapted to explore other agricultural management e g inorganic fertilization or their interaction to get insights into better irrigation strategies this is a relevant consideration to extend the study to other mechanistic nonlinear functions see paine et al 2011 archontoulis and miguez 2015 according to the index trend for exploiting the use of u a v multispectral imagery 4 conclusions this study assessed the use of nonlinear mixed models to fit tomato canopy n d v i under deficit irrigation treatments using high resolution u a v multispectral imagery moreover on ground plant measurements were performed to evaluate canopy characteristics at field level deficit irrigation doses 50 70 and 85 etc induced lower biomass accumulation and greatly affected l a i and e w t c a n o p y attaining lower values p 0 05 than the control treatment 100 etc from 800 to 1600 g d d in spite of reaching higher l a i and e w t c a n o p y values 70 etc was not significantly different from 50 etc p 0 05 showing the difficulty to accurately discriminate treatments with high deficit irrigation however 85 etc produced important differences in e w t c a n o p y and l a i compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments p 0 05 due to a higher leaf area expansion and biomass accumulation deficit irrigation doses led to less vigorous plants resulting in lower n d v i values compared to the control notwithstanding 50 etc obtained lower n d v i values than 70 etc differences were not significant volumetric soil moisture was consistent with the irrigation treatments resulting in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season an adequate n d v i fit based on a three parameter logistic mixed model captured the irrigation treatment effects on tomato canopy n d v i growth curves significant differences at maturity stage were observed from the control p 0 05 when the cumulative effect of the irrigation doses was well defined and n d v i reached asymptotic behavior œï 1 during the vegetative stage the inflection point œï 2 marked the fastest n d v i growth rate for 100 etc treatment whereas the lowest for 50 etc p 0 05 well captured by the model the scale parameter œï 3 followed a decreased trend in function of the deficit irrigation doses the diagnosis plots and the root mean squared error of the observed and fitted n d v i indicated the suitability of using the three parameter logistic mixed model this study provides insights into the feasibility of using nonlinear mixed random coefficient models to analyze spectral vegetation index data to assess irrigation treatments on tomato while n d v i might represent a good index to detect irrigation effects applying mixed models could extend the assessment using other mechanistic nonlinear functions on thermal and narrow band hyperspectral indexes similarly future research should focus on the integration of n d v i to estimate plant water status on real time data analysis the assimilation of these estimates into a crop water stress model would provide an important tool for open field tomato growers for decision making towards optimization of irrigation strategies declaration of competing interest the

irrigation unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral sensor vegetation index nonlinear mixed model 1 introduction unmanned aerial vehicles u a v s equipped with multispectral sensors are a cost efficient approach considering the high sensors performance data acquisition and high flexibility lelong et al 2008 the development and steep rise of u a v s have marked a new era in image acquisition providing data of considerable spatial spectral and temporal resolution colomina and molina 2014 therefore crop canopy status data can be acquired repeatedly without conducting expensive nor destructive crop ground measurements particularly in agronomic experiments where space resource and time constraints limit on ground sampling duan et al 2017 irrigation treatments have been broadly assessed in

nondestructive measurements obtained from multispectral sensors e g ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 using u a v s have been scarcely explored spectral vegetation indices obtained from multispectral

relevance to assess crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 while studies demonstrated the feasibility of n d v i obtained from multispectral sensors for monitoring plant water relations ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 2017 the results indicated that n d v i sensitivity at the plant canopy level needs further assessment moreover approaches taking into account the repeated measurements nature and n d v i temporal nonlinearity are required while traditional statistical models e g polynomial functions for fitting n d v i growth evolution have been used without considering the repeated measures nature mixed modeling has been proposed as the workhorse of statistical image analysis demidenko 2004 mixed models are commonly used for repeated

the intra and inter individual variability respectively while fixed effects are common to all the individuals of specific experimental factor levels e g irrigation treatments random effects describe the variation linked to the subjects e g plants the nonlinear models archontoulis and miguez 2015 paine et al 2011 are mostly used to describe nonlinear responses in time allowing to investigate the comparison of treatments while controlling for repeated measurements in time since deficit irrigation is important to perform better management strategies it is essential the assessment of narrow band reflectance indices to support precision agriculture there is limited reporting of the use of u a v based canopy n d v i considering the repeated measurement structure and plant specific variability for tomato irrigation therefore the aim of the current study was to assess the effect of deficit irrigation treatments on tomato canopy n d v i growth curves based on high resolution multispectral u a v imagery specifically the feasibility to use nonlinear mixed models to identify water treatment effects on tomato growth was explored furthermore on ground plant measurements and soil moisture were studied to validate and describe the effect of the irrigation treatments 2 material and methods 2 1 field experiment and irrigation treatments the field experiment was performed in the regional

senescence plant density was 8097 plants ha 1 i e 1 9 m between lines and 0 65 m inter plant spacing the experiment was established using a latin square design with four replicates considering four irrigation treatments the irrigation treatments were applied based on the actual crop evapotranspiration etc considering 50 70 85 and 100 of the etc reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated using the standardized asce ewri penman monteith equation asce ewri 2005 on daily basis etc was calculated by multiplying et0 with the tomato crop coefficient kc to determine the water requirements kc

irrigation treatments started 16 days after transplanting d a t once the plants were well established each experimental unit had an area of 136 m2 with five irrigation lines and twenty two plants per line a total net area of 2174 m2 was used nitrogen n phosphorus p2o5 and potassium k2o were applied along to local commercial practice 250 100 and 350 kg ha 1 respectively irrigation was performed with one dripper per plant 2 4 l h 1 every two three days while fertigation was applied twice a week during the growth cycle the field was weeded manually and pests and diseases were controlled according to commercial practices field evaluations every five days were performed to verify the health stage of the tomato plants and decide on the agrochemical control methods 2 1 1 aboveground plant destructive measurements and volumetric soil moisture monitoring four plants per treatment totaling 16 plants were periodically sampled to assess canopy characteristics and leaves biomass accumulation at field level these plants were randomly obtained from each subplot destructive plant sampling was performed when 50 of the crop reached critical growth stages shamshiri et al 2018 seedling early growth vegetative flowering fruit formation and ripening maturity fresh and dry weight of the leaf biomass was recorded similarly digital images of all the leaves per plant were taken in each evaluation date 0 20 34 48 62 76 and 90 d a t in order to obtain the leaf area index l a i i e the total leaf area per unit ground area the amount of water in plant leaves was measured by the equivalent water thickness e w t danson et al 1992 ma et al 2019 the leaf e w t g cm 2 is the hypothetical thickness of a single layer of water averaged over the whole leaf area ihuoma and madramootoo

implemented using the nlme library pinheiro et al 2019 in r programming language r core team 2017 dunnett contrast with control treatment 100 etc reference coding was performed with the emmeans r package lenth 2019 to monitor soil water content volumetric soil moisture was measured using a time domain reflectometry system campbell scientific inc usa data was recorded at three hours interval and aggregated to daily averaged values probes of 15 cm long were installed under the drippers at four depths 10 20 30 and 45 cm for a tomato plant located in a mid irrigation line a total of four probes per experimental plot were installed 2 2 multispectral imagery and unmanned aerial vehicle u a v missions a multispectral parrot sequoia camera parrot drones sas france with a coupled sunshine radiation sensor onboard of the u a v was used to capture the images this camera allows capturing green g red r red edge r e and near infra red n i r bands with 1 2 mpx 10 bit spectral images in t i f f format the bands wavelength widths are 530 570 640 680 730 740 and 770 810 n m respectively the sunshine sensor allows correcting the imagery radiometrically using the incoming radiation information a total of 10 u a v flights were performed during the tomato growth cycle the first flight was achieved at 11 d a t and the last one at 86 d a t once the plant senescence started maturity stage all the u a v flight missions were accomplished at a similar average altitude of 25 m along with the sunshine sensor radiometric calibration targets were used to accurately obtain the reflectance of the imagery ground control points gcp were fixed in the experimental field to establish georeferencing of the images the orthomosaic for every single band was build based on structure from motion and bundle block adjustment algorithms using pix4dmapper software pix4d sa switzerland individual orthomosaic bands were aligned based on the gcp and converted into a reflectance image finally reflectance images were combined into a single 4 band multispectral orthomosaic with 3 cm resolution for each u a v flight mission 2 3 plant canopy reflectance information extraction individual plant delineation and identification were performed based on oversegmented superpixel extraction and posterior cluster implementation for each image first a tiling process based on the plant density for each individual plant was performed to reduce computation time second the simple linear iterative cluster s l i c method achanta et al 2012 was used to segment individual tiles and to delineate individual plants s l i c is a local k means clustering adaptation to generate superpixels i e compact atomic regions based on spectral and spatial information simultaneously in this study n i r r and g bands were used to generate the superpixels then the affinity propagation algorithm frey and dueck 2007 was implemented to cluster the superpixels the affinity propagation is a relatively new non hierarchical clustering method that uses a message passing algorithm this method takes as input measures of similarity e g negative euclidean distance between pairs of data points e g superpixels real valued messages are iteratively exchanged between data points superpixels until a good set of representative points and corresponding clusters are found frey and dueck 2007 an additional specific explanation can be found in brusco et al 2018 the clusters belonging to the plant were extracted based on the centroid of each individual plant this semi supervised method was applied for the 3 mid row irrigation lines and limited to 15 central plants per row in order to avoid border effect errors on these individual delineated plants the averaged normalized difference vegetation index n d v i rouse et al 1974 per pixel was calculated this quantitative expression of vegetation vigor was estimated using the following formula 3 n d v i n i r r n i r r where n i r is near infra red band and r is the red band reflectance values as a consequence tomato canopy n d v i values per plant were obtained for each specific u a v image at each time representing typical longitudinal or repeated measures data a preliminary linear mixed model was implemented to contrast the irrigation effects i e fixed effects on ndvi versus the control treatment 100 etc the dynamics of the n d v i values were modeled with g d d nested in the treatment while individual plants were considered as the experimental unit i e random effects the linear mixed model was fit using the nlme r package pinheiro et al 2019 dunnett contrasts with the control treatment 100 etc reference coding was performed with the emmeans r library lenth 2019 2 4 nonlinear mixed modeling of the n d v i data a three parameter logistic growth function archontoulis and miguez 2015 was adopted for the nonlinear mixed model after preliminary initial parameter estimation with nonlinear function fits the three parameter logistic model is applicable as it predicts n d v i as function of œï 1 horizontal upper asymptotic œï 2 inflection point abscissa and œï 3 numeric scale parameter on the x axis the three parameter logistic growth curve is described in the following equation 4 n d v i j œï 1 1 e œï 2 g d d j œï 3 where g d d was defined as cumulative growing degree days g d d at day j after transplanting i e time scale of crop phenology given by 5 g d d j i 1 j t i t b where t i is the average daily temperature c t b is the base temperature assumed to be 10 c for tomato scholberg et al 2000 and j is the days number of the temperature observations 1 86 d a t the treatment effect on parameter estimates of eq 4 was tested against the control estimates 100 etc by specifying water treatments as a fixed effect plant specific parameters for the logistic growth curve were specified as a random effect therefore the model fit included a mean fixed effect growth function per treatment best linear unbiased estimates blue and plant specific growth curves with random effect parameters best linear unbiased predictions blup which are assumed to be normally distributed model goodness of fit was evaluated by observing predicted versus observed values and calculating prediction intervals of fixed effects confidence intervals at 95 normality and variance homogeneity assumptions were assessed with q q residuals plot and residuals versus fitted values scatter plots the wald test was used to assess the significance of the fixed effect parameters and dunnett contrasts to distinguish the treatment effects from the control the three parameter logistic model equation specifying the fixed and random terms is provided in the supplementary material equation s1 the nlme library pinheiro et al 2019 in r r core team 2017 was used to fit the nonlinear mixed model by maximum likelihood m l estimation based on the lindstrom and bates algorithm lindstrom and bates 1990 pinheiro and bates 2000 this approximation estimates the model parameters alternating between a penalized non linear least square gauss newton algorithm to estimate the fixed and random components and a linear mixed effect hybrid approach of expectation maximisation and newton raphson iterations to return the estimators procedures until the convergence criterion is obtained pinheiro and bates 2000 significance levels for the main effects were estimated with the wald test dunnett contrasts were performed with the emmeans r package lenth 2019 the overall workflow analysis of the study is depicted in the following graphic fig 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation effects on ground measurements fig 2 shows in panel a l a i and in panel b e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 in function of the growing degree days g d d c for the irrigation treatments l a i of deficit irrigation treatments obtained significantly lower values p 0 05 than the control 100 etc between 800 and 1600 g d d c fig 2a comparing the lai values among the treatments 70 and 50 etc did not obtain statistically significant differences treatment 85 etc obtained systematically higher values than 70 etc however the difference was significantly different only from 50 etc all the treatments achieved their saturation l a i maximum growth at 1300 g d d 6 11 50 etc 4 14 70 etc 3 14 85 etc and 3 07 100 etc fig 2a the growth curve of e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 fig 2b shows a similar trend to the development of l a i fig 2a treatments 50 70 and 85 etc generated significant differences p 0 05 and lower values than 100 etc for the e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 between 800 and 1600 g d d c fig 2b e w t c a n o p y g cm 2 values from treatment 50 etc were not significantly different p 0 05 from 70 etc following the same tendency as l a i fig 2a treatment 85 etc was statistically significant different p 0 05 from 70 and 50 etc maximum e w t c a n o p y values for treatments 70 85 and 100 etc were attained at 1500 g d d when the treatment 50 etc had started senescence fig 2b l a i and e w t c a n o p y were lower for 50 70 and 85 etc treatments than the control from 800 to 1600 g d d due to a lower leaf area expansion it is well known that plant response to a particular irrigation level varies with the plant growth stage climatic conditions cultivar and agronomic management practices khapte et al 2019 as it was shown in fig 2 the highest deficit irrigation treatment 50 etc started senescence earlier than the other treatments 1500 g d d similar results were also found in other studies where water deficit leads to a significant reduction in the vegetative growth and other tomato growth functions i e aboveground biomass and fruit ku≈ü√ßu et al 2014 patan√® et al 2011 patan√® and cosentino 2010 favati et al 2009 underlying mechanisms under deficit irrigation cause reduction in leaf water content and leaf water potential p√©rez pastor et al 2014 liu et al 2006 lowering stomatal conductance and transpiration rates badr et al 2018 hence diminishing leaf area expansion and plant growth shahnazari et al 2007 in addition deficit irrigation applications induce early plant senescence hanson et al 2006 favati et al 2009 related to the structural and physiological effect of the water shortage our research applied the irrigation treatments across the growing season i e along all phenological stages however other studies have shown that flowering and fruit setting stages are most sensitive to irrigation doses in tomato nangare et al 2016 kuscu et al 2014 this was clearly the case for our study where relevant differences in l a i and e w t c a n o p y were noticed from 800 to 1600 g d d regarding the control treatment however as reported by other studies zhang et al 2017 nangare et al 2016 high water deficit treatments not necessarily different from each other e w t c a n o p y has proven to be positively correlated not only with plant biomass and l a i champagne et al 2003 but also to vegetation water content indexes for horticultural crops yilmaz et al 2008 the relationship between l a i and e w t c a n o p y is inherent e w t is an optical thickness measure of water in the leaves therefore an increase in leaves biomass increases both the l a i and the e w t hence e w t c a n o p y champagne et al 2003 3 2 irrigation effects on n d v i and volumetric soil moisture conditions fig 3 a depicts the n d v i and cumulative irrigation mm in function of the growing degree days c for the irrigation treatments the influence of irrigation treatments was positively related to their n d v i values deficit irrigation treatments 50 etc 219 mm 70 etc 289 mm and 85 etc 360 mm obtained lower n d v i values fig 3a than the control 430 mm being more evident once n d v i reached saturation around 900 g d d n d v i values from treatments 50 and 75 etc were not statistically different showing the difficulty to obtain reflectance differences for low water requirements similar to on ground plant measurements fig 2 similarly n d v i of 50 and 85 etc were only statistically different from 1100 to 1500 g d d n d v i s of treatment 70 and 85 etc were significantly at 400 700 900 1300 and 1500 g d d small fluctuations in n d v i were observed when n d v i reached its maximum fig 3a from 900 g d d this might be attributed to the influence of diverse factors in the plant canopy reflectance leaf orientation canopy architecture leaf area and soil background once the tomato plants stop growing maximum averaged n d v i values were 0 731 0 753 0 783 and 0 813 for 50 70 85 and 100 etc treatments fig 3a respectively n d v i probability distribution showing the plant variability in function of growing degree days c for each irrigation treatment is provided in supplementary material fig s2a volumetric soil water content for the irrigation treatments is presented in fig 3b the values represent the average over the soil profile 15 20 30 and 45 cm on daily basis soil water content generally decreased with decreasing water application fig 3a with 100 and 50 etc resulting in the highest and lowest values of soil water content respectively fig 3b a comparison of different water stress conditions showed that volumetric soil moisture was low in high stressed conditions 50 etc which values fluctuated from 0 22 to 0 25 volumetric soil moisture remained relatively low for treatments 70 etc 0 21 0 26 and 85 etc 0 22 0 29 due to insufficient supplementary irrigation while the soil water content for 100 etc treatment was systematically maintained at a high level during the growing season fig 3b n d v i has proven to be important water content sensitive index at plant and canopy scale gerhards et al 2016 genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 roberts et al 1997 and is positively related to e w t c a n o p y for agricultural crops champagne et al 2003 treatments 50 70 and 85 etc obtained systematically lower n d v i values than control across the growing season fig 3a a lower level of n d v i is associated with a slower growth rate and lower biomass accumulation during the vegetative stage hassan et al 2019 in addition healthy plants 100 etc absorb less visible light for photosynthesis i e photosynthetic pigment concentration increase leading to decreased reflectance in the visible band and increased reflectance in the n i r range ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 the opposite occurs for stressed plants treatment 50 70 and 85 etc for this reason canopy n d v i obtained high positive correlation not only with plant biomass chlorophyll leaf area and l a i leroux et al 2016 huang et al 2014 panigada et al 2014 rinaldi et al 2014 rossini et al 2013 k√∂ksal 2011 jones et al 2004 2007 liu et al 2004 but also with leaf water potential and stomatal conductance poblete et al 2017 gago et al 2015 marino et al 2014 shimada et al 2012 baluja et al 2012 genc et al 2011 kim et al 2010 n d v i differences among the irrigation treatments were more obvious once the tomato plants reached maturity from 900 g d d than at the initial stages from 0 to 600 g d d fig 3a due to the accumulated effect on the plant physiology fig 2 k√∂ksal 2011 attributed these findings to the effects of water stress doses on the crop canopy caused partially by changes in leaf structure and composition similarly ihuoma and madramootoo 2019 obtained a good correlation between plant water status and structural indices specifically during the tomato late maturity stage when the water stress effects on the plants were already established however canopy n d v i sensitivity becomes weaker with increasing values of l a i due to the asymptotic saturation of n d v i at high l a i liu et al 2012 carlson and ripley 1997 small fluctuations on n d v i once the tomato plants reached maximum growth i e high l a i values might be attributed to n d v i sensitivity to background factors such as the brightness and shade of the vegetation canopy and soil background brightness gago et al 2015 3 3 suitability of nonlinear mixed model fig 4 depicts the nonlinear mixed modeling results for a random coefficient logistic n d v i fit table 1 shows the nonlinear mixed model parameters for the tomato n d v i for the irrigation treatments the three parameter logistic growth model described adequately the n d v i in function of g d d c and was capable to discriminate the deficit irrigation effects on the n d v i growth curves fig 4a results in the following discussion are reported in function of the control treatment standard error of the mean obtained from table 1 and noticed in the panels of fig 4 for œï 1 representing the asymptote value treatment 50 etc obtained a decreased mean of 92 48 0 35 similarly a decreased mean for 70 etc 93 7 0 3 and 85 etc 96 1 0 4 were achieved fig 4b and table 1 the œï 1 fixed effect parameter of the treatments were significantly different p 0 05 from the control fig 4b and between each other p 0 05 for œï 2 representing the inflection point value 50 etc 96 0 0 9 and 85 etc 94 6 0 9 obtained a significant decreased mean from 100 etc p 0 05 fig 4c and table 1 for the extra œï 2 pairwise comparisons the 50 85 etc and 70 100 etc contrasts were not statistically different the scale parameter œï 3 of treatments 50 etc 82 5 3 0 70 etc 94 8 2 2 and 85 etc 97 1 3 0 achieved a significantly decreased mean from control p 0 05 fig 4d and table 1 for the additional œï 3 pairwise comparisons only 70 85 etc contrast was not significant the standard deviation of the random components was 0 019 œï 1 20 608 œï 2 12 581 œï 3 whereas the within plant standard error was 0 05 random coefficient parameters and plant specific three parameter growth curves are provided in the supplementary material figs s1 and s2b respectively fig 4 showed that a nonlinear mixed model can be applied to assess water treatment effect on n d v i growth analysis the implementation of the three parameter logistic model revealed that differences can be captured for the irrigation treatments on tomato canopy n d v i the major advantage of considering the nonlinear mixed model is that it can address not only the irrigation treatment effects on mean n d v i but also its temporal characteristic along the growing season the mixed model was well suited to capture the n d v i differences during the maturity stage i e œï 1 parameter when the cumulative effects of irrigation doses were well defined fig 4a fig 4b and table 1 and n d v i reached its asymptote deficit irrigation doses obtained lower n d v i values than the control captured by the œï 1 parameter during the vegetative stage the inflection point i e œï 2 parameter marked the fastest n d v i growth rate for 100 etc fig 4c and table 1 however the difference from the control regarding the œï 2 parameter was difficult to capture for 70 etc since the difference in the inflection point value table 1 was 5 c g d d representing one d a t 1 g d d 10 c tomato base temperature this can be attributed to the limited number of measurements before n d v i reached its saturation level at high l a i and e w t c a n o p y 800 c g d d the scale parameter œï 3 which is the point where the n d v i value is œï 1 1 e 1 0 73 œï 1 was consistent with œï 1 in function of the irrigation doses since it depended on the saturated n d v i values fig 4d and table 1 this time scale parameter œï 3 accurately characterized how quickly the n d v i growth increased from the initial value to the asymptote œï 1 however œï 3 differences of treatments 70 and 85 etc from control were not significant due to the difficulty of capturing relevant differences in function of growing degree days fig 4d and table 1 fig 5 depicts the goodness of fit and diagnosis figures of the nonlinear mixed model fitting of the logistic growth model prediction intervals for fixed effects i e confidence limits at 95 indicated that the variability of the model predictions was acceptable fig 5a fitted n d v i values were closely matching mean observed n d v i for the water treatments fig 5b the root mean squared error r m s e of the residual n d v i values was 4 9 5 1 5 0 and 3 9 for treatment 50 70 85 and 100 etc respectively normality assumptions for model residuals were satisfied since a linear trend can be noticed in fig 5c being symmetrically distributed around zero additionally no clear systematic pattern in the fitted versus model residual plot was found fig 5d overall the water doses effects on n d v i considering the treatment level i e fixed effects and within plant i e random effects predictions were adequately estimated by the three parameter logistic growth model with a nonlinear mixed model fig 5 the confidence limits for the fixed effects indicated that the variability in predicted n d v i was adequate fig 5a while the fitted n d v i values were similar to the observed n d v i fig 5b moreover the root mean square error linked to the random effects i e plants was admissible 0 049 50 etc 0 051 70 etc 0 050 85 etc and 0 039 100 etc fig 5b the prediction of n d v i is important for the estimation of vegetation fraction cover fc and actual basal crop coefficient kcb the empirical relation of n d v i with fc and kcb along the growing season is defined by the crop phenological development calera et al 2017 the fc and kcb are relevant parameters used with the conventional fao 56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for estimating etc ihuoma and madramootoo 2020 saadi et al 2015 enabling the assessment of crop water requirements for scheduling irrigation jones 2014 the application of three parameter logistic mixed model to assess and predict the effects of deficit irrigation treatment on tomato canopy n d v i provided meaningful outcomes this approach is a mechanistic and integral methodology allowing to study the crop along the growing season under a repeated measures scheme similarly this framework considers not only the irrigation treatment structure but also the variability at plant level simultaneously however the potential for using nonlinear mixed models to expand the assessment of irrigation doses should be complemented based on narrow band hyperspectral and thermal indexes while more sophisticated models can be proposed including spectral autocorrelation or spatial correlation model complexity can make the interpretation of the parameters a difficult task this research showed as study case deficit irrigation treatments solely however the framework can be adapted to explore other agricultural management e g inorganic fertilization or their interaction to get insights into better irrigation strategies this is a relevant consideration to extend the study to other mechanistic nonlinear functions see paine et al 2011 archontoulis and miguez 2015 according to the index trend for exploiting the use of u a v multispectral imagery 4 conclusions this study assessed the use of nonlinear mixed models to fit tomato canopy n d v i under deficit irrigation treatments using high resolution u a v multispectral imagery moreover on ground plant measurements were performed to evaluate canopy characteristics at field level deficit irrigation doses 50 70 and 85 etc induced lower biomass accumulation and greatly affected l a i and e w t c a n o p y attaining lower values p 0 05 than the control treatment 100 etc from 800 to 1600 g d d in spite of reaching higher l a i and e w t c a n o p y values 70 etc was not significantly different from 50 etc p 0 05 showing the difficulty to accurately discriminate treatments with high deficit irrigation however 85 etc produced important differences in e w t c a n o p y and l a i compared to the other deficit irrigation treatments p 0 05 due to a higher leaf area expansion and biomass accumulation deficit irrigation doses led to less vigorous plants resulting in lower n d v i values compared to the control notwithstanding 50 etc obtained lower n d v i values than 70 etc differences were not significant volumetric soil moisture was consistent with the irrigation treatments resulting in a decreased trend with decreasing water application along the growing season an adequate n d v i fit based on a three parameter logistic mixed model captured the irrigation treatment effects on tomato canopy n d v i growth curves significant differences at maturity stage were observed from the control p 0 05 when the cumulative effect of the irrigation doses was well defined and n d v i reached asymptotic behavior œï 1 during the vegetative stage the inflection point œï 2 marked the fastest n d v i growth rate for 100 etc treatment whereas the lowest for 50 etc p 0 05 well captured by the model the scale parameter œï 3 followed a decreased trend in function of the deficit irrigation doses the diagnosis plots and the root mean squared error of the observed and fitted n d v i indicated the suitability of using the three parameter logistic mixed model this study provides insights into the feasibility of using nonlinear mixed random coefficient models to analyze spectral vegetation index data to assess irrigation treatments on tomato while n d v i might represent a good index to detect irrigation effects applying mixed models could extend the assessment using other mechanistic nonlinear functions on thermal and narrow band hyperspectral indexes similarly future research should focus on the integration of n d v i to estimate plant water status on real time data analysis the assimilation of these estimates into a crop water stress model would provide an important tool for open field tomato growers for decision making towards optimization of irrigation strategies declaration of competing interest the

10522,the least limiting water range llwr is a modern and widely used soil physical quality indicator based on predefined limits of water availability aeration and penetration resistance providing a range of soil water contents in which their limitations for plant growth are minimized however to set up the upper and lower limits for a range of soil physical properties is a challenge for llwr computation and hence for adequate water management moreover the usual llwr is given in terms of the soil water content in which only for field capacity and permanent wilting point the matric potential range is known in this paper we present a procedure for calculating llwr using genuchten s water retention curve parameters and introducing the least limiting matric potential ranges of agricultural soils which we named llmpr defined as the range of matric potential for which soil aeration water availability and mechanical resistance would not be restrictive to plant growth additionally we calculated the minimal air filled porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds which define the upper and lower limits of llwr and llmpr finally we present some application examples using experimental data from cultivated and forest soils and developed an algorithm for their calculation in the r software the calculated soil physical restriction thresholds were sensitive to changes in soil structure and clay content and were changeable rather than fixed based on experimental data our calculations with the calculated parameters showed that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure higher water content at field capacity as well as a larger soil penetration resistance threshold to a given root elongation rate were observed in the structured in comparison to the cultivated soil the llwr and llmpr as presented in this study was computationally implemented as an r function r software named llwr llmpr and in an interactive web page both available in the r package soilphysics version 4 0 or later available from https arsilva87 github io soilphysics or cran http cran r project org web packages soilphysics index html keywords agricultural water management soil physical restrictions water availability 1 introduction plant available water paw is a well known concept that was first proposed by veihmeyer and hendrickson 1927 1931 asgarzadeh et al 2014 it is defined as the water content between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp in the absence of other physical restrictions e g soil aeration and impedance to root elongation plants should be able to grow within the paw range without water stress letey 1985 silva et al 1994 however due to the complex nature of soil particles and soil structure changes induced by agricultural traffic both aeration and mechanical impedance may impose restrictions for plant growth even within the range of paw letey 1985 silva et al 1994 groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2014 lima et al 2016 temporal and spatial changes in water content interact with the soil structure influencing many soil physical properties letey 1985 considered that air filled porosity and soil penetration resistance restrictions may occur within the paw range in such a way that water uptake would be limited by rising soil mechanical resistance under drying or reducing root oxygen supply under wetter conditions for this approach he introduced the term non limiting water range nlwr to characterize the water content range in which plant growth should not be restricted by aeration penetration resistance and soil water potential silva et al 1994 quantitatively refined the nlwr concept introduced by letey 1985 and renamed it the least limiting water range llwr which takes into account the water content range for which soil aeration soil penetration resistance and soil water potentials at fc and pwp should impose minimal stress on plant growth generally the llwr is given in terms of soil water content e g silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 and only the matric potentials at the fc and pwp are known because they are assigned as input physical restriction thresholds for the calculation of the llwr silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 this means that the matric potential at limiting air filled porosity and mechanical resistance is unknown in the current llwr approach approaches using the matric potential ranges at which the soil physical restriction thresholds occur have been applied in the studies of groenevelt et al 2001 and asgarzadeh et al 2010 for calculation of the integral water capacity iwc see also asgarzadeh et al 2014 and lima et al 2016 the calculation of the llwr in terms of matric potential could allow agricultural management using both the water content and the matric potential e g using tensiometers which would be useful for applications at the field scale tormena et al 1999 the llwr is a widely used soil physical quality indicator for water management e g safadoust et al 2014 ferreira et al 2017 oliveira et al 2019 but knowledge of the upper and lower limits air filled porosity fc pwp and soil penetration resistance for a range of soil properties is a major challenge for llwr applications at the field scale clark et al 2003 bengough 2012 czy≈º and dexter 2012 dexter et al 2012 assouline and or 2014 van lier and wendroth 2016 van lier 2017 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 lima et al 2020 silva et al 1994 suggested a minimal aeration porosity of 0 10 m3 m 3 a matric potential at field capacity and permanent wilting point of 100 and 15 000 hpa respectively and a limiting soil penetration resistance of 2 0 mpa as the physical restriction thresholds of the llwr however recent studies show that these thresholds depend on the plant s response soil porosity and hydraulic and mechanical properties of soil instead of being arbitrarily applied meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 wiecheteck et al 2020 for example pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 suggest that the minimum air filled porosity could be calculated as a function of minimum relative gas diffusion for plant oxygen supply assouline and or 2014 provide a simple procedure for estimating field capacity as a function of water retention curve components czy≈º and dexter 2012 suggest that the wilting of plants may occur at the hydraulic cut off of soil which dexter et al 2012 defined as the matric potential at which convective water flow ceases even under an applied pressure gradient bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 estimated the impact of mechanical impedance in terms of root elongation rate and penetrometer resistance however only a few studies e g pilatti et al 2012 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 have updated the critical limits of the llwr and compared their results with the usual thresholds suggested by silva et al 1994 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 and wiecheteck et al 2020 observed experimentally that different plant species respond differently to physical soil restrictions and thresholds imposed by soil with contrasting soil textures in this paper we present a procedure for the calculation of the llwr using genuchten s water retention curve parameters we introduce the least limiting matric potential ranges of agricultural soils which we named llmpr and could be defined as a range of matric potential for which soil aeration water availability and mechanical impediment would not be restrictive to plant growth additionally we calculated the minimal aeration porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds finally we present some application examples using experimental data from cultivated and forest soils and developed an algorithm for calculation in the

be described in terms of water tension h which can be given as h œà to calculate llwr and llmpr both water retention and penetration resistance curves are necessary genuchten s model van genuchten

represent field capacity e g silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 we used the approach given by meskini vishkaee 2018 which was developed by assouline and or 2014 for calculation of h fc based on genuchten s parameters n and Œ± as given in eq 9 9 h fc 1 Œ± n 1 n 1 2 n n to represent the h pwp we assumed that the wilting of plants may occur at the hydraulic cut off of soil h co

immobile water remains dexter et al 2012 and czy≈º and dexter 2012 proposed empirical relationships to estimate h co as a function of clay content thus we assumed h pwp as equal to h co for delimiting

classical model proposed by millington and quirk 1961 thus the Œµ a to supply a minimal ds d0 value of 0 005 grable and siemer 1968 schj√∏nning et al 2003 berisso et al 2012 pulido moncada and

root growth bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 suggest that better approximations of root growth can be given in terms of root elongation rate ret bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 show that ret can be estimated as a function of q using an exponential equation eq 15 whereas the q at which a given ret occurs q r e t can be estimated using eq 16 15 r e t exp x q 16 q r e t ln r e t x where x is an empirical parameter and ret is given in a scale from 0 to 1 i e from 0 to 100 moraes et al 2018 explain that biopores may facilitate root elongation and change the relationship between ret and soil strength thus moraes et al 2018 suggest values of x 0 4325 and x 0 3000 for soil without and with biopores respectively which could be analogously compared to soil without and with a structure or with and without tillage practices by applying eq 16 it is possible to estimate for example the q at which ret is halved by using ret 0 5 assuming q r e t q c r i t i c a l see eq 5 representing the critical penetrometer resistance for a given root elongation rate it would be possible to apply eq 16 and estimate the q c r i t i c a l for a given ret so that eq 16 could be written as follows eq 17

were sampled at an experimental farm of the state university of maring√° see ara√∫jo et al 2004 located in maring√° 23 21 s 52 03 w paran√° state southern brazil the soil was classified as oxisol soil survey staff 2014 with sand silt and clay contents of 760 10 and 230 g kg 1 respectively sampling was performed in two sites with distinct land uses native forest and cultivated soil the native forest site consisted of an intact native forest fragment semi decidual seasonal forest adjacent to the cultivated site whereas the cultivated area consisted of a conventionally tilled field disk plow and harrowing cultivated during 20 consecutive years with different crops maize oats sorghum soybean and cassava at the sampling time the soil was cultivated with cassava undisturbed soil cores were randomly taken at a depth of 0 0 20 m within each experimental site using steel rings of 0 05 m diameter and 0 05 m height totaling 24 samples per experimental site the soil cores were saturated by capillary rise and equilibrated to one of the following water tensions h 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 hpa using a tension table and 250 500 1 000 2 000 4 000 8 000 and 15 000 hpa via a pressure plate apparatus at hydraulic equilibrium the soil cores were weighed for each h for the determination of the water content for fitting of the soil water retention curve and to demonstrate the calculation procedures we used samples for maximum minimum and mean values of soil bulk density for each experimental site another set of 24 soil cores per site was sampled to determine the soil penetration resistance curve soil penetrometer resistance q was measured with an electronic laboratory penetrometer at a penetration rate of 10 mm min 1 using a 60 cone angle and a diameter of 4 mm finally the cores were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine bulk density and soil water content the parameters of this measurement are also available in ara√∫jo et al 2004 3 2 least limiting water llwr and matric potential ranges llmpr calculations based on the experimental data described previously we fitted van genuchten s water retention curve eq 1 for the three soil bulk density levels classes separated within each site obtained within the native forest and cultivated sites table 1 which we named minimum mean and maximum soil bulk density levels additionally busscher s penetrometer resistance model was fitted for the range of bulk density and soil water contents corresponding to the applied h to obtain the parameters d e and f which were estimated as 0 0132 1 3406 and 5 3229 p 0 05 r2 0 84 respectively for the native forest soil and 0 0028 2 0592 and 5 3229 p 0 05 r2 0 84 respectively for the cultivated soil ara√∫jo et al 2004 to calculate the llwr and llmpr we applied the procedure described in section 2 using the usual i e silva et al 1994 and calculated physical restriction thresholds i e Œµ a h fc h pwp and q c r i t i c a l which resulted in the usual and calculated scenarios a summary of the thresholds for each scenario is given in table 2 specifically for calculation of Œ∏ q critical we fixed the bulk densities given in table 1 for each one of the classes and applied eq 5 using a q c r i t i c a l estimated for 50 of ret i e ret 0 5 which was calculated using eq 17 by applying x 0 3000 and x 0 4325 for native forest with biopores and cultivated soils without biopores moraes et al 2018 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical restriction thresholds the calculated Œµ a eq 12 was slightly larger than the usual Œµ a suggested by silva et al 1994 for native forest soil whereas for cultivated soil Œµ a was rather similar to the generally suggested 0 10 m3 m 3 silva et al 1994 table 2 based on eq 12 Œµ a for a fixed value of ds d0 0 005 as the used here becomes dependent on œÜ which is similar to the Œ∏s given in table 1 thus considering the Œ∏s of the native forest and cultivated soils it is possible to observe that Œµ a is greater with an increasing Œ∏s tables 1 and 2 therefore considering a minimal ds d0 for plant oxygen supply Œµ a would not be a fixed value e g 0 10 m3 m 3 but dependent on soil total porosity our simulation shows that for the native forest soil an Œµ a of 0 10 m3 m 3 would not be sufficient to provide minimal gas diffusion ds d0 0 005 although we used the value of 0 005 for ds d0 the millington and quirk 1961 model allows the use of a range of ds d0 as suggested by grable and siemer 1968 i e ds d0 from 0 005 to 0 02 making it an open input model from a practical point of view by increasing the value of ds d0 towards 0 02 while œÜ remains unchanged the millington and quirk 1961 model estimates that a greater Œµ a value is required to allow the corresponding ds d0 however this model does not incorporate dynamic aspects regarding the level of organization of the porous system which may be developed in future studies the value of ds d0 0 005 has also been suggested as a minimal plant oxygen supply by schj√∏nning et al 2003 kad≈æienƒó et al 2011 berisso et al 2012 and pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 however kad≈æienƒó et al 2011 and pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 suggest a power model for the estimation of ds d0 as a function of Œµ a for which an empirical parameter is necessary here we propose the use of the classical model from millington and quirk 1961 eq 11 for the calculation of Œµ a which neira et al 2015 described as a mechanistic model moldrup et al 2004 verified that among the frequently used soil type independent models for estimation of ds d0 the millington and quirk 1961 model performed best the millington and quirk 1961 model requires only a few parameters for estimation of Œµ a and seems to be able to provide good agreement with experimental data moldrup et al 2004 soil water tension at the field capacity h fc calculated by eq 9 assouline and or 2014 was predominantly higher than 100 hpa for both native forest and cultivated soil but higher values were observed for the cultivated soil table 2 based on the h fc calculated using eq 9 table 2 in the cultivated soil the water would still be freely draining at around 100 hpa and therefore h fc would be underestimated eq 9 shows that h fc which is dependent on genuchten s parameters Œ± and n and the matric potential at field capacity will be somewhat larger with decreasing values of n table 1 shows that lower n values were obtained for the cultivated soil and therefore higher h fc values were estimated for this soil table 2 which are greater than the usual 100 hpa silva et al 1994 the formulation given by assouline and or 2014 is described as a self consistent criterion based on soil internal drainage dynamics which describe the calculated h fc eq 9 as a marked loss of hydraulic continuity which characterizes the field capacity after numerical simulations and comparison with experimental data assouline and or 2014 argue that their results reveal remarkable consistency and predictability across a wide range of soil types in addition to assouline and or 2014 recent studies from twarakavi et al 2009 van lier 2017 and meskini vishkaee et al 2018 have questioned the use of field capacity as a single value of soil h among several possible formulations for the estimation of h fc described in previous studies e g twarakavi et al 2009 reynolds et al 2018 an advantage of the model proposed by assouline and or 2014 is that h fc is derived from the soil water retention curve and is easily parameterized using genuchten s parameters which can be extracted from the same formulation of the llwr and llmpr proposed here our calculations for h pwp considering the h co proposed by dexter et al 2012 reveal that h pwp was lower than the usual threshold of 15 000 hpa used by silva et al 1994 table 2 the h co was calculated as 12 274 hpa indicating that for this clay content i e 230 g kg 1 following the empirical equation proposed by dexter et al 2012 plants should wither in wetter conditions than 15 000 hpa because after the soil has reached the h co convective water flow should cease even under an applied pressure gradient by the plants dexter 2004 and dexter et al 2012 explain that the clay content governs textural porosity and therefore particles smaller than 2 Œºm i e clay are especially important because most of the specific surface area and therefore adsorption occurs on these smallest particles this somehow justifies the positive correlation of h co and clay content found by dexter et al 2012 overall the model from dexter et al 2012 demonstrated that plants should wither in sandy soil under a high soil water potential rather than in clay soils investigating the hydraulic cut off and plant wilting relationship czy≈º and dexter 2012 demonstrated that the h at the permanent wilting point does not appear to be a single value as first proposed by briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 czy≈º and dexter 2012 tried to show for a range of soil textural classes that drainage often ceases at h 15 000 hpa due to the phenomenon of hydraulic cut off furthermore they highlight that it is interesting to note that this explanation is published 100 years after briggs and shantz 1912 in an experiment comparing the classical permanent wilting point concept of soil to the biological wilting of wheat and barley plants under contrasting soil textures wiecheteck et al 2020 observed that wheat and barley plants withered under wetter conditions than the h of 15 000 hpa for soil with lower clay content corroborating the empirical equation suggested by dexter et al 2012 eq 10 it is important to highlight that we used the empirical equation eq 10 proposed by dexter et al 2012 to illustrate the understanding of the application of the hydraulic cut off as the lower limit of llwr and llmpr however dexter et al 2012 detail two procedures that are based on the water retention curve parameters proposed by groenevelt and grant 2004 and dexter et al 2008 thus it is possible to calculate the h co from experimental data by fitting the parameters of groenevelt and grant 2004 and dexter et al 2008 to the water retention curves and to apply the procedures described by dexter et al 2012 in this study we chose to apply the estimated h co as a function of clay content because of the complexity of introducing two more water retention curves on the calculation procedure the assumption that the permanent wilting point is not a single value of h has been experimentally confirmed in several studies the permanent wilting point reached values of h from 15 000 hpa for cotton and sorghum savage et al 1996 22 000 30 000 hpa for maize hsieh et al 1972 and 37 000 hpa for pepper rawlins et al 1968 the solution proposed by dexter et al 2012 provides a prediction tool related to soil particle size with a significant relationship with clay but it seems that plant mechanisms would have to be added to predictions in future studies van lier et al 2006 czy≈º and dexter 2012 hosseini et al 2016 wiecheteck et al 2020 for example the study carried out by wiecheteck et al 2020 indicates that wheat plants were more drought tolerant than barley plants the calculated qcritical for 50 of ret was calculated as 2 3 and 1 6 mpa for native forest and cultivated soils respectively the higher qcritical values for the native forest soil consider that roots encounter a network of cracks and biopores such that the roots of plants are able to have higher elongation rates for a larger q range bengough 1997 moraes et al 2018 whereas for cultivated soil without biopores 50 of the ret would be reached at lower q values than the usual threshold of 2 0 mpa this means that the degraded soil structure in cultivated soil causes greater restrictions for root elongation and this is reflected in the lower critical soil penetration resistance value bengough et al 2011 moraes et al 2018 our results highlight that the use of a common critical penetration resistance value to calculate the llwr for studying the impact of soil management systems on soil physical quality may lead to inconsistent conclusions it is well known that soil structure and pore shape size continuity and connectivity are altered by soil land use and management systems moraes et al 2014 lima et al 2020 modifying the root elongation rate moraes et al 2014 investigated critical limits of soil penetration resistance affecting plant performance in different tillage systems they suggest that the critical soil penetration resistance limit of 2 0 mpa should be maintained for conventional tillage however it should be increased to 3 0 3 5 mpa under no tillage and or minimum tillage because of the predominance of biopores presenting a soil environment more similar to forest i e with more biopores in a recent study lima et al 2020 found a severe contrast for soil penetration resistance behavior affected by tillage systems which seems to have been influenced by soil structure several studies applying the llwr concept have used 2 0 mpa as qcritical e g le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 but these studies make no reference to an expected loss in the growth rate of any root parameter approaches for estimating the soil penetrometer resistance required to reduce the rate of root elongation by half were proposed by dexter 1987 and discussed by silva et al 1994 however the calculation of llwr proposed by silva et al 1994 was based on the assumption that the limiting value of soil resistance is constant at 2 0 mpa which has been a usual threshold used for many studies using the llwr furthermore the fixed threshold does not consider the effect of soil structure on the reduction increase in qcritical for which the studies of bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 showed to be relevant there are not many functions for the estimation of root elongation rate as a function of soil penetrometer resistance however the studies of dexter 1987 bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 seem to show that there is a need to know not only the critical limit of penetrometer resistance for root growth impediment but also the rate of loss associated with the increase of this penetrometer resistance note that within the llwr approach water content could be managed to achieve a qcritical that would only reduce a relative growth rate 4 2 least limiting water llwr and matric potential ranges llmpr except for the native forest soil at the minimum soil bulk density the llwr was reduced from usual to the calculated physical restriction threshold scenarios fig 1 fig 1 shows that for the land uses examined in this study native forest and cultivated soil there was an overestimation of the llwr calculated with the usual thresholds in relation to that calculated however as the calculated thresholds are dynamic and dependent on soil porosity or soil structure and water retention characteristics see discussion in section 4 1 this overestimation scenario should not always be predominant the graphic solution model for llwr and llmpr using the calculation procedure presented in section 2 1 is given in fig 2 to illustrate the graphic solution only fig 2 shows the graphic solutions for llwr and llmpw only for the minimum bulk density table 1 of the cultivated soil considering both usual and calculated physical restriction threshold scenarios all other physical restriction limits in terms of Œ∏ and h which delimited llwr and llmpr are presented in tables 3 and 4 fig 2 shows that the llwr and llmpr for the minimum soil bulk density of the cultivated soil were delimited by field capacity and soil penetration resistance regardless of the applied usual or calculated thresholds however llwr and llmpr were greater when the physical restriction thresholds were applied as usual in contrast to using the calculated procedure table 3 shows that the llwr was reduced from 0 1003 to 0 0458 m3 m 3 from usual to calculated physical restriction thresholds whereas the llmpr was reduced from 708 to 287 hpa table 4 demonstrating a large difference between calculated llwr and llmpr using the two ascribed thresholds fig 3 shows how the four restrictions thresholds change as a function of bulk density for each land use and threshold scenarios i e usual and calculated the changes in the four thresholds in the native forest soil from the usual to the calculated scenarios seem to be minimal whereas for the cultivated soil they were considerable demonstrating that the calculation of the thresholds was sensitive to soil structure and soil cultivation table 2 shows that the reduction in llwr and llmpr from the usual to the calculated scenarios of the cultivated soil was caused by an increase in h fc from 100 to 178 hpa and a decrease in qcritical from 2 0 1 6 mpa which resulted in a decrease and increase in Œ∏fc and Œ∏qcritical respectively fig 3 based on our scenarios these results show that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure which results in lower h at field capacity as well as an increase in soil penetration resistance for a given elongation rate overall water content or water potential at the field scale should be managed within llwr and llmpr to avoid physical restriction for plant water uptake note that besides the water content range given by llwr first introduced by silva et al 1994 the corresponding llmpr presented in this study would also allow monitoring of the moisture range in terms of water potential which could be managed with tensiometers up to 700 800 hpa and could be useful for agricultural water management 4 3 computational implementation the procedure described in the section 2 1 which calculates llwr and llmpr was computationally implemented as an r function r software r core team 2020 named llwr llmpr and on an interactive web page both available in the r package soilphysics available from https arsilva87 github io soilphysics or http cran r project org web packages soilphysics index html basically the function llwr llmpr requires genuchten s water retention curve parameters table 1 busscher s soil penetration curve parameters d e and f and the soil physical restriction thresholds table 2 although here we calculated the soil physical restriction thresholds the user is free to assign the thresholds in the function llwr llmpr the output of the function llwr llmpr is the graphic solution for llwr or llmpr as well as a correspond table with the limits in terms of Œ∏ and h and the values of llwr and llmpr 5 summary and conclusions we present a new procedure for the calculation of the least limiting water range llwr and additionally present the least limiting water matric potential range llmpr both llwr and llmpr are easily parameterized using the common genuchten s water retention curve beyond the usual busscher s penetration resistance curve the introduction of the llmpr calculation allowed to determine besides the soil water content the soil water potential boundaries associated with physical restrictions for plant growth furthermore we present a calculation procedure of the soil physical restriction thresholds that are used to calculate llwr and llmpr and suggest a procedure for the calculation of minimal aeration porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds the calculated soil physical restriction thresholds are sensitive to changes in soil structure and clay content and are therefore changeable rather than fixed they were able to considerably reduce llwr and llmpr in native forest and cultivated soils in comparison with calculations made with the usual thresholds finally based on experimental data our calculations with the calculated thresholds showed that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure the improvements in the soil structure could result in higher water content at field capacity as well

10522,the least limiting water range llwr is a modern and widely used soil physical quality indicator based on predefined limits of water availability aeration and penetration resistance providing a range of soil water contents in which their limitations for plant growth are minimized however to set up the upper and lower limits for a range of soil physical properties is a challenge for llwr computation and hence for adequate water management moreover the usual llwr is given in terms of the soil water content in which only for field capacity and permanent wilting point the matric potential range is known in this paper we present a procedure for calculating llwr using genuchten s water retention curve parameters and introducing the least limiting matric potential ranges of agricultural soils which we named llmpr defined as the range of matric potential for which soil aeration water availability and mechanical resistance would not be restrictive to plant growth additionally we calculated the minimal air filled porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds which define the upper and lower limits of llwr and llmpr finally we present some application examples using experimental data from cultivated and forest soils and developed an algorithm for their calculation in the r software the calculated soil physical restriction thresholds were sensitive to changes in soil structure and clay content and were changeable rather than fixed based on experimental data our calculations with the calculated parameters showed that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure higher water content at field capacity as well as a larger soil penetration resistance threshold to a given root elongation rate were observed in the structured in comparison to the cultivated soil the llwr and llmpr as presented in this study was computationally implemented

cran http cran r project org web packages soilphysics index html keywords agricultural water management soil physical restrictions water availability 1 introduction plant available water paw is a well known concept that was first proposed by veihmeyer and hendrickson 1927 1931 asgarzadeh et al 2014 it is defined as the water content between field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp in the absence of other physical restrictions e g soil aeration and impedance to root elongation plants should be able to grow within the paw range without water stress letey 1985 silva et al 1994 however due to the complex nature of soil particles and soil structure changes induced by agricultural traffic both aeration and mechanical impedance may impose restrictions for plant growth even within the range of paw letey 1985 silva et al 1994 groenevelt et al 2001 asgarzadeh et al 2014 lima et al 2016 temporal and spatial changes in water content interact with the soil structure influencing many soil physical properties letey 1985 considered that air filled porosity and soil penetration resistance restrictions may occur within the paw range in such a way that water uptake would be limited by rising soil mechanical resistance under drying or reducing root oxygen supply under wetter conditions for this approach he introduced the term non limiting water range nlwr to characterize the water content range in which plant growth should not be restricted by aeration penetration resistance and soil water potential silva et al 1994 quantitatively refined the nlwr concept introduced by letey 1985 and renamed it the least limiting water range llwr which takes into account the water content range for which soil aeration soil penetration resistance and soil water potentials at fc and pwp should impose minimal stress on plant growth generally the llwr is given in terms of soil water content e g silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 and only the matric potentials at the fc and pwp are known because they are assigned as input physical restriction thresholds for the calculation of the llwr silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 this means that the matric potential at limiting air filled porosity and mechanical resistance is unknown in the current llwr approach approaches using the matric potential ranges at which the soil physical restriction thresholds occur have been applied in the studies of groenevelt et al 2001 and asgarzadeh et al 2010 for calculation of the integral water capacity iwc see also asgarzadeh et al 2014 and lima et al 2016 the calculation of the llwr in terms of matric potential could allow agricultural management using both the water content and the matric potential e g using tensiometers which would be useful for applications at the field scale tormena et al 1999 the llwr is a widely used soil physical quality indicator for water management e g safadoust et al 2014 ferreira et al 2017 oliveira et al 2019 but knowledge of the upper and lower limits air filled porosity fc pwp and soil penetration resistance for a range of soil properties is a major challenge for llwr applications at the field scale clark et al 2003 bengough 2012 czy≈º and dexter 2012 dexter et al 2012 assouline and or 2014 van lier and wendroth 2016 van lier 2017 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 lima et al 2020 silva et al 1994 suggested a minimal aeration porosity of 0 10 m3 m 3 a matric potential at field capacity and permanent wilting point of 100 and 15 000 hpa respectively and a limiting soil penetration resistance of 2 0 mpa as the physical restriction thresholds of the llwr however recent studies show that these thresholds depend on the plant s response soil porosity and hydraulic and mechanical properties of soil instead of being arbitrarily applied meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 wiecheteck et al 2020 for example pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 suggest that the minimum air filled porosity could be calculated as a function of minimum relative gas diffusion for plant oxygen supply assouline and or 2014 provide a simple procedure for estimating field capacity as a function of water retention curve components czy≈º and dexter 2012 suggest that the wilting of plants may occur at the hydraulic cut off of soil which dexter et al 2012 defined as the matric potential at which convective water flow ceases even under an applied pressure gradient bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 estimated the impact of mechanical impedance in terms of root elongation rate and penetrometer resistance however only a few studies e g pilatti et al 2012 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 have updated the critical limits of the llwr and compared their results with the usual thresholds suggested by silva et al 1994 meskini vishkaee et al 2018 and wiecheteck et al 2020 observed experimentally that different plant species respond differently to physical soil restrictions and thresholds imposed by soil with contrasting soil textures in this paper we present a procedure for the calculation of the llwr using genuchten s water retention curve parameters we introduce the least limiting matric potential ranges of agricultural soils which we named llmpr and could be defined as a range of matric potential for which soil aeration water availability and mechanical impediment would not be restrictive to plant growth additionally we calculated the minimal aeration porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds finally we present some application examples using experimental data from cultivated and forest soils and developed an algorithm for calculation in the r software 2 theoretical formulation 2 1 least limiting water llwr and matric potential ranges llmpr to avoid any confusion in signals and for the mathematical formulation the matric potential œà will be described in terms of water tension h which can be given as h œà to calculate llwr and llmpr both water retention and penetration resistance curves are necessary genuchten s model van genuchten

represent field capacity e g silva et al 1994 le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 we used the approach given by meskini vishkaee 2018 which was developed by assouline and or 2014 for calculation of h fc based on genuchten s parameters n and Œ± as given in eq 9 9 h fc 1 Œ± n 1 n 1 2 n n to represent the h pwp we assumed that the wilting of plants may occur at the hydraulic cut off of soil h co

immobile water remains dexter et al 2012 and czy≈º and dexter 2012 proposed empirical relationships to estimate h co as a function of clay content thus we assumed h pwp as equal to h co for delimiting the lower limit of paw 10 h pwp h co 10 3 514 0 0250clay 2 2 2 soil aeration restrictions the relative gas diffusivity ds d0 in the soil can be estimated as a function of œÜ and Œµ a using the classical model proposed by millington and quirk 1961 thus the Œµ a to supply a minimal ds d0 value of 0 005 grable and siemer 1968 schj√∏nning et al 2003 berisso et al 2012 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 can be calculated using eq 12 11 d s d 0 Œµ a Œ≤ œÜ 2 12 Œµ a d s d 0 œÜ 2 1 Œ≤ where Œ≤ is an empirical parameter here assumed as 10 3 which was first suggested by millington and quirk 1961 later van lier 2001 verified that the value 10 3 for Œ≤ resulted in the best agreement between calculated Œµ a and typical values reported in the literature 2 2 3 soil mechanical resistance for root growth bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 suggest that better approximations of root growth can be given in terms of root elongation rate ret bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 show that ret can be estimated as a function of q using an exponential equation eq 15 whereas the q at which a given ret occurs q r e t can be estimated using eq 16 15 r e t exp x q 16 q r e t ln r e t x where x is an empirical parameter and ret is given in a scale from 0 to 1 i e from 0 to 100 moraes et al 2018 explain that biopores may facilitate root elongation and change the relationship between ret and soil strength thus moraes et al 2018 suggest values of x 0 4325 and x 0 3000 for soil without and with biopores respectively which could be analogously compared to soil without and with a structure or with and without tillage practices by applying eq 16 it is possible to estimate for example the q at which ret is halved by using ret 0 5 assuming q r e t q c r i t i c a l see eq 5 representing the critical penetrometer resistance for a given root elongation rate it would be possible to apply eq 16 and estimate the q c r i t i c a l for a given ret so that eq 16 could be written as follows eq 17 17 q c r i t i c a l ln r e t x 3 material and methods 3 1 experimental data in this paper applications for calculation of the llwr and llmpr were made using experimental data undisturbed soil cores were sampled at an experimental farm of the state university of maring√° see ara√∫jo et al 2004 located in maring√° 23 21 s 52 03 w paran√° state southern brazil the soil was classified as oxisol soil survey staff 2014 with sand silt and clay contents of 760 10 and 230 g kg 1 respectively sampling was performed in two sites with distinct land uses native forest and cultivated soil the native forest site consisted of an intact native forest fragment semi decidual seasonal forest adjacent to the cultivated site whereas the cultivated area consisted of a conventionally tilled field disk plow and harrowing cultivated during 20 consecutive years with different crops maize oats sorghum soybean and cassava at the sampling time the soil was cultivated with cassava undisturbed soil cores were randomly taken at a depth of 0 0 20 m within each experimental site using steel rings of 0 05 m diameter and 0 05 m height totaling 24 samples per experimental site the soil cores were saturated by capillary rise and equilibrated to one of the following water tensions h 10 20 40 60 80 and 100 hpa using a tension table and 250 500 1 000 2 000 4 000 8 000 and 15 000 hpa via a pressure plate apparatus at hydraulic equilibrium the soil cores were weighed for each h for the determination of the water content for fitting of the soil water retention curve and to demonstrate the calculation procedures we used samples for maximum minimum and mean values of soil bulk density for each experimental site another set of 24 soil cores per site was sampled to determine the soil penetration resistance curve soil penetrometer resistance q was measured with an electronic laboratory penetrometer at a penetration rate of 10 mm min 1 using a 60 cone angle and a diameter of 4 mm finally the cores were oven dried at 105 c for 24 h to determine bulk density and soil water content the parameters of this measurement are also available in ara√∫jo et al 2004 3 2 least limiting water llwr and matric potential ranges llmpr calculations based on the experimental data described previously we fitted van genuchten s water retention curve eq 1 for the three soil bulk density levels classes separated within each site obtained within the native forest and cultivated sites table 1 which we named minimum mean and maximum soil bulk density levels additionally busscher s penetrometer resistance model was fitted for the range of bulk density and soil water contents corresponding to the applied h to obtain the parameters d e and f which were estimated as 0 0132 1 3406 and 5 3229 p 0 05 r2 0 84 respectively for the native forest soil and 0 0028 2 0592 and 5 3229 p 0 05 r2 0 84 respectively for the cultivated soil ara√∫jo et al 2004 to calculate the llwr and llmpr we applied the procedure described in section 2 using the usual i e silva et al 1994 and calculated physical restriction thresholds i e Œµ a h fc h pwp and q c r i t i c a l which resulted in the usual and calculated scenarios a summary of the thresholds for each scenario is given in table 2 specifically for calculation of Œ∏ q critical we fixed the bulk densities given in table 1 for each one of the classes and applied eq 5 using a q c r i t i c a l estimated for 50 of ret i e ret 0 5 which was calculated using eq 17 by applying x 0 3000 and x 0 4325 for native forest with biopores and cultivated soils without biopores moraes et al 2018 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 physical restriction thresholds the calculated Œµ a eq 12 was slightly larger than the usual Œµ a suggested by silva et al 1994 for native forest soil whereas for cultivated soil Œµ a was rather similar to the generally suggested 0 10 m3 m 3 silva et al 1994 table 2 based on eq 12 Œµ a for a fixed value of ds d0 0 005 as the used here becomes dependent on œÜ which is similar to the Œ∏s given in table 1 thus considering the Œ∏s of the native forest and cultivated soils it is possible to observe that Œµ a is greater with an increasing Œ∏s tables 1 and 2 therefore considering a minimal ds d0 for plant oxygen supply Œµ a would not be a fixed value e g 0 10 m3 m 3 but dependent on soil total porosity our simulation shows that for the native forest soil an Œµ a of 0 10 m3 m 3 would not be sufficient to provide minimal gas diffusion ds d0 0 005 although we used the value of 0 005 for ds d0 the millington and quirk 1961 model allows the use of a range of ds d0 as suggested by grable and siemer 1968 i e ds d0 from 0 005 to 0 02 making it an open input model from a practical point of view by increasing the value of ds d0 towards 0 02 while œÜ remains unchanged the millington and quirk 1961 model estimates that a greater Œµ a value is required to allow the corresponding ds d0 however this model does not incorporate dynamic aspects regarding the level of organization of the porous system which may be developed in future studies the value of ds d0 0 005 has also been suggested as a minimal plant oxygen supply by schj√∏nning et al 2003 kad≈æienƒó et al 2011 berisso et al 2012 and pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 however kad≈æienƒó et al 2011 and pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 suggest a power model for the estimation of ds d0 as a function of Œµ a for which an empirical parameter is necessary here we propose the use of the classical model from millington and quirk 1961 eq 11 for the calculation of Œµ a which neira et al 2015 described as a mechanistic model moldrup et al 2004 verified that among the frequently used soil type independent models for estimation of ds d0 the millington and quirk 1961 model performed best the millington and quirk 1961 model requires only a few parameters for estimation of Œµ a and seems to be able to provide good agreement with experimental data moldrup et al 2004 soil water tension at the field capacity h fc calculated by eq 9 assouline and or 2014 was predominantly higher than 100 hpa for both native forest and cultivated soil but higher values were observed for the cultivated soil table 2 based on the h fc calculated using eq 9 table 2 in the cultivated soil the water would still be freely draining at around 100 hpa and therefore h fc would be underestimated eq 9 shows that h fc which is dependent on genuchten s parameters Œ± and n and the matric potential at field capacity will be somewhat larger with decreasing values of n table 1 shows that lower n values were obtained for the cultivated soil and therefore higher h fc values were estimated for this soil table 2 which are greater than the usual 100 hpa silva et al 1994 the formulation given by assouline and or 2014 is described as a self consistent criterion based on soil internal drainage dynamics which describe the calculated h fc eq 9 as a marked loss of hydraulic continuity which characterizes the field capacity after numerical simulations and comparison with experimental data assouline and or 2014 argue that their results reveal remarkable consistency and predictability across a wide range of soil types in addition to assouline and or 2014 recent studies from twarakavi et al 2009 van lier 2017 and meskini vishkaee et al 2018 have questioned the use of field capacity as a single value of soil h among several possible formulations for the estimation of h fc described in previous studies e g twarakavi et al 2009 reynolds et al 2018 an advantage of the model proposed by assouline and or 2014 is that h fc is derived from the soil water retention curve and is easily parameterized using genuchten s parameters which can be extracted from the same formulation of the llwr and llmpr proposed here our calculations for h pwp considering the h co proposed by dexter et al 2012 reveal that h pwp was lower than the usual threshold of 15 000 hpa used by silva et al 1994 table 2 the h co was calculated as 12 274 hpa indicating that for this clay content i e 230 g kg 1 following the empirical equation proposed by dexter et al 2012 plants should wither in wetter conditions than 15 000 hpa because after the soil has reached the h co convective water flow should cease even under an applied pressure gradient by the plants dexter 2004 and dexter et al 2012 explain that the clay content governs textural porosity and therefore particles smaller than 2 Œºm i e clay are especially important because most of the specific surface area and therefore adsorption occurs on these smallest particles this somehow justifies the positive correlation of h co and clay content found by dexter et al 2012 overall the model from dexter et al 2012 demonstrated that plants should wither in sandy soil under a high soil water potential rather than in clay soils investigating the hydraulic cut off and plant wilting relationship czy≈º and dexter 2012 demonstrated that the h at the permanent wilting point does not appear to be a single value as first proposed by briggs and shantz 1912 and veihmeyer and hendrickson 1928 czy≈º and dexter 2012 tried to show for a range of soil textural classes that drainage often ceases at h 15 000 hpa due to the phenomenon of hydraulic cut off furthermore they highlight that it is interesting to note that this explanation is published 100 years after briggs and shantz 1912 in an experiment comparing the classical permanent wilting point concept of soil to the biological wilting of wheat and barley plants under contrasting soil textures wiecheteck et al 2020 observed that wheat and barley plants withered under wetter conditions than the h of 15 000 hpa for soil with lower clay content corroborating the empirical equation suggested by dexter et al 2012 eq 10 it is important to highlight that we used the empirical equation eq 10 proposed by dexter et al 2012 to illustrate the understanding of the application of the hydraulic cut off as the lower limit of llwr and llmpr however dexter et al 2012 detail two procedures that are based on the water retention curve parameters proposed by groenevelt and grant 2004 and dexter et al 2008 thus it is possible to calculate the h co from experimental data by fitting the parameters of groenevelt and grant 2004 and dexter et al 2008 to the water retention curves and to apply the procedures described by dexter et al 2012 in this study we chose to apply the estimated h co as a function of clay content because of the complexity of introducing two more water retention curves on the calculation procedure the assumption that the permanent wilting point is not a single value of h has been experimentally confirmed in several studies the permanent wilting point reached values of h from 15 000 hpa for cotton and sorghum savage et al 1996 22 000 30 000 hpa for maize hsieh et al 1972 and 37 000 hpa for pepper rawlins et al 1968 the solution proposed by dexter et al 2012 provides a prediction tool related to soil particle size with a significant relationship with clay but it seems that plant mechanisms would have to be added to predictions in future studies van lier et al 2006 czy≈º and dexter 2012 hosseini et al 2016 wiecheteck et al 2020 for example the study carried out by wiecheteck et al 2020 indicates that wheat plants were more drought tolerant than barley plants the calculated qcritical for 50 of ret was calculated as 2 3 and 1 6 mpa for native forest and cultivated soils respectively the higher qcritical values for the native forest soil consider that roots encounter a network of cracks and biopores such that the roots of plants are able to have higher elongation rates for a larger q range bengough 1997 moraes et al 2018 whereas for cultivated soil without biopores 50 of the ret would be reached at lower q values than the usual threshold of 2 0 mpa this means that the degraded soil structure in cultivated soil causes greater restrictions for root elongation and this is reflected in the lower critical soil penetration resistance value bengough et al 2011 moraes et al 2018 our results highlight that the use of a common critical penetration resistance value to calculate the llwr for studying the impact of soil management systems on soil physical quality may lead to inconsistent conclusions it is well known that soil structure and pore shape size continuity and connectivity are altered by soil land use and management systems moraes et al 2014 lima et al 2020 modifying the root elongation rate moraes et al 2014 investigated critical limits of soil penetration resistance affecting plant performance in different tillage systems they suggest that the critical soil penetration resistance limit of 2 0 mpa should be maintained for conventional tillage however it should be increased to 3 0 3 5 mpa under no tillage and or minimum tillage because of the predominance of biopores presenting a soil environment more similar to forest i e with more biopores in a recent study lima et al 2020 found a severe contrast for soil penetration resistance behavior affected by tillage systems which seems to have been influenced by soil structure several studies applying the llwr concept have used 2 0 mpa as qcritical e g le√£o and da silva 2004 lima et al 2016 tormena et al 2017 pulido moncada and munkholm 2019 but these studies make no reference to an expected loss in the growth rate of any root parameter approaches for estimating the soil penetrometer resistance required to reduce the rate of root elongation by half were proposed by dexter 1987 and discussed by silva et al 1994 however the calculation of llwr proposed by silva et al 1994 was based on the assumption that the limiting value of soil resistance is constant at 2 0 mpa which has been a usual threshold used for many studies using the llwr furthermore the fixed threshold does not consider the effect of soil structure on the reduction increase in qcritical for which the studies of bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 showed to be relevant there are not many functions for the estimation of root elongation rate as a function of soil penetrometer resistance however the studies of dexter 1987 bengough 1997 and moraes et al 2018 seem to show that there is a need to know not only the critical limit of penetrometer resistance for root growth impediment but also the rate of loss associated with the increase of this penetrometer resistance note that within the llwr approach water content could be managed to achieve a qcritical that would only reduce a relative growth rate 4 2 least limiting water llwr and matric potential ranges llmpr except for the native forest soil at the minimum soil bulk density the llwr was reduced from usual to the calculated physical restriction threshold scenarios fig 1 fig 1 shows that for the land uses examined in this study native forest and cultivated soil there was an overestimation of the llwr calculated with the usual thresholds in relation to that calculated however as the calculated thresholds are dynamic and dependent on soil porosity or soil structure and water retention characteristics see discussion in section 4 1 this overestimation scenario should not always be predominant the graphic solution model for llwr and llmpr using the calculation procedure presented in section 2 1 is given in fig 2 to illustrate the graphic solution only fig 2 shows the graphic solutions for llwr and llmpw only for the minimum bulk density table 1 of the cultivated soil considering both usual and calculated physical restriction threshold scenarios all other physical restriction limits in terms of Œ∏ and h which delimited llwr and llmpr are presented in tables 3 and 4 fig 2 shows that the llwr and llmpr for the minimum soil bulk density of the cultivated soil were delimited by field capacity and soil penetration resistance regardless of the applied usual or calculated thresholds however llwr and llmpr were greater when the physical restriction thresholds were applied as usual in contrast to using the calculated procedure table 3 shows that the llwr was reduced from 0 1003 to 0 0458 m3 m 3 from usual to calculated physical restriction thresholds whereas the llmpr was reduced from 708 to 287 hpa table 4 demonstrating a large difference between calculated llwr and llmpr using the two ascribed thresholds fig 3 shows how the four restrictions thresholds change as a function of bulk density for each land use and threshold scenarios i e usual and calculated the changes in the four thresholds in the native forest soil from the usual to the calculated scenarios seem to be minimal whereas for the cultivated soil they were considerable demonstrating that the calculation of the thresholds was sensitive to soil structure and soil cultivation table 2 shows that the reduction in llwr and llmpr from the usual to the calculated scenarios of the cultivated soil was caused by an increase in h fc from 100 to 178 hpa and a decrease in qcritical from 2 0 1 6 mpa which resulted in a decrease and increase in Œ∏fc and Œ∏qcritical respectively fig 3 based on our scenarios these results show that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure which results in lower h at field capacity as well as an increase in soil penetration resistance for a given elongation rate overall water content or water potential at the field scale should be managed within llwr and llmpr to avoid physical restriction for plant water uptake note that besides the water content range given by llwr first introduced by silva et al 1994 the corresponding llmpr presented in this study would also allow monitoring of the moisture range in terms of water potential which could be managed with tensiometers up to 700 800 hpa and could be useful for agricultural water management 4 3 computational implementation the procedure described in the section 2 1 which calculates llwr and llmpr was computationally implemented as an r function r software r core team 2020 named llwr llmpr and on an interactive web page both available in the r package soilphysics available from https arsilva87 github io soilphysics or http cran r project org web packages soilphysics index html basically the function llwr llmpr requires genuchten s water retention curve parameters table 1 busscher s soil penetration curve parameters d e and f and the soil physical restriction thresholds table 2 although here we calculated the soil physical restriction thresholds the user is free to assign the thresholds in the function llwr llmpr the output of the function llwr llmpr is the graphic solution for llwr or llmpr as well as a correspond table with the limits in terms of Œ∏ and h and the values of llwr and llmpr 5 summary and conclusions we present a new procedure for the calculation of the least limiting water range llwr and additionally present the least limiting water matric potential range llmpr both llwr and llmpr are easily parameterized using the common genuchten s water retention curve beyond the usual busscher s penetration resistance curve the introduction of the llmpr calculation allowed to determine besides the soil water content the soil water potential boundaries associated with physical restrictions for plant growth furthermore we present a calculation procedure of the soil physical restriction thresholds that are used to calculate llwr and llmpr and suggest a procedure for the calculation of minimal aeration porosity field capacity permanent wilting point and limiting soil penetration resistance thresholds the calculated soil physical restriction thresholds are sensitive to changes in soil structure and clay content and are therefore changeable rather than fixed they were able to considerably reduce llwr and llmpr in native forest and cultivated soils in comparison with calculations made with the usual thresholds finally based on experimental data our calculations with the calculated thresholds showed that an increase in llwr and its corresponding llmpr could be achieved with improvements in soil structure the improvements in the soil structure could result in higher water content at field capacity as well

10523,plastic film mulching pm has been widely adopted for dryland maize zea mays l in the loess plateau of china whereas its impact on grain yield gy varies considerably therefore it is crucial to make some feasible strategies that aim to improve the productivity of pm systems using the data obtained from peer reviewed publications we conducted a meta analysis to 1 analyze the climate regions where maize gy increase induced by pm gy i was greater than zero and 2 determine the optimum conditions of soil properties and field management practices for pm application considering both gy i and actual gy under pm gy p the results showed that on average pm significantly increased maize gy by 56 10 as compared with no mulching which was a result of increased aboveground biomass at harvest

rate pfr increasing sbd nfr and pfr tended to reduce gy i but gy p showed an inverted u shaped relationship with sbd and changed from increasing to constant with increasing nfr and pfr as pd increased

climate regions optimum conditions 1 introduction maize zea mays l has become the highest yielding grain crop in china since 2011 and its production was 259 mt in 2017 accounting for about two fifths of china s grain production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 with the rapid growth of population and economy the demand for grain in china is increasing especially maize whose grain yield gy is expected to reach 315 mt by 2030 approximately 22 higher than the current maize production chen et al 2014 among the major maize production regions gy gaps i e differences between gy potential and actual farmers gy are relatively lower in northeastern china the huang huai hai plain and southwestern china li and wang 2010 tao et al 2015 however in northern china where dryland maize is dominant li 2004 li and wang 2010 actual farmers gys generally only achieve less than 60 of gy potential tao et al 2015 therefore improving dryland maize production and thereby closing gy gaps in northern china will be of great important significance for ensuring china s national food security in the future the loess plateau spreading over approximately 64 million hectares and supporting about 100 million people is a typical dryland maize growing region in northern china wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2018a due to the lack of surface water and groundwater precipitation has generally been the primary source of water for maize production li 2004 the water requirement of maize varies from 450 mm to 750 mm during the growing season in the loess plateau liu et al 2009b however dryland maize over this region is almost entirely located in semi arid and semi humid regions with annual precipitation of 200 650 mm li 2004 zhang et al 2014 which indicates the growth and development of maize are usually limited by water deficit worse still this water deficit may become more prevalent in the future because the annual potential evapotranspiration from 2011 to 2100 over the loess plateau was projected to significantly increase peng et al 2017 but no significant change in the annual precipitation was expected peng et al 2018 additionally the annual precipitation mostly falls during july to september in the loess plateau which is in the mid to late growing period of maize yu et al 2018 this mismatch between the rain season and maize cycle constrains the emergence and early growth and development of maize thereby reducing the final gy apart from water deficit cold stress during the early growing period is considered as another factor that suppresses maize production in the loess plateau mo et al 2018 which is because maize is generally sowed every mid to late april with a low air temperature bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009a given these negative factors over the maize growing season local farmers in the loess plateau adopted various corresponding field management practices to boost and stabilize maize production and plastic film mulching pm has been proven to be one of the most widely used and effective li 2004 in 2017 about 0 17 mt of plastic film was applied to 2 6 million hectares of cropland in shanxi shaanxi ningxia and gansu provinces where the loess plateau is mostly located national bureau of statistics of china 2019 abundant information about increasing maize gy by pm has been reported in the loess plateau lin and liu 2016 ye and liu 2012 zhang et al 2014 2017b 2018a however the increasing effect of pm on maize gy varies considerably zhang et al 2014 for instance on average maize gy under pm relative to no mulching nm significantly increases by 30 56 84 93 and 107 in the counties of ningxian chongxin tongwei yuzhong and huining across gansu province respectively wang et al 2016b and surprisingly a few studies found maize production under pm is lower than that under nm in some years hai 2011 li et al 2016b wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2008 zhang 2016 therefore it is crucial to make some feasible strategies that aim to improve the productivity of pm systems in the loess plateau meta analysis provides a formal statistical technique for quantitatively evaluating treatment effects by summarizing the results of independent experiments with the same subject hedges et al 1999 furthermore it can identify specific reasons for the sample to sample variation of treatment effects smith and kaoru 1990 stanley 2001 several recent studies using a meta analytical approach have focused on the response of maize gy to pm gao et al 2019 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 qin et al 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b one of the most direct and important reasons for the positive effect of pm on maize gy is to improve soil hydrothermal environments especially in more water and heat limited areas steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016b as a result it is likely that there is a specific climate region for maize production increase under pm compared with nm whereas no conclusive meta analyses were published in the meta analysis the relative value such as the ratio of the mean of the research outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group is commonly used as a measure of experimental effect because it quantifies the proportionate change that results from an experimental manipulation hedges et al 1999 thus these previous meta analyses mainly evaluated maize gy increase induced by pm gy i under different factors thereby determining the optimum conditions for pm application apart from gy i farmers are also concerned about actual gy under pm gy p in practice because it greatly affects their economic income from maize cultivation li et al 2012 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 however gy i and gy p may lead to conflicting research outcomes regarding the optimum conditions for pm application li 2016 wang 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the climate regions where pm is effective in increasing maize gy as compared with nm and 2 identify the optimum conditions of some controllable factors in practice soil properties and field management practices for pm application considering both gy i and gy p 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and preparation the china knowledge resource integrated database http www cnki net web of science http apps webofknowledge com and google scholar http scholar google com were used to search relevant peer reviewed studies published from 1978 to 2018 the search terms included mulch or mulching and maize or corn in the article title abstract or keywords we screened publications according to the following criteria 1 the experimental sites were located in the loess plateau of china 2 the studies had to be conducted in rain fed fields 3 there were at least two experimental treatments for each study i e pm and nm 4 the

number per square meter ensm kernel row number krn kernel number per row knr kernel number per ear kne and hundred kernel weight hkw and 5 with regard to the publications containing the same experimental results the one that provided the most detailed description about this experiment was selected to compile its data into the database in total 83 studies 33 and 50 published in english and chinese respectively conducted at 20 sites in the loess plateau were obtained appendix a and fig 1 the desired data in the publications were extracted directly from tables and texts or indirectly from figures using the getdata graph digitizer software http getdata graph digitizer com standard deviation sd is needed as an input variable to meta analysis sd was computed when only standard error se was reported s d s e n where n is the number of replicates in cases where sd and se were not available we calculated the average coefficients of variation acvs of gy and gy related indices under pm and nm based on the known sample data and then the missing sds were estimated via the following equation mei et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 s d x a c v where x is the mean of gy and gy related indices under pm and nm from the studies that did not report sd and se due to the sd se and acv of ensm that could not be directly obtained or indirectly computed in all studies its sd was assigned as 10 of the mean luo et al 2006 in addition to the above mentioned data other related information of each study was also compiled into the database table a 1 1 climate included mean annual precipitation map and mean annual temperature mat for at least the past three decades 2 soil properties included soil organic carbon soc soil total nitrogen stn soil available phosphorus sap soil available potassium sak and soil bulk density sbd in topsoil at the start of field experiment and 3 field management practices included plant density pd nitrogen fertilizer rate nfr phosphorus fertilizer rate pfr and potassium fertilizer rate kfr if the climatic information of experimental sites was not given in the publications we obtained the map and mat during 1981 2015 from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 2 2 meta analysis in order to quantify the pm effects on gy and gy related indices the natural logarithm of the response ratio ln r was used as the effect size in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where xe and xc are the means under pm and nm for gy and gy related indices respectively the variance of lnr v was computed as v s d e 2 n x e 2 s d c 2 n x c 2 where sde and sdc are the corresponding standard deviations the weighting factor of ln r w was the inverse of its variance w 1 v the mean effect size for all pm to nm comparisons ln r was estimated as ln r ln r i w i w i where ln ri and wi are the effect size and its weighting factor for the ith pm to nm comparison respectively the 95 confidence interval ci of ln r was calculated as 95 c i ln r 1 96 s e ln r where s e ln r is the standard error of ln r and it was obtained as s e ln r 1 w i in order to explain the variation in gy i between samples the database was separated into different sub databases based on climate soil properties and field management practices table 1 according to the generalized climate classification schemes li 2004 zhang and liu 2007 experimental sites with map 450 mm 450 mm map 600 mm and map 600 mm were considered to be semi arid dry semi humid and semi humid regions respectively and experimental sites with mat 8 c and 8 c were considered to be mid temperate and warm temperate regions respectively sbd was divided into three subgroups 1 14 g cm 3 loose soil 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 moderate soil and 1 30 g cm 3 tight soil geng and dai 2011 shen 2001 based on the sample sizes and distributions the equidistant separations listed in table 1 were used for other categorical factors soc stn sap sak pd nfr pfr and kfr mean effect sizes and their 95 cis were calculated using a random effects model in metawin 2 1 rosenberg et al 2000 in the categorical meta analysis the total heterogeneity qt of effect sizes was partitioned into within group heterogeneity qw and between group heterogeneity qb which were both tested against a chi square distribution a significant qb indicates that gy i is significantly affected by this categorical factor p 0 05 if the 95 cis did not overlap with zero the mean effect sizes of pm on maize gy and gy related indices were statistically significant similarly the mean effect sizes of pm between subgroups significantly differed when there were no overlaps in the 95 cis between subgroups in order to facilitate interpretation the percent change was computed as exp ln r 1 100 the results of meta analysis may be strongly affected by publication bias because studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published luo et al 2018 rosenberg 2005 begg and mazumdar rank correlation test was conducted to judge whether publication bias existed begg and mazumdar 1994 in addition we calculated rosenthal s fail safe number rosenthal 1979 the results were considered robust despite the possibility for publication bias when their rosenthal s fail safe numbers were greater than 5 n 10 where n is the sample size of effect sizes rosenberg 2005 2 3 statistical analysis the frequency distributions of the effect sizes of pm on gy and gy related indices were fitted by a gaussian normal distribution function to test their normality yu et al 2020 correlation analysis was used to understand which of the changes of gy related indices caused increased gy under pm relative to nm regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships of gy i with map and mat the relationships of gy with map and mat under pm and nm were also tested by regression analysis according to the classification schemes for the gy i database table 1 we classified the gy p database into different subgroups the significant differences between subgroups for gy p were evaluated with a kruskal wallis one way anova at the 0 05 probability level these analyses were conducted using spss 23 0 ibm spss statistics usa 3 results 3 1 overview of the database and analysis of publication bias data used in the meta analysis are summarized in tables a 1 a 2 and a 3 in total there were 3337 records about climate soil properties and field management practices and 1339 pm to nm comparisons about maize gy and gy related indices in the collected 83 studies all but krn varied greatly with coefficients of variation cvs of 10 09 160 49 and the magnitudes of variations were moderate or strong according to the classification of weak cv 10 moderate 10 cv 100 and strong cv 100 jia and shao 2014 begg and mazumdar rank correlation tests showed that publication bias occurred for the mean effect sizes of pm on gy under mid temperate and warm temperate climates sap of 20 28 mg kg 1 nfr of 220 280 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 abh kne and hkw table a 4 however all rosenthal s fail safe numbers were far beyond their respective thresholds of 5 n 10 table a 4 which indicates the results calculated by meta analysis are robust as a result we did not consider publication bias to be a problem in this meta analysis 3 2 overall effects of pm on grain yield and its related indices the effect sizes of pm on maize gy and gy related indices all followed a normal distribution in frequency table 2 overall maize gy significantly increased by 56 10 from 7345 kg ha 1 under nm to 10 512 kg ha 1 under pm over the loess plateau tables 2 a 2 and a 3 abh and hi under pm were significantly higher by 49 96 and 12 57 on average respectively than under nm table 2 besides it was found that increased abh and hi caused by pm both showed significant and positive correlations with gy i table 3 with gy components pm significantly increased ensm knr kne and hkw by 13 47 10 82 18 76 and 24 10 overall respectively table 2 however krn under nm basically matched that under pm table 2 correlation analyses demonstrated that there were significant and positive correlations between the pm induced increases in ensm knr kne and hkw and gy i table 3 kne is equal to the product of krn and knr in theory yu 2013 whereas increased kne under pm was significantly and positively correlated with only the knr increase table 3 3 3 interactions between climate and pm on grain yield both map and mat significantly affected gy i figs 2b and 3 b gy i linearly decreased at mean rates of 0 70 mm 1 and 20 59 c 1 with increasing map and mat respectively and approached zero at map of 627 6 mm and mat of 13 1 c figs 2a and 3 a categorical meta analysis showed that in semi arid dry semi humid and semi humid regions pm significantly increased gy by 132 36 40 80 and 16 33 respectively as compared with nm fig 2b moreover gy i significantly differed among these three subgroups fig 2b in mid temperate regions a gy i of 107 09 was observed which was significantly higher than that of 39 71 in warm temperate regions fig 3b 3 4 interactions between soil properties and pm on grain yield among the five soil properties considered here gy i was significantly affected by only sbd fig 4 increasing sbd tended to reduce gy i fig 4e gy was significantly higher by 78 57 57 29 and 32 41 under pm than under nm when sbd was 1 14 g cm 3 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 30 g cm 3 respectively fig 4e however the gy i at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 showed no significant difference from that at sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 fig 4e soc stn sap and sak had no statistically significant effects on gy p which was about 10 500 kg ha 1 in each subgroup on average whereas sbd significantly affected it fig 5 as sbd increased gy p changed in a low to high to low trend fig 5e the maximum gy p was achieved at sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 10 867 kg ha 1 which was significantly higher than the gy p at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 9428 kg ha 1 and 1 30 g cm 3 9457 kg ha 1 fig 5e 3 5 interactions between field management practices and pm on grain yield except for kfr the field management practices considered here pd nfr and pfr all significantly affected gy i fig 6 gy i was the highest and lowest at pd of 56 000 plants ha 1 71 48 and 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 39 17 respectively and a significant difference among them was observed fig 6a however there was the same gy i of about 52 for pd of 56 000 64 000 plants ha 1 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 and 80 000 plants ha 1 fig 6a the maximum gy i occurred when nfr was 100 kg n ha 1 60 43 followed by 220 280 kg n ha 1 58 26 100 160 kg n ha 1 56 69 160 220 kg n ha 1 52 38 and 280 kg n ha 1 28 56 fig 6b moreover there were significant differences between at nfr of 280 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg n ha 1 100 160 kg n ha 1 and 220 280 kg n ha 1 for gy i fig 6b at pfr of 45 kg p2o5 ha 1 45 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 the gy i was 61 09 68 07 59 15 41 85 and 33 02 respectively fig 6c besides it was found that the gy i at pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 significantly differed from that at pfr of 45 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 fig 6c gy p significantly varied with pd nfr and pfr but not kfr fig 7 as pd increased gy p increased at first and then decreased peaking when pd was 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 12 799 kg ha 1 fig 7a however the maximum gy p showed no significant differences from the gy p at pd of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 12 367 kg ha 1 and 80 000 plants ha 1 11 544 kg ha 1 fig 7a a significant increase from 7170 kg ha 1 to 10 610 kg ha 1 was observed for gy p when nfr was from 100 kg n ha 1 to 160 220 kg n ha 1 fig 7b however the gy p remained the same of about 11 000 kg ha 1 at nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 220 280 kg n ha 1 and 280 kg n ha 1 fig 7b similarly gy p changed from increasing to constant with increasing pfr fig 7c the maximum gy p of 12 380 kg ha 1 achieved at pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 was significantly higher than the gy p at pfr of 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 7645 10 298 kg ha 1 but similar to the gy p at pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 11 738 kg ha 1 fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 pm increased grain yield because of the differences in climate soil properties field managements and so on there was a strong variation in gy i with cv of 156 85 fig a 1a among our database about 1 of samples demonstrated that pm reduced gy by 7 55 on average as compared with nm fig a 1a this phenomenon may be because pm significantly accelerates the growth and development of maize which results in maize flowering and silking under conditions of water shortage caused by summer drought happening occasionally in the loess plateau hai 2011 wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2008 however approximately 99 of samples were observed to be greater than zero for gy i and its maximum reached up to 1043 66 fig a 1a as a result pm application over the loess plateau usually has a positive effect on maize gy which is consistent with the results reported by other meta analyses ma et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b in addition to increasing the productivity of dryland farming systems reducing its variability is another major objective of development parr et al 1990 it was found in our study that compared with nm pm decreased the sample to sample variation in gy by 40 09 tables a 2 and a 3 indicting maize production is less variable under pm than under nm spearman correlation coefficients as shown in table 3 suggest that increased maize gy due to pm is a result of increased abh and hi and it can also be attributed to increased ensm knr and hkw similar results were found by jia et al 2018 wang et al 2016b 2018a and zhang 2016 as well who concluded that in comparison with nm the great improvements in leaf photosynthesis ear and kernel numbers translocation of assimilates from vegetative to reproductive organs and grain filling lead to a higher maize production under pm however krn was not significantly affected by pm table 2 perhaps because krn an ear trait with high heritability has low sensitivity to the changes of field environment dhillon and singh 1977 li et al 2011 4 2 response of grain yield to pm varied with climate drought and low temperature are recognized as the two main factors that suppress maize production over the loess plateau bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009a mo et al 2018 in part of this region nm cannot produce any maize gy due to the limitations of precipitation and accumulated temperature he and zhou 2012 sun 2016 however pm significantly reduces soil water loss by evaporation and improves soil heat retention thereby having the potential to extend maize cultivation to some drier and colder areas zhang et al 2018a zhang 1995 based on the relationships of the gy under nm and pm with map and mat extrapolations showed that at map of 203 8 281 3 mm and mat of 3 3 4 6 c pm could produce maize gy of about 1866 kg ha 1 on average whereas there was zero maize production under nm figs 8 and 9 previous findings consistently demonstrated that the wetter and warmer local hydrothermal conditions the less is the positive effect of pm on maize gy han et al 2014 he et al 2018 wang et al 2016b ye and liu 2012 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a our study also found that increasing map and mat both reduced maize gy i figs 2 and 3 as a result pm should be preferentially applied in more hydrothermally limited areas e g semi arid and mid temperate areas of the loess plateau in respect to the thresholds of map and mat where no increasing in maize gy occurs under pm the present study differs somewhat from previous studies our results showed that gy i approached zero when map and mat were 627 6 mm and 13 1 c respectively figs 2a and 3 a however zhang et al 2018a concluded that pm is likely not effective in increasing maize production at map exceeding 600 mm and mat exceeding 9 c based on the denitrification decomposition dndc model simulations han et al 2014 also used the dndc model to conduct a regional simulation in shaanxi province of china which suggested that almost no gy benefit of pm over nm is achieved when map is greater than 700 mm the reasons causing the above mentioned differences among the present and these previous studies may be the differences in research method and data source considering that the same crop parameters and field managements were used in the dndc model simulations for all regions which is not the case the results based on meta analysis may be more realistic for pm application in the loess plateau than those based on model simulations 4 3 response of grain yield to pm varied with soil properties soil fertility is vital for agricultural productivity yageta et al 2019 however gy i and gy p were both not significantly related to soc stn sap and sak in our study figs 4a d and 5 a d which is in agreement with the findings of yu et al 2018 on one hand sak is not a limiting factor for maize production because of its high contents over the loess plateau wu et al 2013 on the other hand high inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers dilute the effects of soc stn and sap on the productivity of pm systems as recommended by wu et al 2015 in order to attain dryland maize gy of 6800 10 500 kg ha 1 in the loess plateau nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers must be applied at 135 210 kg n ha 1 and 68 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 respectively regardless of the variation in regional soil fertility in the present study average nfr and pfr were about 220 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 in each soc stn and sap subgroups respectively and maize gy under nm and pm of about 7300 kg ha 1 and 10 500 kg ha 1 were achieved on average respectively data not shown therefore no matter how soc stn and sap vary the external applications of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers can support the current level of maize gy especially under nm with greater sbd less soil water is evaporated geng and dai 2011 thus as sbd increases the role in reducing soil evaporation by pm decreases which may result in a decreasing trend for gy i especially the gy i at sbd of 1 30 g cm 3 that was significantly lower than that at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 and 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 fig 4e there was an inverted u shaped relationship between gy p and sbd in our study fig 5e possibly because of 1 weak root systems and high soil water loss by evaporation when soil is too loose sbd 1 14 g cm 3 and 2 shallow root systems and poor soil aeration and water permeability when soil is too tight sbd 1 30 g cm 3 geng and dai 2011 these results suggest an sbd range of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 for pm application in the loess plateau 4 4 response of grain yield to pm varied with field management practices adjusting the population density of plants is a widely used agronomic practice to improve maize production worldwide testa et al 2016 as reported by other studies li et al 2018b ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the pm induced advantages e g the wetter and warmer root zone soil can support a higher pd to increase maize gy in water and heat limited regions such as the loess plateau as a result the maximum gy occurs with lower pd under nm than under pm which may contribute to the result that gy i decreased at first and then increased with increasing pd fig 6a many previous studies have demonstrated that gy has an inverted u shaped relationship with pd li et al 2018b sangoi et al 2002 tokatlidis and koutroubas 2004 as was the case with our study fig 7a the gy p at pd of 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 and 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 was obviously higher than that in other subgroups fig 7a but the minimum gy i was observed at pd of 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 fig 6a therefore we suggest that a pd range of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 be adopted for maximizing the pm productivity in the loess plateau improved soil hydrothermal environments under pm not only increase soil microbial quantity and enzymatic activity but also result in a shift in the composition of the soil microbial community thereby stimulating soc mineralization li et al 2004 liu et al 2014b steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016a besides some published studies suggested that compared with nm pm can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching haraguchi et al 2004 jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2017a 2017b ruidisch et al 2013 thus high contents of available nutrients are observed in soil profile under pm especially in topsoil generally crop nutrient requirements come mostly from the soil reserves and external fertilizer applications chuan et al 2013 gianquinto et al 2013 the less external fertilizer applications in croplands the greater is the dependence of crop production on the inherent capacity of soil to supply nutrients wang et al 2018b therefore the pm induced increase in soil nutrient availability plays a greater role in improving crop production at low fertilizer inputs than at high fertilizer inputs fan et al 2005 li et al 2018a similarly our meta analysis showed rough decreasing trends for gy i as nfr and pfr increased and the gy i at nfr of 280 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 was obviously lower than that in other subgroups fig 6b and c with regard to gy p it significantly increased with increasing nfr and pfr at first and then it basically remained unchanged when nfr and pfr exceeded 160 kg n ha 1 and 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 respectively fig 7b and c which is comparable with other studies over this region bu et al 2014 wang et al 2018c given both the gy i and gy p responses to nfr and pfr it may be advisable to adopt pm at nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 for dryland maize in the loess plateau due to the high soil indigenous potassium supply for maize growth and development over the loess plateau wu et al 2013 2015 the effects of kfr on gy i and gy p were not significant figs 6d and 7 d therefore maize production has low sensitivity to potassium fertilizer application in this region 4 5 study limitations and future perspectives abundant information has showed that there are interactive effects of climate soil properties and field management practices on maize production for instance water availability greatly affects the gy pd relationship friedman 2016 and tokatlidis et al 2011 concluded that the optimum pd under drought prone conditions is much lower than that under favorable conditions for maize hybrids indicating that the optimum pd differs in different climate regions however if our database had been separated into different subgroups based on pd under a certain map range e g semi arid regions with mat 450 mm some subgroups would have small sample sizes which may lead to some misleading results calculated by meta analysis yu et al 2018 similarly the above mentioned problems would occur when other interactive effects had been studied therefore the present study only evaluated the effects of a single factor on gy i and gy p thereby identifying the climate thresholds and optimum conditions for pm application in the loess plateau on the other hand in addition to the factors considered here additional factors may also influence the response of maize gy to pm such as climate change chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a and variety wang et al 2018a so their critical or optimum conditions for pm application also need to be determined however our work did not involve these studies because of the limitation of data availability although pm significantly increased maize production as compared with nm table 2 it induces a series of environmental issues that should be given more attentions in future studies firstly agriculture is a key contributor to the anthropogenic emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o worldwide ciais et al 2013 pm has the potential to favor greenhouse gas emissions due to the improvements in soil microbial quantity and enzymatic activity and the shift in the composition of the soil microbial community chen et al 2017 cuello et al 2015 he et al 2018 steinmetz et al 2016 especially under future climate change chen et al 2019 secondly as discussed by previous studies he et al 2018 li et al 2016a 2017 steinmetz et al 2016 xie et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017a increased crop gys under pm may be at the expense of the degradation of the soil resources among our collected data not included in the database of this study approximately 39 and 57 of samples showed the decreases in soil water storage and soc at harvest respectively under pm compared with nm fig a 1b and c thirdly plastic mulch films consist mostly of low density and linear low density polyethylene which do not readily biodegrade sintim and flury 2017 as a result these polyethylene based mulches must be retrieved and disposed after usage however the incomplete removal of plastic mulches which causes an accumulation of plastic residue year by year in soil and the unreasonable disposal options for the plastic mulches retrieved from fields e g amassing burning and landfilling both produce plenty of adverse impacts on the agricultural environment he et al 2018 liu et al 2014a sintim and flury 2017 biodegradable plastic mulching may be a solution to agriculture s plastic problem because it can be directly tilled into the soil after use and degraded by the action of soil organisms kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 sintim and flury 2017 however there are some problems requiring further identification in our opinion 1 are agronomic benefits of biodegradable plastic mulching the same as those of polyethylene mulching 2 given the expensive price of biodegradable plastic can its mulching increase farmers economic return 3 does biodegradable plastic degrade completely in soil and 4 does biodegradable plastic mulching affect soil health 5 conclusions overall adoption of plastic film mulching pm significantly increased maize grain yield gy in the loess plateau of china and specifically this increasing effect was more remarkable in more hydrothermally limited areas but small or even negative in areas that were not so hydrothermally limited besides pm had the potential to extend maize cultivation to some drier and colder areas where no gy was achieved under no mulching maize gy and gy increase under pm both significantly varied with soil bulk density sbd plant density pd nitrogen fertilizer rate nfr and phosphorus fertilizer rate pfr but not soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen soil available phosphorus soil available potassium and potassium fertilizer rate it may be advisable to adopt pm under sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 pd of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 in order to investigate the effects of factors not considered in this study and the interactive effects of factors on the response of maize gy to pm more relevant experimental data should be collected in future studies in addition future studies should put more emphases on the environmental costs of pm such as greenhouse gas emissions increased soil resource depletion and white

10523,plastic film mulching pm has been widely adopted for dryland maize zea mays l in the loess plateau of china whereas its impact on grain yield gy varies considerably therefore it is crucial to make some feasible strategies that aim to improve the productivity of pm systems using the data obtained from peer reviewed publications we conducted a meta analysis to 1 analyze the climate regions where maize gy increase induced by pm gy i was greater than zero and 2 determine the optimum conditions of soil properties and field management practices for pm application considering both gy i and actual gy under pm gy p the results showed that on average pm significantly increased maize gy by 56 10 as compared with no mulching which was a result of increased aboveground biomass at harvest harvest index ear number per square meter kernel number per row and hundred kernel weight pm could extend maize cultivation to drier and colder areas with mean annual precipitation map of 203 8 281 3 mm and mean annual temperature mat of 3 3 4 6 c where an average gy of about 1866 kg ha 1 could be achieved under pm however as map and mat continued to increase gy i decreased linearly and reached zero at map and mat of 627 6 mm and 13 1 c respectively gy i and gy p were both significantly affected by soil bulk density sbd plant density pd nitrogen fertilizer rate nfr and phosphorus fertilizer rate pfr increasing sbd nfr and pfr tended to reduce gy i but gy p showed an inverted u shaped relationship with sbd and changed from increasing to constant with increasing nfr and pfr as pd increased gy i decreased at first and then increased while gy p was observed to change oppositely it was suggested that pm be adopted at sbd nfr pfr and pd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 160 220 kg n ha 1 105 135 kg p2o5

climate regions optimum conditions 1 introduction maize zea mays l has become the highest yielding grain crop in china since 2011 and its production was 259 mt in 2017 accounting for about two fifths of china s grain production national bureau of statistics of china 2018 with the rapid growth of population and economy the demand for grain in china is increasing especially maize whose grain yield gy is expected to reach 315 mt by 2030 approximately 22 higher than the current maize production chen et al 2014 among the major maize production regions gy gaps i e differences between gy potential and actual farmers gy are relatively lower in northeastern china the huang huai hai plain and southwestern china li and wang 2010 tao et al 2015 however in northern china where dryland maize is dominant li 2004 li and wang 2010 actual farmers gys generally only achieve less than 60 of gy potential tao et al 2015 therefore improving dryland maize production and thereby closing gy gaps in northern china will be of great important significance for ensuring china s national food security in the future the loess plateau spreading over approximately 64 million hectares and supporting about 100 million people is a typical dryland maize growing region in northern china wang et al 2007 zhang et al 2018a due to the lack of surface water and groundwater precipitation has generally been the primary source of water for maize production li 2004 the water requirement of maize varies from 450 mm to 750 mm during the growing season in the loess plateau liu et al 2009b however dryland maize over this region is almost entirely located in semi arid and semi humid regions with annual precipitation of 200 650 mm li 2004 zhang et al 2014 which indicates the growth and development of maize are usually limited by water deficit worse still this water deficit may become more prevalent in the future because the annual potential evapotranspiration from 2011 to 2100 over the loess plateau was projected to significantly increase peng et al 2017 but no significant change in the annual precipitation was expected peng et al 2018 additionally the annual precipitation mostly falls during july to september in the loess plateau which is in the mid to late growing period of maize yu et al 2018 this mismatch between the rain season and maize cycle constrains the emergence and early growth and development of maize thereby reducing the final gy apart from water deficit cold stress during the early growing period is considered as another factor that suppresses maize production in the loess plateau mo et al 2018 which is because maize is generally sowed every mid to late april with a low air temperature bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009a given these negative factors over the maize growing season local farmers in the loess plateau adopted various corresponding field management practices to boost and stabilize maize production and plastic film mulching pm has been proven to be one of the most widely used and effective li 2004 in 2017 about 0 17 mt of plastic film was applied to 2 6 million hectares of cropland in shanxi shaanxi ningxia and gansu provinces where the loess plateau is mostly located national bureau of statistics of china 2019 abundant information about increasing maize gy by pm has been reported in the loess plateau lin and liu 2016 ye and liu 2012 zhang et al 2014 2017b 2018a however the increasing effect of pm on maize gy varies considerably zhang et al 2014 for instance on average maize gy under pm relative to no mulching nm significantly increases by 30 56 84 93 and 107 in the counties of ningxian chongxin tongwei yuzhong and huining across gansu province respectively wang et al 2016b and surprisingly a few studies found maize production under pm is lower than that under nm in some years hai 2011 li et al 2016b wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2008 zhang 2016 therefore it is crucial to make some feasible strategies that aim to improve the productivity of pm systems in the loess plateau meta analysis provides a formal statistical technique for quantitatively evaluating treatment effects by summarizing the results of independent experiments with the same subject hedges et al 1999 furthermore it can identify specific reasons for the sample to sample variation of treatment effects smith and kaoru 1990 stanley 2001 several recent studies using a meta analytical approach have focused on the response of maize gy to pm gao et al 2019 he et al 2018 ma et al 2018 qin et al 2015 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b one of the most direct and important reasons for the positive effect of pm on maize gy is to improve soil hydrothermal environments especially in more water and heat limited areas steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016b as a result it is likely that there is a specific climate region for maize production increase under pm compared with nm whereas no conclusive meta analyses were published in the meta analysis the relative value such as the ratio of the mean of the research outcome in the experimental group to that in the control group is commonly used as a measure of experimental effect because it quantifies the proportionate change that results from an experimental manipulation hedges et al 1999 thus these previous meta analyses mainly evaluated maize gy increase induced by pm gy i under different factors thereby determining the optimum conditions for pm application apart from gy i farmers are also concerned about actual gy under pm gy p in practice because it greatly affects their economic income from maize cultivation li et al 2012 qin et al 2018 wu et al 2017 however gy i and gy p may lead to conflicting research outcomes regarding the optimum conditions for pm application li 2016 wang 2018 therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 analyze the climate regions where pm is effective in increasing maize gy as compared with nm and 2 identify the optimum conditions of some controllable factors in practice soil properties and field management practices for pm application considering both gy i and gy p 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection and preparation the china knowledge resource integrated database http www cnki net web of science http apps webofknowledge com and google scholar http scholar google com were used to search relevant peer reviewed studies published from 1978 to 2018 the search terms included mulch or mulching and maize or corn in the article title abstract or keywords we screened publications according to the following criteria 1 the experimental sites were located in the loess plateau of china 2 the studies had to be conducted in rain fed fields 3 there were at least two experimental treatments for each study i e pm and nm 4 the means standard deviations or standard errors and numbers of replicates were reported or could be calculated for maize gy or gy related indices aboveground biomass at harvest abh harvest index hi ear number per square meter ensm kernel row number krn kernel number per row knr kernel number per ear kne and hundred kernel weight hkw and 5 with regard to the publications containing the same experimental results the one that provided the most detailed description about this experiment was selected to compile its data into the database in total 83 studies 33 and 50 published in english and chinese respectively conducted at 20 sites in the loess plateau were obtained appendix a and fig 1 the desired data in the publications were extracted directly from tables and texts or indirectly from figures using the getdata graph digitizer software http getdata graph digitizer com standard deviation sd is needed as an input variable to meta analysis sd was computed when only standard error se was reported s d s e n where n is the number of replicates in cases where sd and se were not available we calculated the average coefficients of variation acvs of gy and gy related indices under pm and nm based on the known sample data and then the missing sds were estimated via the following equation mei et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 s d x a c v where x is the mean of gy and gy related indices under pm and nm from the studies that did not report sd and se due to the sd se and acv of ensm that could not be directly obtained or indirectly computed in all studies its sd was assigned as 10 of the mean luo et al 2006 in addition to the above mentioned data other related information of each study was also compiled into the database table a 1 1 climate included mean annual precipitation map and mean annual temperature mat for at least the past three decades 2 soil properties included soil organic carbon soc soil total nitrogen stn soil available phosphorus sap soil available potassium sak and soil bulk density sbd in topsoil at the start of field experiment and 3 field management practices included plant density pd nitrogen fertilizer rate nfr phosphorus fertilizer rate pfr and potassium fertilizer rate kfr if the climatic information of experimental sites was not given in the publications we obtained the map and mat during 1981 2015 from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 2 2 meta analysis in order to quantify the pm effects on gy and gy related indices the natural logarithm of the response ratio ln r was used as the effect size in this meta analysis hedges et al 1999 ln r ln x e x c ln x e ln x c where xe and xc are the means under pm and nm for gy and gy related indices respectively the variance of lnr v was computed as v s d e 2 n x e 2 s d c 2 n x c 2 where sde and sdc are the corresponding standard deviations the weighting factor of ln r w was the inverse of its variance w 1 v the mean effect size for all pm to nm comparisons ln r was estimated as ln r ln r i w i w i where ln ri and wi are the effect size and its weighting factor for the ith pm to nm comparison respectively the 95 confidence interval ci of ln r was calculated as 95 c i ln r 1 96 s e ln r where s e ln r is the standard error of ln r and it was obtained as s e ln r 1 w i in order to explain the variation in gy i between samples the database was separated into different sub databases based on climate soil properties and field management practices table 1 according to the generalized climate classification schemes li 2004 zhang and liu 2007 experimental sites with map 450 mm 450 mm map 600 mm and map 600 mm were considered to be semi arid dry semi humid and semi humid regions respectively and experimental sites with mat 8 c and 8 c were considered to be mid temperate and warm temperate regions respectively sbd was divided into three subgroups 1 14 g cm 3 loose soil 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 moderate soil and 1 30 g cm 3 tight soil geng and dai 2011 shen 2001 based on the sample sizes and distributions the equidistant separations listed in table 1 were used for other categorical factors soc stn sap sak pd nfr pfr and kfr mean effect sizes and their 95 cis were calculated using a random effects model in metawin 2 1 rosenberg et al 2000 in the categorical meta analysis the total heterogeneity qt of effect sizes was partitioned into within group heterogeneity qw and between group heterogeneity qb which were both tested against a chi square distribution a significant qb indicates that gy i is significantly affected by this categorical factor p 0 05 if the 95 cis did not overlap with zero the mean effect sizes of pm on maize gy and gy related indices were statistically significant similarly the mean effect sizes of pm between subgroups significantly differed when there were no overlaps in the 95 cis between subgroups in order to facilitate interpretation the percent change was computed as exp ln r 1 100 the results of meta analysis may be strongly affected by publication bias because studies with statistically significant results are more likely to be published luo et al 2018 rosenberg 2005 begg and mazumdar rank correlation test was conducted to judge whether publication bias existed begg and mazumdar 1994 in addition we calculated rosenthal s fail safe number rosenthal 1979 the results were considered robust despite the possibility for publication bias when their rosenthal s fail safe numbers were greater than 5 n 10 where n is the sample size of effect sizes rosenberg 2005 2 3 statistical analysis the frequency distributions of the effect sizes of pm on gy and gy related indices were fitted by a gaussian normal distribution function to test their normality yu et al 2020 correlation analysis was used to understand which of the changes of gy related indices caused increased gy under pm relative to nm regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships of gy i with map and mat the relationships of gy with map and mat under pm and nm were also tested by regression analysis according to the classification schemes for the gy i database table 1 we classified the gy p database into different subgroups the significant differences between subgroups for gy p were evaluated with a kruskal wallis one way anova at the 0 05 probability level these analyses were conducted using spss 23 0 ibm spss statistics usa 3 results 3 1 overview of the database and analysis of publication bias data used in the meta analysis are summarized in tables a 1 a 2 and a 3 in total there were 3337 records about climate soil properties and field management practices and 1339 pm to nm comparisons about maize gy and gy related indices in the collected 83 studies all but krn varied greatly with coefficients of variation cvs of 10 09 160 49 and the magnitudes of variations were moderate or strong according to the classification of weak cv 10 moderate 10 cv 100 and strong cv 100 jia and shao 2014 begg and mazumdar rank correlation tests showed that publication bias occurred for the mean effect sizes of pm on gy under mid temperate and warm temperate climates sap of 20 28 mg kg 1 nfr of 220 280 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 abh kne and hkw table a 4 however all rosenthal s fail safe numbers were far beyond their respective thresholds of 5 n 10 table a 4 which indicates the results calculated by meta analysis are robust as a result we did not consider publication bias to be a problem in this meta analysis 3 2 overall effects of pm on grain yield and its related indices the effect sizes of pm on maize gy and gy related indices all followed a normal distribution in frequency table 2 overall maize gy significantly increased by 56 10 from 7345 kg ha 1 under nm to 10 512 kg ha 1 under pm over the loess plateau tables 2 a 2 and a 3 abh and hi under pm were significantly higher by 49 96 and 12 57 on average respectively than under nm table 2 besides it was found that increased abh and hi caused by pm both showed significant and positive correlations with gy i table 3 with gy components pm significantly increased ensm knr kne and hkw by 13 47 10 82 18 76 and 24 10 overall respectively table 2 however krn under nm basically matched that under pm table 2 correlation analyses demonstrated that there were significant and positive correlations between the pm induced increases in ensm knr kne and hkw and gy i table 3 kne is equal to the product of krn and knr in theory yu 2013 whereas increased kne under pm was significantly and positively correlated with only the knr increase table 3 3 3 interactions between climate and pm on grain yield both map and mat significantly affected gy i figs 2b and 3 b gy i linearly decreased at mean rates of 0 70 mm 1 and 20 59 c 1 with increasing map and mat respectively and approached zero at map of 627 6 mm and mat of 13 1 c figs 2a and 3 a categorical meta analysis showed that in semi arid dry semi humid and semi humid regions pm significantly increased gy by 132 36 40 80 and 16 33 respectively as compared with nm fig 2b moreover gy i significantly differed among these three subgroups fig 2b in mid temperate regions a gy i of 107 09 was observed which was significantly higher than that of 39 71 in warm temperate regions fig 3b 3 4 interactions between soil properties and pm on grain yield among the five soil properties considered here gy i was significantly affected by only sbd fig 4 increasing sbd tended to reduce gy i fig 4e gy was significantly higher by 78 57 57 29 and 32 41 under pm than under nm when sbd was 1 14 g cm 3 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 and 1 30 g cm 3 respectively fig 4e however the gy i at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 showed no significant difference from that at sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 fig 4e soc stn sap and sak had no statistically significant effects on gy p which was about 10 500 kg ha 1 in each subgroup on average whereas sbd significantly affected it fig 5 as sbd increased gy p changed in a low to high to low trend fig 5e the maximum gy p was achieved at sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 10 867 kg ha 1 which was significantly higher than the gy p at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 9428 kg ha 1 and 1 30 g cm 3 9457 kg ha 1 fig 5e 3 5 interactions between field management practices and pm on grain yield except for kfr the field management practices considered here pd nfr and pfr all significantly affected gy i fig 6 gy i was the highest and lowest at pd of 56 000 plants ha 1 71 48 and 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 39 17 respectively and a significant difference among them was observed fig 6a however there was the same gy i of about 52 for pd of 56 000 64 000 plants ha 1 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 and 80 000 plants ha 1 fig 6a the maximum gy i occurred when nfr was 100 kg n ha 1 60 43 followed by 220 280 kg n ha 1 58 26 100 160 kg n ha 1 56 69 160 220 kg n ha 1 52 38 and 280 kg n ha 1 28 56 fig 6b moreover there were significant differences between at nfr of 280 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg n ha 1 100 160 kg n ha 1 and 220 280 kg n ha 1 for gy i fig 6b at pfr of 45 kg p2o5 ha 1 45 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 the gy i was 61 09 68 07 59 15 41 85 and 33 02 respectively fig 6c besides it was found that the gy i at pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 significantly differed from that at pfr of 45 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 fig 6c gy p significantly varied with pd nfr and pfr but not kfr fig 7 as pd increased gy p increased at first and then decreased peaking when pd was 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 12 799 kg ha 1 fig 7a however the maximum gy p showed no significant differences from the gy p at pd of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 12 367 kg ha 1 and 80 000 plants ha 1 11 544 kg ha 1 fig 7a a significant increase from 7170 kg ha 1 to 10 610 kg ha 1 was observed for gy p when nfr was from 100 kg n ha 1 to 160 220 kg n ha 1 fig 7b however the gy p remained the same of about 11 000 kg ha 1 at nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 220 280 kg n ha 1 and 280 kg n ha 1 fig 7b similarly gy p changed from increasing to constant with increasing pfr fig 7c the maximum gy p of 12 380 kg ha 1 achieved at pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 was significantly higher than the gy p at pfr of 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 7645 10 298 kg ha 1 but similar to the gy p at pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 11 738 kg ha 1 fig 7c 4 discussion 4 1 pm increased grain yield because of the differences in climate soil properties field managements and so on there was a strong variation in gy i with cv of 156 85 fig a 1a among our database about 1 of samples demonstrated that pm reduced gy by 7 55 on average as compared with nm fig a 1a this phenomenon may be because pm significantly accelerates the growth and development of maize which results in maize flowering and silking under conditions of water shortage caused by summer drought happening occasionally in the loess plateau hai 2011 wang et al 2016b zhang et al 2008 however approximately 99 of samples were observed to be greater than zero for gy i and its maximum reached up to 1043 66 fig a 1a as a result pm application over the loess plateau usually has a positive effect on maize gy which is consistent with the results reported by other meta analyses ma et al 2018 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017b in addition to increasing the productivity of dryland farming systems reducing its variability is another major objective of development parr et al 1990 it was found in our study that compared with nm pm decreased the sample to sample variation in gy by 40 09 tables a 2 and a 3 indicting maize production is less variable under pm than under nm spearman correlation coefficients as shown in table 3 suggest that increased maize gy due to pm is a result of increased abh and hi and it can also be attributed to increased ensm knr and hkw similar results were found by jia et al 2018 wang et al 2016b 2018a and zhang 2016 as well who concluded that in comparison with nm the great improvements in leaf photosynthesis ear and kernel numbers translocation of assimilates from vegetative to reproductive organs and grain filling lead to a higher maize production under pm however krn was not significantly affected by pm table 2 perhaps because krn an ear trait with high heritability has low sensitivity to the changes of field environment dhillon and singh 1977 li et al 2011 4 2 response of grain yield to pm varied with climate drought and low temperature are recognized as the two main factors that suppress maize production over the loess plateau bu et al 2013 liu et al 2009a mo et al 2018 in part of this region nm cannot produce any maize gy due to the limitations of precipitation and accumulated temperature he and zhou 2012 sun 2016 however pm significantly reduces soil water loss by evaporation and improves soil heat retention thereby having the potential to extend maize cultivation to some drier and colder areas zhang et al 2018a zhang 1995 based on the relationships of the gy under nm and pm with map and mat extrapolations showed that at map of 203 8 281 3 mm and mat of 3 3 4 6 c pm could produce maize gy of about 1866 kg ha 1 on average whereas there was zero maize production under nm figs 8 and 9 previous findings consistently demonstrated that the wetter and warmer local hydrothermal conditions the less is the positive effect of pm on maize gy han et al 2014 he et al 2018 wang et al 2016b ye and liu 2012 yu et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a our study also found that increasing map and mat both reduced maize gy i figs 2 and 3 as a result pm should be preferentially applied in more hydrothermally limited areas e g semi arid and mid temperate areas of the loess plateau in respect to the thresholds of map and mat where no increasing in maize gy occurs under pm the present study differs somewhat from previous studies our results showed that gy i approached zero when map and mat were 627 6 mm and 13 1 c respectively figs 2a and 3 a however zhang et al 2018a concluded that pm is likely not effective in increasing maize production at map exceeding 600 mm and mat exceeding 9 c based on the denitrification decomposition dndc model simulations han et al 2014 also used the dndc model to conduct a regional simulation in shaanxi province of china which suggested that almost no gy benefit of pm over nm is achieved when map is greater than 700 mm the reasons causing the above mentioned differences among the present and these previous studies may be the differences in research method and data source considering that the same crop parameters and field managements were used in the dndc model simulations for all regions which is not the case the results based on meta analysis may be more realistic for pm application in the loess plateau than those based on model simulations 4 3 response of grain yield to pm varied with soil properties soil fertility is vital for agricultural productivity yageta et al 2019 however gy i and gy p were both not significantly related to soc stn sap and sak in our study figs 4a d and 5 a d which is in agreement with the findings of yu et al 2018 on one hand sak is not a limiting factor for maize production because of its high contents over the loess plateau wu et al 2013 on the other hand high inputs of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers dilute the effects of soc stn and sap on the productivity of pm systems as recommended by wu et al 2015 in order to attain dryland maize gy of 6800 10 500 kg ha 1 in the loess plateau nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers must be applied at 135 210 kg n ha 1 and 68 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 respectively regardless of the variation in regional soil fertility in the present study average nfr and pfr were about 220 kg n ha 1 and 100 kg p2o5 ha 1 in each soc stn and sap subgroups respectively and maize gy under nm and pm of about 7300 kg ha 1 and 10 500 kg ha 1 were achieved on average respectively data not shown therefore no matter how soc stn and sap vary the external applications of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers can support the current level of maize gy especially under nm with greater sbd less soil water is evaporated geng and dai 2011 thus as sbd increases the role in reducing soil evaporation by pm decreases which may result in a decreasing trend for gy i especially the gy i at sbd of 1 30 g cm 3 that was significantly lower than that at sbd of 1 14 g cm 3 and 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 fig 4e there was an inverted u shaped relationship between gy p and sbd in our study fig 5e possibly because of 1 weak root systems and high soil water loss by evaporation when soil is too loose sbd 1 14 g cm 3 and 2 shallow root systems and poor soil aeration and water permeability when soil is too tight sbd 1 30 g cm 3 geng and dai 2011 these results suggest an sbd range of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 for pm application in the loess plateau 4 4 response of grain yield to pm varied with field management practices adjusting the population density of plants is a widely used agronomic practice to improve maize production worldwide testa et al 2016 as reported by other studies li et al 2018b ren et al 2017 zhang et al 2018b the pm induced advantages e g the wetter and warmer root zone soil can support a higher pd to increase maize gy in water and heat limited regions such as the loess plateau as a result the maximum gy occurs with lower pd under nm than under pm which may contribute to the result that gy i decreased at first and then increased with increasing pd fig 6a many previous studies have demonstrated that gy has an inverted u shaped relationship with pd li et al 2018b sangoi et al 2002 tokatlidis and koutroubas 2004 as was the case with our study fig 7a the gy p at pd of 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 and 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 was obviously higher than that in other subgroups fig 7a but the minimum gy i was observed at pd of 64 000 72 000 plants ha 1 fig 6a therefore we suggest that a pd range of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 be adopted for maximizing the pm productivity in the loess plateau improved soil hydrothermal environments under pm not only increase soil microbial quantity and enzymatic activity but also result in a shift in the composition of the soil microbial community thereby stimulating soc mineralization li et al 2004 liu et al 2014b steinmetz et al 2016 wang et al 2016a besides some published studies suggested that compared with nm pm can effectively reduce nitrogen leaching haraguchi et al 2004 jiang et al 2018 liu et al 2017a 2017b ruidisch et al 2013 thus high contents of available nutrients are observed in soil profile under pm especially in topsoil generally crop nutrient requirements come mostly from the soil reserves and external fertilizer applications chuan et al 2013 gianquinto et al 2013 the less external fertilizer applications in croplands the greater is the dependence of crop production on the inherent capacity of soil to supply nutrients wang et al 2018b therefore the pm induced increase in soil nutrient availability plays a greater role in improving crop production at low fertilizer inputs than at high fertilizer inputs fan et al 2005 li et al 2018a similarly our meta analysis showed rough decreasing trends for gy i as nfr and pfr increased and the gy i at nfr of 280 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 was obviously lower than that in other subgroups fig 6b and c with regard to gy p it significantly increased with increasing nfr and pfr at first and then it basically remained unchanged when nfr and pfr exceeded 160 kg n ha 1 and 105 kg p2o5 ha 1 respectively fig 7b and c which is comparable with other studies over this region bu et al 2014 wang et al 2018c given both the gy i and gy p responses to nfr and pfr it may be advisable to adopt pm at nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 for dryland maize in the loess plateau due to the high soil indigenous potassium supply for maize growth and development over the loess plateau wu et al 2013 2015 the effects of kfr on gy i and gy p were not significant figs 6d and 7 d therefore maize production has low sensitivity to potassium fertilizer application in this region 4 5 study limitations and future perspectives abundant information has showed that there are interactive effects of climate soil properties and field management practices on maize production for instance water availability greatly affects the gy pd relationship friedman 2016 and tokatlidis et al 2011 concluded that the optimum pd under drought prone conditions is much lower than that under favorable conditions for maize hybrids indicating that the optimum pd differs in different climate regions however if our database had been separated into different subgroups based on pd under a certain map range e g semi arid regions with mat 450 mm some subgroups would have small sample sizes which may lead to some misleading results calculated by meta analysis yu et al 2018 similarly the above mentioned problems would occur when other interactive effects had been studied therefore the present study only evaluated the effects of a single factor on gy i and gy p thereby identifying the climate thresholds and optimum conditions for pm application in the loess plateau on the other hand in addition to the factors considered here additional factors may also influence the response of maize gy to pm such as climate change chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a and variety wang et al 2018a so their critical or optimum conditions for pm application also need to be determined however our work did not involve these studies because of the limitation of data availability although pm significantly increased maize production as compared with nm table 2 it induces a series of environmental issues that should be given more attentions in future studies firstly agriculture is a key contributor to the anthropogenic emissions of co2 ch4 and n2o worldwide ciais et al 2013 pm has the potential to favor greenhouse gas emissions due to the improvements in soil microbial quantity and enzymatic activity and the shift in the composition of the soil microbial community chen et al 2017 cuello et al 2015 he et al 2018 steinmetz et al 2016 especially under future climate change chen et al 2019 secondly as discussed by previous studies he et al 2018 li et al 2016a 2017 steinmetz et al 2016 xie et al 2018 zhang et al 2011 2017a increased crop gys under pm may be at the expense of the degradation of the soil resources among our collected data not included in the database of this study approximately 39 and 57 of samples showed the decreases in soil water storage and soc at harvest respectively under pm compared with nm fig a 1b and c thirdly plastic mulch films consist mostly of low density and linear low density polyethylene which do not readily biodegrade sintim and flury 2017 as a result these polyethylene based mulches must be retrieved and disposed after usage however the incomplete removal of plastic mulches which causes an accumulation of plastic residue year by year in soil and the unreasonable disposal options for the plastic mulches retrieved from fields e g amassing burning and landfilling both produce plenty of adverse impacts on the agricultural environment he et al 2018 liu et al 2014a sintim and flury 2017 biodegradable plastic mulching may be a solution to agriculture s plastic problem because it can be directly tilled into the soil after use and degraded by the action of soil organisms kasirajan and ngouajio 2012 sintim and flury 2017 however there are some problems requiring further identification in our opinion 1 are agronomic benefits of biodegradable plastic mulching the same as those of polyethylene mulching 2 given the expensive price of biodegradable plastic can its mulching increase farmers economic return 3 does biodegradable plastic degrade completely in soil and 4 does biodegradable plastic mulching affect soil health 5 conclusions overall adoption of plastic film mulching pm significantly increased maize grain yield gy in the loess plateau of china and specifically this increasing effect was more remarkable in more hydrothermally limited areas but small or even negative in areas that were not so hydrothermally limited besides pm had the potential to extend maize cultivation to some drier and colder areas where no gy was achieved under no mulching maize gy and gy increase under pm both significantly varied with soil bulk density sbd plant density pd nitrogen fertilizer rate nfr and phosphorus fertilizer rate pfr but not soil organic carbon soil total nitrogen soil available phosphorus soil available potassium and potassium fertilizer rate it may be advisable to adopt pm under sbd of 1 14 1 30 g cm 3 pd of 72 000 80 000 plants ha 1 nfr of 160 220 kg n ha 1 and pfr of 105 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 in order to investigate the effects of factors not considered in this study and the interactive effects of factors on the response of maize gy to pm more relevant experimental data should be collected in future studies in addition future studies should put more emphases on the environmental costs of pm such as greenhouse gas emissions increased soil resource depletion and white

10524,water and soil resource are fundamental natural resources and one of the determinant factors of the ecological environment soil erosion not only affects economic development but also triggers the occurrence of natural disasters that threaten people s property and lives therefore it is necessary to take various and effective measures and technologies to protect water and soil resources to promote rapid and stable economic development and to protect people s livelihood this paper explores the impact of related policies on soil and water conservation in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development and analyzes the effects of investment in soil and water conservation and construction on agricultural production in 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 the empirical results show that the performance of soil and water conservation construction in zhejiang over the years fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 and the overall efficiency value and productivity changes began to decline after the year of 2015 secondly mixed cross sectional data analysis and panel data analysis showed that the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on the agricultural outputs log output1 in each city keywords soil and water resource conservation agricultural production production performance 1 introduction water and soil are fundamental natural resources and one of the determinant factors of the ecological environment at the same time they are also strategic resources according to tang 2004 soil erosion refers to the degradation and loss of resources such as water soil and land productivity under the effects of external forces such as water power wind power and gravity as it covers a broad range of losses various natural factors such as rugged landforms steep peaks and ditches uneven distribution of precipitation loose topsoil and sparse vegetation can all be considered as causes of soil erosion in addition human activities such as deforestation land reclamation overgrazing and vegetation destruction are regarded as economic factors that may trigger soil erosion soil erosion can harm the productivity of agriculture by destructing land resources firstly soil erosion can seriously degrade the quality of land resources and surface integrity under the effect of water runoff the surface of land can be fragmented and full of gullies which in turn leads to a sharp decline in the area of cultivated land resources and thereafter a dramatic decrease in crop yields this would seriously threaten the food supply for the residents secondly soil erosion can reduce agricultural productivity by hindering the formation and stability of soil fertility this would result in reduction in soil permeability and reduction in the capacity of water storage which may trigger a higher probability of land consolidation thirdly soil erosion may lead to imbalanced distribution of water resources in detail losses in soil and water resources would induce land desertification grassland degradation and damage of ecological environment which would seriously hinder vegetation restoration and thereafter affect the redistribution of water resources in addition soil erosion may alter the structure of the soil dry the places with fast drainage and flood the place with slow drainage geographically china is a country with mountainous terrains therefore both natural and artificial factors can harm water and soil resources and bring a certain degree of damage to the mountains and residential areas nearby in addition china has a large population and therefore also an extensive demand for various resources under the pressure of survival china used to conduct large scale reclamations by turning steep mountains and forest into farmland causing serious damage to the ecosystem even worse it had also carried out deforestation and exposed the land surface leading to serious loss of soil and water resources at present the acceleration of the urbanization process increases the amount of different construction projects such as building factories roads and mining these projects have also disrupted the stability of the land and may induce geological disasters such as landslides soil erosion not only limits economic development but also threatens people s lives and property by increasing the occurrence of natural disasters therefore it is necessary to take effective measures to protect water and soil resources to promote the rapid and stable development of economy and protect residents safety to summarize the development of soil and water conservation technology enables the effective control of soil erosion under the needs of developing ecological civilization it is necessary to follow the laws of nature and adhere to the principle of combining ecological economic and social benefits and the principle of combining engineering technology biotechnology and farming technology to form a comprehensive protecting system to prevent losses of water and land resources in this way water and land resources can play the important role of improving ecological environment and lay as the foundation for sustainable development the main aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of soil and water conservation policies in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development considering the completeness of available data and regional differences most of the existing chinese literatures focused on specific regions and watersheds as china has a vast territory there are dramatic differences in economic activities across different regions thus relevant statistics and data from different regions also vary greatly from each other in terms of the topics and units included in these data this makes it difficult to discuss the impact of soil and water conservation policies at a national level therefore the present study focused on eleven cities in zhejiang province and used data from zhejiang natural resources and statistical yearbook on environment which is published annually by china statistics press we investigated the impact of water and soil conservation investments on the agricultural production in all the eleven cities between the year of 2007 and 2016 stochastic frontier analysis was used to analyze the impact of investment in projects such as environmental infrastructure construction and water and soil disaster prevention on the increase of farmland in urban areas furthermore the impacts of water and soil conservation on agricultural outputs and the agricultural returns of the local farmers were discussed to quantify the impact of promoting soil and water conservation in china on the development of the overall industry 2 literature review some studies discuss the complementarity of environmental water and soil protection and economic development from the perspective of agricultural activities and mutual assistance in landscapes such results are relatively easy to carry out in other industries such as manufacturing however with the development of the national economy the final contribution of agricultural activities to the economic output value will show a downward trend how to achieve common prosperity in the economic environment is indeed an important issue wade et al 2008 bauer et al 2009 waltert and schl√§pfer 2010 ortolani et al 2010 van oudenhoven ape and alkemade 2012 soil and water conservation technologies serve the management of soil erosion and are constrained by social ecological and economic factors related research indicated that the application rate of soil and water conservation technologies was generally low in various countries de graaff et al 2008 jara rojas et al 2013 the application of soil and water conservation technologies is determined by natural economic and social factors in local areas several important factors include farmers awareness and attitudes on soil and water conservation de graaff et al 2008 economic benefits and risks of soil and water conservation technologies morris et al 2010 oostendorp and zaal 2012 natural economic and social conditions in local areas bewket 2007 wang et al 2010 udfatakumara et al 2012 and soil and water conservation services and supporting policies provided by governments jara rojas et al 2013 udfatakumara et al 2012 among all the factors the strategic positioning of the region proposed by the national government and the needs of regional economic development played an important and driving role in the selection of soil and water conservation technologies dai 2014 in other studies environmental protection was found to have an impact on the development and use of agricultural landscapes in the past sixty years the agricultural environment in the united states and europe has changed dramatically stoate 2001 jongman 2002 klijn 2004 tscharntke et al 2005 after the second world war the large scale application and mechanization of synthetic fertilizers substantially improved the soils that used to be poor and unstable several european countries further increased their yields through land integration policies which in turn had greatly changed the landscape structure and composition in these countries klijn 2004 during the same period the european common agricultural policy cap aimed to make the rate of agricultural self sufficiency a major incentive for agricultural intensification in the uk agricultural intensification has dramatically increased crop yields as the wheat production increased three times at the same time as a result of land consolidation and conversion to farmland around 97 of the enclosed grassland disappeared between 1930 and 1984 estimated by uk national ecosystem assessment 2011 due to the large regional differences in the natural environment and the social and cultural contexts as well as differences in farming history and institutional settings in some pre socialist and post socialist countries land restructuring has led to a large scale agricultural decentralization while farms in western europe have continued to grow unfortunately these have led to a substantial decline in agricultural profitability and eventually resulted in the abandonment of farmland in western and eastern europe e g kuemmerle et al 2008 verburg et al 2009 renwick et al 2013 from the perspective of economic development economic development will inevitably have a negative impact on the environment however if economic activities are not carried out it will also affect the operation of the economy how to balance the economic environmental and related levels has become one of the important issues of national development chou et al 2019 the main aim of the agricultural sector is to produce and provide services that is agricultural products and raw materials the maintaining of the sustainability of agricultural production however requires the development of soil and water conservation yet it is widely believed that agricultural landscapes also provide cultural recreational regulatory and supporting services gobster et al 2007 power 2010 de groot et al 2010 some services are unintended from agricultural activities that is most agricultural managements are not intended to maintain non supply production services many of these unintentional services support the provision of the commodity such as achieving high agricultural production levels by regulating nutrient cycling or providing habitat for pollinators although cultural services do not support agricultural production it brings aesthetic benefits such as attracting tourism and providing spiritual experiences and entertainment therefore cultural services can also increase regional income through for example developing the entertainment and tourism sector teeb 2010a all components which are part of the agricultural landscape and the spatial structure of the landscape are important determinants of the services provided by these landscapes although people increasingly recognize the importance of providing a wide range of ecosystem services especially in suburban areas zasada 2011 the centralized agricultural management usually focuses on the optimization of commodity supply services which often leads to a loss in non supply services agricultural policies and regional development incentives are shifting to support broader ecosystem services for agricultural management aiming at maintenance prager et al 2012 rey benayas and bullock 2012 to support influential agricultural design and planning of agricultural landscapes and agricultural management practices knowledge about the value of agricultural landscapes in providing services is required while ecosystem focused services have grown strongly over the past few years most attention has been paid to semi natural ecosystems e g costanza et al 1997 de groot 2002 and agricultural landscapes are often overlooked extensive knowledge of ecosystem service stabilization measures as well as current policy support for supply is moving towards improving landscape management these knowledge in particular may provide insights for the indirect effects of social value added production possible transactions and landscape management on providing landscape possibilities 3 model specification and data source 3 1 methods the present study aims to investigate the impact of investment in soil and water disaster prevention projects on newly increased urban farmland we further explore the effect of soil and water conservation construction performance on the agricultural output and agricultural returns of local farmers to quantify the impact of soil and water conservation construction in china on promoting the development of the overall industry in developing an empirical model the concept of production efficiency analysis is used data analysis consists of two parts first the stochastic frontier analysis is applied to assess the efficiency values produced by investment in soil and water conservation construction in 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 s the efficiency value is used as an explanatory variable to discuss its impact on the disposable income of farmers the increase of agricultural production and the increase of farmers returns previous literatures applying parametric and non parametric methods to estimate production efficiency can be roughly divided into four groups first one of the first approaches being used is the stochastic frontier approach sfa proposed by aigner et al 1977 and meeusen and van den broeck 1977 and the data development analysis dea developed by charnes et al 1978 more recently the thick frontier approach tfa proposed by berger and humphrey 1991 and the distribution free approach dfa proposed by berger et al 1993 were often used early studies furtherly consider the production behavior such as fixed input kopp and diewert 1982 pan et al 2009 this part of research points out that whether the factor input is fixed in the economic concept will have an impact on its production behavior and efficiency in other words if the producer is faced with the problem of fixed input factors his production performance or efficiency will be more difficult than if the input factors can be adjusted at will the stochastic frontier function model was developed in combination with the production theory in economics that the function of production can be defined as the maximum output under a given amount of input factors this model was discussed and developed by previous literatures such as pitt and lee 1981 battese and coelli 1992 1995 and was extended to an empirical approach to discuss cross sectional frontier data and to apply panel data analysis the advantage of this method is that based on the empirical estimation statistical significance tests can be performed the model is set as follows 1 l n y i x i b v i u i among them y and x respectively represents the output and input of producers or other factors that may affect the output v i refers to random factors that are uncontrollable u i refers to the part that the manufacturer or decision makers can control but fail to achieve efficiency these two factors are mutually independent under this setting the output value is set to be higher than the random variable e x p x i b v i the random variable can be either positive or negative and the output model changes as e x p x i b changes in empirical estimation the stochastic frontier is calculated by statistical approximation like function estimation and the equation for estimation is defined as ln y i Œ≤ x i v i u i i 1 i 2 v i n 0 œÉ v 2 u i n 0 œÉ u 2 f u 2 2 œÄ œÉ u e x p u 2 2 œÉ u 2 u 0 as mentioned above in eq 2 vi is an identically distributed normal random variable measuring technology inefficiency and it is statistically independent the mean value is 0 and the variance is œÉ v 2 the characteristic ui is a random variable following the semi normality distribution with a variance of œÉ u 2 according to the parametric maximum likelihood estimation proposed by aigner et al 1977 the semi normal distribution of maximum likelihood function is taken as a logarithmic form as in eq 3 3 l n l y Œ≤ œÉ Œª 1 2 l n œÄ œÉ 2 2 i 1 i l n œÜ y i Œ≤ x i œÉ 1 2 œÉ 2 i 1 i y i Œ≤ x i 2 in eq 3 œÉ 2 œÉ v 2 œÉ u 2 Œª 2 œÉ u 2 œÉ v 2 0 y is a vector of dependent variables œÜ x follows standard normal distribution and is a cumulative distribution function evaluated at the random variable x Œª 2 reflects the variance of the producing efficiency of the sample and a higher value of Œª 2 is associated with a larger variance in the process of estimation the present study also includes the malmquist productivity index to investigate the impact of investment in soil and water conservation construction on the productivity of newly increased agricultural land the malmquist productivity index mpi is used to measure the total factor productivity in different periods this index can assess the stability of the efficiency of each unit and can meanwhile observe the developing trend of the efficiency of each unit the model is set in eq 4 4 œÜ d i p x p y p g i q x p y p d i p x q y q g i q x q y q 1 2 the first term on the right side of eq 4 is the frontier shift effects of efficiency and the second term is innovation effects which reflect the changes of the boundary efficiency between two periods from period p to q when the index is greater than 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from period p to q is increasing when the index is equal to 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from period p to q stays constant when the index is less than 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from the p period to q period appears to decline 3 2 data source since china s reform and opening up in 1978 the economic development of china s coastal provinces has gradually become the main force of china s economic activities and zhejiang province has become one of the main development areas however although china s economic activity has improved the regional economic differences have also been different year after year among them the definition of statistical data is to show the difference between regions under such a background it is difficult to conduct a national soil and water conservation analysis therefore this article focuses on the research object in zhejiang province and explores the impact of water and soil conservation policies the present study accesses data from zhejiang natural resources and statistical yearbook on environment published by china statistics press we summarized investments in water and soil conservation in 11 cities including hangzhou ningbo wenzhou taizhou shaoxing lishui zhoushan jinhua jiaxing huzhou and quzhou from the year of 2007 to 2016 in terms of the studied variables we included the number of employment in water conservation the investment in infrastructure construction the investment in preventing water and soil disasters in each city as input variables and took the annual increase in the area of farmland with soil erosion management in each city as an output variable based on these variables the present study conducted a performance evaluation about the water and soil conservation construction of the governments and a total factor productivity analysis in the analysis we estimated the efficiency value and changes in productivity based on eqs 3 and 4 table 1 summarizes the definition and descriptive statistics of all the studied variables 4 empirical results first table 2 presents the correlation coefficients of the input and output variables it can be seen that there were weak correlations between the input and output variables these results show that the correlations between the main variables were not strong indicating that in the later regression analysis the problem of multicollinearity can be avoided table 3 presents results from the analysis applying eq 3 in the model estimation translog production function was used when including input variables the influences of input variables on each other as well as the interaction effect between input variables were considered secondly based on eqs 3 and 4 fig 1 summarizes the changes in performance and productivity of soil and water conservation construction conducted by zhejiang provincial government between 2007 and 2016 it can be seen from fig 1 that as time goes by the changes of efficiency and the changes of productivity in general follow a similar trajectory among them a value of malmquist production index curve higher than one indicates that the total factor productivity of the city in the current year has increased compared to last year from the figure it can be seen that between the year of 2009 2012 and 2015 in general the positive effect of water and soil conservation construction in zhejiang on increasing farmland grew stronger whereas this effect showed a decrease since 2015 as the latest published data do not cover data after the year of 2017 future research is needed to discuss and explore the reasons of this decrease in addition suggested by the technical efficiency curve in fig 1 most of the efficiency value of governments investment on water and soil conservation fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 and there was a trend of decreasing after 2015 the range of the efficiency value indicates that in general the efficiency of environmental protection needs to be improved generally speaking the management of soil erosion can firstly enable the better development of the water conservancy industry as the surface vegetation can be increased surface runoff can be reduced and agricultural production conditions can be improved secondly it can improve the ability of water conservancy and disaster prevention which would lay as a foundation for forming a virtuous circle of ecological environment development and the realization of sustainable development of society and economy the present study further analyzes the effect of soil and water conservation construction performance on the agricultural production and agricultural returns of local farmers to this end the logarithm of agricultural in each city log output1 the logarithm of the increase of farmers income in each city log output2 and the logarithm of the disposable income of farmers in each city log output3 were included as dependent variables table 4 presents results of the influence of water and soil conservation construction performance on these dependent variables it can be found from the results that given the influence of regions and time the performance of water and soil conservation construction had a significantly positive effect on the agricultural production of each city log output1 whereas the performance had a negative effect on farmers disposable income two plausible reasons might account for these results first the well planned and systematic measures for environmental protection in each city can effectively increase the amount of farmland available which in turn would improve the amount of agricultural production and bring positive effect on food supply however what comes along environmental protection is the internalizing or transferring of external costs or production costs on farmers such as costs of environmental pollution water and soil conservation and agricultural production the increase of production activity would increase the costs for environmental maintenance which would in turn affect labor compensation the results of estimation showed two types of pull one is the positive impact of urban environmental maintenance on economic output and the other is the negative impact of transferring of external costs of environmental protection to producers therefore in order to achieve sustainable soil and water conservation careful and serious considerations about trade offs between economic and environmental benefits are required in current and future china table 4 shows results of an analysis with mixed cross sectional data whereas fixed effects and time in variant effects were not considered in the estimation therefore the present study further used panel data analysis to investigate fixed effects in the analysis as the variable technical efficiency in table 4 was estimated from mixed cross sectional data the value was the ranking of performance assuming that the technology stayed invariant across different periods to further analysis the changes of productivity across periods in panel data analysis we instead used malmquist production index as an independent variable this variable is used to measure the impact of investment in soil and water conservation construction on the productivity of newly increased farmland and the impacts on agricultural production and on the agricultural returns and disposable income of local farmers the model for panel data analysis is developed as follows the model with individual specific effects is 5 y i t m a t e i t Œ≤ z i Œ¥ u i Œµ i t among which z i is individual characteristics that are time invariant m a t e i t is malmquist production index and in eq 5 it represents individuals that are time varing u i and Œµ i t are the composite error term in addition u i represents the intercept of individual heterogeneity in fixed effect model fe the two side of eq 5 can both be divided by the average time and thus we get 6 y i m a t e i Œ≤ z i Œ¥ u i Œµ i subtract eq 1 with the mean values and we can get mean differencing or time demeaning 7 y i t y i m a t e i t m a t e i Œ≤ Œµ i t Œµ i define y i t y i t y i m a t e i t m a t e i t m a t e i Œµ i t Œµ i t Œµ i so that 8 y i t m a t e i t Œ≤ Œµ i t in eq 8 u i was already excluded suppose that Œµ i t is not correlated with m a t e i t the ordinary least square can be used consistently to estimate fixed effect estimator Œ≤ ÀÜ f e table 5 shows empirical results based on eq 8 it can be found that when controlling for the effects of region and time the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on agricultural output log output1 in each city this result is consistent with results presented in table 4 however the influence on agricultural return and disposable income was not significant comparing tables 4 and 5 we can see that investments in soil and water conservation human resources and disaster prevention had a significantly positive impact on the amount of farmland in zhejiang china whereas their effects on farmers income were not significant in addition comparing the percentages of variance explained by the models it can be found that the model presented in table 5 with panel analysis performed better in explaining variances than the model presented in table 4 5 conclusion this article explores the impact of soil and water conservation policies in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development based on data from the zhejiang natural resources and environment statistical yearbook the present study uses the stochastic frontier approach and the malmquist production index to investigate the soil and water conservation of 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 and the effect of investment in soil and water conservation on agricultural production in the cities the empirical results show that the performance of soil and water conservation construction in zhejiang over the years fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 the overall efficiency value and changes in productivity began to decline after 2015 secondly using mixed cross sectional data analysis and panel data analysis we found that the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on

10524,water and soil resource are fundamental natural resources and one of the determinant factors of the ecological environment soil erosion not only affects economic development but also triggers the occurrence of natural disasters that threaten people s property and lives therefore it is necessary to take various and effective measures and technologies to protect water and soil resources to promote rapid and stable economic development and to protect people s livelihood this paper explores the impact of related policies on soil and water conservation in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development and analyzes the effects of investment in soil and water conservation and construction on agricultural production in 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 the empirical results show that the performance of soil and water conservation construction in zhejiang over the years fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 and the overall efficiency value and productivity changes began to decline after the year of 2015 secondly mixed cross sectional data analysis and panel data analysis showed that the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on the agricultural outputs log output1 in each city keywords soil and water resource conservation agricultural production production performance 1 introduction water and soil are fundamental natural resources and one of the determinant factors of the ecological environment at the same time they are also strategic resources according to tang 2004 soil erosion refers to the degradation and loss of resources such as water soil and land productivity under the effects of external forces such as water power wind power and gravity as it covers a broad range of losses various natural factors such as rugged landforms steep peaks and ditches uneven distribution of precipitation loose topsoil and sparse vegetation can all be considered as causes of soil erosion in addition human activities such as deforestation land reclamation overgrazing and vegetation destruction are regarded as economic factors that may trigger soil erosion soil erosion can harm the productivity of agriculture by destructing land resources firstly soil erosion can seriously degrade the quality of land resources and surface integrity under the effect of water runoff the surface of land can be fragmented and full of gullies which in turn leads to a sharp decline in the area of cultivated land resources and thereafter a dramatic decrease in crop yields this would seriously threaten the food supply for the residents secondly soil erosion can reduce agricultural productivity by hindering the formation and stability of soil fertility this would result in reduction in soil permeability and reduction in the capacity of water storage which may trigger a higher probability of land consolidation thirdly soil erosion may lead to imbalanced distribution of water resources in detail losses in soil and water resources would induce land desertification grassland degradation and damage of ecological environment which would seriously hinder vegetation restoration and thereafter affect the redistribution of water resources in addition soil erosion may alter the structure of the soil dry the places with fast drainage and flood the place with slow drainage geographically china is a country with mountainous terrains therefore both natural and artificial factors can harm water and soil resources and bring a certain degree of damage to the mountains and residential areas nearby in addition china has a large population and therefore also an extensive demand for various resources under the pressure of survival china used to conduct large scale reclamations by turning steep mountains and forest into farmland causing serious damage to the ecosystem even worse it had also carried out deforestation and exposed the land surface leading to serious loss of soil and water resources at present the acceleration of the urbanization process increases the amount of different construction projects such as building factories roads and mining these projects have also disrupted the stability of the land and may induce geological disasters such as landslides soil erosion not only limits economic development but also threatens people s lives and property by increasing the occurrence of natural disasters therefore it is necessary to take effective measures to protect water and soil resources to promote the rapid and stable development of economy and protect residents safety to summarize the development of soil and water conservation technology enables the effective control of soil erosion under the needs of developing ecological civilization it is necessary to follow the laws of nature and adhere to the principle of combining ecological economic and social benefits and the principle of combining engineering technology biotechnology and farming technology to form a comprehensive protecting system to prevent losses of water and land resources in this way water and land resources can play the important role of improving ecological environment and lay as the foundation for sustainable development the main aim of the present study is to analyze the impact of soil and water conservation policies in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development considering the completeness of available data and regional differences most of the existing chinese literatures focused on specific regions and watersheds as china has a vast territory there are dramatic differences in economic activities across different regions thus relevant statistics and data from different regions also vary greatly from each other in terms of the topics and units included in these data this makes it difficult to discuss the impact of soil and water conservation policies at a national level therefore the present study focused on eleven cities in zhejiang province and used data from zhejiang natural resources and statistical yearbook on environment which is published annually by china statistics press we investigated the impact of water and soil conservation investments on the agricultural production in all the eleven cities between the year of 2007 and 2016 stochastic frontier analysis was used to analyze the impact of investment in projects such as environmental infrastructure construction and water and soil disaster prevention on the increase of farmland in urban areas furthermore the impacts of water and soil conservation on agricultural outputs and the agricultural returns of the local farmers were discussed to quantify the impact of promoting soil and water conservation in china on the development of the overall industry 2 literature review some studies discuss the complementarity of environmental water and soil protection and economic development from the perspective of agricultural activities and mutual assistance in landscapes such results are relatively easy to carry out in other industries such as manufacturing however with the development of the national economy the final contribution of agricultural activities to the economic output value will show a downward trend how to achieve common prosperity in the economic environment is indeed an important issue wade et al 2008 bauer et al 2009 waltert and schl√§pfer 2010 ortolani et al 2010 van oudenhoven ape and alkemade 2012 soil and water conservation technologies serve the management of soil erosion and are constrained by social ecological and economic factors related research indicated that the application rate of soil and water conservation technologies was generally low in various countries de graaff et al 2008 jara rojas et al 2013 the application of soil and water conservation technologies is determined by natural economic and social factors in local areas several important factors include farmers awareness and attitudes on soil and water conservation de graaff et al 2008 economic benefits and risks of soil and water conservation technologies morris et al 2010 oostendorp and zaal 2012 natural economic and social conditions in local areas bewket 2007 wang et al 2010 udfatakumara et al 2012 and soil and water conservation services and supporting policies provided by governments jara rojas et al 2013 udfatakumara et al 2012 among all the factors the strategic positioning of the region proposed by the national government and the needs of regional economic development played an important and driving role in the selection of soil and water conservation technologies dai 2014 in other studies environmental protection was found to have an impact on the development and use of agricultural landscapes in the past sixty years the agricultural environment in the united states and europe has changed dramatically stoate 2001 jongman 2002 klijn 2004 tscharntke et al 2005 after the second world war the large scale application and mechanization of synthetic fertilizers substantially improved the soils that used to be poor and unstable several european countries further increased their yields through land integration policies which in turn had greatly changed the landscape structure and composition in these countries klijn 2004 during the same period the european common agricultural policy cap aimed to make the rate of agricultural self sufficiency a major incentive for agricultural intensification in the uk agricultural intensification has dramatically increased crop yields as the wheat production increased three times at the same time as a result of land consolidation and conversion to farmland around 97 of the enclosed grassland disappeared between 1930 and 1984 estimated by uk national ecosystem assessment 2011 due to the large regional differences in the natural environment and the social and cultural contexts as well as differences in farming history and institutional settings in some pre socialist and post socialist countries land restructuring has led to a large scale agricultural decentralization while farms in western europe have continued to grow unfortunately these have led to a substantial decline in agricultural profitability and eventually resulted in the abandonment of farmland in western and eastern europe e g kuemmerle et al 2008 verburg et al 2009 renwick et al 2013 from the perspective of economic development economic development will inevitably have a negative impact on the environment however if economic activities are not carried out it will also affect the operation of the economy how to balance the economic environmental and related levels has become one of the important issues of national development chou et al 2019 the main aim of the agricultural sector is to produce and provide services that is agricultural products and raw materials the maintaining of the sustainability of agricultural production however requires the development of soil and water conservation yet it is widely believed that agricultural landscapes also provide cultural recreational regulatory and supporting services gobster et al 2007 power 2010 de groot et al 2010 some services are unintended from agricultural activities that is most agricultural managements are not intended to maintain non supply production services many of these unintentional services support the provision of the commodity such as achieving high agricultural production levels by regulating nutrient cycling or providing habitat for pollinators although cultural services do not support agricultural production it brings aesthetic benefits such as attracting tourism and providing spiritual experiences and entertainment therefore cultural services can also increase regional income through for example developing the entertainment and tourism sector teeb 2010a all components which are part of the agricultural landscape and the spatial structure of the landscape are important determinants of the services provided by these landscapes although people increasingly recognize the importance of providing a wide range of ecosystem services especially in suburban areas zasada 2011 the centralized agricultural management usually focuses on the optimization of commodity supply services which often leads to a loss in non supply services agricultural policies and regional development incentives are shifting to support broader ecosystem services for agricultural management aiming at maintenance prager et al 2012 rey benayas and bullock 2012 to support influential agricultural design and planning of agricultural landscapes and agricultural management practices knowledge about the value of agricultural landscapes in providing services is required while ecosystem focused services have grown strongly over the past few years most attention has been paid to semi natural ecosystems e g costanza et al 1997 de groot 2002 and agricultural landscapes are often overlooked extensive knowledge of ecosystem service stabilization measures as well as current policy support for supply is moving towards improving landscape management these knowledge in particular may provide insights for the indirect effects of social value added production possible transactions and landscape management on providing landscape possibilities 3 model specification and data source 3 1 methods the present study aims to investigate the impact of investment in soil and water disaster prevention projects on newly increased urban farmland we further explore the effect of soil and water conservation construction performance on the agricultural output and agricultural returns of local farmers to quantify the impact of soil and water conservation construction in china on promoting the development of the overall industry in developing an empirical model the concept of production efficiency analysis is used data analysis consists of two parts first the stochastic frontier analysis is applied to assess the efficiency values produced by investment in soil and water conservation construction in 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 s the efficiency value is used as an explanatory variable to discuss its impact on the disposable income of farmers the increase of agricultural production and the increase of farmers returns previous literatures applying parametric and non parametric methods to estimate production efficiency can be roughly divided into four groups first one of the first approaches being used is the stochastic frontier approach sfa proposed by aigner et al 1977 and meeusen and van den broeck 1977 and the data development analysis dea developed by charnes et al 1978 more recently the thick frontier approach tfa proposed by berger and humphrey 1991 and the distribution free approach dfa proposed by berger et al 1993 were often used early studies furtherly consider the production behavior such as fixed input kopp and diewert 1982 pan et al 2009 this part of research points out that whether the factor input is fixed in the economic concept will have an impact on its production behavior and efficiency in other words if the producer is faced with the problem of fixed input factors his production performance or efficiency will be more difficult than if the input factors can be adjusted at will the stochastic frontier function model was developed in combination with the production theory in economics that the function of production can be defined as the maximum output under a given amount of input factors this model was discussed and developed by previous literatures such as pitt and lee 1981 battese and coelli 1992 1995 and was extended to an empirical approach to discuss cross sectional frontier data and to apply panel data analysis the advantage of this method is that based on the empirical estimation statistical significance tests can be performed the model is set as follows 1 l n y i x i b v i u i among them y and x respectively represents the output and input of producers or other factors that may affect the output v i refers to random factors that are uncontrollable u i refers to the part that the manufacturer or decision makers can control but fail to achieve efficiency these two factors are mutually independent under this setting the output value is set to be higher than the random variable e x p x i b v i the random variable can be either positive or negative and the output model changes as e x p x i b changes in empirical estimation the stochastic frontier is calculated by statistical approximation like function estimation and the equation for estimation is defined as ln y i Œ≤ x i v i u i i 1 i 2 v i n 0 œÉ v 2 u i n 0 œÉ u 2 f u 2 2 œÄ œÉ u e x p u 2 2 œÉ u 2 u 0 as mentioned above in eq 2 vi is an identically distributed normal random variable measuring technology inefficiency and it is statistically independent the mean value is 0 and the variance is œÉ v 2 the characteristic ui is a random variable following the semi normality distribution with a variance of œÉ u 2 according to the parametric maximum likelihood estimation proposed by aigner et al 1977 the semi normal distribution of maximum likelihood function is taken as a logarithmic form as in eq 3 3 l n l y Œ≤ œÉ Œª 1 2 l n œÄ œÉ 2 2 i 1 i l n œÜ y i Œ≤ x i œÉ 1 2 œÉ 2 i 1 i y i Œ≤ x i 2 in eq 3 œÉ 2 œÉ v 2 œÉ u 2 Œª 2 œÉ u 2 œÉ v 2 0 y is a vector of dependent variables œÜ x follows standard normal distribution and is a cumulative distribution function evaluated at the random variable x Œª 2 reflects the variance of the producing efficiency of the sample and a higher value of Œª 2 is associated with a larger variance in the process of estimation the present study also includes the malmquist productivity index to investigate the impact of investment in soil and water conservation construction on the productivity of newly increased agricultural land the malmquist productivity index mpi is used to measure the total factor productivity in different periods this index can assess the stability of the efficiency of each unit and can meanwhile observe the developing trend of the efficiency of each unit the model is set in eq 4 4 œÜ d i p x p y p g i q x p y p d i p x q y q g i q x q y q 1 2 the first term on the right side of eq 4 is the frontier shift effects of efficiency and the second term is innovation effects which reflect the changes of the boundary efficiency between two periods from period p to q when the index is greater than 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from period p to q is increasing when the index is equal to 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from period p to q stays constant when the index is less than 1 the total factor productivity of the decision maker from the p period to q period appears to decline 3 2 data source since china s reform and opening up in 1978 the economic development of china s coastal provinces has gradually become the main force of china s economic activities and zhejiang province has become one of the main development areas however although china s economic activity has improved the regional economic differences have also been different year after year among them the definition of statistical data is to show the difference between regions under such a background it is difficult to conduct a national soil and water conservation analysis therefore this article focuses on the research object in zhejiang province and explores the impact of water and soil conservation policies the present study accesses data from zhejiang natural resources and statistical yearbook on environment published by china statistics press we summarized investments in water and soil conservation in 11 cities including hangzhou ningbo wenzhou taizhou shaoxing lishui zhoushan jinhua jiaxing huzhou and quzhou from the year of 2007 to 2016 in terms of the studied variables we included the number of employment in water conservation the investment in infrastructure construction the investment in preventing water and soil disasters in each city as input variables and took the annual increase in the area of farmland with soil erosion management in each city as an output variable based on these variables the present study conducted a performance evaluation about the water and soil conservation construction of the governments and a total factor productivity analysis in the analysis we estimated the efficiency value and changes in productivity based on eqs 3 and 4 table 1 summarizes the definition and descriptive statistics of all the studied variables 4 empirical results first table 2 presents the correlation coefficients of the input and output variables it can be seen that there were weak correlations between the input and output variables these results show that the correlations between the main variables were not strong indicating that in the later regression analysis the problem of multicollinearity can be avoided table 3 presents results from the analysis applying eq 3 in the model estimation translog production function was used when including input variables the influences of input variables on each other as well as the interaction effect between input variables were considered secondly based on eqs 3 and 4 fig 1 summarizes the changes in performance and productivity of soil and water conservation construction conducted by zhejiang provincial government between 2007 and 2016 it can be seen from fig 1 that as time goes by the changes of efficiency and the changes of productivity in general follow a similar trajectory among them a value of malmquist production index curve higher than one indicates that the total factor productivity of the city in the current year has increased compared to last year from the figure it can be seen that between the year of 2009 2012 and 2015 in general the positive effect of water and soil conservation construction in zhejiang on increasing farmland grew stronger whereas this effect showed a decrease since 2015 as the latest published data do not cover data after the year of 2017 future research is needed to discuss and explore the reasons of this decrease in addition suggested by the technical efficiency curve in fig 1 most of the efficiency value of governments investment on water and soil conservation fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 and there was a trend of decreasing after 2015 the range of the efficiency value indicates that in general the efficiency of environmental protection needs to be improved generally speaking the management of soil erosion can firstly enable the better development of the water conservancy industry as the surface vegetation can be increased surface runoff can be reduced and agricultural production conditions can be improved secondly it can improve the ability of water conservancy and disaster prevention which would lay as a foundation for forming a virtuous circle of ecological environment development and the realization of sustainable development of society and economy the present study further analyzes the effect of soil and water conservation construction performance on the agricultural production and agricultural returns of local farmers to this end the logarithm of agricultural in each city log output1 the logarithm of the increase of farmers income in each city log output2 and the logarithm of the disposable income of farmers in each city log output3 were included as dependent variables table 4 presents results of the influence of water and soil conservation construction performance on these dependent variables it can be found from the results that given the influence of regions and time the performance of water and soil conservation construction had a significantly positive effect on the agricultural production of each city log output1 whereas the performance had a negative effect on farmers disposable income two plausible reasons might account for these results first the well planned and systematic measures for environmental protection in each city can effectively increase the amount of farmland available which in turn would improve the amount of agricultural production and bring positive effect on food supply however what comes along environmental protection is the internalizing or transferring of external costs or production costs on farmers such as costs of environmental pollution water and soil conservation and agricultural production the increase of production activity would increase the costs for environmental maintenance which would in turn affect labor compensation the results of estimation showed two types of pull one is the positive impact of urban environmental maintenance on economic output and the other is the negative impact of transferring of external costs of environmental protection to producers therefore in order to achieve sustainable soil and water conservation careful and serious considerations about trade offs between economic and environmental benefits are required in current and future china table 4 shows results of an analysis with mixed cross sectional data whereas fixed effects and time in variant effects were not considered in the estimation therefore the present study further used panel data analysis to investigate fixed effects in the analysis as the variable technical efficiency in table 4 was estimated from mixed cross sectional data the value was the ranking of performance assuming that the technology stayed invariant across different periods to further analysis the changes of productivity across periods in panel data analysis we instead used malmquist production index as an independent variable this variable is used to measure the impact of investment in soil and water conservation construction on the productivity of newly increased farmland and the impacts on agricultural production and on the agricultural returns and disposable income of local farmers the model for panel data analysis is developed as follows the model with individual specific effects is 5 y i t m a t e i t Œ≤ z i Œ¥ u i Œµ i t among which z i is individual characteristics that are time invariant m a t e i t is malmquist production index and in eq 5 it represents individuals that are time varing u i and Œµ i t are the composite error term in addition u i represents the intercept of individual heterogeneity in fixed effect model fe the two side of eq 5 can both be divided by the average time and thus we get 6 y i m a t e i Œ≤ z i Œ¥ u i Œµ i subtract eq 1 with the mean values and we can get mean differencing or time demeaning 7 y i t y i m a t e i t m a t e i Œ≤ Œµ i t Œµ i define y i t y i t y i m a t e i t m a t e i t m a t e i Œµ i t Œµ i t Œµ i so that 8 y i t m a t e i t Œ≤ Œµ i t in eq 8 u i was already excluded suppose that Œµ i t is not correlated with m a t e i t the ordinary least square can be used consistently to estimate fixed effect estimator Œ≤ ÀÜ f e table 5 shows empirical results based on eq 8 it can be found that when controlling for the effects of region and time the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on agricultural output log output1 in each city this result is consistent with results presented in table 4 however the influence on agricultural return and disposable income was not significant comparing tables 4 and 5 we can see that investments in soil and water conservation human resources and disaster prevention had a significantly positive impact on the amount of farmland in zhejiang china whereas their effects on farmers income were not significant in addition comparing the percentages of variance explained by the models it can be found that the model presented in table 5 with panel analysis performed better in explaining variances than the model presented in table 4 5 conclusion this article explores the impact of soil and water conservation policies in china in recent years on domestic agricultural development based on data from the zhejiang natural resources and environment statistical yearbook the present study uses the stochastic frontier approach and the malmquist production index to investigate the soil and water conservation of 11 cities in zhejiang province from 2007 to 2016 and the effect of investment in soil and water conservation on agricultural production in the cities the empirical results show that the performance of soil and water conservation construction in zhejiang over the years fell in the range between 0 4 and 0 6 the overall efficiency value and changes in productivity began to decline after 2015 secondly using mixed cross sectional data analysis and panel data analysis we found that the performance of soil and water conservation construction had a significantly positive impact on agricultural output log output1 in each city however it had a negative impact on the disposable income of farmers these results may reflect the phenomenon that the external costs for environmental protection such as costs of soil and water conservation and costs for agricultural production were considerably internalized or transferred to the production costs of the farmers therefore it is essential for future chinese environmental policies and systems to effectively drive agricultural economic incentives as it is a key factor for the sustainable development of water and soil
