conductivity was measured using a conductimeter consort protein content was determined by bradford method 28 a mixture of 800 μl of the diluted sample and 200 μl of biorad reagent was maintained at ambient temperature and in the dark during10 min a calibration curve prepared with concentrated bovine serum albumin bsa solution was used to determine protein concentration optical density of samples was measured at 595 nm for the determination of total volatile fatty acids vfa filtered and acidified ph 3 samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu 10 avp 3 results and discussion 3 1 ef disintegration effects on sludge properties 3 1 1 physico chemical characteristics table 1 gives the characteristics of was before and after ef treatment results showed an effect of ef on different parameters as ph conductivity cod vfa ph of sludge increased and reached a value of 7 2 after 1 h also an increase of the conductivity was shown 13 72 ms cm due to the liberation of mineral salts during electrolysis the vss tvs ratio about 0 57 of untreated sludge indicated the high proportion of organic matter flocs the decrease of this ratio to 0 29 with the drop of tss to 10 5 g l proved the sludge disintegration effect of ef over sludge solubilization was also noted by the increase of soluble cod proteins and vfa however a decrease in total cod was noted due to the mineralization of om which makes the measured soluble cod low compared to the real concentration released during treatment after 30 min of treatment the vfa concentration increased from 84 26 to 924 mg l this shows that the disintegration of was by ef pretreatment causes the vfas release resulting from cell lysis 29 this was also noted by xu et al 30 after electrochemical treatment ti ruo2 anode so the increase of vfa content in pretreated sample with a concentration less than 2 3 g l will obviously promote their anaerobic digestion 3 1 2 biodegradability and bioaccessibility the biodegradability of om does not only depend on its composition but also on its accessibility and complexity the integrated methodology successive chemical extractions 3d fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the accessibility and complexity of om the effect of the pretreatment on the distribution of different om categories in the extractable fractions was determined the percentages of fluorescence of zones i ii and iii were important in the most extractable fractions of the raw and pretreated sludge fig 1 in fact the fluorescence percentage of zone i increased from 11 to 38 in the dissolved fraction dom and from 15 to 25 in the soluble fraction spom after pretreatment the enhancement of om solubilization in zone i was also observed in zone iii in the raw sludge a fluorescence percentage of 10 in all the fractions was registered this percentage increased to 20 after ef pretreatment in all fractions except in peom where the percentage is low than 2 for zones iv v and vi which are respectively analogues of fulvic acids glycol proteins and lignocellulose show an increase of fluorescence percentages in spom reom and seom after pretreatment but a significant decrease from 60 to 16 was observed in peom whereas for the zone vii fluorescence analogous to humic acid 17 shows a high percentage of fluorescence 80 in the peom fraction of the pretreated sludge in comparison to the raw sludge 10 in fact this zone contains the most complex organic matter and it is not accessible for biological degradation 31 this finding demonstrates that under the effect of ef treatment there is a conversion of the simple non extractable molecules detected in crude sludge into soluble extractable molecules according to these results the ef pretreatment improves bio accessibility of om through the release of non extractable compounds to the soluble and extractable fractions fig 2 shows the complexity index ci of each fraction before and after pretreatment ci is the ratio between the sum of percentages of zones iv v vi and vii and the sum of percentages of zones i ii and iii and gives an idea about the biodegradability of organic fractions the results in fig 2 show that the index of the dom fraction of raw sludge decreases from 0 75 to 0 25 after pretreatment this shows that the om solubilized during the pretreatment is composed of simple and biodegradable molecules increasingly higher index was recorded in the other fractions of the pretreated sludge indicating the increase of complex molecules concentration with the decrease of accessibility degree on the other hand low index was measured in the spom reom and seom fractions of the raw sludge which shows that the organic matter present in these fractions is biodegradable but not easily accessible under the effect of pretreatment this part of organic matter becomes more accessible to microorganisms which clearly explains the improvement of biogas yield of pretreated sludge 3 2 biochemical methane potential bmp bmp assays were performed to determine the methane potential of raw and pretreated was samples table 1 gives the results of methane yield of samples the low methane yield of raw sample 0 080 l ch4 g vs confirms the hydrolysis limitation due to the resistance of flocs to anaerobic degradation the increase of anaerobic degradability of pretreated sludge was confirmed in this study as a significant improvement of methane yield about 68 was registered which is in correlation with the degree of cod solubilization and the released vfa table 1 at this step of study batch fermentation results showed the positive effect of ef disintegration on the anaerobic digestion of was 3 3 semi continuous anaerobic digestion of disintegrated sludge 3 3 1 reactor performance table 2 summarizes the operating conditions applied to uasb reactor during fermentation experiments the schematic configuration of uasb reactor is given in fig 3 the daily biogas production was in correlation with the applied olr during the two fermentations fig 4 however low biogas yields were noted during the first period of fermentations which then improved with fermentation time and reached 0 5 and 0 8 l g vs respectively at the end of the fermentation of raw and disintegrated sludge fig 4 table 2 in the case of raw sludge no significant increase of biogas yield was registered during the increase of olr from 0 35 to 0 5 g vs l d that showing the low degradability of raw sludge based on this result the fermentation of pretreated sludge was started by applying olr in the range of 0 5 g vs l d this period was considered as an acclimation phase for the new substrate which explains the low biogas yields nevertheless by increasing the olr a progressive increase of biogas yield was observed indicating the improvement of consortium activity to convert the hydrolyzed sludge to biogas this result demonstrated the improvement of biogas yield of uasb reactor by using ef pretreated sludge as substrate which confirms the results of batch fermentation table 1 moreover an enhancement of biogas yield was observed during the semi continuous fermentation in comparison to batch condition also high methane percentages were registered during the fermentation of pretreated sludge in comparison to raw sample fermentation table 2 the cod of reactor effluent was determined during fermentations table 2 gives the cod removals a maximum cod removal about 30 was obtained in the case of raw was after crossing the bed sludge reactor high removal of cod was registered in the case of pretreated sludge and reached 96 at an olr of 2 5 g vs l d this cod removal is considered high compared to other results obtained by xu et al 32 49 2 and li et al 15 12 5 the high cod removal at a trh 7 days could be explained by the high biodegradability of ef disintegrated sludge and the purification performance of uasb reactor this result confirms that the anaerobic uasb reactor is a promising digester design for the treatment of was 15 33 34 the present study has shown the effectiveness of ef process as disintegration pretreatment for a significant improvement of sludge biogas yield about 60 this finding is considered important in comparison to other studies using electrolysis methods and advanced oxidation processes before anaerobic digestion of was table 3 the destruction of sludge structure and the enhancement of methane production about only 10 was revealed by using the indigenous iron activated peroxidation pretreatment 35 similarly electrochemical disintegration of was before ad resulted in a 18 and 20 methane production improvement respectively in the case of pretreatment using boron doped diamond 36 and carbon 37 electrodes charles et al 38 studied the enhancement of waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion using electrolysis process with an ion exchange membrane their study mentioned that methane yield during anaerobic digestion at 20 days retention time was 31 higher than that of untreated sludge this comparison of results supports the conclusion that electrolysis pretreatment coupled to fenton reaction before anaerobic digestion has the potential to significantly improve digester performance resulting in high methane potential besides the uasb digester performance could be explained by the balance between the microbial communities in order to understand the interaction between these communities a molecular study of sludge bacterial biodiversity in this reactor was investigated 3 3 2 bacterial community structure bacterial community structure of digested sludge samples a raw and b pretreated was monitored using dgge method the number and intensity of migrating bands showed a distinct difference between sample a and b fig 5 table 4 dgge profiles show only two common bands in the two samples bands b15 and b18 bands b16 and b20 were observed only in sample a whereas bands b9 b10 b11 and b14 were detected in sample b in fact 8 bands were excised from the dgge gel and sequenced a dendrogram was constructed in order to present the relationship of all the partial 16s rdna sequences representing the excised dgge bands fig 5 all sequences were belonging to firmicutes proteobacteria alpha proteobacteria class nitrospira and chloroflexi phyla fig 6 these taxonomic groups are usually detected on anaerobic sludge digestion in uasb reactor 39 two sequences band b15 and b16 assigned to clostridium species of the lachnospiraceae family are dominant in landfills sludge and anaerobic reactor 40 therefore in the hydrolysis steps of ad members of clostridium produce a wide variety of extracellular enzymes to convert cellulose xylans proteins and lipids into fermentable components 41 and participate in acetogenesis step to produce precursors of methane production for methanogens 42 some species belong to the family lachnospiraceae are involved into hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis 43 band b14 sequence related to oribacterium species strictly anaerobic strains were isolated from the human oral cavity and sinus pus 44 band b20 is affiliated to the genus caldilinea of the caldilineaceae family among the chloroflexi phylum the sequence band b20 present 93 of similarity with caldilinea tarbellica and caldilinea aerophila species filamentous thermophilic anaerobic bacteria isolated during the anaerobic digestion of raw was some studies demonstrated that some species belong to the family caldilineaceae are involved into acidogenesis step in the fermentation reactors 38 band b9 was closely related to the genus coprothermobacter which can be classified in the phylum firmicutes or phyla dictyoglomi and thermotoga 45 the sequence of the band b9 has high similarity 99 with coprothermobacter proteolyticus formerly thermobacteroides proteolyticus that was the first isolated from digestate of a thermophilic co digestion of tannery wastes and cattle manure 41 46 a coprothermobacter platensis was also isolated from a mesophilic digester treating a protein rich wastewater 47 band b10 was related to the genus thermodesulfovibrio which uses sulfate and other sulfur compounds 48 these results indicated the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria into the uasb reactor bands b11 and b18 sequences were related to demequina and parvibaculum genera respectively these findings illustrated the coexistence of diversified anaerobic bacteria community involved into anaerobic digestion steps in the uasb reactor 49 comparison of results demonstrated that the ad system treating ef pretreated was favored the growth of coprothermobacter previous works reported that coprothermobacter growth is often related to the presence of proteinaceous substrate 50 therefore the proliferation of coprothermobacter in digester is related to proteinaceous material solubilization induced by the ef pretreatment the latter caused the solubilization of organic matter highlighted by the release of simple molecules as vfa table 1 the high substrate availability in the feed pretreated by ef led to the increase of biogas potential and performance of fermentation which suggest the establishment of syntrophic association between anaerobic bacteria implicated into different steps of ad according to these results ef process could be integrated to anaerobic system of was for high bioenergy recovery 3 3 3 bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities abundance the abundance of bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities in digestate samples was reported as dna copy numbers of 16s rrna or mcra genes per gram of wet sludge before treatment the abundance of total bacteria and archaea were 195 6 108 and 4 29 108 whereas after treatment their abundances were 139 5108 and 5 47 108 dna copies g 1 respectively according to the 16s rrna copy number in bacteria 3 82 and archaeal 1 62 genomes 51 the qpcr data were also expressed in relative percentage higher proportion of bacteria ranging between 96 22 and 97 85 was obtained in comparison to archaea accounting for 2 14 3 77 of the total prokaryotic population for the two samples assuming that one copy of the mcra gene methanogens accounted for 0 47 raw was to 1 92 pretreated was of the archaeal community these results proved that the increased number of methanogen along the process allowed the improvement of methane production in the reactor 4 conclusion the positive effect of ef treatment on the was disintegration was demonstrated the ef pretreatment led to the improvement of biodegradability and bioaccessibility of organic matter the anaerobic digestion study of pretreated sludge in uasb reactor confirmed the enhancement of biosystem performance the anaerobic bacteria community analyzed by pcr dgge method indicated that ef changed the microbial community to be enriched by the firmicutes proteobacteria nitrospira and chloroflexi phyla these results illustrate a richness of microbial community thus showing the balance of the anaerobic biosystem with the integration of ef disintegration bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities abundance was also shown to be improved in uasb reactor treating disintegrated sludge which explains the purification performance and high biogas production in order to evaluate the techno economic feasibility of the developed integrated process a pilot scale study is needed in the future the techno economic feasibility is dependent on the degree of sludge disintegration and methane potential but also on the energetic and environmental benefits for this reason carbon footprint analysis and life cycle assessment should be examined in a future work declaration of competing interest all authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest

96 real time system bio rad using the same reaction components and qpcr protocol condition as previously described 25 26 using the standard curves the abundance of each microbial group was reported as dna copy numbers of corresponding gene per gram of wet sludge 2 10 analytical methods methods used for the physico chemical analysis cod ts vs tss vss tkn and ph are described in previous study 27 conductivity was measured using a conductimeter consort protein content was determined by bradford method 28 a mixture of 800 μl of the diluted sample and 200 μl of biorad reagent was maintained at ambient temperature and in the dark during10 min a calibration curve prepared with concentrated bovine serum albumin bsa solution was used to determine protein concentration optical density of samples was measured at 595 nm for the determination of total volatile fatty acids vfa filtered and acidified ph 3 samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu 10 avp 3 results and discussion 3 1 ef disintegration effects on sludge properties 3 1 1 physico chemical characteristics table 1 gives the characteristics of was before and after ef treatment results showed an effect of ef on different parameters as ph conductivity cod vfa ph of sludge increased and reached a value of 7 2 after 1 h also an increase of the conductivity was shown 13 72 ms cm due to the liberation of mineral salts during electrolysis the vss tvs ratio about 0 57 of untreated sludge indicated the high proportion of organic matter flocs the decrease of this ratio to 0 29 with the drop of tss to 10 5 g l proved the sludge disintegration effect of ef over sludge solubilization was also noted by the increase of soluble cod proteins and vfa however a decrease in total cod was noted due to the mineralization of om which makes the measured soluble cod low compared to the real concentration released during treatment after 30 min of treatment the vfa concentration increased from 84 26 to 924 mg l this shows that the disintegration of was by ef pretreatment causes the vfas release resulting from cell lysis 29 this was also noted by xu et al 30 after electrochemical treatment ti ruo2 anode so the increase of vfa content in pretreated sample with a concentration less than 2 3 g l will obviously promote their anaerobic digestion 3 1 2 biodegradability and bioaccessibility the biodegradability of om does not only depend on its composition but also on its accessibility and complexity the integrated methodology successive chemical extractions 3d fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize the accessibility and complexity of om the effect of the pretreatment on the distribution of different om categories in the extractable fractions was determined the percentages of fluorescence of zones i ii and iii were important in the most extractable fractions of the raw and pretreated sludge fig 1 in fact the fluorescence percentage of zone i increased from 11 to 38 in the dissolved fraction dom and from 15 to 25 in the soluble fraction spom after pretreatment the enhancement of om solubilization in zone i was also observed in zone iii in the raw sludge a fluorescence percentage of 10 in all the fractions was registered this percentage increased to 20 after ef pretreatment in all fractions except in peom where the percentage is low than 2 for zones iv v and vi which are respectively analogues of fulvic acids glycol proteins and lignocellulose show an increase of fluorescence percentages in spom reom and seom after pretreatment but a significant decrease from 60 to 16 was observed in peom whereas for the zone vii fluorescence analogous to humic acid 17 shows a high percentage of fluorescence 80 in the peom fraction of the pretreated sludge in comparison to the raw sludge 10 in fact this zone contains the most complex organic matter and it is not accessible for biological degradation 31 this finding demonstrates that under the effect of ef treatment there is a conversion of the simple non extractable molecules detected in crude sludge into soluble extractable molecules according to these results the ef pretreatment improves bio accessibility of om through the release of non extractable compounds to the soluble and extractable fractions fig 2 shows the complexity index ci of each fraction before and after pretreatment ci is the ratio between the sum of percentages of zones iv v vi and vii and the sum of percentages of zones i ii and iii and gives an idea about the biodegradability of organic fractions the results in fig 2 show that the index of the dom fraction of raw sludge decreases from 0 75 to 0 25 after pretreatment this shows that the om solubilized during the pretreatment is composed of simple and biodegradable molecules increasingly higher index was recorded in the other fractions of the pretreated sludge indicating the increase of complex molecules concentration with the decrease of accessibility degree on the other hand low index was measured in the spom reom and seom fractions of the raw sludge which shows that the organic matter present in these fractions is biodegradable but not easily accessible under the effect of pretreatment this part of organic matter becomes more accessible to microorganisms which clearly explains the improvement of biogas yield of pretreated sludge 3 2 biochemical methane potential bmp bmp assays were performed to determine the methane potential of raw and pretreated was samples table 1 gives the results of methane yield of samples the low methane yield of raw sample 0 080 l ch4 g vs confirms the hydrolysis limitation due to the resistance of flocs to anaerobic degradation the increase of anaerobic degradability of pretreated sludge was confirmed in this study as a significant improvement of methane yield about 68 was registered which is in correlation with the degree of cod solubilization and the released vfa table 1 at this step of study batch fermentation results showed the positive effect of ef disintegration on the anaerobic digestion of was 3 3 semi continuous anaerobic digestion of disintegrated sludge 3 3 1 reactor performance table 2 summarizes the operating conditions applied to uasb reactor during fermentation experiments the schematic configuration of uasb reactor is given in fig 3 the daily biogas production was in correlation with the applied olr during the two fermentations fig 4 however low biogas yields were noted during the first period of fermentations which then improved with fermentation time and reached 0 5 and 0 8 l g vs respectively at the end of the fermentation of raw and disintegrated sludge fig 4 table 2 in the case of raw sludge no significant increase of biogas yield was registered during the increase of olr from 0 35 to 0 5 g vs l d that showing the low degradability of raw sludge based on this result the fermentation of pretreated sludge was started by applying olr in the range of 0 5 g vs l d this period was considered as an acclimation phase for the new substrate which explains the low biogas yields nevertheless by increasing the olr a progressive increase of biogas yield was observed indicating the improvement of consortium activity to convert the hydrolyzed sludge to biogas this result demonstrated the improvement of biogas yield of uasb reactor by using ef pretreated sludge as substrate which confirms the results of batch fermentation table 1 moreover an enhancement of biogas yield was observed during the semi continuous fermentation in comparison to batch condition also high methane percentages were registered during the fermentation of pretreated sludge in comparison to raw sample fermentation table 2 the cod of reactor effluent was determined during fermentations table 2 gives the cod removals a maximum cod removal about 30 was obtained in the case of raw was after crossing the bed sludge reactor high removal of cod was registered in the case of pretreated sludge and reached 96 at an olr of 2 5 g vs l d this cod removal is considered high compared to other results obtained by xu et al 32 49 2 and li et al 15 12 5 the high cod removal at a trh 7 days could be explained by the high biodegradability of ef disintegrated sludge and the purification performance of uasb reactor this result confirms that the anaerobic uasb reactor is a promising digester design for the treatment of was 15 33 34 the present study has shown the effectiveness of ef process as disintegration pretreatment for a significant improvement of sludge biogas yield about 60 this finding is considered important in comparison to other studies using electrolysis methods and advanced oxidation processes before anaerobic digestion of was table 3 the destruction of sludge structure and the enhancement of methane production about only 10 was revealed by using the indigenous iron activated peroxidation pretreatment 35 similarly electrochemical disintegration of was before ad resulted in a 18 and 20 methane production improvement respectively in the case of pretreatment using boron doped diamond 36 and carbon 37 electrodes charles et al 38 studied the enhancement of waste activated sludge anaerobic digestion using electrolysis process with an ion exchange membrane their study mentioned that methane yield during anaerobic digestion at 20 days retention time was 31 higher than that of untreated sludge this comparison of results supports the conclusion that electrolysis pretreatment coupled to fenton reaction before anaerobic digestion has the potential to significantly improve digester performance resulting in high methane potential besides the uasb digester performance could be explained by the balance between the microbial communities in order to understand the interaction between these communities a molecular study of sludge bacterial biodiversity in this reactor was investigated 3 3 2 bacterial community structure bacterial community structure of digested sludge samples a raw and b pretreated was monitored using dgge method the number and intensity of migrating bands showed a distinct difference between sample a and b fig 5 table 4 dgge profiles show only two common bands in the two samples bands b15 and b18 bands b16 and b20 were observed only in sample a whereas bands b9 b10 b11 and b14 were detected in sample b in fact 8 bands were excised from the dgge gel and sequenced a dendrogram was constructed in order to present the relationship of all the partial 16s rdna sequences representing the excised dgge bands fig 5 all sequences were belonging to firmicutes proteobacteria alpha proteobacteria class nitrospira and chloroflexi phyla fig 6 these taxonomic groups are usually detected on anaerobic sludge digestion in uasb reactor 39 two sequences band b15 and b16 assigned to clostridium species of the lachnospiraceae family are dominant in landfills sludge and anaerobic reactor 40 therefore in the hydrolysis steps of ad members of clostridium produce a wide variety of extracellular enzymes to convert cellulose xylans proteins and lipids into fermentable components 41 and participate in acetogenesis step to produce precursors of methane production for methanogens 42 some species belong to the family lachnospiraceae are involved into hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis 43 band b14 sequence related to oribacterium species strictly anaerobic strains were isolated from the human oral cavity and sinus pus 44 band b20 is affiliated to the genus caldilinea of the caldilineaceae family among the chloroflexi phylum the sequence band b20 present 93 of similarity with caldilinea tarbellica and caldilinea aerophila species filamentous thermophilic anaerobic bacteria isolated during the anaerobic digestion of raw was some studies demonstrated that some species belong to the family caldilineaceae are involved into acidogenesis step in the fermentation reactors 38 band b9 was closely related to the genus coprothermobacter which can be classified in the phylum firmicutes or phyla dictyoglomi and thermotoga 45 the sequence of the band b9 has high similarity 99 with coprothermobacter proteolyticus formerly thermobacteroides proteolyticus that was the first isolated from digestate of a thermophilic co digestion of tannery wastes and cattle manure 41 46 a coprothermobacter platensis was also isolated from a mesophilic digester treating a protein rich wastewater 47 band b10 was related to the genus thermodesulfovibrio which uses sulfate and other sulfur compounds 48 these results indicated the presence of sulfate reducing bacteria into the uasb reactor bands b11 and b18 sequences were related to demequina and parvibaculum genera respectively these findings illustrated the coexistence of diversified anaerobic bacteria community involved into anaerobic digestion steps in the uasb reactor 49 comparison of results demonstrated that the ad system treating ef pretreated was favored the growth of coprothermobacter previous works reported that coprothermobacter growth is often related to the presence of proteinaceous substrate 50 therefore the proliferation of coprothermobacter in digester is related to proteinaceous material solubilization induced by the ef pretreatment the latter caused the solubilization of organic matter highlighted by the release of simple molecules as vfa table 1 the high substrate availability in the feed pretreated by ef led to the increase of biogas potential and performance of fermentation which suggest the establishment of syntrophic association between anaerobic bacteria implicated into different steps of ad according to these results ef process could be integrated to anaerobic system of was for high bioenergy recovery 3 3 3 bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities abundance the abundance of bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities in digestate samples was reported as dna copy numbers of 16s rrna or mcra genes per gram of wet sludge before treatment the abundance of total bacteria and archaea were 195 6 108 and 4 29 108 whereas after treatment their abundances were 139 5108 and 5 47 108 dna copies g 1 respectively according to the 16s rrna copy number in bacteria 3 82 and archaeal 1 62 genomes 51 the qpcr data were also expressed in relative percentage higher proportion of bacteria ranging between 96 22 and 97 85 was obtained in comparison to archaea accounting for 2 14 3 77 of the total prokaryotic population for the two samples assuming that one copy of the mcra gene methanogens accounted for 0 47 raw was to 1 92 pretreated was of the archaeal community these results proved that the increased number of methanogen along the process allowed the improvement of methane production in the reactor 4 conclusion the positive effect of ef treatment on the was disintegration was demonstrated the ef pretreatment led to the improvement of biodegradability and bioaccessibility of organic matter the anaerobic digestion study of pretreated sludge in uasb reactor confirmed the enhancement of biosystem performance the anaerobic bacteria community analyzed by pcr dgge method indicated that ef changed the microbial community to be enriched by the firmicutes proteobacteria nitrospira and chloroflexi phyla these results illustrate a richness of microbial community thus showing the balance of the anaerobic biosystem with the integration of ef disintegration bacterial archaeal and methanogens communities abundance was also shown to be improved in uasb reactor treating disintegrated sludge which explains the purification performance and high biogas production in order to evaluate the techno economic feasibility of the developed integrated process a pilot scale study is needed in the future the techno economic feasibility is dependent on the degree of sludge disintegration and methane potential but also on the energetic and environmental benefits for this reason carbon footprint analysis and life cycle assessment should be examined in a future work declaration of competing interest all authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest

12876,the adsorption instability and weak visible light utilization of biochar restrain the industrial application in wastewater and soil remediations hence s n codoped biochar is modified with la2s3 la2s3 sn biochar via the one pot sulfurization approach to boost the adsorption and photocatalytic activities for tetracycline hydrochloride tch removal among the biochar based composites the optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar with the la content of 15 43 wt and the n content of 0 49 wt exhibits the best removal efficiency of tch its calculated adsorption capacity is 419 18 mg g 1 and the solar light driven removal efficiency is 98 45 for 200 mg l 1 tch solution within 120 min however the long term photo corrosion induces to the declined adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of 3c la2s3 sn biochar from 98 45 to 93 26 after 5 cycles and the inadequate vacant sites result in the decreased adsorption capacity from 313 44 to 286 36 mg g 1 after 7 cycles langmuir isotherms and second order kinetics well fit with the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of la2s3 sn biochar composites respectively the z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar favors the rapid migration and separation of photoinduced electron hole pairs meanwhile the negative surface discharge is suitable for the efficient electrostatic attraction of tch adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords la2s3 s n codoped carbon adsorption photocatalysis tetracycline hydrochloride data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics such as tetracycline tc sulfonamides aminoglycosides quinolone and macrolides are commonly used for the disease treatment in animals and humans 1 2 however the misuse and poor absorption of antibiotics have instigated the adverse issues in the soil and water contamination for instance 80 90 of tc is not absorbed by animals and humans and seriously emitted to the environments which is detected to the low concentrations ng l 1 to μg l 1 in treated water and the high levels in pharmaceutical manufacturing and hospital effluents 3 4 especially the chronic and acute toxicity effects as well as high biological activity induce to the antibiotic resistance of ecosystems 5 hence many routes are developed to eliminate antibiotics of aqueous solution including adsorption 6 photocatalysis 7 8 biological degradation 9 electro coagulation 10 advanced oxidation 11 12 and plasma 13 in recent years these two or more approaches have been coupled to achieve the wastewater treatment typically adsorption combined with photocatalysis is a promising way to remove antibiotics 14 16 hence the economical and efficient photocatalysts with excellent adsorption photocatalytic activity are still expected to realize the industrial application in wastewater treatment biochar generated from the carbonization of municipal solid waste straw wood manure sludge and shell waste under the inert environment has been intensively performed for the pollution control due to its eco friendly and low cost 17 18 in contrast with the low carbonization of 573 673 k the medium carbonization of 673 973 k can generate biochar with higher porous texture and higher aromaticity for electron donor interaction in addition the moderate pyrolysis process favors the formation of oxygen and nitrogen based groups serving as electron acceptors different from the hydrogen peroxide ozonation and chlorine dioxide for the removal of organic pollutants biochar can release the issues of genotoxic cytotoxic and mutagenic possibilities in living organisms via the adsorption and photocatalysis the adsorption nature of biochar is greatly affected by the surface area porous nature cation exchange capacity and functional groups 19 20 to further enlarge the amounts of adsorption sites and the surface functionality of biochar physical activation and chemical modification are the main strategies for enhancing the adsorption capacity of biochar different from physical activation such as ball milling 21 and uv irradiation 22 chemical modifications such as magnetization 23 reductant 24 enrichment of active functional groups 25 26 nanocomposites 27 28 heteroatom dopants 29 30 acid and alkali treatment 31 32 induce to the more intensive functional groups and higher surface area of biochar nonmetallic dopants are incorporated into the carbonaceous matrix of biochar to climb the negative charge nature for binding the electropositive or amphoteric molecules such as tch 33 34 notably nonmetal doped biochar serves as the electron trapper for efficient charge separation and provides the sufficient vacant sites for pollutant absorption for instance the π π electron donor acceptor pore filling interactions and h bonds facilitate the adsorption capacity of n doped biochar for norfloxacin removal 46 24 mg g 1 which is 4 folds higher than pristine biochar 35 in contrast with activated carbon 6 mg g 1 and commercial graphene 19 mg g 1 fe n codoped biochar 54 mg g 1 has better adsorption capacity of bisphenol a due to the vacant adsorption sites of graphitic n and fe nx bonds 36 in multi pollutants adsorption system the adsorption capacities of fe n codoped biochar for tetracycline phosphate and ammonium are 238 9 165 0 and 111 8 mg g 1 respectively 37 in addition the adsorption capacities of mgo loaded n p codoped biochar for cd2 cu2 and pb2 are 327 2 505 8 and 661 2 mg g 1 respectively 38 the adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of znfe2o4 modified b n codoped biochar is 98 19 with a high adsorption capacity of 244 34 mg g 1 39 when biochar combined with k doped g c3n4 the disinfection rates for s aureus and e coli are above 90 because of the unique defects for the rapid adsorption of pollutants and the fast transfer of generated intermediates 40 hence metal and nonmetal co doped biochar is promising for the adsorption photocatalytic system of pollutants elimination in recent years metal sulfides as well as metal oxides have emerged to promote the photocatalytic activity of biochar 41 43 however metal sulfides prepared via the chemical precipitation microwave and hydrothermal routes normally suffer from the aggregation and instability in the aqueous solution 44 45 to conquer the above drawbacks the high temperature sulfurization has been intensively employed to synthesize metal sulfides with excellent stability and activity 46 47 for example znin2s4 48 and mn0 5cd0 5s 49 are likely to enhance h2 evolution rate of s n codoped carbon via high temperature sulfurization meanwhile the high surface area and porous structure of ga2s3 s modified biochar prepared through one pot sulfurization endows its excellent adsorption capacity of 330 21 mg g 1 for ciprofloxacin removal 50 this strategy is confirmed by mgo n doped carbon 51 and znfe2o4 b n codoped biochar 39 for wastewater treatment compared with biochar s doped biochar and cds the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of cds s biochar for rhb removal are higher due to the large surface area and sufficient vacant sites 52 different from common metal sulfides such as cds zns fes and cus la2s3 have barely reported in the photocatalytic system due to its diversifying crystalline phases although la2s3 has the promising chemical and physical natures for optical application the transformation of crystalline states such as α β and γ are seriously determined by the synthesis routes and experimental factors 53 54 these la2s3 multiphases are easy to form s defects acting as the active sites for pollutants adsorption and photocatalysis however the fundamental knowledge of la2s3 based composites in adsorption photocatalytic system has not been investigated in previous works to heighten the adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar derived from sugarcane bagasse for tch removal la2s3 modifided biochar with s n codoping la2s3 sn biochar composites were synthesized via one pot sulfurization approach at high temperature in contrast with biochar and s n codoped biochar la2s3 sn biochar composites exhibit the better adsorption and photocatalytic activities the negative surface discharge as well as abundant functional groups is helpful for the electrostatic attraction between tch molecules and vacant sites of la2s3 sn biochar bulks the large surface area of obtained sample can provide abundant active sites for tch adsorption and photocatalysis especially s defects generated from la2s3 multiphases and s n codoped carbon matrix serving as the vacant sites 55 56 in addition z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar boosts the migration and separation of charge carriers leading to the excellent utilization of solar light for pollutants degradation 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of catalysts the reagents and characterization methods of la2s3 sn biochar were described in s1 and s2 of supported information respectively in a typical process 0 22 g la no3 3 6h2o 1 0 g sugarcane bagasse and 0 25 g co nh2 2 were dispersed into 200 ml deionized water with the intensive stirring at room temperature for 0 5 h and then stirred at 333 k to remove h2o after dried at 353 k for 6 h the obtained precursor was mixed with 1 3 g koh in a mortar for 0 5 h and then transferred to a tube furnace after heated to 873 k with a 20 h2s ar flow of 40 ml min 1 and a heating rate of 10 k min 1 the precursor was treated at 873 k for 3 h after cooled down to room temperature the sample was washed with deionized water and c2h5oh for four times and then dried at 343 k for 6 h to obtain 3c la2s3 sn biochar xc la2s3 sn biochar x 1 2 4 and 5 with various la2s3 content were obtained using 0 05 0 11 0 35 and 0 43 g la no3 3 6h2o respectively in addition 3y la2s3 sn biochar y a b d and e with various n doped content were generated using 0 05 0 13 0 50 and 1 00 g urea respectively moreover s doped biochar s biochar s n codoped biochar s n biochar using 0 25 g urea la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar were produced in above system for comparison sugarcane bagasse was treated at 873 k for 3 h with a 20 h2s ar flow of 40 ml min 1 to produce s doped biochar 2 2 adsorption photocatalytic experiment the adsorption photocatalytic performances of la2s3 sn biochar composites in tch removal were evaluated in a 200 ml home made reactor equipped with xe lamp of 400 mw cm2 and the irradiated instance of 20 cm typically 40 mg la2s3 sn biochar bulks were added into 100 ml tch solution of 200 mg l 1 and stirred in dark at 298 k for 60 min to reach the balance of adsorption desorption after irradiated for a certain time interval 2 ml solution was sampled filtered and detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 the adsorption isotherms of these samples for tch removal were performed with the tch concentration range of 100 220 mg l 1 at 298 k s2 supported information moreover the adsorption kinetics of biochar based composites were carried on with the addition of 40 mg obtained bulks into 100 ml tch solution of 130 mg l 1 at 298 k s2 supported information according to the above process effects of la2s3 content n doped content inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 fecl3 na2so4 and na3po4 ph and quenchers such as p bq edta 2na and t buoh on the adsorption photocatalysis of la2s3 sn biochar were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar based composites the morphology and texture of biochar based composites were detected by sem and tem s doped biochar fig 1a and b is amorphous and porous structure while s n codoped biochar fig 1e g has much more irregular meso microporous la2s3 is the aggregation consisted of 20 nm nanoparticles fig 1c and d la2s3 nanoparticles are randomly loaded on the surface and in the pore channels of 3 la2s3 s biochar fig 1i k and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 1m o which are further confirmed by tem fig 2 the lattice fringes with the interplanar distance of 0 237

planes of la2o2s jcpds 27 0263 and the peak at 32 48 and 36 65 are assigned to 300 and 311 planes of cubic las2 jcpds 25 1042 respectively in contrast with 3 la2s3 s biochar the peaks intensities of 3

lao bonds 61 these cn co cs las and lao bonds serve as the adsorption sites and electron trappers inducing to the efficient adsorption and visible light response 62 n2 adsorption desorption crvues of s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 3c are the type iv of h4 hysteresis loop indicating the porosity nature the surface areas of la2s3 sn biochar composites table s1 change with la2s3 and n contents since la2s3 nanoparticles loaded on the surface and pore channels the surface area and pore volume of optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar are 954 73 m2 g 1 and 0 266 cm3 g 1 respectively zeta potential plots fig 3d confirm that 3c la2s3 sn biochar exhibits the positive surface discharge at ph of 3 0 5 54 while the negative surface discharge at ph of 5 54 11 0 which favors the adsorption of cationic and amphoteric pollutants via the electrostatic attraction 63 64 uv vis drs spectra fig 3e suggest that la2s3 and biochar based composites exhibit the strong visible light harvesting the interaction between s n codoped biochar and la2s3 slightly enhances the visible light absorption intensity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the estimated band gap energy eg values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar table s2 are respectively 2 47 1 05 and 0 90 ev according to the relationship between flat band potential efb and conduction band energy ecb the calculated ecb values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar are 0 26 0 59 and 0 51 ev respectively hence their corresponding valance band energy evb values are 2 21 0 38 and 0 39 ev respectively it s confirmed that la2s3 and s n codoped biochar can form z scheme junction 37 65 the positive slop of mott schottky plots further indicates the n type nature of la2s3 sn biochar fig 3g for comparison the photocurrent intensity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 3f is higher than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 sn biochar meaning the strong visible light response and fast charge separation of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the smallest arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectrum fig 3h and the weakest intensity of pl spectrum fig 3i suggest that the photoinduced electron hole pairs of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are efficiently separated and transferred at z scheme junction interface expecting the excellent photocatalytic activity the surface compositions and valence states of elements were detected by xps fig s1 for la 3d xps spectrum of la2s3 fig s1a the peaks at 854 60 and 837 92 ev are la 3d3 2 and la 3d5 2 and the peaks at 851 37 and 834 68 ev are their coressponding satellite peaks respectively the binding energies of splitting la3d peaks in 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar shift to the higher values due to the tight contact between la2s3 and functionalized biochar 66 for la2s3 the peaks at 162 64 and 161 39 ev fig s1b are assigend to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 of la2s3 and the peaks at 169 16 ev and 160 22 ev are the so bond of la2o2s and the sla bond of las2 respectively the splitting s 2p peaks of s doped biochar s n codoped biochar 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar belonging to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 shift to the higher binding energies 164 40 0 2 ev 163 20 0 1 ev and the splitting peak indexing as so of functional so3 2 and so4 2 groups shifts to the lower binding energy the peaks defined as sp3 bonded c 3 n and amorphous cc bonds in these biochar composites slightly change and locate at around 285 0 3 ev and 284 10 0 1 ev respectively fig s1c the splitting n 1s peaks indexing as quaternary n and c n c fig s1d also slightly shift and appear at 400 60 0 3 ev and 398 10 0 1 ev respectively for o 1s fig s1e the splitting peaks of la2s3 at 531 56 and 528 88 ev are attributed to o la s defects and lattice oxygen of la2o2s and the peaks of s doped biochar at 531 57 and 528 95 ev are ascribed to oc defects and lattice oxygen in carbon matrix respectively the binding energies of these splitting peaks in s n codoped biochar 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar shift to the higher values the various binding energies of valence states are responsible for the difference in adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar based samples for tch removal 3 2 adsorption photocatalysis the adsorption photocatalytic performances of biochar based composites were peformed for the visible light induced degradation of tch 200 mg l 1 the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of s n codoped biochar fig 4a are higher than s doped biochar while lower than pure la2s3 the combied effect of la2s3 and s n codoped biochar boosts the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar and 3 la2s3 s biochar the charge carriers are efficiently separated and tranfered at the junction interface between la2s3 and s n biochar of which the excited electrons are repaidly captured by s n doped biochar meanwhile tch molecules are rapdily diffused from aqueous slution to bulks surface and efficiently absorbed on the vacant sites of junction interface 67 68 in addition the large surface area of obtianed 3c la2s3 sn biochar is likely to provide aboundant active sites for adsorption and photocatalytic reaction the adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is thus higher than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar although the amounts of active sites at junction interface increase with the climbing la and n contents the texture strucutre of bulks is seriously destroyed leading to the inferior adsorption and photocatalytic locations for the mass transfer of tch and intermediates on the bulks surface 69 70 the adsorption photocatalytic capacity of la2s3 sn biochar increases and then decreases with an increase in la and n contents fig 4b and c among these composites the optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar with a la content of 15 43 wt and a n content of 0 49 wt presents the best adsorption photocatalytic activity of 98 45 for tch removal within 120 min owing to the z scheme junction for efficient transfer and separation of photo induced charge carriers and the abundant vacant sites for rapid adsorption of tch molecules the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar table s3 is better than the reported materials under solar light irradiation notably the functionalized biochar such as s n doping and la2s3 loading has the dual effect of adsorption and photocatalysis for tch and intermediates removal hence biochar based composites with adsorption and photocatalysis are developed to eradicate pollutants from wastewater the adsorption and photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is affected by inorganic salts and quenchers inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and na3po4 fig 4d restrain the adsorption and photocatalytic capacities of 3c la2s3 sn biochar due to the competitive adsorption between tch molecules and inorganic ions on the vacant sites 55 70 although fecl3 suppresses the adsorption activity it greatly enhances the photocatalytic capacity because of the redox couples of fe2 fe3 for the migration and separation of charge carriers the quenchers including p bq edta 2na and t buoh fig 4e restrain the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of 3c la2s3 sn biochar for tch removal confirming that the photo induced o2 oh and h species are vital for the photocatalytic system with the presence of these active radicals the durability of 3c la2s3 sn biochar for solar light driven removal of tch slightly decines after 5 cycles and the total removal efficienvy of tch decreases from 98 45 to 93 26 fig 4f the deactivation of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is mainly attributed to the photo corrosion for the declined amounts of active sites 3 3 adsorption the adsorption of tch molecules and the desorption of intermediates on the acitve sites play the important roles in the photocatalytic process of 3c la2s3 sn biochar it s essential to discuss the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of biochar based composites for tch removal compared with first order model fig 5a second order model fig 5b is better to describe to the adsorption kinetics of biochar based composites because of the higher r2 values 0 993 0 996 and the lower are values 1 79 8 10 of second order kinetics table s4 the estimated qe value and rate constant of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are resepctively 317 12 mg g 1 and 0 0015 g mg 1 min 1 which are higher than s n codoped biochar and la2s3 it s confirmed that the cooperative effect between s n codoped biochar and la2s3 is likely to enhance the adsorption activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the intra particle diffusion curves fig 5c don t pass through the original point meaning that the rate limiting steps of biochar based composites are the boundary and intra particle diffusion tch molecules rapidly diffuse from aqueous solution to bulks surface and then slowly migrate to the inner pores and intra particles for comparison to freundlich fig 6b and temkin fig 6c models langmuir isotherm fig 6a is better to simulate the experimental data of la2s3 and biochar based composites due to the higher r2 values 0 997 0 998 and the lower are values 0 70 1 44 table s5 the calculated separation factor rl values are lower than 1 0 meaning the excellent reliability of langmuir model for fitting the adsorption isotherms of obtained samples the monolayer adsorption dominates the adsorption process of tch molecules on the bulks surface according to langmuir isotherm the estimated qe value of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is 419 18 mg g 1 which is higher than s n coped biochar 124 83 mg g 1 and la2s3 316 15 mg g 1 the adsorption capacities of biochar based composites are affected by ph inorganic salts la content n content and adsorbent dosage fig 7 the adsorption capcities of la2s3 and biochar based composites decrease with the climbing ph fig 7a it s reported that tch molecules have cationic tch3 existed at ph 3 3 zwitterionic existed at ph at 3 3 7 7 and anionic tch and tc2 species existed at ph 7 7 15 19 due to the positive and negative surface discharges of 3c la2s3 sn biochar appearing at ph of 3 0 5 54 and 5 54 11 0 tch molecules are easily adsorbed at ph 7 7 via the electrostatic attraction while unlikely to adsorb on the bulks surface at ph 7 7 due to the electrostatic repulsion the inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 fecl3 na2so4 and na3po4 affect the ph of aqueous solution to some extent restaining the adsorption capacity of la2s3 and biochar based composites fig 7b these ions are competitively adsorbed on the active sites limiting the amounts of tch adsorption in addition the abundant inorganic ions in aqueous solution hamper the transfer of tch molecules at the boundary film of liquid solid phases notably po4 3 is likely to react with h2o to produce anionic hpo4 2 h2po4 and oh species leading to the inferior adsorption of tch in alkaline medium la2s3 and s n codoping are favorable for forming active asites on the surface of biochar notably s defects of la2s3 sever as the vacant sites for adsorption and photocatalysis hence the adsorption capacity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar increases with the climbing la fig 7c and n contents fig 7d the increasing dosage of 3c la2s3 sn biochar provides the more vacant sites for tch adsorption however the limited amounts of tch molecules are rapidly adsorbed at the initial stage and then slowly diffuse from aqueous solution to absorb on the vacant sites at the later stage declining the adsorption capacity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 7e the adsorption capacities of la2s3 and biochar based composites slightly decline after 7 cycles fig 7f 3c la2s3 sn biochar has the better adsorption durability than la2s3 s doped biochar s n codoped biochar and 3 la2s3 s biochar it s indicated that the high temperature sulfurization is a potential route to fabricate biochar based composites with efficient adsorption photocatalytic activity 3 4 adsorption photocatalytic mechanism the various functional groups and s defects as well as the unique surface discharge nature favor the superior adsorption photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar also promotes the efficient migration and separation of electron hole pairs leading to the excellent utilization of visible light 68 69 the functional groups such as cn cs ch cn no nh las and lao bonds on the bulks surface can efficiently adsorb tch molecules through π π interaction of aromatics the h bonds formed between tch and functional groups act as donors or acceptors promoting the fast physisorption of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar 50 these chemical bonds of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are likely to generate the hydrogen bonds at ph 5 54 inducing to the negative surface discharge due to cationic type at ph 3 3 and anionic specie at ph 7 7 the electrostatic repulsion restrains the adsorption of tch at ph 3 3 and ph 7 7 while the electrostatic interaction favors the adsorption of tch at ph of 3 3 7 7 hence the π π interaction h bonding and electrostatic interaction dominate the adsorption process of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the photocatalytic mechanism of 3c la2s3 sn biochar presents in fig 8 the calculated ecb values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar are 0 26 and 0 59 ev and their evb values are 2 21 and 0 38 ev respectively hence la2s3 and s n codoped biochar are easy to form z scheme structure 11 55 the photo generated electrons at the vb of la2s3 efficiently transfer to the cb of s n codoped biochar stimulating the separation and migration of charge carriers at vb and cb of s n codoped biochar due to the cb value of s n codoped biochar 0 59 ev more negative than 0 33 ev the dissolved o2 captures e to generate o2 60 owing to the more positive vb value of la2s3 2 21 ev than 1 99 ev oh oh oh reacts with h to convert oh 16 with the assistance of these radicals the adsorbed tch molecules over 3c la2s3 sn biochar are likely to degrade the harmless intermediates and small molecules although sem and tem images fig s2 indicate that there is no change in the morphology of used 3c la2s3 sn biochar after 7 cycles the photo corrosion changes the valance states of surface composition fig s3 the peaks of la 3d at 854 69 and 837 76 ev fig s3a correspond to la 3d3 2 and la 3d5 2 and the corresponding satellite peaks locate at 851 58 and 834 67 ev respectively for s 2p fig s3b the peak at 167 55 is indexed as the so bond of so3 2 and the peaks at 164 08 and 162 87 ev are ascribed to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 of las bond respectively for n 1 s fig s3c the peaks of sp3 bonded c 3 n and amorphous cc bonds respectively appear at 285 82 and 283 91 ev the peaks at 401 29 and 399 14 ev in n 1s xps spectrum fig s3d are assigned to quaternary n and c n c respectively the peaks at 532 02 and 530 82 ev fig s3e are respectively ascribed to oxygen defects and lattice oxygen the oxygen defects are from the co bond of biochar and o la s bond of la2o2s while the lattice oxygen is the lao bond of la2o2s the changes in valance states of surface elements induce to the declining adsorption and photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar hence the future work will focus on the improvement in the durability of biochar based composites 4 conclusion la2s3 sn biochar composites efficiently promote the adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar langmuir and the second order models well describe the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of biochar based composites respectively the adsorption photocatalytic activity of optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar is better than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar its calculated adsorption capacity is 419 18 mg g 1 and the removal efficiency is 98 45 for 200 mg l 1 tch solution within 120 min however the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar declines from 98 45 to 93 26 after 5 cycles and its adsorption capacity decreases from 313 44 to 286 36 mg g 1 after 7 cycles z scheme junction between la2s3 and sn biochar favors the transfer and separation of photo generated charge carriers boosting the visible light response and solar energy utilization however the photo corrosion

12876,the adsorption instability and weak visible light utilization of biochar restrain the industrial application in wastewater and soil remediations hence s n codoped biochar is modified with la2s3 la2s3 sn biochar via the one pot sulfurization approach to boost the adsorption and photocatalytic activities for tetracycline hydrochloride tch removal among the biochar based composites the optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar with the la content of 15 43 wt and the n content of 0 49 wt exhibits the best removal efficiency of tch its calculated adsorption capacity is 419 18 mg g 1 and the solar light driven removal efficiency is 98 45 for 200 mg l 1 tch solution within 120 min however the long term photo corrosion induces to the declined adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of 3c la2s3 sn biochar from 98 45 to 93 26 after 5 cycles and the inadequate vacant sites result in the decreased adsorption capacity from 313 44 to 286 36 mg g 1 after 7 cycles langmuir isotherms and second order kinetics well fit with the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of la2s3 sn biochar composites respectively the z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar favors the rapid migration and separation of photoinduced electron hole pairs meanwhile the negative surface discharge is suitable for the efficient electrostatic attraction of tch adsorption graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords la2s3 s n codoped carbon adsorption photocatalysis tetracycline hydrochloride data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction antibiotics such as tetracycline tc sulfonamides aminoglycosides quinolone and macrolides are commonly used for the disease treatment in animals and humans 1 2 however the misuse and poor absorption of antibiotics have instigated the adverse issues in the soil and water contamination for instance 80 90 of tc is not absorbed by animals and humans and seriously emitted to the environments which is detected to the low concentrations ng l 1 to μg l 1 in treated water and the high levels in pharmaceutical manufacturing and hospital effluents 3 4 especially the chronic and acute toxicity effects as well as high biological activity induce to the antibiotic resistance of ecosystems 5 hence many routes are developed to eliminate antibiotics of aqueous solution including adsorption 6 photocatalysis 7 8 biological degradation 9 electro coagulation 10 advanced oxidation 11 12 and plasma 13 in recent years these two or more approaches have been coupled to achieve the wastewater treatment typically adsorption combined with photocatalysis is a promising way to remove antibiotics 14 16 hence the economical and efficient photocatalysts with excellent adsorption photocatalytic activity are still expected to realize the industrial application in wastewater treatment biochar generated from the carbonization of municipal solid waste straw wood manure sludge and shell waste under the inert environment has been intensively performed for the pollution control due to its eco friendly and low cost 17 18 in contrast with the low carbonization of 573 673 k the medium carbonization of 673 973 k can generate biochar with higher porous texture and higher aromaticity for electron donor interaction in addition the moderate pyrolysis process favors the formation of oxygen and nitrogen based groups serving as electron acceptors different from the hydrogen peroxide ozonation and chlorine dioxide for the removal of organic pollutants biochar can release the issues of genotoxic cytotoxic and mutagenic possibilities in living organisms via the adsorption and photocatalysis the adsorption nature of biochar is greatly affected by the surface area porous nature cation exchange capacity and functional groups 19 20 to further enlarge the amounts of adsorption sites and the surface functionality of biochar physical activation and chemical modification are the main strategies for enhancing the adsorption capacity of biochar different from physical activation such as ball milling 21 and uv irradiation 22 chemical modifications such as magnetization 23 reductant 24 enrichment of active functional groups 25 26 nanocomposites 27 28 heteroatom dopants 29 30 acid and alkali treatment 31 32 induce to the more intensive functional groups and higher surface area of biochar nonmetallic dopants are incorporated into the carbonaceous matrix of biochar to climb the negative charge nature for binding the electropositive or amphoteric molecules such as tch 33 34 notably nonmetal doped biochar serves as the electron trapper for efficient charge separation and provides the sufficient vacant sites for pollutant absorption for instance the π π electron donor acceptor pore filling interactions and h bonds facilitate the adsorption capacity of n doped biochar for norfloxacin removal 46 24 mg g 1 which is 4 folds higher than pristine biochar 35 in contrast with activated carbon 6 mg g 1 and commercial graphene 19 mg g 1 fe n codoped biochar 54 mg g 1 has better adsorption capacity of bisphenol a due to the vacant adsorption sites of graphitic n and fe nx bonds 36 in multi pollutants adsorption system the adsorption capacities of fe n codoped biochar for tetracycline phosphate and ammonium are 238 9 165 0 and 111 8 mg g 1 respectively 37 in addition the adsorption capacities of mgo loaded n p codoped biochar for cd2 cu2 and pb2 are 327 2 505 8 and 661 2 mg g 1 respectively 38 the adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of znfe2o4 modified b n codoped biochar is 98 19 with a high adsorption capacity of 244 34 mg g 1 39 when biochar combined with k doped g c3n4 the disinfection rates for s aureus and e coli are above 90 because of the unique defects for the rapid adsorption of pollutants and the fast transfer of generated intermediates 40 hence metal and nonmetal co doped biochar is promising for the adsorption photocatalytic system of pollutants elimination in recent years metal sulfides as well as metal oxides have emerged to promote the photocatalytic activity of biochar 41 43 however metal sulfides prepared via the chemical precipitation microwave and hydrothermal routes normally suffer from the aggregation and instability in the aqueous solution 44 45 to conquer the above drawbacks the high temperature sulfurization has been intensively employed to synthesize metal sulfides with excellent stability and activity 46 47 for example znin2s4 48 and mn0 5cd0 5s 49 are likely to enhance h2 evolution rate of s n codoped carbon via high temperature sulfurization meanwhile the high surface area and porous structure of ga2s3 s modified biochar prepared through one pot sulfurization endows its excellent adsorption capacity of 330 21 mg g 1 for ciprofloxacin removal 50 this strategy is confirmed by mgo n doped carbon 51 and znfe2o4 b n codoped biochar 39 for wastewater treatment compared with biochar s doped biochar and cds the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of cds s biochar for rhb removal are higher due to the large surface area and sufficient vacant sites 52 different from common metal sulfides such as cds zns fes and cus la2s3 have barely reported in the photocatalytic system due to its diversifying crystalline phases although la2s3 has the promising chemical and physical natures for optical application the transformation of crystalline states such as α β and γ are seriously determined by the synthesis routes and experimental factors 53 54 these la2s3 multiphases are easy to form s defects acting as the active sites for pollutants adsorption and photocatalysis however the fundamental knowledge of la2s3 based composites in adsorption photocatalytic system has not been investigated in previous works to heighten the adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar derived from sugarcane bagasse for tch removal la2s3 modifided biochar with s n codoping la2s3 sn biochar composites were synthesized via one pot sulfurization approach at high temperature in contrast with biochar and s n codoped biochar la2s3 sn biochar composites exhibit the better adsorption and photocatalytic activities the negative surface discharge as well as abundant functional groups is helpful for the electrostatic attraction between tch molecules and vacant sites of la2s3 sn biochar bulks the large surface area of obtained sample can provide abundant active sites for tch adsorption and photocatalysis especially s defects generated from la2s3 multiphases and s n codoped carbon matrix serving as the vacant sites 55 56 in addition z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar boosts the migration and separation of charge carriers leading to the excellent utilization of solar light for pollutants degradation 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of catalysts the reagents and characterization methods of la2s3 sn biochar were described in s1 and s2 of supported information respectively in a typical process 0 22 g la no3 3 6h2o 1 0 g sugarcane bagasse and 0 25 g co nh2 2 were dispersed into 200 ml deionized water with the intensive stirring at room temperature for 0 5 h and then stirred at 333 k to remove h2o after dried at 353 k for 6 h the obtained precursor was mixed with 1 3 g koh in a mortar for 0 5 h and then transferred to a tube furnace after heated to 873 k with a 20 h2s ar flow of 40 ml min 1 and a heating rate of 10 k min 1 the precursor was treated at 873 k for 3 h after cooled down to room temperature the sample was washed with deionized water and c2h5oh for four times and then dried at 343 k for 6 h to obtain 3c la2s3 sn biochar xc la2s3 sn biochar x 1 2 4 and 5 with various la2s3 content were obtained using 0 05 0 11 0 35 and 0 43 g la no3 3 6h2o respectively in addition 3y la2s3 sn biochar y a b d and e with various n doped content were generated using 0 05 0 13 0 50 and 1 00 g urea respectively moreover s doped biochar s biochar s n codoped biochar s n biochar using 0 25 g urea la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar were produced in above system for comparison sugarcane bagasse was treated at 873 k for 3 h with a 20 h2s ar flow of 40 ml min 1 to produce s doped biochar 2 2 adsorption photocatalytic experiment the adsorption photocatalytic performances of la2s3 sn biochar composites in tch removal were evaluated in a 200 ml home made reactor equipped with xe lamp of 400 mw cm2 and the irradiated instance of 20 cm typically 40 mg la2s3 sn biochar bulks were added into 100 ml tch solution of 200 mg l 1 and stirred in dark at 298 k for 60 min to reach the balance of adsorption desorption after irradiated for a certain time interval 2 ml solution was sampled filtered and detected by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 the adsorption isotherms of these samples for tch removal were performed with the tch concentration range of 100 220 mg l 1 at 298 k s2 supported information moreover the adsorption kinetics of biochar based composites were carried on with the addition of 40 mg obtained bulks into 100 ml tch solution of 130 mg l 1 at 298 k s2 supported information according to the above process effects of la2s3 content n doped content inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 fecl3 na2so4 and na3po4 ph and quenchers such as p bq edta 2na and t buoh on the adsorption photocatalysis of la2s3 sn biochar were performed 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of biochar based composites the morphology and texture of biochar based composites were detected by sem and tem s doped biochar fig 1a and b is amorphous and porous structure while s n codoped biochar fig 1e g has much more irregular meso microporous la2s3 is the aggregation consisted of 20 nm nanoparticles fig 1c and d la2s3 nanoparticles are randomly loaded on the surface and in the pore channels of 3 la2s3 s biochar fig 1i k and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 1m o which are further confirmed by tem fig 2 the lattice fringes with the interplanar distance of 0 237 0 276 and 0 313 nm in 3 la2s3 s biochar fig 2c and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 2f are assigned to 222 plane of las2 310 plane of la2s3 and 101 facet of las2 phases respectively edx patterns indicate that s n codoped biochar fig 1h 3 la2s3 s biochar fig 1l and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 1p are successfully prepared the crystal phases of s doped biochar s n codoped biaochar la2s3 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar were observed by xrd fig 3a the weak and broad peak of 20 30 is assigned to the 002 plane of graphitic carbon 57 the peaks of s doped biochar s n codoped biaochar and la2s3 at 29 55 and 30 84 are the 313 and 044 facets of orthorhombic sulfur jcpds no 77 0145 respectively for la2s3 the peaks at 12 65 28 45 44 98 and 52 13 are ascribed to 001 101 110 and 200 planes of la2o2s jcpds 27 0263 the peaks at 32 31 and 51 65 are indexed as 310 and 422 facets of cubic γ la2s3 jcpds 25 1041 the peaks at 23 86 39 09 and 41 85 are assigned to 200 330 and 311 planes of α la2s3 jcpds 21 4059 and the peaks at 21 48 37 82 39 75 43 96 and 49 84 are indexed as 200 222 320 400 and 420 facets of cubic las2 jcpds 25 1042 respectively the above results indicate that la2s3 prepared by high temperature sulfurization is consist of la2o2s la2s3 and las2 phases with s defects for 3 la2s3 s biochar the peaks at 15 60 and 29 68 are assigned to 022 and 313 planes of orthorhombic s jcpds no 77 0145 the peaks at 20 37 26 25 33 49 35 42 37 98 43 32 and 46 16 are ascribed to 312 332 217 008 613 642 and 644 planes of tetragonal la10s14o jcpds no 43 0340 the peaks at 32 48 and 48 75 are assigned to 310 and 332 planes of cubic γ la2s3 jcpds 25 1041 the peaks at 23 77 and 41 85 are assigned to 200 and 311 planes of α la2s3 jcpds 21 4059 the peaks at 28 35 and 44 61 are assigned to 101 and 110 planes of la2o2s jcpds 27 0263 and the peak at 32 48 and 36 65 are assigned to 300 and 311 planes of cubic las2 jcpds 25 1042 respectively in contrast with 3 la2s3 s biochar the peaks intensities of 3 la2s3 sn biochar indexing as 200 facet of α la2s3 101 plane of la2o2s and 300 plane of las2 become stronger while the other peaks become weaker the differences in naked crystal phases induce to the various adsorption and photocatalytic activities of these composites the functional groups of biochar based were detected by ft ir fig 3b the band indexed as the stretching vibration of oh group in s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar locate at around 3400 20 cm 1 respectively 58 the bands of 1675 1500 cm 1 can be assigned to cn cc and no bonds and the bands of 1500 1300 and 900 600 cm 1 are indexed to ch bond 59 the vibration modes of cn co and cs bonds appear at the bands of 1300 900 cm 1 60 the bands of 600 400 cm 1 are ascribed to las and lao bonds 61 these cn co cs las and lao bonds serve as the adsorption sites and electron trappers inducing to the efficient adsorption and visible light response 62 n2 adsorption desorption crvues of s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 3c are the type iv of h4 hysteresis loop indicating the porosity nature the surface areas of la2s3 sn biochar composites table s1 change with la2s3 and n contents since la2s3 nanoparticles loaded on the surface and pore channels the surface area and pore volume of optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar are 954 73 m2 g 1 and 0 266 cm3 g 1 respectively zeta potential plots fig 3d confirm that 3c la2s3 sn biochar exhibits the positive surface discharge at ph of 3 0 5 54 while the negative surface discharge at ph of 5 54 11 0 which favors the adsorption of cationic and amphoteric pollutants via the electrostatic attraction 63 64 uv vis drs spectra fig 3e suggest that la2s3 and biochar based composites exhibit the strong visible light harvesting the interaction between s n codoped biochar and la2s3 slightly enhances the visible light absorption intensity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the estimated band gap energy eg values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar table s2 are respectively 2 47 1 05 and 0 90 ev according to the relationship between flat band potential efb and conduction band energy ecb the calculated ecb values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar are 0 26 0 59 and 0 51 ev respectively hence their corresponding valance band energy evb values are 2 21 0 38 and 0 39 ev respectively it s confirmed that la2s3 and s n codoped biochar can form z scheme junction 37 65 the positive slop of mott schottky plots further indicates the n type nature of la2s3 sn biochar fig 3g for comparison the photocurrent intensity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 3f is higher than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 sn biochar meaning the strong visible light response and fast charge separation of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the smallest arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectrum fig 3h and the weakest intensity of pl spectrum fig 3i suggest that the photoinduced electron hole pairs of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are efficiently separated and transferred at z scheme junction interface expecting the excellent photocatalytic activity the surface compositions and valence states of elements were detected by xps fig s1 for la 3d xps spectrum of la2s3 fig s1a the peaks at 854 60 and 837 92 ev are la 3d3 2 and la 3d5 2 and the peaks at 851 37 and 834 68 ev are their coressponding satellite peaks respectively the binding energies of splitting la3d peaks in 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar shift to the higher values due to the tight contact between la2s3 and functionalized biochar 66 for la2s3 the peaks at 162 64 and 161 39 ev fig s1b are assigend to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 of la2s3 and the peaks at 169 16 ev and 160 22 ev are the so bond of la2o2s and the sla bond of las2 respectively the splitting s 2p peaks of s doped biochar s n codoped biochar 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar belonging to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 shift to the higher binding energies 164 40 0 2 ev 163 20 0 1 ev and the splitting peak indexing as so of functional so3 2 and so4 2 groups shifts to the lower binding energy the peaks defined as sp3 bonded c 3 n and amorphous cc bonds in these biochar composites slightly change and locate at around 285 0 3 ev and 284 10 0 1 ev respectively fig s1c the splitting n 1s peaks indexing as quaternary n and c n c fig s1d also slightly shift and appear at 400 60 0 3 ev and 398 10 0 1 ev respectively for o 1s fig s1e the splitting peaks of la2s3 at 531 56 and 528 88 ev are attributed to o la s defects and lattice oxygen of la2o2s and the peaks of s doped biochar at 531 57 and 528 95 ev are ascribed to oc defects and lattice oxygen in carbon matrix respectively the binding energies of these splitting peaks in s n codoped biochar 3 la2s3 s biochar and 3c la2s3 sn biochar shift to the higher values the various binding energies of valence states are responsible for the difference in adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar based samples for tch removal 3 2 adsorption photocatalysis the adsorption photocatalytic performances of biochar based composites were peformed for the visible light induced degradation of tch 200 mg l 1 the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of s n codoped biochar fig 4a are higher than s doped biochar while lower than pure la2s3 the combied effect of la2s3 and s n codoped biochar boosts the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar and 3 la2s3 s biochar the charge carriers are efficiently separated and tranfered at the junction interface between la2s3 and s n biochar of which the excited electrons are repaidly captured by s n doped biochar meanwhile tch molecules are rapdily diffused from aqueous slution to bulks surface and efficiently absorbed on the vacant sites of junction interface 67 68 in addition the large surface area of obtianed 3c la2s3 sn biochar is likely to provide aboundant active sites for adsorption and photocatalytic reaction the adsorption photocatalytic efficiency of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is thus higher than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar although the amounts of active sites at junction interface increase with the climbing la and n contents the texture strucutre of bulks is seriously destroyed leading to the inferior adsorption and photocatalytic locations for the mass transfer of tch and intermediates on the bulks surface 69 70 the adsorption photocatalytic capacity of la2s3 sn biochar increases and then decreases with an increase in la and n contents fig 4b and c among these composites the optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar with a la content of 15 43 wt and a n content of 0 49 wt presents the best adsorption photocatalytic activity of 98 45 for tch removal within 120 min owing to the z scheme junction for efficient transfer and separation of photo induced charge carriers and the abundant vacant sites for rapid adsorption of tch molecules the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar table s3 is better than the reported materials under solar light irradiation notably the functionalized biochar such as s n doping and la2s3 loading has the dual effect of adsorption and photocatalysis for tch and intermediates removal hence biochar based composites with adsorption and photocatalysis are developed to eradicate pollutants from wastewater the adsorption and photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is affected by inorganic salts and quenchers inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 na2so4 and na3po4 fig 4d restrain the adsorption and photocatalytic capacities of 3c la2s3 sn biochar due to the competitive adsorption between tch molecules and inorganic ions on the vacant sites 55 70 although fecl3 suppresses the adsorption activity it greatly enhances the photocatalytic capacity because of the redox couples of fe2 fe3 for the migration and separation of charge carriers the quenchers including p bq edta 2na and t buoh fig 4e restrain the adsorption and photocatalytic activities of 3c la2s3 sn biochar for tch removal confirming that the photo induced o2 oh and h species are vital for the photocatalytic system with the presence of these active radicals the durability of 3c la2s3 sn biochar for solar light driven removal of tch slightly decines after 5 cycles and the total removal efficienvy of tch decreases from 98 45 to 93 26 fig 4f the deactivation of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is mainly attributed to the photo corrosion for the declined amounts of active sites 3 3 adsorption the adsorption of tch molecules and the desorption of intermediates on the acitve sites play the important roles in the photocatalytic process of 3c la2s3 sn biochar it s essential to discuss the adsorption kinetics and isotherms of biochar based composites for tch removal compared with first order model fig 5a second order model fig 5b is better to describe to the adsorption kinetics of biochar based composites because of the higher r2 values 0 993 0 996 and the lower are values 1 79 8 10 of second order kinetics table s4 the estimated qe value and rate constant of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are resepctively 317 12 mg g 1 and 0 0015 g mg 1 min 1 which are higher than s n codoped biochar and la2s3 it s confirmed that the cooperative effect between s n codoped biochar and la2s3 is likely to enhance the adsorption activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the intra particle diffusion curves fig 5c don t pass through the original point meaning that the rate limiting steps of biochar based composites are the boundary and intra particle diffusion tch molecules rapidly diffuse from aqueous solution to bulks surface and then slowly migrate to the inner pores and intra particles for comparison to freundlich fig 6b and temkin fig 6c models langmuir isotherm fig 6a is better to simulate the experimental data of la2s3 and biochar based composites due to the higher r2 values 0 997 0 998 and the lower are values 0 70 1 44 table s5 the calculated separation factor rl values are lower than 1 0 meaning the excellent reliability of langmuir model for fitting the adsorption isotherms of obtained samples the monolayer adsorption dominates the adsorption process of tch molecules on the bulks surface according to langmuir isotherm the estimated qe value of 3c la2s3 sn biochar is 419 18 mg g 1 which is higher than s n coped biochar 124 83 mg g 1 and la2s3 316 15 mg g 1 the adsorption capacities of biochar based composites are affected by ph inorganic salts la content n content and adsorbent dosage fig 7 the adsorption capcities of la2s3 and biochar based composites decrease with the climbing ph fig 7a it s reported that tch molecules have cationic tch3 existed at ph 3 3 zwitterionic existed at ph at 3 3 7 7 and anionic tch and tc2 species existed at ph 7 7 15 19 due to the positive and negative surface discharges of 3c la2s3 sn biochar appearing at ph of 3 0 5 54 and 5 54 11 0 tch molecules are easily adsorbed at ph 7 7 via the electrostatic attraction while unlikely to adsorb on the bulks surface at ph 7 7 due to the electrostatic repulsion the inorganic salts such as nacl mgcl2 fecl3 na2so4 and na3po4 affect the ph of aqueous solution to some extent restaining the adsorption capacity of la2s3 and biochar based composites fig 7b these ions are competitively adsorbed on the active sites limiting the amounts of tch adsorption in addition the abundant inorganic ions in aqueous solution hamper the transfer of tch molecules at the boundary film of liquid solid phases notably po4 3 is likely to react with h2o to produce anionic hpo4 2 h2po4 and oh species leading to the inferior adsorption of tch in alkaline medium la2s3 and s n codoping are favorable for forming active asites on the surface of biochar notably s defects of la2s3 sever as the vacant sites for adsorption and photocatalysis hence the adsorption capacity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar increases with the climbing la fig 7c and n contents fig 7d the increasing dosage of 3c la2s3 sn biochar provides the more vacant sites for tch adsorption however the limited amounts of tch molecules are rapidly adsorbed at the initial stage and then slowly diffuse from aqueous solution to absorb on the vacant sites at the later stage declining the adsorption capacity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar fig 7e the adsorption capacities of la2s3 and biochar based composites slightly decline after 7 cycles fig 7f 3c la2s3 sn biochar has the better adsorption durability than la2s3 s doped biochar s n codoped biochar and 3 la2s3 s biochar it s indicated that the high temperature sulfurization is a potential route to fabricate biochar based composites with efficient adsorption photocatalytic activity 3 4 adsorption photocatalytic mechanism the various functional groups and s defects as well as the unique surface discharge nature favor the superior adsorption photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the z scheme junction between la2s3 and s n codoped biochar also promotes the efficient migration and separation of electron hole pairs leading to the excellent utilization of visible light 68 69 the functional groups such as cn cs ch cn no nh las and lao bonds on the bulks surface can efficiently adsorb tch molecules through π π interaction of aromatics the h bonds formed between tch and functional groups act as donors or acceptors promoting the fast physisorption of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar 50 these chemical bonds of 3c la2s3 sn biochar are likely to generate the hydrogen bonds at ph 5 54 inducing to the negative surface discharge due to cationic type at ph 3 3 and anionic specie at ph 7 7 the electrostatic repulsion restrains the adsorption of tch at ph 3 3 and ph 7 7 while the electrostatic interaction favors the adsorption of tch at ph of 3 3 7 7 hence the π π interaction h bonding and electrostatic interaction dominate the adsorption process of 3c la2s3 sn biochar the photocatalytic mechanism of 3c la2s3 sn biochar presents in fig 8 the calculated ecb values of la2s3 s n codoped biochar are 0 26 and 0 59 ev and their evb values are 2 21 and 0 38 ev respectively hence la2s3 and s n codoped biochar are easy to form z scheme structure 11 55 the photo generated electrons at the vb of la2s3 efficiently transfer to the cb of s n codoped biochar stimulating the separation and migration of charge carriers at vb and cb of s n codoped biochar due to the cb value of s n codoped biochar 0 59 ev more negative than 0 33 ev the dissolved o2 captures e to generate o2 60 owing to the more positive vb value of la2s3 2 21 ev than 1 99 ev oh oh oh reacts with h to convert oh 16 with the assistance of these radicals the adsorbed tch molecules over 3c la2s3 sn biochar are likely to degrade the harmless intermediates and small molecules although sem and tem images fig s2 indicate that there is no change in the morphology of used 3c la2s3 sn biochar after 7 cycles the photo corrosion changes the valance states of surface composition fig s3 the peaks of la 3d at 854 69 and 837 76 ev fig s3a correspond to la 3d3 2 and la 3d5 2 and the corresponding satellite peaks locate at 851 58 and 834 67 ev respectively for s 2p fig s3b the peak at 167 55 is indexed as the so bond of so3 2 and the peaks at 164 08 and 162 87 ev are ascribed to s 2p1 2 and s 2p3 2 of las bond respectively for n 1 s fig s3c the peaks of sp3 bonded c 3 n and amorphous cc bonds respectively appear at 285 82 and 283 91 ev the peaks at 401 29 and 399 14 ev in n 1s xps spectrum fig s3d are assigned to quaternary n and c n c respectively the peaks at 532 02 and 530 82 ev fig s3e are respectively ascribed to oxygen defects and lattice oxygen the oxygen defects are from the co bond of biochar and o la s bond of la2o2s while the lattice oxygen is the lao bond of la2o2s the changes in valance states of surface elements induce to the declining adsorption and photocatalytic activity of 3c la2s3 sn biochar hence the future work will focus on the improvement in the durability of biochar based composites 4 conclusion la2s3 sn biochar composites efficiently promote the adsorption photocatalytic activity of biochar langmuir and the second order models well describe the adsorption isotherms and kinetics of biochar based composites respectively the adsorption photocatalytic activity of optimal 3c la2s3 sn biochar is better than s doped biochar s n codoped biochar la2s3 and 3 la2s3 s biochar its calculated adsorption capacity is 419 18 mg g 1 and the removal efficiency is 98 45 for 200 mg l 1 tch solution within 120 min however the removal efficiency of tch over 3c la2s3 sn biochar declines from 98 45 to 93 26 after 5 cycles and its adsorption capacity decreases from 313 44 to 286 36 mg g 1 after 7 cycles z scheme junction between la2s3 and sn biochar favors the transfer and separation of photo generated charge carriers boosting the visible light response and solar energy utilization however the photo corrosion

12877,the objective of the study is to reconnoiter the degradation of anti biotics from real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater using a combined electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process by implying for the first time fe zn loaded zeolite 5a as a catalyst in a hybrid reactor doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate were identified in pharmaceutical wastewater and were selected as target antibiotics bod cod and turbidity are the major pollutant indicators in any type of wastewater therefore these were selected and influence by various parameters such as ozone flow 0 8 1 55 mg min catalyst dose 5 15 g l and dc volts 5 15 v were studied moreover degradation efficiencies of the doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate were compared with single ozonation electroflocculation ef catalytic ozonation and combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 the results revealed that combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 has highest elimination efficiency i e 41 77 and 79 of the bod cod and turbidity respectively at optimum parameters values of dc volts 10 v ozone flow 1 1 mg min and catalyst dose 10 g l moreover degradation of anti biotics was also the highest in the case of the ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 process and was 55 57 and 99 for timlisoin phosphate doxycycline and tylosin tartrate respectively in challenging wastewater based on the results of experimental work it is established that the proposed combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 is appropriate for the effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anti biotics electroflocculation catalytic ozonation fe zn zeolite 5a veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction effluents from pharmaceutical wastewater are being identified as emerging contaminants in environmental samples around the globe due to a prompt increase in the squandering of antibiotics 1 2 genotoxic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects on human life animals and vegetation are caused by antibiotics when discharged in wastewater 3 the removal of aforesaid micro contaminants from industrial and metropolitan effluents is one of the foremost challenges nowadays the aforementioned sources of wastewater generate an enormous quantity of contaminants chemical oxygen demand organic carbon biochemical oxygen demand suspended solids and total nitrogen and phosphorus contents 4 5 several research studies have been conducted for their elimination from the community and industrial wastewaters 6 7 the growth of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics in living organisms is stimulated due to the existence of antibiotics in water bodies that may potentially have serious health risks 8 traditional wastewater treatment techniques are found unable to treat the antibiotics due to their persistent nature and resistance to degradation 9 several studies proposed elimination technologies of persistent organic pollutants in wastewater such as electrochemical degradation 10 membrane processes 11 fenton process 12 adsorption 13 biological treatments 14 and a combination of various technologies 15 18 to improve the elimination capacities combined technologies have been established which are also known as hybrid processes among them are processes based on electroflocculation and advanced oxidation processes for the elimination of anthropogenic pollutants and micropollutants 19 21 in the electrocoagulation process voltage is applied through the electrodes which lead to the agglomeration of contaminants through a redox reaction 22 for the decontamination of wastewater different electrochemical and photo assisted electrochemical methods have been studied as well in the electrochemical process metallic electrodes have been used by applying electric current for the elimination of pollutants from wastewater therefore preference was given to the aforementioned method 23 24 in said process harmful organic pollutants of wastewater are transformed into non harmful materials by redox reactions furthermore the aforementioned procedure which is simple to operate has slight consumption of chemicals the least reaction time maximum selective capacity and safety for effective water purification known as sustainable technology 24 25 it is reported that different treatment methods were used for the wastewater which has antibiotics as pollutants but remains ineffective in the inclusive elimination of these pollutants conventional biological treatment methods are green technologies however their treatment time is high and the elimination of antibiotics may be partial 26 27 hybrid processes using aops may be alternative to a standalone system which overcomes the limitation of individual treatment techniques in the hybrid process reaction time and operation cost are minimized and the deprivation and mineralization of antibiotics may be higher 9 28 in the past few years the oxidation process has been contemplated as an effective technique among other technologies for the treatment of real wastewater it is revealed from the studies the performance of the catalytic ozonation is significant among other advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of wastewater 29 31 recent research on the removal of refractory organic pollutants by applying hybrid advanced oxidation processes such as using a falling film reactor has shown effective abatement due to the high transfer rate of reactive oxygen species from the gas phase to the liquid phase 32 33 various aops such as ozonation non thermal dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and photocatalysis were studied and compared with the hybrid aops such as dbd fenton dbd photocatalytic ozonation dbd photocatalytic oxidation processes the research showed that the mineralization of pollutants is greatly enhanced in hybrid aops due to the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical hydrogen peroxide ozone and superoxide 32 33 therefore the application of aops using hybrid advanced treatment methods leads to more efficient treatment of pharmaceuticals hence in the current investigation zeolite 5a based hybrid process using combination of electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation processes was investigated to treat pharmaceutical wastewater zeolites have been employed in some recent findings as highly effective catalysts in catalytic ozonation processes for wastewater treatment 8 34 37 literature reveals that various types of zeolites were used in catalytic ozonation processes and it was observed that metal loaded zeolites were more efficient as compared with those without metal loadings as there would be an increase in the number of lewis acid sites with metal loading 38 they may promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals in a significant proportion that may affect water and wastewater purification 38 some recent findings suggested that multi metal loaded catalysts are more effective as compared with single metal loaded catalysts 39 40 therefore in the current investigation fe zn loaded zeolite was implied in a hybrid electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process to the best of the authors knowledge fe zn loaded zeolite 5a was not previously used for wastewater treatment using the catalytic ozonation process this study is the continuation of the authors studies to test the application of zeolites based hybrid electroflocculation catalytic ozonation processes for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment our previous study was concerned with the application of electroflocculation catalytic ozonation processes using real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater 8 however in the current investigation more in depth study was conducted by preparing more challenging pharmaceutical wastewater and degradation of selected pharmaceuticals doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate was studied in ozonation electroflocculation catalytic ozonation and synergistic process moreover fe zn zeolite 5a was not implied in our previous work in addition to the above cod bod and turbidity removal were also studied and results were compared with the individual anti biotics removed in various processes this study may help to bring environmental and economic benefits to find more sustainable solutions for pollution remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials baariq pharmaceutical industry situated in sundar industrial estate lahore pakistan provided the real wastewater a sample of wastewater was transported after the collection to the lab immediately and stored at 4 c characterization of collected wastewater was performed analytical grade chemicals were

ammonium sulfate used for titration in cod and starch used as an indicator for the determination of cod 29 31 2 2 synthetic wastewater preparation the synthetic wastewater was prepared by spiking known amounts of tylosin tartrate doxycycline and timlicosin phosphate in the real wastewater obtained from baariq pharmaceuticals pvt ltd sunder industrial estate lahore pakistan the wastewater characterization was done before the preparation of synthetic wastewater afterward characterization bod cod and turbidity estimation was carried out for the synthetic wastewater the initial concentrations of studied pharmaceuticals were 50 mg l 100 mg l and 50 mg l for tylosin tartrate doxycycline and timlicosin phosphate in the real wastewater respectively 2 3 catalyst coating process panreac quimica sl pvt ltd is the manufacturer of the catalyst 5a al12ca4 5na3o48si12xh2o used during this research work the aforementioned 5a zeolite catalyst was synthesized by following the procedure illustrated in the literature 41 two different metal salts fe and zinc of each quantity of 18 0 g have been selected for the impregnation process these metal salts were mixed in 120 ml of deionized water then 60 g of aforesaid catalyst was mixed in that solution and evaporation of the solution was started at 100 c along with agitation afterward the bimetal impregnated catalyst was dried in the oven at 102 c and then the catalyst was placed for 6 h in the furnace for calcination at 550 c 41 0 1 molar nitric acid solution was prepared and dried catalyst after calcination was immersed in that prepared acid solution afterward it was rinsed with distilled water till the persistent ph of the water was attained and then the catalyst was placed in the oven again for drying 2 4 lab scale setup the lab scale process setup is illustrated in fig 1 the process reactor which has a rectangular shape contains two metallic electrodes of aluminum whereas one submersible pump for recirculation carries heterogeneous zeolite catalysts at its suction point the ozone generator sky zone da12025b12l karachi pakistan supplied the ozone through the sparger at the base of the reactor which produced bubbles in wastewater while dc power supply was used to supply the electric current the electrodes used were made of aluminum for each batch the reactor was filled with 500 ml of spiked pharmaceutical wastewater during the treatment process treated wastewater samples were drawn through a sample collection point for the post treatment analysis of cod bod turbidity and hplc 2 5 methods

characterized by the following scientific techniques the surface area of the catalyst was studied by the bet method using micromeritics usa asap 2020 analyzer the pore size of the catalyst was 3 212 nm while the surface area was found to be 37 531 m2 g table 1 the mass transfer method opted for the assessment of the isoelectric point and it was 6 4 0 2 43 the scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive x rays edx using zeiss sigma 500 vp germany was used for the elemental analysis of fe zn coated zeolite5a the results presented in table 1 indicate that iron and zinc coatings on zeolite were 16 17 and 19 99 respectively which confirms the zinc and iron impregnation sem images and graphs of coated and non coated catalysts are illustrated in fig 2 the catalyst surface was found to be rough and porous and no significant change in the surface was observed after coating with minute quantities of fe and zn fig 2 a b the edx graphs fig 2 c d presented indicate the coating of metals on the catalyst 5a zeolite catalyst was impregnated with fe zn metal salts and coated and non coated 5a zeolite catalyst was analyzed ftir technique as illustrated in following fig 3 when coated catalyst was analyzed by the ftir process a new peak at 460 cm 1 was found because of fe coating on this catalyst which related to the feoh stretching vibrations 44 similarly vibration bands may relate to feofe stretching vibration 462 and 560 cm 1 45 similarly another peak at 523 cm 1 was found because of zinc coating that relates to the zinc oxide stretching vibrations as the absorption peak at 575 9 cm 1 links to zinc oxide stretching vibrations 46 3 2 optimization of various parameters 3 2 1 voltage optimization in the electroflocculation process variation in voltage may be the key factor that might affect the performance of the treatment process the electroflocculation process was carried out at 5 v 10 v and 15 v for 30 min and the effect of voltage on selected parameters such as cod ntu and bod was studied fig 4 the results indicated the impact of voltage on the aforesaid parameters the cod reduction of 16 21 and 24 were attained at 5 10 and 15 dc volts respectively while bod removal efficiency of 31 38 and 43 was achieved in 30 min at 5 10 and 15 dc volts respectively therefore it can be concluded that an increase in dc voltage also increase the removal efficiency of the aforesaid parameters similarly an increase in dc voltage has shown a significant decreasing effect on wastewater turbidity the initial turbidity value was 331 and 5 10 ntu and 15 dc volts were applied via electrodes which decreased the turbidity up to 93 50 and 42 ntu and the measured removal efficiency was 72 85 and 87 respectively in the early 1900 s various types of the effluent waste stream were treated by the ec process in which a direct current was applied via iron and aluminum electrodes to remove the floating and organic pollutants 17 in this electrochemical process 10 dc volts were selected as the optimum voltage by considering the economy because treatment cost increases with the increase in electrical energy 47 the results shown in fig 5 suggested that at 15 volts maximum removal of pharmaceuticals was observed in synthetic wastewater for example the removal of tylosin tartrate doxycycline and timlicosin phosphate was 18 86 and 31 7 respectively when 15 v was applied the studies further revealed that doxycycline removal efficiency was the highest at all studied voltages as compared with tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate it was hypothesized that it may be due to the different nature and chemistry of pharmaceuticals that may lead to variable responses towards sweep floc mechanism leading to their removal in wastewater in the electroflocculation process 48 3 2 2 ozone flow optimization in the ozonation process an increase in ozone flow leads to an increase in ozone concentration which is highly effective for the treatment of organic contaminants and enhances the treatment efficiency as well 49 51 an increase in ozone flow has a significant effect on the elimination of cod bod and turbidity from pharmaceutical wastewater samples as shown in fig 6 for example the cod elimination was 27 30 and 32 at ozone flow of 0 88 mg min 1 1 mg min and 1 55 mg min correspondingly similar bod was reduced to 39 44 and 48 at aforementioned dose respectively and the removal efficiency of the turbidity was 39 44 and 48 on same aforementioned ozone flows the degradation rate of organic pollutants is high due to the high concentration of ozone in wastewater which also increased the ozone diffusion in the gas liquid interface 49 51 catalyst provides its surface to ozone and a radical based reaction takes place which leads to the elimination of organics pollutants 52 the removal of tylosin tartrate doxycycline and timlicosin phosphate was 76 4 80 and 19 at ozone dose 0 88 mg min while 84 7 74 9 and 22 7 at ozone dose 1 1 mg min 64 3 30 5 and 26 7 at 1 55 mg min ozone dose respectively the removal efficiency of the studied pharmaceuticals was the highest at 1 1 mg min as shown in fig 7 3 2 3 catalyst dose optimization the catalyst has a vital role in the synergic treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater process because of its intensive adsorption property and hydroxyl radical generation ability leading to the reduction of organics it was observed that cod and turbidity values decreased in wastewater with the increase in catalyst dose 5 g 10 g and 15 g in synergic process where iron and zinc loaded zeolite catalyst was used the significant effect of catalyst dose on aforesaid selected parameters is revealed in fig 8 ozone flow 1 1 mg min was kept constant whereas the catalyst dose varied from 5 to 15 g l and removal efficiency was 59 71 and 75 at 5 10 and 15 g l catalyst doses respectively similarly removal efficiency of turbidity was 48 52 and 55 on aforesaid respective doses of catalyst as mentioned earlier catalyst provide the surface area for the adsorption of organics and for the radical reactions which degrade the organic and inorganic pollutants 31 53 although the removal efficiency of cod was high 75 at 15 g l catalyst 10 g l catalyst was selected as the optimum dose because low elimination difference to keep the economy factor the removal of tylosin tartrate doxycycline and timlicosin phosphate was 63 61 and 89 respectively at 5 g l catalyst and fixed ozone dose of 1 1 mg min while 53 44 and 85 at 10 g l catalyst dose and 52 45 and 82 at 15 g l catalyst dose respectively fig 9 the removal efficiency of the studied pharmaceuticals was the highest at 10 g l catalyst and a fixed ozone dose of 1 1 mg min 0 g l 3 2 4 comparison of various processes a comparative study was conducted between various processes o3 ef and fe zn zeolite5a o3 and hybrid process ef fe zn zeolite5a o3 in both challenging and real wastewater in the combined process fe zn zeolite5a catalyst has shown its substantial effect in the removal of organic pollutants from pharmaceutical wastewater 3 2 5 treatment of challenging pharmaceutical wastewater spiked wastewater was treated by different aforesaid processes treated water samples were analyzed by hplc it is pertinent to mention that timlicosin phosphate doxycycline and tylsoin tartrate show resistance towards the electroflocculation process as compared to other processes whereas ozonation and catalytic ozonation seems to be effective for doxycycline and tylosin tartrate but ozonation was not that much effective for timlicosin phosphate fig 10 moreover the combined process seems to be efficient in the removal of all pharmaceuticals and is proven the efficient process during wastewater treatment three different parameters were analyzed from post treated wastewater samples which are cod turbidity and bod electroflocculation seems to be effective for the removal of turbidity in comparison with ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes but the elimination effectiveness of turbidity by the combined process was closer to electroflocculation whereas combined process was more efficient than ozonation in combination with catalyst and only ozonation processes for the elimination of two other parameters bod and cod as shown in fig 11 3 2 6 real wastewater treatment similarly real wastewater was treated and analyzed after treatment the removal efficiency of turbidity by electroflocculation was high as compared to the ozonation and catalytic ozonation but removal efficiency by the combined process was highest whereas combined process was more efficient than the ozonation and catalytic ozonation processes for the elimination of bod and cod as shown in the fig 12 it is also pertinent to mention here that only the combined process reduced the values of turbidity bod and cod within the permissible limits of punjab environment quality standards peqs as shown in fig 13 54 whereas the other treatment processes could not bring all three parameters within the limits araujo et al 2021 55 investigated the pharmaceutical removal using catalytic ozonation with mono and bimetallic zeolite catalyst the degree of mineralization was greatly enhanced in the presence of bimetal loaded zeolites in catalytic ozonation due to a remarkable enhancement in catalytic activity 55 the results shown in the current study fig 12 compares the ef single ozonation with catalytic ozonation and the combined process it was found that the highest removal efficiency was achieved in the case of combined process and about 99 pharmaceuticals removal efficiency was achieved in 30 min in a combined process similar results were reported by araujo et al 2021 55 for the pharmaceutical degradation with complete removal in 60 min the single ef and ozonation processes deem ineffective due to the limitations such as resistances to mass transfer and intermediate formations which are readily demolished by the catalytic ozonation combined process various metal loaded zeolites were studied as heterogeneous catalysts in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ibuprofen by saeid et al 2020 56 it was reported that complete degradation of ibuprofen was achieved after 30 min by catalytic ozonation process gonzález labrada et al 2020 57 investigated the ciprofloxacin degradation by iron oxide nano particles doped zeolites in a heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process the catalytic activity in metal loaded zeolite was enhanced moreover it was reported that the process operates through three mechanisms ozone chemisorption on catalyst surface leading to generation of hydroxyl radicals which degrades pharmaceuticals pollutant chemisorption on catalyst surface and undergoing ozone oxidation chemisorption of ozone and pharmaceuticals on catalyst surface and ultimate interaction between them 57 it is important to mention here that in the current investigation the pharmaceuticals removal was investigated in real wastewater however in the above mentioned studies 56 57 aqueous solutions of pharmaceuticals were used therefore currently proposed combined processes are useful for the treatment of even real pharmaceutical wastewaters 3 2 7 ph changes during studied processes in the case of electroflocculation process a very minor increase in ph was detected the investigation of change in ph during the ozonation and catalytic ozonation process is also important to compare various processes since the change in ph may affect the removal efficiency of pollutants in various processes as the ph changes may alter the overall mechanism of the catalytic ozonation process 58 59 the results presented in fig 14 indicate that during treatment of electroflocculation ozonation catalytic ozonation and combined treatment process ph remain within the range of peqs 54 whereas the initial ph value was 7 1 for studied pharmaceutical wastewater and by applying different processes it varies between 7 2 and 7 7 therefore the slight variation in the ph may not have a significant effect on overall removal efficiencies and mechanisms of studied processes 3 2 8 proposed mechanism pharmaceutical wastewater was spiked with the pharmaceuticals and treated in the hybrid reactor in the reactor aluminum electrodes were used to produce ions and these ions made flocs with hydroxide ions that may adsorb the pollutants via the sweep floc mechanism 8 moreover ozone may directly attack the organic pollutants and brake down the pollutants into co2 and h2o whereas in radical based reactions hydroxyl radicals are formed which remove cod and organic pollutants 8 34 37 the hydroxyl radicals may be generated via ozone interactions with hydroxide ions in the solution or via interactions with surface hydroxyl groups and lewis acid sites on the metal loaded zeolites 8 34 37 fig 15 illustrates the various mechanisms occurring in the reaction tank such as electroflocculation direct oxidation of contaminants by ozone and radical oxidation which considerably improves the generation of hydroxyl radicals and leads to the elimination of organics pollutants in order to understand the mechanism of studied processes whether hydroxyl radical plays an important role in pollutants removal tertiary butyl butanol tba was used as hydroxyl radical s scavenger the results presented in fig 16 clearly suggested that in the case of the combined process the cod removal efficiency was decreased significantly at higher age as compared with other processes for example the cod removal was decreased from 68 to 45 in the case of the combined process however in the case of the catalytic ozonation process the cod removal efficiency was decreased from 44 without tba to 29 fig 16 this may be due to a large number of hydroxyl radicals produced in the combined process the hydroxyl radicals may be generated via electrochemical interactions fig 15 as well as in the catalytic ozonation process as indicated in fig 15 the tba effect study further confirms the dominating hydroxyl radicals based mechanism in the studied combined process 4 conclusions the present research has revealed that the electroflocculation process combined heterogeneous catalytic ozonation employing zeolite catalyst coated with the fe and zn for the reduction of organics is a promising technique in veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater treatment the bod turbidity and cod removal efficiency achieved was 41 79 and 77 in the case of combined process at optimum values of dc 10 v ozone dose 1 1 mg min and 10 g l catalyst dose the results show that the proposed process with bimetal coated zeolite can treat the pharmaceutical industry effluents in minimum time as compared to other traditional processes and may be applied efficiently to approach the effluent quality standards as well the pharmaceutical removal was 55 57 and 100 for timlicosin phosphate doxycycline and tylosin tartrate

12877,the objective of the study is to reconnoiter the degradation of anti biotics from real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater using a combined electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process by implying for the first time fe zn loaded zeolite 5a as a catalyst in a hybrid reactor doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate were identified in pharmaceutical wastewater and were selected as target antibiotics bod cod and turbidity are the major pollutant indicators in any type of wastewater therefore these were selected and influence by various parameters such as ozone flow 0 8 1 55 mg min catalyst dose 5 15 g l and dc volts 5 15 v were studied moreover degradation efficiencies of the doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate were compared with single ozonation electroflocculation ef catalytic ozonation and combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 the results revealed that combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 has highest elimination efficiency i e 41 77 and 79 of the bod cod and turbidity respectively at optimum parameters values of dc volts 10 v ozone flow 1 1 mg min and catalyst dose 10 g l moreover degradation of anti biotics was also the highest in the case of the ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 process and was 55 57 and 99 for timlisoin phosphate doxycycline and tylosin tartrate respectively in challenging wastewater based on the results of experimental work it is established that the proposed combined process ef fe zn zeolite 5a o3 is appropriate for the effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anti biotics electroflocculation catalytic ozonation fe zn zeolite 5a veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction effluents from pharmaceutical wastewater are being identified as emerging contaminants in environmental samples around the globe due to a prompt increase in the squandering of antibiotics 1 2 genotoxic mutagenic and ecotoxicological effects on human life animals and vegetation are caused by antibiotics when discharged in wastewater 3 the removal of aforesaid micro contaminants from industrial and metropolitan effluents is one of the foremost challenges nowadays the aforementioned sources of wastewater generate an enormous quantity of contaminants chemical oxygen demand organic carbon biochemical oxygen demand suspended solids and total nitrogen and phosphorus contents 4 5 several research studies have been conducted for their elimination from the community and industrial wastewaters 6 7 the growth of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics in living organisms is stimulated due to the existence of antibiotics in water bodies that may potentially have serious health risks 8 traditional wastewater treatment techniques are found unable to treat the antibiotics due to their persistent nature and resistance to degradation 9 several studies proposed elimination technologies of persistent organic pollutants in wastewater such as electrochemical degradation 10 membrane processes 11 fenton process 12 adsorption 13 biological treatments 14 and a combination of various technologies 15 18 to improve the elimination capacities combined technologies have been established which are also known as hybrid processes among them are processes based on electroflocculation and advanced oxidation processes for the elimination of anthropogenic pollutants and micropollutants 19 21 in the electrocoagulation process voltage is applied through the electrodes which lead to the agglomeration of contaminants through a redox reaction 22 for the decontamination of wastewater different electrochemical and photo assisted electrochemical methods have been studied as well in the electrochemical process metallic electrodes have been used by applying electric current for the elimination of pollutants from wastewater therefore preference was given to the aforementioned method 23 24 in said process harmful organic pollutants of wastewater are transformed into non harmful materials by redox reactions furthermore the aforementioned procedure which is simple to operate has slight consumption of chemicals the least reaction time maximum selective capacity and safety for effective water purification known as sustainable technology 24 25 it is reported that different treatment methods were used for the wastewater which has antibiotics as pollutants but remains ineffective in the inclusive elimination of these pollutants conventional biological treatment methods are green technologies however their treatment time is high and the elimination of antibiotics may be partial 26 27 hybrid processes using aops may be alternative to a standalone system which overcomes the limitation of individual treatment techniques in the hybrid process reaction time and operation cost are minimized and the deprivation and mineralization of antibiotics may be higher 9 28 in the past few years the oxidation process has been contemplated as an effective technique among other technologies for the treatment of real wastewater it is revealed from the studies the performance of the catalytic ozonation is significant among other advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of wastewater 29 31 recent research on the removal of refractory organic pollutants by applying hybrid advanced oxidation processes such as using a falling film reactor has shown effective abatement due to the high transfer rate of reactive oxygen species from the gas phase to the liquid phase 32 33 various aops such as ozonation non thermal dielectric barrier discharge dbd plasma and photocatalysis were studied and compared with the hybrid aops such as dbd fenton dbd photocatalytic ozonation dbd photocatalytic oxidation processes the research showed that the mineralization of pollutants is greatly enhanced in hybrid aops due to the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical hydrogen peroxide ozone and superoxide 32 33 therefore the application of aops using hybrid advanced treatment methods leads to more efficient treatment of pharmaceuticals hence in the current investigation zeolite 5a based hybrid process using combination of electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation processes was investigated to treat pharmaceutical wastewater zeolites have been employed in some recent findings as highly effective catalysts in catalytic ozonation processes for wastewater treatment 8 34 37 literature reveals that various types of zeolites were used in catalytic ozonation processes and it was observed that metal loaded zeolites were more efficient as compared with those without metal loadings as there would be an increase in the number of lewis acid sites with metal loading 38 they may promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals in a significant proportion that may affect water and wastewater purification 38 some recent findings suggested that multi metal loaded catalysts are more effective as compared with single metal loaded catalysts 39 40 therefore in the current investigation fe zn loaded zeolite was implied in a hybrid electroflocculation and catalytic ozonation process to the best of the authors knowledge fe zn loaded zeolite 5a was not previously used for wastewater treatment using the catalytic ozonation process this study is the continuation of the authors studies to test the application of zeolites based hybrid electroflocculation catalytic ozonation processes for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment our previous study was concerned with the application of electroflocculation catalytic ozonation processes using real veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater 8 however in the current investigation more in depth study was conducted by preparing more challenging pharmaceutical wastewater and degradation of selected pharmaceuticals doxycycline tylosin tartrate and timlicosin phosphate was studied in ozonation electroflocculation catalytic ozonation and synergistic process moreover fe zn zeolite 5a was not implied in our previous work in addition to the above cod bod and turbidity removal were also studied and results were compared with the individual anti biotics removed in various processes this study may help to bring environmental and economic benefits to find more sustainable solutions for pollution remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials baariq pharmaceutical industry situated in sundar industrial estate lahore pakistan provided the real

as the absorption peak at 575 9 cm 1 links to zinc oxide stretching vibrations 46 3 2 optimization of various parameters 3 2 1 voltage optimization in the electroflocculation process variation in voltage may be the key factor that might affect the performance of the treatment process the electroflocculation process was carried out at 5 v 10 v and 15 v for 30 min and the effect of voltage on

catalyst the degree of mineralization was greatly enhanced in the presence of bimetal loaded zeolites in catalytic ozonation due to a remarkable enhancement in catalytic activity 55 the results shown in the current study fig 12 compares the ef single ozonation with catalytic ozonation and the combined process it was found that the highest removal efficiency was achieved in the case of combined process and about 99 pharmaceuticals removal efficiency was achieved in 30 min in a combined process similar results were reported by araujo et al 2021 55 for the pharmaceutical degradation with complete removal in 60 min the single ef and ozonation processes deem ineffective due to the limitations such as resistances to mass transfer and intermediate formations which are readily demolished by the catalytic ozonation combined process various metal loaded zeolites were studied as heterogeneous catalysts in catalytic ozonation for the degradation of ibuprofen by saeid et al 2020 56 it was reported that complete degradation of ibuprofen was achieved after 30 min by catalytic ozonation process gonzález labrada et al 2020 57 investigated the ciprofloxacin degradation by iron oxide nano particles doped zeolites in a heterogeneous catalytic ozonation process the catalytic activity in metal loaded zeolite was enhanced moreover it was reported that the process operates through three mechanisms ozone chemisorption on catalyst surface leading to generation of hydroxyl radicals which degrades pharmaceuticals pollutant chemisorption on catalyst surface and undergoing ozone oxidation chemisorption of ozone and pharmaceuticals on catalyst surface and ultimate interaction between them 57 it is important to mention here that in the current investigation the pharmaceuticals removal was investigated in real wastewater however in the above mentioned studies 56 57 aqueous solutions of pharmaceuticals were used therefore currently proposed combined processes are useful for the treatment of even real pharmaceutical wastewaters 3 2 7 ph changes during studied processes in the case of electroflocculation process a very minor increase in ph was detected the investigation of change in ph during the ozonation and catalytic ozonation process is also important to compare various processes since the change in ph may affect the removal efficiency of pollutants in various processes as the ph changes may alter the overall mechanism of the catalytic ozonation process 58 59 the results presented in fig 14 indicate that during treatment of electroflocculation ozonation catalytic ozonation and combined treatment process ph remain within the range of peqs 54 whereas the initial ph value was 7 1 for studied pharmaceutical wastewater and by applying different processes it varies between 7 2 and 7 7 therefore the slight variation in the ph may not have a significant effect on overall removal efficiencies and mechanisms of studied processes 3 2 8 proposed mechanism pharmaceutical wastewater was spiked with the pharmaceuticals and treated in the hybrid reactor in the reactor aluminum electrodes were used to produce ions and these ions made flocs with hydroxide ions that may adsorb the pollutants via the sweep floc mechanism 8 moreover ozone may directly attack the organic pollutants and brake down the pollutants into co2 and h2o whereas in radical based reactions hydroxyl radicals are formed which remove cod and organic pollutants 8 34 37 the hydroxyl radicals may be generated via ozone interactions with hydroxide ions in the solution or via interactions with surface hydroxyl groups and lewis acid sites on the metal loaded zeolites 8 34 37 fig 15 illustrates the various mechanisms occurring in the reaction tank such as electroflocculation direct oxidation of contaminants by ozone and radical oxidation which considerably improves the generation of hydroxyl radicals and leads to the elimination of organics pollutants in order to understand the mechanism of studied processes whether hydroxyl radical plays an important role in pollutants removal tertiary butyl butanol tba was used as hydroxyl radical s scavenger the results presented in fig 16 clearly suggested that in the case of the combined process the cod removal efficiency was decreased significantly at higher age as compared with other processes for example the cod removal was decreased from 68 to 45 in the case of the combined process however in the case of the catalytic ozonation process the cod removal efficiency was decreased from 44 without tba to 29 fig 16 this may be due to a large number of hydroxyl radicals produced in the combined process the hydroxyl radicals may be generated via electrochemical interactions fig 15 as well as in the catalytic ozonation process as indicated in fig 15 the tba effect study further confirms the dominating hydroxyl radicals based mechanism in the studied combined process 4 conclusions the present research has revealed that the electroflocculation process combined heterogeneous catalytic ozonation employing zeolite catalyst coated with the fe and zn for the reduction of organics is a promising technique in veterinary pharmaceutical wastewater treatment the bod turbidity and cod removal efficiency achieved was 41 79 and 77 in the case of combined process at optimum values of dc 10 v ozone dose 1 1 mg min and 10 g l catalyst dose the results show that the proposed process with bimetal coated zeolite can treat the pharmaceutical industry effluents in minimum time as compared to other traditional processes and may be applied efficiently to approach the effluent quality standards as well the pharmaceutical removal was 55 57 and 100 for timlicosin phosphate doxycycline and tylosin tartrate

12878,this study evaluated the effects of electrode arrangement and aquatic plant selection on the performance of single chamber constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc in the treatment of wastewater containing cr vi the cw mfc with the electrode distance of 10 cm obtained the highest cr vi removal efficiency of 98 8 at 9 h and the largest power density of 37 8 mw m2 short electrode distance would destroy anodic anoxic atmosphere by oxygen secretion of plant roots while large electrode distance would increase the internal resistance of the system in the three sets of cw mfcs with different cathode areas of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 the system with 75 cm2 cathode area achieved the highest maximum power density of 39 9 mw m2 and corresponding cr vi removal efficiency of 90 9 cr vi removal by the cw mfc conformed to first order kinetics and the main cr vi removal mechanisms involved cathodic reduction of cr vi to cr iii cr iii deposition and plant uptake high throughput analysis indicates that lactococcus and streptococcus were key electroactive bacteria for bioelectricity generation while rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga were responsible for cathodic cr vi reduction to select optimal wetland plant with the characteristics of both high cr enrichment capacity and high bioenergy output performance six cw mfcs with different plant species were established scirpus validus cw mfc exhibited better comprehensive performance with maximum power density of 40 6 mw m2 and cr vi removal rate constant of 0 346 h 1 for ensuring high electricity yield and efficient cr vi removal scirpus validus can be selected as the optimal aquatic plant of the cw mfc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wetland plant cr containing wastewater constructed wetland microbial fuel cell electrode distance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chromium a heavy metal is extensively used in social life and industrial production such as electroplating process leather tanning metallurgical manufacture and pharmaceutical production etc which discharge large quantities of wastewaters containing cr ranging from 0 5 mg l to 2 7 105 mg l 1 generally cr occurs in two oxidation forms in the wastewater as follows cr vi and cr iii 2 cr vi is readily soluble and highly toxic in water and can possibly cause cancer and induce gene mutations thus resulting in serious impact on human health and ecological environment consequently the united states environmental protection agency us epa has classified cr vi as one of the most 17 threatening chemical substances to human health 3 compared with cr vi cr iii is less toxic and more easily precipitated from solution in the form of cr oh 3 making it impenetrable into biofilms highly soluble cr vi in the cr industrial wastewater is a major toxic substance posing potential hazards to human beings and the environment and therefore it is particularly necessary to efficiently eliminate cr vi from wastewater before drainage e g maximum allowable cr concentration of 0 1 mg l according to us epa 2 traditional cr vi wastewater treatment technologies e g chemical reagent reduction precipitation method ferrite method and electrolytic reduction method often require a large amount of chemical reagents and electric energy 4 and are increasingly incompatible with current clean production and low carbon industrial model as a result it has become a new trend to develop new environmental friendly and sustainable wastewater treatment technologies so as to reduce cost minimize carbon emissions and recover resources and energy from cr vi wastewater microbial fuel cell mfc is an emerging and sustainable biotechnology for wastewater treatment which can not only remove pollutants from wastewater but also generate a certain amount of bioelectricity energy mfcs provide a new approach for heavy metal cr removal and recovery from wastewater in which organic pollutants serve as electron donors in anodic chamber while metal ions replace oxygen as electron acceptors in cathodic chamber 5 the reduction potential of cr vi i e e0 1 33 v is relatively higher than that of oxygen i e e0 1 23 v so the cell voltage and power outputs of mfc have substantial improvement when highly toxic cr vi is converted into less harmful cr iii by obtaining electrons from the cathode 2 a two chamber mfc operated in batch mode was firstly used for electrochemical reduction of cr vi and after 150 h of reaction 100 mg l cr was almost completely removed and a maximum power density of 150 mw m2 was obtained at current density of 0 04 ma cm2 6 with the further study of the influencing factors of mfc including electrode material 7 electrode modification 8 electrode distance 9 solution ph 10 and cr vi concentration 11 the bioelectricity generation capacity and cr vi reduction rate have been dramatically promoted in the mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater overall mfc technology shows great potential for cr removal and recovery from wastewater but much more work is still needed to further understand cr vi reduction mechanisms and investigate the feasibility of practical applications e g scale up and single chamber design of mfc reactor constructed wetland cw is an artificially intensified ecological engineering technology which relies on natural processes including wetland plant activity soil or matrix adsorption sedimentation and microbial metabolism to eliminate pollutants from wastewater as a sustainable and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technology constructed wetland has been widely recognized and widespread applied in wastewater treatment e g domestic sewage mine drainage and industrial wastewater for several decades 12 mainly due to its easy maintenance low cost and high purification effect etc in particular owing to the high absorption and accumulation capacity of some certain aquatic plants to heavy metals constructed wetlands exhibit outstanding advantages in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater however only a few of plant species such as lemna minor typha latifolia 13 cyperus alternifolius 14 iris pseudacorus 15 pennisetum purpureum and echinochloa pyramidalis 16 etc have been widely used in constructed wetlands to treat cr vi containing wastewater therefore the selection of suitable wetland plants is currently one of the priorities for the design of constructed wetland for treating cr vi wastewater 17 of course for the selection of aquatic plant species the enrichment capacity of cr vi and the tolerance of flooded anoxia should be critically considered as well as adaption to local climate conditions the existence of a natural redox gradient in cw allows the conversion of cw into a novel mfc system i e cw mfc 18 which can simultaneously implement bioelectricity production and wastewater treatment 19 20 for almost a decade the cw mfc technology has been improved in many aspects e g reactor volume power outputs pollutants removal capacity and greenhouse gases mitigation potential 21 23 a lab scale unplanted cw mfc study showed that the efficiency removal of cr vi reached approximately 93 4 at an influent cr vi concentration of 40 mg l 24 for single chamber air cathode cw mfc oxygen diffused from atmosphere into cathode serves as electron acceptor and moreover vertical reactor design can reduce the involvement of proton exchange membrane which is a promising application design the optimization of reactor structure and the selection of aquatic species are considered to be two major factors to boost the performance of cw mfc 25 previous studies have demonstrated that electrode distance has large impacts on the electricity generation performance and pollutant removal efficiency of mfcs at a shorter electrode distance the internal resistance and current loss of mfcs are reduced thus substantially enhancing power outputs 26 27 the electrode surface area is crucial for the electricity improvement of mfcs and previous research shows that the power production was increased by approximately 62 by doubling cathode size 28 generally the internal resistance of mfc consists of mass transfer internal resistance activation internal resistance and ohmic internal resistance among which the activation internal resistance has the most significant influence on cell performance increasing specific electrode surface area involved in electrode reaction can reduce the activation internal resistance of mfcs thus improving power generation 29 currently the electrode optimization of single chamber cw mfc system on cr vi removal and bioelectricity generation including electrode distance and electrode surface area still requires more detailed research according to previous research wetland plant species planted in the cw mfc significantly promote electricity generation performance and pollutants removal effect 30 plant roots can not only increase dissolved oxygen in rhizosphere through aerenchyma tissues but also greatly enhance microbial richness and microbial metabolic activities 31 however the contributions of different aquatic plants to cw mfc performance vary considerably 32 saz et al studied the effects of four plant species i e typha latifolia typha angustifolia juncus gerardii and carex divisa on bioelectricity generation and pollutants elimination and the results showed that typha angustifolia achieved the highest power density of 18 1 mw m2 with stronger wastewater purification ability than the other three plants 33 oodally et al selected three indigenous plant species for cw mfc treatment of wastewater and found that cyperus prolifer obtained much higher power output cod removal and orthophosphate removal than phragmites australis and wachendorfia thyrsiflora 34 the above studies are only confined to the removal of organic pollutants and nutrient elements from wastewater however there are few studies on the effect of different aquatic plants on the cw mfc treatment of cr vi containing wastewater since each plant species has its own ecological requirements and physiological characteristics it also determines the potential for power generation and cr vi removal therefore it is very important to select appropriate aquatic plants with both high bioelectricity yield and high cr enrichment ability for cw mfc treating cr vi wastewater in this study a single chamber cw mfc planted with acorus calamus l was constructed to explore the effects of electrode distance and cathode surface area on bioelectricity generation performance and cr vi removal effect and the optimal electrode distance and cathode surface area were proposed then the removal mechanism of cr vi in the cw mfc was analyzed and discussed finally the impacts of six emergent aquatic plants i e acorus calamus l typha orientalis presl scirpus validus vahl canna indica l iris pseudacorus l and cyperus involucratus rottboll on cw mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater were investigated so as to screen out the most appropriate plant with both high bioelectricity yield ability and high cr enrichment capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device in this experiment cw mfc was a membrane free single chamber air cathode reactor which was composed of a polyacrylic acid plastic bucket with an inner diameter of 15 cm and a height of 25 cm the cw mfc reactor consisted of four layers from bottom to top supporting layer anode layer spacing layer and cathode layer fig s1 the supporting layer and spacing layer were filled with pebbles with a diameter of 2 cm and the cathode layer and anode layer were filled with pebbles with a diameter of 5 mm the electrode distance of the cw mfc was changed by altering the filling height of the spacing layer two layers of carbon felt cf sandwiched with stainless steel wire mesh ssm 16 mesh were used to form the system electrode which was braided and fixed with 0 5 mm titanium wire and embedded into the cathode layer and anode layer respectively as the cathode and anode of the system the cf used in this experiment thickness of 2 mm was purchased from tianjin carbon factory the cf was successively modified with 1 m sodium hydroxide and 1 m nitric acid before use a square hole was cut in the middle of the cf to facilitate aquatic plant planting the external circuit of the cw mfc was connected with a 1000 ω resistor by copper wire 2 2 sludge inoculation and acclimation anaerobic sludge was collected from xi an no 4 sewage treatment plant the retrieved sludge was added into nutrient solution for 10 days of acclimation and culture to guarantee the growth of wetland plants and anodic anaerobic microorganisms the nutrient solution included c 0 80 g l glucose n 0 15 g l nh4cl p 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs k 0 13 g l kcl and a certain amount of trace elements as detailed in similar reference 19 and the pbs could avoid excessive ph fluctuation in the process of cr wastewater treatment 300 ml of acclimated concentrated anaerobic sludge was injected into the anode layer of each cw mfc for membrane hanging wetland plants were cultured in the laboratory for 1 week and then transplanted to the cathode layer of the system in this experiment intermittent operation mode was adopted peristaltic pump was used to add nutrient solution to the cw mfc reactor at a flow rate of 0 3 ml s and the nutrient solution was replaced every three days the water level was maintained at the highest surface of the cathodic cf and distilled water was added twice daily to allow for evaporation of water during the cw mfc startup the output voltage varied gradually with time when the output voltage reached the maximum value for three consecutive periods and the variation curves of cell voltage versus time were essentially consistent the system was regarded as successfully started 2 3 cw mfc operation and experiment process three experiments were carried out in this study firstly three groups of cw mfcs were prepared with electrode distance set at 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm respectively then three sets of reaction devices were designed with electrode distance of 10 cm and cathodic cf surface area of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 respectively aquatic plant acorus calamus l was planted in the cathode layer of the cw mfc in both above experiments finally six cw mfcs were planted with different aquatic plants to ensure the comparability of the experiment plant species with similar weight were selected as follows acorus calamus l 4 plants 107 4 g typha orientalis presl 7 plants 101 5 g scirpus validus vahl 5 plants 103 5 g canna indica l 2 plants 110 6 g iris pseudacorus l 5 plants 101 6 g and cyperus involucratus rottboll 5 plants 105 3 g the cathode surface area of the above cw mfcs was set at 75 cm2 and the electrode distance was set at 10 cm in this experiment synthetic cr vi wastewater was composed of nutrient solution and analytical pure potassium dichromate to reduce the negative effects of cr vi toxicity on microorganisms and aquatic plants e g plant death synthetic wastewater with low cr vi concentration of 12 mg l was used to carry out research e g the cr vi concentration of rinsing wastewater or combined wastewater with tanning wastewater produced by tannery industry is typically 30 mg l 17 during the experiment 0 5 ml water solutions were sampled from the cathode layer anode layer and spacing layer of the cw mfc reactor with a syringe respectively and mixed together the samples were taken every hour and the samples were filtered with microporous membrane before measurement all the experiments were carried out at the room temperature of 25 c 2 4 analysis and calculation during the electrochemical test the voltage of each cw mfc was continuously monitored a variable resistance box was connected to the cw mfc and the resistance value was changed from 10 000 ω to 5 ω after the stability of the cw mfc the voltage value was recorded multifunctional digital multimeter was used to measure and monitor the voltage of each cw mfc the power density mw m2 and current density ma m2 of the cw mfc were obtained by dividing the power and current by the effective area m2 of the anode the power density curves and polarization curves were used to evaluate the power generation performance of the cw mfc the total internal resistance of the system was calculated from the slope of the linear region of the polarization curve anode and cathode potentials were separately determined against a silver silver chloride reference electrode ag agcl 0 198 v vs she the concentration of cr vi was measured according to the national standard of china gb t7467 1987 water quality determination of chromium hexavalent diphenyl carbazide spectrophotometric method in acidic solution cr vi reacted with 1 5 diphenylcarbazide and then the absorbance of the solution was measured by spectrophotometry at 540 nm total cr concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 715es agilent inc usa and cr iii concentration was calculated by subtracting cr vi concentration from total cr concentration in this study the reduction kinetics of cr vi was regressed according to first order kinetic equation as follows 1 ln c t c 0 kt where k is the first order rate constant ct is the concentration of cr vi at time t and c0 is the initial concentration of cr vi after the experiment cathodic cf was taken out and dried in a vacuum drying oven the morphology of cathodic cf was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm5400 jeol japan and element composition and the proportion of the reduced substance attached to the cf were analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer eds inca x max oxford instruments uk to further determine the composition and valence state of the elements on the electrode surface cathodic cf was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab xi thermo scientific usa microbes attached to the anodic cathodic cf were ultrasonically collected and genomic dna was extracted and purified the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr to target the v3 v4 region shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd china and the microbial compositions of anodic cathodic biofilm were analyzed according to liu et al 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of electrode distance on power generation and cr vi removal electrode distance is a vital factor to determine the internal resistance and power output of cw mfc since it is directly related to the transfer distance of protons between anode and cathode in the solution fig 1a shows that under open circuit condition the voltages of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs with distances of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm were 659 mv 683 mv and 634 mv respectively with the increase of the current density the cell voltage of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs decreased and the order of cell voltage outputs at different electrode distances was as follows 10 cm 5 cm 15 cm the maximum power density of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distance 10 cm reached 37 8 mw m2 which was much higher than that at 5 cm 22 4 mw m2 and 15 cm 15 9 mw m2 fig 1b shows that as current output increased the cathode potentials of the three cw mfcs with different electrode distances changed smoothly while the anode potentials exhibited distinct change trends the 10 cm electrode distance achieved the lowest anode potential with shallow slope however the electrode distances of 5 cm and 15 cm resulted in sharp increases in anode potentials i e much steeper slopes which were mainly attributed to anodic mass transfer losses small electrode distance e g 5 cm could make it easier for oxygen to diffuse into the anode region which would inhibit the metabolism of anodic anaerobic microorganisms e g electro active bacteria eab and affect the electricity generation performance of the cw mfc when the electrode distance was too large e g 15 cm the internal resistance of the cw mfc increased which was not conducive to the flow and mass transfer of substrates and products thus reducing the power output the cw mfc with electrode distance of 10 cm gained the highest power output which is consistent with the results of similar previous studies zhou et al studied the influence of electrode distance 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm on the treatment of cr vi wastewater by a two chamber mfc and found that the highest power density of 535 4 mw m2 was achieved at electrode distance of 2 cm 9 xie et al designed three cw mfcs with different electrode distances 8 cm 13 cm and 18 cm for treating nitrobenzene wastewater and the system with electrode distance of 13 cm obtained the best electricity production capacity mainly because the reduction of the electrode distance effectively reduced the internal resistance of the system which was conducive to the flow and mass transfer of reactants 36 to better clarify the reason of the power generation differences of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs at different electrode distances the total internal resistances of the three cw mfcs were calculated according to the linear fit of polarization curves as shown in fig s2 the internal resistance of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distance of 10 cm was the lowest only 302 4 ω however the internal resistances of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distances of 5 cm and 15 cm were 62 4 and 115 1 higher than that at 10 cm which were 491 0 ω and 650 4 ω respectively as the electrode distance increased from 10 cm to 15 cm the enhanced total internal resistance of the acorus calamus l cw mfc was mainly caused by an increased transfer distance of protons generated by electricity producing microorganisms from the anode to the cathode and the internal mass transfer resistance of the system increased thus leading to power decline however when the electrode distance was 5 cm oxygen diffused from air or secreted from plant roots would enter into the anodic region and consume a certain number of electrons the consumed electrons would not reach the cathode to form a current resulting in an increase of internal mass transfer resistance and the decrease of power output 37 short electrode distance is favorable for power generation of a typical two chamber mfc however in single chamber cw mfc too short electrode distance can easily lead to oxygen diffusion into the anode region which destroys the anaerobic condition of the anode and is detrimental to bioelectricity generation fig 2a shows the influence of electrode distance on cr vi removal after 9 h the removal efficiencies of cr vi in the three cw mfcs were all above 93 during the operation the removal efficiency of cr vi was the highest in the cw mfc with 10 cm electrode distance followed by the cw mfc with 5 cm electrode distance and the removal efficiency of cr vi was the worst in the cw mfc with 15 cm electrode distance the results show that the cr vi removal efficiencies of the three cw mfcs with different electrode distances were consistent with their respective power generation performance the removal kinetics of cr vi were studied and it was found that cr vi removal accorded with the first order kinetics r2 0 94 which was consistent with the previous study of bio electrochemical cr vi removal in lolium perenne plant mfcs 38 it can be seen more clearly from fig 2b that the cr vi removal rates by the three cw mfcs were quite different the cr vi removal rate constant in the cw mfc with 10 cm electrode distance was the largest 0 471 h 1 and the removal rate constants of cr vi in the cw mfcs with electrode distance of 5 cm and 15 cm were much smaller only 0 343 h 1 and 0 318 h 1 respectively indicating that the electrochemical process might play a major role in accelerating the reduction of cr vi the electrode distance of the cw mfc was set at 10 cm which not only created conditions conducive to the power generation as much as possible but also provided suitable conditions for the removal and recovery of cr vi in conclusion considering the power generation performance and cr vi removal efficiency of the cw mfc system it is the best scheme to set the electrode distance to 10 cm 3 2 effects of electrode surface area on power generation and cr vi removal fig 3a shows that the cell voltages and power densities generated from the three cw mfcs with different cathode areas were considerably different at the same current densities the open circuit voltages of the cw mfcs with cathode area of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were 793 mv 828 mv and 831 mv respectively indicating that increasing the cathode surface area might be beneficial to the enhancement of cathode potential and cell voltage 10 28 however with the increase of current density the order of voltage outputs was as follows 75 cm2 100 cm2 25 cm2 and similarly the cathode surface area of 75 cm2 resulted in the highest power generation performance of the cw mfc followed by 100 cm2 and finally 25 cm2 the maximum power densities of the cw mfcs with cathode areas of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were 20 8 mw m2 42 9 mw m2 and 28 5 mw m2 respectively fig 3b shows that when the cathode area was 25 cm2 with the increase of the current density the anode potential of the cw mfc changed little while the cathode potential decreased sharply indicating that the voltage output was mainly limited by the cathodic reduction reaction of cr vi i e cathodic mass transfer loss 10 for the cw mfc with cathode area of 75 cm2 the variation trends of anode potential and cathode potential versus current density were essentially similar i e comparison between increase slop of anode potential and decrease slop of cathode potential and the output of electricity generation was stable however when the cathode area continued to increase to 100 cm2 with the increase of current density the change of cathode potential was rather small while the anode potential increased sharply indicating that the power generation was probably limited by the insufficient supply of anode electrons i e anodic mass transfer loss 19 the total internal resistances of the three cw mfcs were calculated according to the polarization curve as shown in fig s3 the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 25 cm2 was 739 31 ω and the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 75 cm2 was 419 88 ω this is because with the increase of the cathode surface area the actual area involved in the reaction increased which reduced the cathodic mass transfer losses of the cw mfc and enhanced the power generation performance on the other hand since the increase of the cathode area promoted the transfer and consumption of protons the accumulation of anode protons was alleviated which would be conducive to the growth of anode electricity producing bacteria in a similar study of tubular h type biocathode mfcs treating cr vi wastewater when cathode to anode surface area ratio c a was increased from 3 to 20 the power outputs improved from 6 8 w m3 to15 w m3 while the internal resistance decreased from 231 ω to 82 ω 10 in this study the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 100 cm2 was 610 85 ω which was much larger compared with the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 75 cm2 this might be because the cathodic mass transfer losses of the cw mfc would not decrease as the cathode area of cw mfc increased to a certain extent while the ohmic resistance caused by too large cathode area increased the internal resistance of the system which was unfavorable to the power generation fig 4a shows the removal efficiencies of cr vi in the cw mfcs with different cathode surface areas it can be seen that the removal rate of cr vi accelerated with the increase of cathode area of the cw mfc at 9 h the cr vi removal efficiency of the cw mfc with cathode area of 25 cm2 reached 75 6 while the cr vi removal efficiency of cw mfcs with cathode area of 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were above 90 96 8 and 98 9 respectively with the increase of the cathode area the mass transfer rate on the cathode accelerated and so did the reactions of electrons protons and cr vi in the cw mfc system on the other hand the larger cathode area also provided sufficient adhesion area for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms especially a certain amount of catalystic bacteria and thereby would greatly reduce the activation overpotential of the biocathode i e cathodic activation losses 10 moreover the increase of microbial population would promote the assimilation and alienation of cr vi by microorganisms 5 and thus the removal ability of cr vi by the cw mfc with larger cathode area was strengthened fig 4b shows that the highest cr vi removal rate constant of 0 464 h 1 was obtained in the cw mfc with cathode area of 100 cm2 followed by the cw mfc with cathode area of 75 cm2 0 406 h 1 and then the cw mfc with cathode area of 25 cm2 0 203 h 1 as a result from the comprehensive consideration of the power generation performance and the removal rate of cr vi the design of cathode surface area of 75 cm2 is more suitable for the cw mfc treating cr vi wastewater 3 3 cr vi removal mechanism analysis to determine the removal mechanisms of cr vi in the cw mfc the cathodic cf was collected after the experiments and its surface morphology was analyzed it can be seen that the surface of original cf was smooth and clean fig 5a and a considerable amount of solid substance was attached to the surface of cathodic cf after a period of operation fig 5c to further determine the possible element composition of the attachment on the cathodic cf energy spectrum analysis was conducted fig 5d shows that c o cr p and s were mainly detected on the surface of cathodic cf after operation in the original cf fig 5b the percentages of c by weight and atom were 88 79 and 91 73 respectively the weight percentage and atomic percentage of o were 10 05 and 7 79 respectively cr content was 0 after the cw mfc operated for a period of time the weight percentage of c in the cathodic cf was 77 39 and the atomic percentage was 88 85 the weight percentage of o was 8 06 and the atomic percentage was 6 94 the weight percentage of cr was 12 72 and the atomic percentage was 3 37 by comparing the cathodic cf surface before and after operation it can be found that the p content on the cathodic cf surface increased after operation which might be due to attachment of microorganisms onto the cf surface the proportion of cr also increased and there was o existed on the cathodic cf surface so it is speculated that cr containing oxidizing substances such as cr2o3 and cr oh 3 might be deposited on the surface of cathodic cf to analyze the specific form of cr on the surface of cathodic cf xps was used to scan and analyze the cathodic cf the full spectrum of xps scan can detect most of the elements contained in the sample as shown in fig s4 including c o cr and other elements two peaks of binding energy of 577 6 ev and 586 5 ev appeared in the scanning curve of cr 2p on the cathodic cf and these two peaks have been shown to correspond to the binding energy of cr iii in cr oh 3 precipitation 39 this result indicates the deposition of cr iii on the surface of the cathodic cf after the operation of the cw mfc cathodic cf was recovered and its cr content was determined the dry weight of cathodic cf was 17 97 g and the concentrations of cr iii and cr vi in the cathodic cf reached 239 07 mg kg and 37 52 mg kg respectively so the proportion of cr iii in the cr deposition of the cathodic cf was up to 86 43 the total cr content in the cathodic cf accounted for 46 02 of cr vi removal in addition after removing the matrix a small amount of sediment i e mainly cr oh 3 was observed at the bottom of the cw mfc with a dry weight of 0 42 g and cr iii concentration of 3600 mg kg the cr content in the bottom sediment accounted for 14 00 of cr vi removal it should be noted that before precipitation cr vi should be firstly reduced to cr iii 40 which then combined with oh and transformed into cr oh 3 precipitate 39 part of the produced cr iii was deposited directly on the surface of the cathodic cf while a small amount of cr iii migrated and deposited at the bottom of the reactor as a result the contribution ratio of cathodic reduction to cr vi removal was approximately 53 78 in addition to cathodic reduction and deposition plant uptake also contributed significantly to cr removal in the treatment of cr vi wastewater by the acorus calamus l cw mfc table 1 shows that the cr enrichment capacity of acorus calamus l roots was much higher than that of stems and leaves wang et al also found similar results that average cr enrichment concentrations in roots and shoots of acorus calamus l were 164 4 mg kg and 77 9 mg kg respectively 41 in the acorus calamus l cw mfc the cr enrichment concentrations in roots stems and leaves were 902 82 mg kg 261 80 mg kg and 41 59 mg kg respectively and the contribution ratios of roots stems and leaves to cr removal were 11 87 7 81 and 1 83 respectively it can be clearly observed from table 1 that the cw mfc system promoted plant growth and the biomass of roots stems and leaves in the cw mfc system increased by 13 59 34 06 and 29 28 respectively compared with traditional cw system the contribution ratio of plant uptake to cr removal in the acorus calamus l cw mfc was 4 96 higher than that in the cw system indicating that the incorporation of mfc into cw enhanced the cr enrichment capacity of acorus calamus l consistent with previous research results 25 on one hand the micro current environment of the cw mfc promoted the conversion of cr vi to cr iii and thus reduced the toxicity of cr which would be more conducive to plant growth and plant uptake of cr on the other hand higher biomass of plants in the cw mfc could improve microbial activity e g eab and generate more bioelectricity 42 thus promoting cathodic electrochemical reduction of cr vi to cr iii and total cr removal in conclusion plant physiological activities e g plant growth root secretion of oxygen and plant uptake of cr and microbial electricity production are complementary in the cw mfc system fig 6 shows the relative abundances of main genera on the anode and cathode of the acorus calamus l cw mfc specifically the five domain genera in the cathodic biofilm included nitrospira 8 97 saccharimonadales 6 09 nakamurella 4 49 rhodobacter 3 97 and ferruginibacter 3 23 among them nitrospira nitrifying bacteria was related to nitrogen removal 43 44 and rhodobacter was responsible for cr vi reduction as its ability to reduce cr vi has been previously reported 45 moreover hydrogenophaga one of cr vi reducing bacteria 46 was also enriched on the cathode with a relative abundance of 2 12 further indicating that cr vi could be effectively bio reduced to cr iii in the cathodic region for the anodic biofilm the top five genera consisted of lactococcus 41 02 streptococcus 37 97 clostridium 2 23 bacteroidetes 1 28 and paludibacter 1 11 notably lactococcus and streptococcus were substantially enriched in the anodic biofilm of the cw mfc and these genera has been demonstrated to participate in the process of bioelectricity production and promote extracellular electron transfer 47 according to the above analysis the main possible mechanism of cr vi removal in the cw mfc system was proposed the electric producing microorganisms e g lactococcus and streptococcus on the anode oxidized organic matter to produce protons and electrons and the protons moved to the cathode under the action of electric field while the electrons transported to the cathode via external circuit when there exists protons and electrons in the cathode the reduction reaction of cr vi into cr iii would occur under the function of cr reducing bacteria e g rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga as shown in eq 2 under a certain ph condition e g 6 5 11 soluble cr iii was converted to cr oh 3 precipitation according to the mass balance of cr in the acorus calamus l cw mfc system cr vi was mainly removed by cathodic electrochemical reduction 53 78 and plant uptake 21 50 2 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o 3 4 effects of plant species on power generation and cr vi removal fig 7 shows different cell voltages and power densities were obtained form six cw mfcs planted with different plant species during the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater the order of the maximum power densities of different cw mfcs with different plant species was as follows cyperus involucratus rottboll cw mfc 47 4 mw m2 scirpus validus cw mfc 40 6 mw m2 acorus calamus l cw mfc 37 8 mw m2 canna indica l cw mfc 36 6 mw m2 typha orientalis presl cw mfc 29 9 mw m2 iris pseudacorus l cw mfc 14 1 mw m2 to explore the reasons for the difference of the electricity generation performance of the six cw mfcs the total internal resistances of the six cw mfcs were calculated by using the polarization curve fig s5 the effect of different wetland plant species on the total resistances of the cw mfcs followed the order cyperus involucratus rottboll 236 2 ω scirpus validus 251 6 ω canna indica l 282 4 ω acorus calamus l 315 6 typha orientalis presl 330 0 ω iris pseudacorus l 498 2 ω the results indicate that the power outputs of the cw mfcs with different plant species were closely related to the total internal resistance of the system negative correlation generally wetland plant rhizosphere can improve the abundance and activities of microorganisms in the cathode layer thus promoting oxygen reduction or cr vi reduction reactions of the cw mfc different plant species at the cathode have different influences on the internal resistance of the cw mfc system as previously reported the cw mfcs planted with canna indica 400 ω and arundo donax 399 ω had much lower internal resistances than those with cyperus alternifolius l 1000 ω and acorus calamus 5000 ω so they obtained higher power outputs of 18 56 mw m2 and 17 41 mw m2 respectively 48 similarly in this study the cyperus involucratus rottboll cw mfc with the lowest total internal resistance of 236 2 ω achieved the highest power generation of 47 4 mw m2 fig 8a shows the change of cr vi concentration in the cw mfcs with six different plant species in the acorus calamus l cw mfc the cr vi concentration decreased at the fastest rate and the cr vi removal efficiency reached 88 1 at 4 h and 98 8 after 9 h operation it was followed by the cw mfcs with scirpus validus and cyperus involucratus rottboll and the cr vi removal efficiencies were 97 5 and 96 0 respecitively the eliminations of cr vi were much lower in the canna indica l cw mfc and typha orientalis presl cw mfc only 90 7 and 85 5 respectively the worst cr vi removal effect was observed in the iris pseudacorus l cw mfc only 82 4 fig 8b shows the cr vi removal kinetics analysis for the cw mfcs with six different plant species and the removal of cr vi accorded with the first order kinetic reaction r2 0 95 the order of cr vi removal rate constant of cw mfcs affected by different plant species was as follows acorus calamus l 0 471 h 1 scirpus validus 0 346 h 1 cyperus involucratus rottboll 0 316 h 1 canna indica l 0 248 h 1 typha orientalis presl 0 214 h 1 iris pseudacorus l 0 161 h 1 as well known the cr vi removal from wastewater in a single chamber cw mfc is the result of the synergistic effect of microbial electrochemistry and plant uptake 49 on one hand the cw mfc system with high electricity output is conducive to the cathodic reduction reaction of cr vi 50 previous studies have demonstrated that scirpus validus has high tolerance and adaptability to heavy metals e g cr hg ni and pb and its rhizosphere has a strong promoting effect on microbial diversity and abundance 51 especially for eab including geobacter and ferruginibacter 52 so the scirpus validus cw mfc achieved the highest power output thus enabling efficient and rapid removal of cr vi from wastewater on the other hand wetland plants also play important roles in the absorption transfer and enrichment of soluble cr vi during cw mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater previous research show that acorus calamus l has a strong tolerance and enrichment ability to cr 41 and moreover it possesses high cr translocation factor from root to shoot up to 0 115 0 608 53 this is the exact reason that acorus calamus l cw mfc obtained the highest cr vi removal effect even though its electricity output was in the general level fig 7 nevertheless considering both electricity generation and cr vi removal efficiency scirpus validus is the most suitable wetland plant to improve cw mfc treatment of cr containing wastewater 3 5 prospects and challenges of using cw mfc to treat cr vi wastewater up to now numerous laboratory studies have been conducted on the treatment of cr vi wastewater by using double chamber mfc 2 or single chamber cw mfc 49 however in order to achieve the practical application of cw mfc for treating cr vi containing wastewater more further in depth research are still needed including reactor scale up construction cost reduction bioelectricity generation optimization and carbon limited wastewater treatment moreover prior to the cw mfc treatment physical chemical treatments are recommended as a pretreatment process to reduce cr vi concentration in industrial wastewater and thus avoid the toxicity of cr vi to eab and aquatic plants firstly for large scale cw mfc the bioelectricity production can be enhanced to some extent by increasing cathode surface area however the occupied area of land and construction cost would also increase accordingly so it is particularly important to optimize the cathode area generally platinum or other noble metal based catalysts are common catalysts of cathodic reduction of cr vi in conventional small size mfcs but not feasible for large scale cw mfcs by contrast biological cathode i e microbial catalytic cathode shows great promise for increasing power generation without use of noble metal catalysts 19 secondly there are great differences in cr vi tolerance and enrichment capacity of wetland plants so much work is needed to screen appropriate aquatic plant species with both high bioelectricity production ability and high cr vi enrichment capacity particularly according to local climate conditions e g scirpus validus acorus calamus l and cyperus involucratus rottboll moreover it is necessary to control the negative effect of oxygen diffusion e g from plant roots or the atmosphere on the anode e g electrode distance of 10 cm at least especially while increasing the specific surface area of the cathode in the membrane free cw mfc on the whole it is very promising but challenging to treat cr vi containing wastewater by single chamber large scale cw mfc in the future 4 conclusion electrode distance and cathode surface area had important influences on bioelectricity generation and cr vi removal in the cw mfcs the experimental results showed that electrode distance of 10 cm resulted in the highest maximum power density of 37 8 mw m2 which was approximately 1 7 and 2 4 times that of 5 cm 22 4 mw m2 and 15 cm 15 9 mw m2 respectively the cw mfc with electrode distance of 10 cm achieved the highest removal efficiency of cr vi up to 98 8 at 9 h by comparing the power generation performance and cr vi removal effect of three cw mfcs with different cathode surface areas it was concluded that the order of power density was as follows cathode area of 75 cm2 cathode area of 100 cm2 cathode area of 25 cm2 while the order of cr vi removal was cathode area of 100 cm2 cathode area of 75 cm2 cathode area of 25 cm2 comprehensively cathode area of 75 cm2 was optimal six wetland plant species including typha orientalis presl scirpus validus canna indica l iris pseudacorus l cyperus involucratus rottboll and acorus calamus l were selected for cw mfc treatment of cr vi containing wastewater among them the power outputs of the cw mfcs planted with cyperus involucratus rottboll and scirpus validus were much better than that of other plants and the removal efficiencies of cr vi by the cw mfcs planted with acorus calamus l and scirpus validus were at relatively high levels as a result it was considered that scirpus validus as a wetland plant of the cw mfc was the

12878,this study evaluated the effects of electrode arrangement and aquatic plant selection on the performance of single chamber constructed wetland microbial fuel cell cw mfc in the treatment of wastewater containing cr vi the cw mfc with the electrode distance of 10 cm obtained the highest cr vi removal efficiency of 98 8 at 9 h and the largest power density of 37 8 mw m2 short electrode distance would destroy anodic anoxic atmosphere by oxygen secretion of plant roots while large electrode distance would increase the internal resistance of the system in the three sets of cw mfcs with different cathode areas of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 the system with 75 cm2 cathode area achieved the highest maximum power density of 39 9 mw m2 and corresponding cr vi removal efficiency of 90 9 cr vi removal by the cw mfc conformed to first order kinetics and the main cr vi removal mechanisms involved cathodic reduction of cr vi to cr iii cr iii deposition and plant uptake high throughput analysis indicates that lactococcus and streptococcus were key electroactive bacteria for bioelectricity generation while rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga were responsible for cathodic cr vi reduction to select optimal wetland plant with the characteristics of both high cr enrichment capacity and high bioenergy output performance six cw mfcs with different plant species were established scirpus validus cw mfc exhibited better comprehensive performance with maximum power density of 40 6 mw m2 and cr vi removal rate constant of 0 346 h 1 for ensuring high electricity yield and efficient cr vi removal scirpus validus can be selected as the optimal aquatic plant of the cw mfc graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords wetland plant cr containing wastewater constructed wetland microbial fuel cell electrode distance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chromium a heavy metal is extensively used in social life and industrial production such as electroplating process leather tanning metallurgical manufacture and pharmaceutical production etc which discharge large quantities of wastewaters containing cr ranging from 0 5 mg l to 2 7 105 mg l 1 generally cr occurs in two oxidation forms in the wastewater as follows cr vi and cr iii 2 cr vi is readily soluble and highly toxic in water and can possibly cause cancer and induce gene mutations thus resulting in serious impact on human health and ecological environment consequently the united states environmental protection agency us epa has classified cr vi as one of the most 17 threatening chemical substances to human health 3 compared with cr vi cr iii is less toxic and more easily precipitated from solution in the form of cr oh 3 making it impenetrable into biofilms highly soluble cr vi in the cr industrial wastewater is a major toxic substance posing potential hazards to human beings and the environment and therefore it is particularly necessary to efficiently eliminate cr vi from wastewater before drainage e g maximum allowable cr concentration of 0 1 mg l according to us epa 2 traditional cr vi wastewater treatment technologies e g chemical reagent reduction precipitation method ferrite method and electrolytic reduction method often require a large amount of chemical reagents and electric energy 4 and are increasingly incompatible with current clean production and low carbon industrial model as a result it has become a new trend to develop new environmental friendly and sustainable wastewater treatment technologies so as to reduce cost minimize carbon emissions and recover resources and energy from cr vi wastewater microbial fuel cell mfc is an emerging and sustainable biotechnology for wastewater treatment which can not only remove pollutants from wastewater but also generate a certain amount of bioelectricity energy mfcs provide a new approach for heavy metal cr removal and recovery from wastewater in which organic pollutants serve as electron donors in anodic chamber while metal ions replace oxygen as electron acceptors in cathodic chamber 5 the reduction potential of cr vi i e e0 1 33 v is relatively higher than that of oxygen i e e0 1 23 v so the cell voltage and power outputs of mfc have substantial improvement when highly toxic cr vi is converted into less harmful cr iii by obtaining electrons from the cathode 2 a two chamber mfc operated in batch mode was firstly used for electrochemical reduction of cr vi and after 150 h of reaction 100 mg l cr was almost completely removed and a maximum power density of 150 mw m2 was obtained at current density of 0 04 ma cm2 6 with the further study of the influencing factors of mfc including electrode material 7 electrode modification 8 electrode distance 9 solution ph 10 and cr vi concentration 11 the bioelectricity generation capacity and cr vi reduction rate have been dramatically promoted in the mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater overall mfc technology shows great potential for cr removal and recovery from wastewater but much more work is still needed to further understand cr vi reduction mechanisms and investigate the feasibility of practical applications e g scale up and single chamber design of mfc reactor constructed wetland cw is an artificially intensified ecological engineering technology which relies on natural processes including wetland plant activity soil or matrix adsorption sedimentation and microbial metabolism to eliminate pollutants from wastewater as a sustainable and environmentally friendly wastewater treatment technology constructed wetland has been widely recognized and widespread applied in wastewater treatment e g domestic sewage mine drainage and industrial wastewater for several decades 12 mainly due to its easy maintenance low cost and high purification effect etc in particular owing to the high absorption and accumulation capacity of some certain aquatic plants to heavy metals constructed wetlands exhibit outstanding advantages in the treatment of heavy metal wastewater however only a few of plant species such as lemna minor typha latifolia 13 cyperus alternifolius 14 iris pseudacorus 15 pennisetum purpureum and echinochloa pyramidalis 16 etc have been widely used in constructed wetlands to treat cr vi containing wastewater therefore the selection of suitable wetland plants is currently one of the priorities for the design of constructed wetland for treating cr vi wastewater 17 of course for the selection of aquatic plant species the enrichment capacity of cr vi and the tolerance of flooded anoxia should be critically considered as well as adaption to local climate conditions the existence of a natural redox gradient in cw allows the conversion of cw into a novel mfc system i e cw mfc 18 which can simultaneously implement bioelectricity production and wastewater treatment 19 20 for almost a decade the cw mfc technology has been improved in many aspects e g reactor volume power outputs pollutants removal capacity and greenhouse gases mitigation potential 21 23 a lab scale unplanted cw mfc study showed that the efficiency removal of cr vi reached approximately 93 4 at an influent cr vi concentration of 40 mg l 24 for single chamber air cathode cw mfc oxygen diffused from atmosphere into cathode serves as electron acceptor and moreover vertical reactor design can reduce the involvement of proton exchange membrane which is a promising application design the optimization of reactor structure and the selection of aquatic species are considered to be two major factors to boost the performance of cw mfc 25 previous studies have demonstrated that electrode distance has large impacts on the electricity generation performance and pollutant removal efficiency of mfcs at a shorter electrode distance the internal resistance and current loss of mfcs are reduced thus substantially enhancing power outputs 26 27 the electrode surface area is crucial for the electricity improvement of mfcs and previous research shows that the power production was increased by approximately 62 by doubling cathode size 28 generally the internal resistance of mfc consists of mass transfer internal resistance activation internal resistance and ohmic internal resistance among which the activation internal resistance has the most significant influence on cell performance increasing specific electrode surface area involved in electrode reaction can reduce the activation internal resistance of mfcs thus improving power generation 29 currently the electrode optimization of single chamber cw mfc system on cr vi removal and bioelectricity generation including electrode distance and electrode surface area still requires more detailed research according to previous research wetland plant species planted in the cw mfc significantly promote electricity generation performance and pollutants removal effect 30 plant roots can not only increase dissolved oxygen in rhizosphere through aerenchyma tissues but also greatly enhance microbial richness and microbial metabolic activities 31 however the contributions of different aquatic plants to cw mfc performance vary considerably 32 saz et al studied the effects of four plant species i e typha latifolia typha angustifolia juncus gerardii and carex divisa on bioelectricity generation and pollutants elimination and the results showed that typha angustifolia achieved the highest power density of 18 1 mw m2 with stronger wastewater purification ability than the other three plants 33 oodally et al selected three indigenous plant species for cw mfc treatment of wastewater and found that cyperus prolifer obtained much higher power output cod removal and orthophosphate removal than phragmites australis and wachendorfia thyrsiflora 34 the above studies are only confined to the removal of organic pollutants and nutrient elements from wastewater however there are few studies on the effect of different aquatic plants on the cw mfc treatment of cr vi containing wastewater since each plant species has its own ecological requirements and physiological characteristics it also determines the potential for power generation and cr vi removal therefore it is very important to select appropriate aquatic plants with both high bioelectricity yield and high cr enrichment ability for cw mfc treating cr vi wastewater in this study a single chamber cw mfc planted with acorus calamus l was constructed to explore the effects of electrode distance and cathode surface area on bioelectricity generation performance and cr vi removal effect and the optimal electrode distance and cathode surface area were proposed then the removal mechanism of cr vi in the cw mfc was analyzed and discussed finally the impacts of six emergent aquatic plants i e acorus calamus l typha orientalis presl scirpus validus vahl canna indica l iris pseudacorus l and cyperus involucratus rottboll on cw mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater were investigated so as to screen out the most appropriate plant with both high bioelectricity yield ability and high cr enrichment capacity 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental device in this experiment cw mfc was a membrane free single chamber air cathode reactor which was composed of a polyacrylic acid plastic bucket with an inner diameter of 15 cm and a height of 25 cm the cw mfc reactor consisted of four layers from bottom to top supporting layer anode layer spacing layer and cathode layer fig s1 the supporting layer and spacing layer were filled with pebbles with a diameter of 2 cm and the cathode layer and anode layer were filled with pebbles with a diameter of 5 mm the electrode distance of the cw mfc was changed by altering the filling height of the spacing layer two layers of carbon felt cf sandwiched with stainless steel wire mesh ssm 16 mesh were used to form the system electrode which was braided and fixed with 0 5 mm titanium wire and embedded into the cathode layer and anode layer respectively as the cathode and anode of the system the cf used in this experiment thickness of 2 mm was purchased from tianjin carbon factory the cf was successively modified with 1 m sodium hydroxide and 1 m nitric acid before use a square hole was cut in the middle of the cf to facilitate aquatic plant planting the external circuit of the cw mfc was connected with a 1000 ω resistor by copper wire 2 2 sludge inoculation and acclimation anaerobic sludge was collected from xi an no 4 sewage treatment plant the retrieved sludge was added into nutrient solution for 10 days of acclimation and culture to guarantee the growth of wetland plants and anodic anaerobic microorganisms the nutrient solution included c 0 80 g l glucose n 0 15 g l nh4cl p 5 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs k 0 13 g l kcl and a certain amount of trace elements as detailed in similar reference 19 and the pbs could avoid excessive ph fluctuation in the process of cr wastewater treatment 300 ml of acclimated concentrated anaerobic sludge was injected into the anode layer of each cw mfc for membrane hanging wetland plants were cultured in the laboratory for 1 week and then transplanted to the cathode layer of the system in this experiment intermittent operation mode was adopted peristaltic pump was used to add nutrient solution to the cw mfc reactor at a flow rate of 0 3 ml s and the nutrient solution was replaced every three days the water level was maintained at the highest surface of the cathodic cf and distilled water was added twice daily to allow for evaporation of water during the cw mfc startup the output voltage varied gradually with time when the output voltage reached the maximum value for three consecutive periods and the variation curves of cell voltage versus time were essentially consistent the system was regarded as successfully started 2 3 cw mfc operation and experiment process three experiments were carried out in this study firstly three groups of cw mfcs were prepared with electrode distance set at 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm respectively then three sets of reaction devices were designed with electrode distance of 10 cm and cathodic cf surface area of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 respectively aquatic plant acorus calamus l was planted in the cathode layer of the cw mfc in both above experiments finally six cw mfcs were planted with different aquatic plants to ensure the comparability of the experiment plant species with similar weight were selected as follows acorus calamus l 4 plants 107 4 g typha orientalis presl 7 plants 101 5 g scirpus validus vahl 5 plants 103 5 g canna indica l 2 plants 110 6 g iris pseudacorus l 5 plants 101 6 g and cyperus involucratus rottboll 5 plants 105 3 g the cathode surface area of the above cw mfcs was set at 75 cm2 and the electrode distance was set at 10 cm in this experiment synthetic cr vi wastewater was composed of nutrient solution and analytical pure potassium dichromate to reduce the negative effects of cr vi toxicity on microorganisms and aquatic plants e g plant death synthetic wastewater with low cr vi concentration of 12 mg l was used to carry out research e g the cr vi concentration of rinsing wastewater or combined wastewater with tanning wastewater produced by tannery industry is typically 30 mg l 17 during the experiment 0 5 ml water solutions were sampled from the cathode layer anode layer and spacing layer of the cw mfc reactor with a syringe respectively and mixed together the samples were taken every hour and the samples were filtered with microporous membrane before measurement all the experiments were carried out at the room temperature of 25 c 2 4 analysis and calculation during the electrochemical test the voltage of each cw mfc was continuously monitored a variable resistance box was connected to the cw mfc and the resistance value was changed from 10 000 ω to 5 ω after the stability of the cw mfc the voltage value was recorded multifunctional digital multimeter was used to measure and monitor the voltage of each cw mfc the power density mw m2 and current density ma m2 of the cw mfc were obtained by dividing the power and current by the effective area m2 of the anode the power density curves and polarization curves were used to evaluate the power generation performance of the cw mfc the total internal resistance of the system was calculated from the slope of the linear region of the polarization curve anode and cathode potentials were separately determined against a silver silver chloride reference electrode ag agcl 0 198 v vs she the concentration of cr vi was measured according to the national standard of china gb t7467 1987 water quality determination of chromium hexavalent diphenyl carbazide spectrophotometric method in acidic solution cr vi reacted with 1 5 diphenylcarbazide and then the absorbance of the solution was measured by spectrophotometry at 540 nm total cr concentration was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes 715es agilent inc usa and cr iii concentration was calculated by subtracting cr vi concentration from total cr concentration in this study the reduction kinetics of cr vi was regressed according to first order kinetic equation as follows 1 ln c t c 0 kt where k is the first order rate constant ct is the concentration of cr vi at time t and c0 is the initial concentration of cr vi after the experiment cathodic cf was taken out and dried in a vacuum drying oven the morphology of cathodic cf was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem jsm5400 jeol japan and element composition and the proportion of the reduced substance attached to the cf were analyzed by energy dispersive spectrometer eds inca x max oxford instruments uk to further determine the composition and valence state of the elements on the electrode surface cathodic cf was analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab xi thermo scientific usa microbes attached to the anodic cathodic cf were ultrasonically collected and genomic dna was extracted and purified the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr to target the v3 v4 region shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd china and the microbial compositions of anodic cathodic biofilm were analyzed according to liu et al 35 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of electrode distance on power generation and cr vi removal electrode distance is a vital factor to determine the internal resistance and power output of cw mfc since it is directly related to the transfer distance of protons between anode and cathode in the solution fig 1a shows that under open circuit condition the voltages of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs with distances of 5 cm 10 cm and 15 cm were 659 mv 683 mv and 634 mv respectively with the increase of the current density the cell voltage of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs decreased and the order of cell voltage outputs at different electrode distances was as follows 10 cm 5 cm 15 cm the maximum power density of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distance 10 cm reached 37 8 mw m2 which was much higher than that at 5 cm 22 4 mw m2 and 15 cm 15 9 mw m2 fig 1b shows that as current output increased the cathode potentials of the three cw mfcs with different electrode distances changed smoothly while the anode potentials exhibited distinct change trends the 10 cm electrode distance achieved the lowest anode potential with shallow slope however the electrode distances of 5 cm and 15 cm resulted in sharp increases in anode potentials i e much steeper slopes which were mainly attributed to anodic mass transfer losses small electrode distance e g 5 cm could make it easier for oxygen to diffuse into the anode region which would inhibit the metabolism of anodic anaerobic microorganisms e g electro active bacteria eab and affect the electricity generation performance of the cw mfc when the electrode distance was too large e g 15 cm the internal resistance of the cw mfc increased which was not conducive to the flow and mass transfer of substrates and products thus reducing the power output the cw mfc with electrode distance of 10 cm gained the highest power output which is consistent with the results of similar previous studies zhou et al studied the influence of electrode distance 1 cm 2 cm 3 cm and 4 cm on the treatment of cr vi wastewater by a two chamber mfc and found that the highest power density of 535 4 mw m2 was achieved at electrode distance of 2 cm 9 xie et al designed three cw mfcs with different electrode distances 8 cm 13 cm and 18 cm for treating nitrobenzene wastewater and the system with electrode distance of 13 cm obtained the best electricity production capacity mainly because the reduction of the electrode distance effectively reduced the internal resistance of the system which was conducive to the flow and mass transfer of reactants 36 to better clarify the reason of the power generation differences of the acorus calamus l cw mfcs at different electrode distances the total internal resistances of the three cw mfcs were calculated according to the linear fit of polarization curves as shown in fig s2 the internal resistance of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distance of 10 cm was the lowest only 302 4 ω however the internal resistances of the acorus calamus l cw mfc at electrode distances of 5 cm and 15 cm were 62 4 and 115 1 higher than that at 10 cm which were 491 0 ω and 650 4 ω respectively as the electrode distance increased from 10 cm to 15 cm the enhanced total internal resistance of the acorus calamus l cw mfc was mainly caused by an increased transfer distance of protons generated by electricity producing microorganisms from the anode to the cathode and the internal mass transfer resistance of the system increased thus leading to power decline however when the electrode distance was 5 cm oxygen diffused from air or secreted from plant roots would enter into the anodic region and consume a certain number of electrons the consumed electrons would not reach the cathode to form a current resulting in an increase of internal mass transfer resistance and the decrease of power output 37 short electrode distance is favorable for power generation of a typical two chamber mfc however in single chamber cw mfc too short electrode distance can easily lead to oxygen diffusion into the anode region which destroys the anaerobic condition of the anode and is detrimental to bioelectricity generation fig 2a shows the influence of electrode distance on cr vi removal after 9 h the removal efficiencies of cr vi in the three cw mfcs were all above 93 during the operation the removal efficiency of cr vi was the highest in the cw mfc with 10 cm electrode distance followed by the cw mfc with 5 cm electrode distance and the removal efficiency of cr vi was the worst in the cw mfc with 15 cm electrode distance the results show that the cr vi removal efficiencies of the three cw mfcs with different electrode distances were consistent with their respective power generation performance the removal kinetics of cr vi were studied and it was found that cr vi removal accorded with the first order kinetics r2 0 94 which was consistent with the previous study of bio electrochemical cr vi removal in lolium perenne plant mfcs 38 it can be seen more clearly from fig 2b that the cr vi removal rates by the three cw mfcs were quite different the cr vi removal rate constant in the cw mfc with 10 cm electrode distance was the largest 0 471 h 1 and the removal rate constants of cr vi in the cw mfcs with electrode distance of 5 cm and 15 cm were much smaller only 0 343 h 1 and 0 318 h 1 respectively indicating that the electrochemical process might play a major role in accelerating the reduction of cr vi the electrode distance of the cw mfc was set at 10 cm which not only created conditions conducive to the power generation as much as possible but also provided suitable conditions for the removal and recovery of cr vi in conclusion considering the power generation performance and cr vi removal efficiency of the cw mfc system it is the best scheme to set the electrode distance to 10 cm 3 2 effects of electrode surface area on power generation and cr vi removal fig 3a shows that the cell voltages and power densities generated from the three cw mfcs with different cathode areas were considerably different at the same current densities the open circuit voltages of the cw mfcs with cathode area of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were 793 mv 828 mv and 831 mv respectively indicating that increasing the cathode surface area might be beneficial to the enhancement of cathode potential and cell voltage 10 28 however with the increase of current density the order of voltage outputs was as follows 75 cm2 100 cm2 25 cm2 and similarly the cathode surface area of 75 cm2 resulted in the highest power generation performance of the cw mfc followed by 100 cm2 and finally 25 cm2 the maximum power densities of the cw mfcs with cathode areas of 25 cm2 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were 20 8 mw m2 42 9 mw m2 and 28 5 mw m2 respectively fig 3b shows that when the cathode area was 25 cm2 with the increase of the current density the anode potential of the cw mfc changed little while the cathode potential decreased sharply indicating that the voltage output was mainly limited by the cathodic reduction reaction of cr vi i e cathodic mass transfer loss 10 for the cw mfc with cathode area of 75 cm2 the variation trends of anode potential and cathode potential versus current density were essentially similar i e comparison between increase slop of anode potential and decrease slop of cathode potential and the output of electricity generation was stable however when the cathode area continued to increase to 100 cm2 with the increase of current density the change of cathode potential was rather small while the anode potential increased sharply indicating that the power generation was probably limited by the insufficient supply of anode electrons i e anodic mass transfer loss 19 the total internal resistances of the three cw mfcs were calculated according to the polarization curve as shown in fig s3 the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 25 cm2 was 739 31 ω and the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 75 cm2 was 419 88 ω this is because with the increase of the cathode surface area the actual area involved in the reaction increased which reduced the cathodic mass transfer losses of the cw mfc and enhanced the power generation performance on the other hand since the increase of the cathode area promoted the transfer and consumption of protons the accumulation of anode protons was alleviated which would be conducive to the growth of anode electricity producing bacteria in a similar study of tubular h type biocathode mfcs treating cr vi wastewater when cathode to anode surface area ratio c a was increased from 3 to 20 the power outputs improved from 6 8 w m3 to15 w m3 while the internal resistance decreased from 231 ω to 82 ω 10 in this study the total internal resistance of the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 100 cm2 was 610 85 ω which was much larger compared with the cw mfc with cathode surface area of 75 cm2 this might be because the cathodic mass transfer losses of the cw mfc would not decrease as the cathode area of cw mfc increased to a certain extent while the ohmic resistance caused by too large cathode area increased the internal resistance of the system which was unfavorable to the power generation fig 4a shows the removal efficiencies of cr vi in the cw mfcs with different cathode surface areas it can be seen that the removal rate of cr vi accelerated with the increase of cathode area of the cw mfc at 9 h the cr vi removal efficiency of the cw mfc with cathode area of 25 cm2 reached 75 6 while the cr vi removal efficiency of cw mfcs with cathode area of 75 cm2 and 100 cm2 were above 90 96 8 and 98 9 respectively with the increase of the cathode area the mass transfer rate on the cathode accelerated and so did the reactions of electrons protons and cr vi in the cw mfc system on the other hand the larger cathode area also provided sufficient adhesion area for the growth and reproduction of microorganisms especially a certain amount of catalystic bacteria and thereby would greatly reduce the activation overpotential of the biocathode i e cathodic activation losses 10 moreover the increase of microbial population would promote the assimilation and alienation of cr vi by microorganisms 5 and thus the removal ability of cr vi by the cw mfc with larger cathode area was strengthened fig 4b shows that the highest cr vi removal rate constant of 0 464 h 1 was obtained in the cw mfc with cathode area of 100 cm2 followed by the cw mfc with cathode area of 75 cm2 0 406 h 1 and then the cw mfc with cathode area of 25 cm2 0 203 h 1 as a result from the comprehensive consideration of the power generation performance and the removal rate of cr vi the design of cathode surface area of 75 cm2 is more suitable for the cw mfc treating cr vi wastewater 3 3 cr vi removal mechanism analysis to determine the removal mechanisms of cr vi in the cw mfc the cathodic cf was collected after the experiments and its surface morphology was analyzed it can be seen that the surface of original cf was smooth and clean fig 5a and a considerable amount of solid substance was attached to the surface of cathodic cf after a period of operation fig 5c to further determine the possible element composition of the attachment on the cathodic cf energy spectrum analysis was conducted fig 5d shows that c o cr p and s were mainly detected on the surface of cathodic cf after operation in the original cf fig 5b the percentages of c by weight and atom were 88 79 and 91 73 respectively the weight percentage and atomic percentage of o were 10 05 and 7 79 respectively cr content was 0 after the cw mfc operated for a period of time the weight percentage of c in the cathodic cf was 77 39 and the atomic percentage was 88 85 the weight percentage of o was 8 06 and the atomic percentage was 6 94 the weight percentage of cr was 12 72 and the atomic percentage was 3 37 by comparing the cathodic cf surface before and after operation it can be found that the p content on the cathodic cf surface increased after operation which might be due to attachment of microorganisms onto the cf surface the proportion of cr also increased and there was o existed on the cathodic cf surface so it is speculated that cr containing oxidizing substances such as cr2o3 and cr oh 3 might be deposited on the surface of cathodic cf to analyze the specific form of cr on the surface of cathodic cf xps was used to scan and analyze the cathodic cf the full spectrum of xps scan can detect most of the elements contained in the sample as shown in fig s4 including c o cr and other elements two peaks of binding energy of 577 6 ev and 586 5 ev appeared in the scanning curve of cr 2p on the cathodic cf and these two peaks have been shown to correspond to the binding energy of cr iii in cr oh 3 precipitation 39 this result indicates the deposition of cr iii on the surface of the cathodic cf after the operation of the cw mfc cathodic cf was recovered and its cr content was determined the dry weight of cathodic cf was 17 97 g and the concentrations of cr iii and cr vi in the cathodic cf reached 239 07 mg kg and 37 52 mg kg respectively so the proportion of cr iii in the cr deposition of the cathodic cf was up to 86 43 the total cr content in the cathodic cf accounted for 46 02 of cr vi removal in addition after removing the matrix a small amount of sediment i e mainly cr oh 3 was observed at the bottom of the cw mfc with a dry weight of 0 42 g and cr iii concentration of 3600 mg kg the cr content in the bottom sediment accounted for 14 00 of cr vi removal it should be noted that before precipitation cr vi should be firstly reduced to cr iii 40 which then combined with oh and transformed into cr oh 3 precipitate 39 part of the produced cr iii was deposited directly on the surface of the cathodic cf while a small amount of cr iii migrated and deposited at the bottom of the reactor as a result the contribution ratio of cathodic reduction to cr vi removal was approximately 53 78 in addition to cathodic reduction and deposition plant uptake also contributed significantly to cr removal in the treatment of cr vi wastewater by the acorus calamus l cw mfc table 1 shows that the cr enrichment capacity of acorus calamus l roots was much higher than that of stems and leaves wang et al also found similar results that average cr enrichment concentrations in roots and shoots of acorus calamus l were 164 4 mg kg and 77 9 mg kg respectively 41 in the acorus calamus l cw mfc the cr enrichment concentrations in roots stems and leaves were 902 82 mg kg 261 80 mg kg and 41 59 mg kg respectively and the contribution ratios of roots stems and leaves to cr removal were 11 87 7 81 and 1 83 respectively it can be clearly observed from table 1 that the cw mfc system promoted plant growth and the biomass of roots stems and leaves in the cw mfc system increased by 13 59 34 06 and 29 28 respectively compared with traditional cw system the contribution ratio of plant uptake to cr removal in the acorus calamus l cw mfc was 4 96 higher than that in the cw system indicating that the incorporation of mfc into cw enhanced the cr enrichment capacity of acorus calamus l consistent with previous research results 25 on one hand the micro current environment of the cw mfc promoted the conversion of cr vi to cr iii and thus reduced the toxicity of cr which would be more conducive to plant growth and plant uptake of cr on the other hand higher biomass of plants in the cw mfc could improve microbial activity e g eab and generate more bioelectricity 42 thus promoting cathodic electrochemical reduction of cr vi to cr iii and total cr removal in conclusion plant physiological activities e g plant growth root secretion of oxygen and plant uptake of cr and microbial electricity production are complementary in the cw mfc system fig 6 shows the relative abundances of main genera on the anode and cathode of the acorus calamus l cw mfc specifically the five domain genera in the cathodic biofilm included nitrospira 8 97 saccharimonadales 6 09 nakamurella 4 49 rhodobacter 3 97 and ferruginibacter 3 23 among them nitrospira nitrifying bacteria was related to nitrogen removal 43 44 and rhodobacter was responsible for cr vi reduction as its ability to reduce cr vi has been previously reported 45 moreover hydrogenophaga one of cr vi reducing bacteria 46 was also enriched on the cathode with a relative abundance of 2 12 further indicating that cr vi could be effectively bio reduced to cr iii in the cathodic region for the anodic biofilm the top five genera consisted of lactococcus 41 02 streptococcus 37 97 clostridium 2 23 bacteroidetes 1 28 and paludibacter 1 11 notably lactococcus and streptococcus were substantially enriched in the anodic biofilm of the cw mfc and these genera has been demonstrated to participate in the process of bioelectricity production and promote extracellular electron transfer 47 according to the above analysis the main possible mechanism of cr vi removal in the cw mfc system was proposed the electric producing microorganisms e g lactococcus and streptococcus on the anode oxidized organic matter to produce protons and electrons and the protons moved to the cathode under the action of electric field while the electrons transported to the cathode via external circuit when there exists protons and electrons in the cathode the reduction reaction of cr vi into cr iii would occur under the function of cr reducing bacteria e g rhodobacter and hydrogenophaga as shown in eq 2 under a certain ph condition e g 6 5 11 soluble cr iii was converted to cr oh 3 precipitation according to the mass balance of cr in the acorus calamus l cw mfc system cr vi was mainly removed by cathodic electrochemical reduction 53 78 and plant uptake 21 50 2 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o 3 4 effects of plant species on power generation and cr vi removal fig 7 shows different cell voltages and power densities were obtained form six cw mfcs planted with different plant species during the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater the order of the maximum power densities of different cw mfcs with different plant species was as follows cyperus involucratus rottboll cw mfc 47 4 mw m2 scirpus validus cw mfc 40 6 mw m2 acorus calamus l cw mfc 37 8 mw m2 canna indica l cw mfc 36 6 mw m2 typha orientalis presl cw mfc 29 9 mw m2 iris pseudacorus l cw mfc 14 1 mw m2 to explore the reasons for the difference of the electricity generation performance of the six cw mfcs the total internal resistances of the six cw mfcs were calculated by using the polarization curve fig s5 the effect of different wetland plant species on the total resistances of the cw mfcs followed the order cyperus involucratus rottboll 236 2 ω scirpus validus 251 6 ω canna indica l 282 4 ω acorus calamus l 315 6 typha orientalis presl 330 0 ω iris pseudacorus l 498 2 ω the results indicate that the power outputs of the cw mfcs with different plant species were closely related to the total internal resistance of the system negative correlation generally wetland plant rhizosphere can improve the abundance and activities of microorganisms in the cathode layer thus promoting oxygen reduction or cr vi reduction reactions of the cw mfc different plant species at the cathode have different influences on the internal resistance of the cw mfc system as previously reported the cw mfcs planted with canna indica 400 ω and arundo donax 399 ω had much lower internal resistances than those with cyperus alternifolius l 1000 ω and acorus calamus 5000 ω so they obtained higher power outputs of 18 56 mw m2 and 17 41 mw m2 respectively 48 similarly in this study the cyperus involucratus rottboll cw mfc with the lowest total internal resistance of 236 2 ω achieved the highest power generation of 47 4 mw m2 fig 8a shows the change of cr vi concentration in the cw mfcs with six different plant species in the acorus calamus l cw mfc the cr vi concentration decreased at the fastest rate and the cr vi removal efficiency reached 88 1 at 4 h and 98 8 after 9 h operation it was followed by the cw mfcs with scirpus validus and cyperus involucratus rottboll and the cr vi removal efficiencies were 97 5 and 96 0 respecitively the eliminations of cr vi were much lower in the canna indica l cw mfc and typha orientalis presl cw mfc only 90 7 and 85 5 respectively the worst cr vi removal effect was observed in the iris pseudacorus l cw mfc only 82 4 fig 8b shows the cr vi removal kinetics analysis for the cw mfcs with six different plant species and the removal of cr vi accorded with the first order kinetic reaction r2 0 95 the order of cr vi removal rate constant of cw mfcs affected by different plant species was as follows acorus calamus l 0 471 h 1 scirpus validus 0 346 h 1 cyperus involucratus rottboll 0 316 h 1 canna indica l 0 248 h 1 typha orientalis presl 0 214 h 1 iris pseudacorus l 0 161 h 1 as well known the cr vi removal from wastewater in a single chamber cw mfc is the result of the synergistic effect of microbial electrochemistry and plant uptake 49 on one hand the cw mfc system with high electricity output is conducive to the cathodic reduction reaction of cr vi 50 previous studies have demonstrated that scirpus validus has high tolerance and adaptability to heavy metals e g cr hg ni and pb and its rhizosphere has a strong promoting effect on microbial diversity and abundance 51 especially for eab including geobacter and ferruginibacter 52 so the scirpus validus cw mfc achieved the highest power output thus enabling efficient and rapid removal of cr vi from wastewater on the other hand wetland plants also play important roles in the absorption transfer and enrichment of soluble cr vi during cw mfc treatment of cr vi wastewater previous research show that acorus calamus l has a strong tolerance and enrichment ability to cr 41 and moreover it possesses high cr translocation factor from root to shoot up to 0 115 0 608 53 this is the exact reason that acorus calamus l cw mfc obtained the highest cr vi removal effect even though its electricity output was in the general level fig 7 nevertheless considering both electricity generation and cr vi removal efficiency scirpus validus is the most suitable wetland plant to improve cw mfc treatment of cr containing wastewater 3 5 prospects and challenges of using cw mfc to treat cr vi wastewater up to now numerous laboratory studies have been conducted on the treatment of cr vi wastewater by using double chamber mfc 2 or single chamber cw mfc 49 however in order to achieve the practical application of cw mfc for treating cr vi containing wastewater more further in depth research are still needed including reactor scale up construction cost reduction bioelectricity generation optimization and carbon limited wastewater treatment moreover prior to the cw mfc treatment physical chemical treatments are recommended as a pretreatment process to reduce cr vi concentration in industrial wastewater and thus avoid the toxicity of cr vi to eab and aquatic plants firstly for large scale cw mfc the bioelectricity production can be enhanced to some extent by increasing cathode surface area however the occupied area of land and construction cost would also increase accordingly so it is particularly important to optimize the cathode area generally platinum or other noble metal based catalysts are common catalysts of cathodic reduction of cr vi in conventional small size mfcs but not feasible for large scale cw mfcs by contrast biological cathode i e microbial catalytic cathode shows great promise for increasing power generation without use of noble metal catalysts 19 secondly there are great differences in cr vi tolerance and enrichment capacity of wetland plants so much work is needed to screen appropriate aquatic plant species with both high bioelectricity production ability and high cr vi enrichment capacity particularly according to local climate conditions e g scirpus validus acorus calamus l and cyperus involucratus rottboll moreover it is necessary to control the negative effect of oxygen diffusion e g from plant roots or the atmosphere on the anode e g electrode distance of 10 cm at least especially while increasing the specific surface area of the cathode in the membrane free cw mfc on the whole it is very promising but challenging to treat cr vi containing wastewater by single chamber large scale cw mfc in the future 4 conclusion electrode distance and cathode surface area had important influences on bioelectricity generation and cr vi removal in the cw mfcs the experimental results showed that electrode distance of 10 cm resulted in the highest maximum power density of 37 8 mw m2 which was approximately 1 7 and 2 4 times that of 5 cm 22 4 mw m2 and 15 cm 15 9 mw m2 respectively the cw mfc with electrode distance of 10 cm achieved the highest removal efficiency of cr vi up to 98 8 at 9 h by comparing the power generation performance and cr vi removal effect of three cw mfcs with different cathode surface areas it was concluded that the order of power density was as follows cathode area of 75 cm2 cathode area of 100 cm2 cathode area of 25 cm2 while the order of cr vi removal was cathode area of 100 cm2 cathode area of 75 cm2 cathode area of 25 cm2 comprehensively cathode area of 75 cm2 was optimal six wetland plant species including typha orientalis presl scirpus validus canna indica l iris pseudacorus l cyperus involucratus rottboll and acorus calamus l were selected for cw mfc treatment of cr vi containing wastewater among them the power outputs of the cw mfcs planted with cyperus involucratus rottboll and scirpus validus were much better than that of other plants and the removal efficiencies of cr vi by the cw mfcs planted with acorus calamus l and scirpus validus were at relatively high levels as a result it was considered that scirpus validus as a wetland plant of the cw mfc was the

12879,the depletion of bla kpc k pneumoniae bla oxa 50 p aeruginosa and meca s aureus genes from hospital urines is evaluated to contribute to solve the silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance bacteria a microfluidic flow through reactor with mmo anode and cb ptfe cathode working at 50 a m 2 is employed during electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes the electrodisinfection process only achieves an almost negligible removal of dna and slightly log arg increments of 0 18 0 19 and 0 71 for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively conversely the photo electrodisinfection process attains the complete disinfection for all arb tested and logarithmic removals of 3 70 2 25 and 0 82 for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively these outcomes emphasize the potential of the uv light coupled to the electrodisinfection process to promote the formation of not only hypochlorite but also chlorine and even nitrogen radicals which contribute to enhance the disinfection efficiency of the target arb and their args graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes urine electrodisinfection photo electrodisinfection data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb has become a global concern due to the significant number of deaths occurring worldwide the european centre for disease prevention and control has pointed out the great threat posed by arb due to 671 689 arb infections and 33 110 deaths during 2015 1 more recently 2 868 700 arb infections per year with 24 900 deaths have been estimated in the united states by the u s department of health and human services 2 furthermore the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args may also be developed due to vertical transfer i e cell division and or horizontal gene transfer processes conjugation transduction and natural transformation 3 the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes args by staphylococcus aureus s aureus klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa have been reported to reduce the treatment options of severe infections such as pneumonias sepsis endocarditis skin infections etc 4 6 hospital urines can be considered as one of the main hotspots of arb and args since microorganisms are excreted from infected patients mainly by urine 7 some studies have recently reported on the pre treatment of hospital urines to prevent the appearance and spread of arb args and mobile genetic elements 8 12 conventional technologies based on the addition of chlorine disinfectant species are widely applied in disinfection processes however several studies have reported on the increment of args during chlorine disinfection wu et al have recently found that the relative abundance of 14 args tolc acra acrb etc increased by 49 6 after the disinfection process with 5 mg dm 3 of chlorine 13 likewise jin et al reported on the increment of args exchange across bacterial and the emergence of new arb after the disinfection process with hypochlorite naclo in the range 4 6 mg dm 3 these results were attributted to the enhancement of horizontal transfer processes by the increment of the cell membrane permeabilisation and a stronger stress response of the survival arb 14 kampf has also recently reported on the lack of data available in the literature on a possible induction reduction of antibiotic resistance genes and horizontal gene transfer processes using hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant 15 on the other hand uv disinfection is known to promote bacterial inactivation by damages caused on deoxyribonucleic acid dna and antibiotic resistance genes args 16 however damages caused by uv disinfection can be repaired after relatively small times promoting bacterial regrowth 17 uv irradiation may be coupled to catalysis processes photocatalysis to improve the removal of microorganisms from water environment 18 venieri et al reported a 6 log reduction of klebsiella pneumoniae in real wastewater with a binary co mn tio2 catalyst under simulated solar irradiation 19 s aureus was inactivated during the photocatalysis process using α nimoo4 as catalyst due to the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species 20 the electrochemical

22 tu et al reported a 99 99 of inactivation sars cov 2 using in situ formed nickel oxide hydroxide as anode catalyst in the electrochemical oxidation process at 5 v 23 simultaneous removal of arb and args by the electrochemical disinfection have also been carried out in recent literature fang et al achieved 5 log escherichia coli k 12 le392 removal and simultaneously they attained the degradation of teta and blatem genes by molybdenum carbide assisted electrochemical disinfection under 2 v 24 zhang et al achieved 83 46 escherichia coli 10 667 sul args degradation compared to 10 23 during chlorination or 27 07 under uv light irradiation 25 additionally the coupling of uv light with the electrochemical disinfection process may enhance the generation of powerful chlorine and or nitrogen radicals by the photoactivation of the electrogenerated disinfectants as hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite or chloramines many works have published on the efficiency of different radicals to degrade dna and args 26 28 ahmed et al evaluated a modified photo fenton process at neutral ph and using ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds to chelate iron iii for the removal of arb and args 26 they found that 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm hydrogen peroxide h2o2 allowed to decrease the concentration of e args by 6 log within 10 min additionally zhang et al studied the oxidative damage induced on args in a novel sulfidated micron zero valent activated persulfate system they attributed removals of 2 9 tetb and 2 2 16s rrna logs to the promotion of reactive oxygen species in the solution mainly sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 28 with this background the main goal is to study the performance of the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection process for the removal of arb and args in hospital urines to do this the target bacteria were selected based on their potential to cause urinary tract infections utis in patients from the university hospital complex of albacete spain and on

prevalent microorganism which causes urinary tract infections utis in the university hospital complex of albacete spain within the period of 2014 2018 the study was carried out with 4453 urine samples that were positive for at least one pathogen the urine samples belonged to patients hospitalized in the geriatrics hematology oncology and medical and surgical intensive care wards the pathogens were grouped in the following three families gram negative bacteria blue colour gram positive bacteria orange colour or yeasts green colour as can be observed most of the microorganisms causing utis belong to the gram negative bacteria group representing 62 78 of the total microorganisms analysed indeed the main bacteria causing utis were escherichia coli e coli with a presence percentage of 37 05 follows by k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa with 8 46 and 5 16 respectively it is noticeable that antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa have been recently reported for the serious threat involved in sanitary environments 4 46 specifically these arb present a poor response to antibiotic treatments and their outbreak often causes life threatening nosocomial infections with a plethora of symptoms such as severe pneumonia lung infections sepsis or multiorgan failure 5 6 furthermore gram positive bacteria and yeasts were also present in 21 70 and 15 51 of the total microorganisms analysed respectively enterococcus faecalis e faecalis enterococcus faecium e faecium staphylococcus epidermidis s epidermidis and s aureus were the main gram positive bacteria causing utis with a prevalence of 50 41 14 64 7 32 and 5 95 respectively it is of special relevance the infections caused by antibiotic resistant s aureus since it is a common human pathogenic bacteria with a wide range of virulence factors and high adaptability and tenacity that can result in infectious diseases such as skin infections endocarditis bacteremia or lethal pneumonia among others 47 48 on the other hand the genus candida mainly cope the yeasts analysed in the study in the last years drug resistance in yeasts is becoming an emerging and threatening scenario due to the lack of effective treatment alternatives 49 however the prevalence of antibiotic resistance strains in gram negative and gram positive bacteria over yeasts can be clearly depicted from the report on antibiotic resistance in the united states published by the u s department of health and human services 2 in this context antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus have been employed as target bacteria for the disinfection processes tested in the present work to control the dissemination of arb into the environment and to reduce potential horizontal transfer processes it is of crucial importance the removal of deoxyribonucleic acid dna and antibiotic resistance genes args present in the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains the occurrence of the coexistence of several args in a single bacterial strain is a factor that amplifies the danger posed by the bacterium in this regard to gain insight into the args composition of the three arb tested in this work a search of the main genes responsible for carrying antibiotic resistance through different resistance mechanisms has been carried out in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database during this search the nucleotide sequence of the three arb was continuously compared with the sequences of the args tested and sequences with a homology percentage higher than 99 were assigned to their resistance mechanism table 1 summarized the args present in k pneumoniae atcc baa 1705 p aeruginosa atcc 9027 and s aureus atcc 43300 grouped based on the resistance mechanism to antibiotics among the major resistance mechanisms present in arb are 1 limiting drug uptake drugs that target the cell wall mainly β lactams and glycopeptides enter the cell through porin channels in the outer membrane 2 drug target modification bacteria are able to modify the components that are targeted by drugs to enable resistance to those drugs 3 drug inactivation this mechanism can proceed by the degradation of the drug or by the transference of a chemical group to inactivate the drug 4 drug efflux bacteria that contain chromosomally encoded genes for efflux pumps have the capacity to rid drugs out of the cell and many of these pumps transport a large variety of compounds multi drug efflux pumps 50 52 in this work bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes were selected as arg models for k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively the k pneumoniae strains harboring the bla kpc gene represent the most common cause of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae 53 carbapenemases hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics and other β lactam antibiotics provide a high antibiotic resistance 54 the bla oxa 50 gene is an oxacillinase β lactam gene that confers a decreased susceptibility to antibiotics such as ampicillin ticarcillin moxalactam or meropenem 55 finally the meca gene encodes a low affinity penicillin binding protein pbp 2a which provides resistance to methicillin 56 likewise the meca gene is part of a mobile genetic element that may also provide resistance to non β lactam antibiotics through other contained genetic structures tn554 pub110 or pt181 57 in this regard fig 3a shows the evolution of arb k pneumoniae p aeruginosa s aureus as a function of the applied electric charge whereas fig 3b plots the performance of args bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes and dna during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection of synthetic hospital urines results show that the electrodisinfection process achieved removal ratios higher than 4 logs by applying an electric charge of 0 423 ah dm 3 180 min it is remarkable that the efficiency of the electrodisinfection process varied within a logarithmic order of magnitude among the target arb tested specifically log removals of 4 9 5 8 and 7 total disinfection were achieved for p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively however results also show that slightly log increments of 0 71 0 18 and 0 19 were obtained during the electrodisinfection experiments for bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes respectively indeed the logarithmic increments of args seem to be promoted with the higher removal efficiency of each arb tested bla kpc k pneumoniae meca s aureus bla oxa 50 p aeruginosa in addition an almost negligible removal of dna was observed for every electrodisinfection experiment conducted on the other hand the coupling of uv light with the electrodisinfection process significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency of the process reaching the complete disinfection regardless of the target arb tested the removal of p aeruginosa is observed to be slightly more efficient than the removal of k pneumoniae or s aureus since the complete disinfection is attained at 0 278 ah dm 3 120 min additionally logarithmic removals of dna of 0 172 0 239 and 0 153 were attained during the photo electrodisinfection experiments for the synthetic hospital urines infected with k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively likewise results also showed that log removals of 0 82 3 70 and 2 25 were obtained during the photo electrodisinfection experiments for bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes respectively in fact the more efficient the removal of arb the higher the removal of args the performance of arb args and dna of each strain tested may be related to the disinfectant species electrogenerated during the electrodisinfection process and or even the possible photo activation of these disinfectant species during the photo electrodisinfection process to shed light on it the generation of the different expected disinfectant species were followed during both disinfection processes firstly the use of a titanium cathode with a carbon black polytetrafluoroethylene cb ptfe mixture should promote the generation of hydrogen peroxide by oxygen reduction reaction 1 58 60 the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was monitored during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes data not shown although negligible measurements were obtained for every test this fact does not mean a null electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide but a fast decomposition which could be related with parasitic reactions such as its self decomposition reaction 2 its oxidation in the anode surface to produce oxygen reaction 3 its reduction in the cathode surface to water reaction 4 or its reaction with organic compounds and or bacteria present in urine media 29 61 62 likewise hydrogen peroxide may be activated with uv light to promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals reaction 5 during the photo electrodisinfection process 12 in fact moratalla et al reported the performance on the electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide using a microfluidic flow through reactor with a mmo anode and a cb ptfe cathode working at 50 a m 2 30 the treatment of urines in the absence of their organic compounds led to maximum accumulations of 24 99 mg h2o2 dm 3 0 8 ah dm 3 working at atmospheric pressure 1 o 2 g 2h 2e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o ½ o 2 3 h 2 o 2 2e o 2 2h 4 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh similarly the evolution of chlorine derived disinfectant species as hypochlorite was also monitored in our previous works the evolution of hypochlorite was studied during the electrolysis of urines in the absence of their organic compounds using a microfluidic flow through the reactor with a mmo anode and a stainless steel cathode at 50 a m 2 this test proved the increase in the generation of hypochlorite as a final product reaching maximum concentrations around 1 8 mmol dm 3 cl clo 0 423 ah dm 3 32 however no significant concentrations of hypochlorite were detected in the present work since this is a very reactive species that i can react to degrade organic compounds and to kill bacteria from urine ii can promote to other chlorine species in a higher oxidation state such as chlorate and or perchlorate iii can chemically react with ammonium ions nh4 urine 22 72 mg dm 3 to produce inorganic chloramines reactions 6 8 or even iv can be activated with uv light to produce chlorine radicals reaction 9 10 63 on the one hand the formation of hazardous chloro species as chlorates and perchlorates was avoided due to the high complexity of urine media 64 on the other hand chloramines show higher stability than hypochlorite being easier to measure as they maintain an acceptable residual concentration in solution over time 65 herein the evolution of the concentration of total chloramines is shown in fig 4 as a function of the applied electric charge during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection of hospital urines infected with k pneumoniae p aeruginosa or s aureus total inorganic chloramines correspond to the sum of monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 which each prevalence depends on the ph of the bulk solution 66 nhcl2 followed by nh2cl should be mainly promoted since ph values ranged from 5 to 6 during these disinfection experiments 6 nh 4 clo nh 2 cl h 2 o 7 nh 2 cl clo nhcl 2 h 2 o 8 nhcl 2 clo ncl 3 oh 9 clo hv cl o as can be observed different behavior in the evolution of chloramines was observed during the electrodisinfection and the photo electrodisinfection tests the concentration of chloramines continuously increased with the applied electric charge during electrodisinfection tests with a significant influence on the target arb specifically maximum values of 0 070 0 039 and 0 011 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 were obtained at the end of each test 0 423 ah dm 3 for the urine matrices infected with p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively opposite to that the chloramine s generation showed a negligible influence of the target arb studied during the photo electrodisinfection tests initially a greater accumulation of chloramines was generated until reaching maximum values around 0 035 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 at 0 278 ah dm 3 after that the concentration of chloramines started to decrease toward 0 020 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 at 0 423 ah dm 3 showing a typical profile of an intermediate compound in this context the competitiveness of hypochlorite to attack bacteria or to degrade organic urine compounds for the release of nitrogen species could be helpful to explain the different chloramine profiles are observed in fig 4 it is noticeable that hypochlorite exhibits a higher bactericidal effect in comparison with chloramines because chloramines require longer exposure times to inactive microorganisms 67 additionally it is known that urine contains not only inorganic nitrogen from 17 67 mg dm 3 n nh4 2hpo4 but also organic nitrogen from n ch4n2o urea n c4h7n3o creatinine and n c5h4n4o3 uric acid in concentrations of 1554 00 61 88 and 16 66 mg dm 3 respectively 67 the soft operational conditions used for disinfection tests 50 a m 2 lead to a smooth degradation of these organics as summarized in table 2 the organic compound in a higher concentration urea exhibited the lowest removal percentages of 5 75 4 52 and 2 66 compared with creatinine 5 89 4 60 and 2 37 and uric acid 86 72 81 77 and 78 57 obtained during electrodisinfection tests of urines containing k pneumoniae s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively in this regard the degradation of organic compounds during electrodisinfection tests seems to be influenced by the presence of the different arb in the urine matrix in fact the higher the removal of arb args plotted in fig 3 the higher the degradation of organics from urine shown in table 2 due to the loss of competitiveness of hypochlorite in attacking arb instead of degrading organics furthermore as expected the highest removal rates of organic compounds were observed during photo electrodisinfection tests 68 70 a mean increment in the degradation percentage of 0 30 2 17 and 3 00 were obtained for urea creatinine and uric acid respectively compared with the ones obtained for the electrodisinfection processes the degradation of urea creatinine and uric acid leads to the release of nitrogen into solution herein fig 5 shows the evolution of nitrogen species as nitrite fig 5a nitrate fig 5b and ammonium ions fig 5c with the applied electric charge during the disinfection of hospital urines the degradation of n norg is known to firstly produce the highly reactive n no2 reaction 10 as shown in fig 5a 71 as can be observed it can be appreciated an initial zone with a null concentration of n no2 until 0 05 ah dm 3 from which n no2 concentration increased gradually for electrodisinfection tests up to around 0 13 mmol n no2 dm 3 regardless of the target arb studied 10 n org o 2 aq e no 2 nitrite may be considered a key intermediate nitrogen specie because it may be oxidized or reduced by many chemicals due to its intermediate oxidation state 3 72 nitrite has been reported to follow a disproportionation reaction in acidic media to mainly produce nitrate and nitric oxide and it may be also oxidized into nitrates due to the atmospheric oxygen moved into the aqueous media reactions 11 12 73 the nitrate profiles observed in fig 4b shows that n no3 concentration continuously increases during the electrodisinfection tests specifically maximum accumulations in the bulk solution of 0 109 0 080 and 0 069 mmol n no3 dm 3 were monitored at 0 423 ah dm 3 for urines containing k pneumoniae s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively in fact this evolution agrees the maximum accumulations observed for chloramines during electrodisinfection tests showed in fig 4 bearing in mind that nitrates are known to always evolve to ammonium ions as the final electrochemical reduction products reactions 13 14 32 71 73 the higher the accumulation of chloramines in the bulk solution the higher the efficiency on the removal of arb fig 3a since hypochlorite would tend to degrade organics in this regard final concentrations around 1 70 mmol n nh4 dm 3 were observed for each electrodisinfection test in fig 5c since the concentrations of ammonium ions monitored were not referred to the total concentration generated but those that have not reacted with other compounds thus accumulating in the bulk solution 11 3 no 2 2h 2no aq no 3 h 2 o 12 no 2 ½ o 2 aq no 3 13 no 3 6h 2 o 8e nh 3 aq 9oh 14 nh 3 aq h 2 o nh 4 oh a similar performance of nitrogen species may be described for the photo electrodisinfection tests although it should be highlighted the higher nitrogen release observed due to the higher degradation percentages of organics from urine as can be observed the accumulation of nitrogen species at 0 423 ah dm 3 ranges from 0 23 to 0 33 mmol n no2 dm 3 from 0 12 to 0 13 mmol n no3 dm 3 and from 1 75 to 1 88 mmol n nh4 dm 3 during photo electrodisinfection tests additionally uv light promotes the formation of nitrogen radicals from nitrite or nitrate reactions 15 16 which may contribute to enhance the efficiency on the removal of target arb during photo electrodisinfection 74 15 no 2 hv h no oh 16 no 3 hv no 2 o despite n nh4 concentration is observed to continuously increase with the applied electric charge during the photo electrodisinfection tests the concentration of chloramines started to decrease after 0 278 ah dm 3 fig 4 when the removal of arb was up to 6 logs fig 3a this fact could be explained considering the competitiveness of uv light between killing arb and degrading formed chloramines the depletion of chloramines under uv light exposure at 254 nm follows photolysis rate constants of 9 0 0 7 10 4 9 1 0 7 10 4 and 4 5 0 2 10 3 cm2 mj 1 for nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 respectively 75 in addition it has been reported the formation of chlorine and nitrogen radicals from the fracture of the ncl bonds in nh2cl and nhcl2 as a consequence of the uv light irradiation reactions 17 18 76 77 it is also remarkable that the formation of chlorine and nitrogen radicals can contribute not only to the bacteria killing but also to their args depletion which could explain the improvement in the disinfection efficiencies of the photo electrodisinfection process in comparison with electrodisinfection process as shown in fig 3 finally fig 6 illustrates the disinfection mechanisms that have been previously described during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes 17 nh 2 cl hv nh 2 cl 18 nhcl 2 hv nhcl cl 4 conclusions the antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus were selected as target arb considering their prevalence to cause utis in patients from the university hospital complex of albacete spain the disposal of these untreated hospital urines would lead to outcome a significant sanitary and environmental risk a microfluidic flow through reactor mmo anode cb ptfe cathode was used for the electrochemical treatment of simulated hospital urines at 50 a m 2 attaining arb removals of 4 9 5 8 and 7 logs total disinfection at 0 423 ah dm 3 for p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively the killing of arb takes place due to the formation of hypochlorite although it is not only a powerful disinfectant but also a powerful oxidant thus hypochlorite seems to develop competitive reactions between killing arb and degrading organics from urine which leads to release inorganic nitrogen species as nitrates and then promoting the formation of chloramines additionally the coupling of uv light to the electrodisinfection process significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency reaching the complete disinfection for each arb tested furthermore log removals of 3 70 2 25 and 0 82 were also attained for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively these outcomes reveal the promotion of chlorine and even nitrogen radicals which contribute to enhance the disinfection efficiency of the target arb args in urine the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 experimental setup of the microfluidic flow

12879,the depletion of bla kpc k pneumoniae bla oxa 50 p aeruginosa and meca s aureus genes from hospital urines is evaluated to contribute to solve the silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance bacteria a microfluidic flow through reactor with mmo anode and cb ptfe cathode working at 50 a m 2 is employed during electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes the electrodisinfection process only achieves an almost negligible removal of dna and slightly log arg increments of 0 18 0 19 and 0 71 for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively conversely the photo electrodisinfection process attains the complete disinfection for all arb tested and logarithmic removals of 3 70 2 25 and 0 82 for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively these outcomes emphasize the potential of the uv light coupled to the electrodisinfection process to promote the formation of not only hypochlorite but also chlorine and even nitrogen radicals which contribute to enhance the disinfection efficiency of the target arb and their args graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes urine electrodisinfection photo electrodisinfection data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the alarming spread of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb has become a global concern due to the significant number of deaths occurring worldwide the european centre for disease prevention and control has pointed out the great threat posed by arb due to 671 689 arb infections and 33 110 deaths during 2015 1 more recently 2 868 700 arb infections per year with 24 900 deaths have been estimated in the united states by the u s department of health and human services 2 furthermore the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args may also be developed due to vertical transfer i e cell division and or horizontal gene transfer processes conjugation transduction and natural transformation 3 the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes args by staphylococcus aureus s aureus klebsiella pneumoniae k pneumoniae or pseudomonas aeruginosa p aeruginosa have been reported to reduce the treatment options of severe infections such as pneumonias sepsis endocarditis skin infections etc 4 6 hospital urines can be considered as one of the main hotspots of arb and args since microorganisms are excreted from infected patients mainly by urine 7 some studies have recently reported on the pre treatment of hospital urines to prevent the appearance and spread of arb args and mobile genetic elements 8 12 conventional technologies based on the addition of chlorine disinfectant species are widely applied in disinfection processes however several studies have reported on the increment of args during chlorine disinfection wu et al have recently found that the relative abundance of 14 args tolc acra acrb etc increased by 49 6 after the disinfection process with 5 mg dm 3 of chlorine 13 likewise jin et al reported on the increment of args exchange across bacterial and the emergence of new arb after the disinfection process with hypochlorite naclo in the range 4 6 mg dm 3 these results were attributted to the enhancement of horizontal transfer processes by the increment of the cell membrane permeabilisation and a stronger stress response of the survival arb 14 kampf has also recently reported on the lack of data available in the literature on a possible induction reduction of antibiotic resistance genes and horizontal gene transfer processes using hydrogen peroxide as a disinfectant 15 on the other hand uv disinfection is known to promote bacterial inactivation by damages caused on deoxyribonucleic acid dna and antibiotic resistance genes args 16 however damages caused by uv disinfection can be repaired after relatively small times promoting bacterial regrowth 17 uv irradiation may be coupled to catalysis processes photocatalysis to improve the removal of microorganisms from water environment 18 venieri et al reported a 6 log reduction of klebsiella pneumoniae in real wastewater with a binary co mn tio2 catalyst under simulated solar irradiation 19 s aureus was inactivated during the photocatalysis process using α nimoo4 as catalyst due to the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species 20 the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops provide several advantages for the disinfection treatment e g they are considered as environmental friendly technologies because the electron is a clean reagent 21 22 tu et al reported a 99 99 of inactivation sars cov 2 using in situ formed nickel oxide hydroxide as anode catalyst in the electrochemical oxidation process at 5 v 23 simultaneous removal of arb and args by the electrochemical disinfection have also been carried out in recent literature fang et al achieved 5 log escherichia coli k 12 le392 removal and simultaneously they attained the degradation of teta and blatem genes by molybdenum carbide assisted electrochemical disinfection under 2 v 24 zhang et al achieved 83 46 escherichia coli 10 667 sul args degradation compared to 10 23 during chlorination or 27 07 under uv light irradiation 25 additionally the coupling of uv light with the electrochemical disinfection process may enhance the generation of powerful chlorine and or nitrogen radicals by the photoactivation of the electrogenerated disinfectants as hydrogen peroxide hypochlorite or chloramines many works have published on the efficiency of different radicals to degrade dna and args 26 28 ahmed et al evaluated a modified photo fenton process at neutral ph and using ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds to chelate iron iii for the removal of arb and args 26 they found that 0 1 mm fe iii 0 2 mm edds and 0 3 mm hydrogen peroxide h2o2 allowed to decrease the concentration of e args by 6 log within 10 min additionally zhang et al studied the oxidative damage induced on args in a novel sulfidated micron zero valent activated persulfate system they attributed removals of 2 9 tetb and 2 2 16s rrna logs to the promotion of reactive oxygen species in the solution mainly sulfate and hydroxyl radicals 28 with this background the main goal is to study the performance of the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection process for the removal of arb and args in hospital urines to do this the target bacteria were selected based on their potential to cause urinary tract infections utis in patients from the university hospital complex of albacete spain and on the sanitary and environmental risk that they posed a microfluidic flow through reactor mmo anode cb ptfe cathode was used during the disinfection tests of hospital urines a current density of 50 a m

an initial concentration of 107 cfu ml 1 the composition of the synthetic urine employed has been previously reported elsewhere 34 bacterial strains were cultured at 37 c for 24 h in tryptone soy agar plates scharlab s l before being resuspended into the synthetic urine all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the results were expressed as the mean values since the standard deviation in biological and chemical analyses was below 5 2 3 biological analyses 2 3 1 bacterial concentration the concentration of p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae was determined using the μ trac 4200

prevalent microorganism which causes urinary tract infections utis in the university hospital complex of albacete spain within the period of 2014 2018 the study was carried out with 4453 urine samples that were positive for at least one pathogen the urine samples belonged to patients hospitalized in the geriatrics hematology oncology and medical and surgical intensive care wards the pathogens were grouped in the following three families gram negative bacteria blue colour gram positive bacteria orange colour or yeasts green colour as can be observed most of the microorganisms causing utis belong to the gram negative bacteria group representing 62 78 of the total microorganisms analysed indeed the main bacteria causing utis were escherichia coli e coli with a presence percentage of 37 05 follows by k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa with 8 46 and 5 16 respectively it is noticeable that antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa have been recently reported for the serious threat involved in sanitary environments 4 46 specifically these arb present a poor response to antibiotic treatments and their outbreak often causes life threatening nosocomial infections with a plethora of symptoms such as severe pneumonia lung infections sepsis or multiorgan failure 5 6 furthermore gram positive bacteria and yeasts were also present in 21 70 and 15 51 of the total microorganisms analysed respectively enterococcus faecalis e faecalis enterococcus faecium e faecium staphylococcus epidermidis s epidermidis and s aureus were the main gram positive bacteria causing utis with a prevalence of 50 41 14 64 7 32 and 5 95 respectively it is of special relevance the infections caused by antibiotic resistant s aureus since it is a common human pathogenic bacteria with a wide range of virulence factors and high adaptability and tenacity that can result in infectious diseases such as skin infections endocarditis bacteremia or lethal pneumonia among others 47 48 on the other hand the genus candida mainly cope the yeasts analysed in the study in the last years drug resistance in yeasts is becoming an emerging and threatening scenario due to the lack of effective treatment alternatives 49 however the prevalence of antibiotic resistance strains in gram negative and gram positive bacteria over yeasts can be clearly depicted from the report on antibiotic resistance in the united states published by the u s department of health and human services 2 in this context antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus have been employed as target bacteria for the disinfection processes tested in the present work to control the dissemination of arb into the environment and to reduce potential horizontal transfer processes it is of crucial importance the removal of deoxyribonucleic acid dna and antibiotic resistance genes args present in the antibiotic resistant bacterial strains the occurrence of the coexistence of several args in a single bacterial strain is a factor that amplifies the danger posed by the bacterium in this regard to gain insight into the args composition of the three arb tested in this work a search of the main genes responsible for carrying antibiotic resistance through different resistance mechanisms has been carried out in the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database during this search the nucleotide sequence of the three arb was continuously compared with the sequences of the args tested and sequences with a homology percentage higher than 99 were assigned to their resistance mechanism table 1 summarized the args present in k pneumoniae atcc baa 1705 p aeruginosa atcc 9027 and s aureus atcc 43300 grouped based on the resistance mechanism to antibiotics among the major resistance mechanisms present in arb are 1 limiting drug uptake drugs that target the cell wall mainly β lactams and glycopeptides enter the cell through porin channels in the outer membrane 2 drug target modification bacteria are able to modify the components that are targeted by drugs to enable resistance to those drugs 3 drug inactivation this mechanism can proceed by the degradation of the drug or by the transference of a chemical group to inactivate the drug 4 drug efflux bacteria that contain chromosomally encoded genes for efflux pumps have the capacity to rid drugs out of the cell and many of these pumps transport a large variety of compounds multi drug efflux pumps 50 52 in this work bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes were selected as arg models for k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively the k pneumoniae strains harboring the bla kpc gene represent the most common cause of carbapenem resistance in enterobacteriaceae 53 carbapenemases hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics and other β lactam antibiotics provide a high antibiotic resistance 54 the bla oxa 50 gene is an oxacillinase β lactam gene that confers a decreased susceptibility to antibiotics such as ampicillin ticarcillin moxalactam or meropenem 55 finally the meca gene encodes a low affinity penicillin binding protein pbp 2a which provides resistance to methicillin 56 likewise the meca gene is part of a mobile genetic element that may also provide resistance to non β lactam antibiotics through other contained genetic structures tn554 pub110 or pt181 57 in this regard fig 3a shows the evolution of arb k pneumoniae p aeruginosa s aureus as a function of the applied electric charge whereas fig 3b plots the performance of args bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes and dna during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection of synthetic hospital urines results show that the electrodisinfection process achieved removal ratios higher than 4 logs by applying an electric charge of 0 423 ah dm 3 180 min it is remarkable that the efficiency of the electrodisinfection process varied within a logarithmic order of magnitude among the target arb tested specifically log removals of 4 9 5 8 and 7 total disinfection were achieved for p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively however results also show that slightly log increments of 0 71 0 18 and 0 19 were obtained during the electrodisinfection experiments for bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes respectively indeed the logarithmic increments of args seem to be promoted with the higher removal efficiency of each arb tested bla kpc k pneumoniae meca s aureus bla oxa 50 p aeruginosa in addition an almost negligible removal of dna was observed for every electrodisinfection experiment conducted on the other hand the coupling of uv light with the electrodisinfection process significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency of the process reaching the complete disinfection regardless of the target arb tested the removal of p aeruginosa is observed to be slightly more efficient than the removal of k pneumoniae or s aureus since the complete disinfection is attained at 0 278 ah dm 3 120 min additionally logarithmic removals of dna of 0 172 0 239 and 0 153 were attained during the photo electrodisinfection experiments for the synthetic hospital urines infected with k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus respectively likewise results also showed that log removals of 0 82 3 70 and 2 25 were obtained during the photo electrodisinfection experiments for bla kpc bla oxa 50 and meca genes respectively in fact the more efficient the removal of arb the higher the removal of args the performance of arb args and dna of each strain tested may be related to the disinfectant species electrogenerated during the electrodisinfection process and or even the possible photo activation of these disinfectant species during the photo electrodisinfection process to shed light on it the generation of the different expected disinfectant species were followed during both disinfection processes firstly the use of a titanium cathode with a carbon black polytetrafluoroethylene cb ptfe mixture should promote the generation of hydrogen peroxide by oxygen reduction reaction 1 58 60 the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was monitored during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes data not shown although negligible measurements were obtained for every test this fact does not mean a null electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide but a fast decomposition which could be related with parasitic reactions such as its self decomposition reaction 2 its oxidation in the anode surface to produce oxygen reaction 3 its reduction in the cathode surface to water reaction 4 or its reaction with organic compounds and or bacteria present in urine media 29 61 62 likewise hydrogen peroxide may be activated with uv light to promote the generation of hydroxyl radicals reaction 5 during the photo electrodisinfection process 12 in fact moratalla et al reported the performance on the electrogeneration of hydrogen peroxide using a microfluidic flow through reactor with a mmo anode and a cb ptfe cathode working at 50 a m 2 30 the treatment of urines in the absence of their organic compounds led to maximum accumulations of 24 99 mg h2o2 dm 3 0 8 ah dm 3 working at atmospheric pressure 1 o 2 g 2h 2e h 2 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 h 2 o ½ o 2 3 h 2 o 2 2e o 2 2h 4 h 2 o 2 2h 2e 2h 2 o 5 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh similarly the evolution of chlorine derived disinfectant species as hypochlorite was also monitored in our previous works the evolution of hypochlorite was studied during the electrolysis of urines in the absence of their organic compounds using a microfluidic flow through the reactor with a mmo anode and a stainless steel cathode at 50 a m 2 this test proved the increase in the generation of hypochlorite as a final product reaching maximum concentrations around 1 8 mmol dm 3 cl clo 0 423 ah dm 3 32 however no significant concentrations of hypochlorite were detected in the present work since this is a very reactive species that i can react to degrade organic compounds and to kill bacteria from urine ii can promote to other chlorine species in a higher oxidation state such as chlorate and or perchlorate iii can chemically react with ammonium ions nh4 urine 22 72 mg dm 3 to produce inorganic chloramines reactions 6 8 or even iv can be activated with uv light to produce chlorine radicals reaction 9 10 63 on the one hand the formation of hazardous chloro species as chlorates and perchlorates was avoided due to the high complexity of urine media 64 on the other hand chloramines show higher stability than hypochlorite being easier to measure as they maintain an acceptable residual concentration in solution over time 65 herein the evolution of the concentration of total chloramines is shown in fig 4 as a function of the applied electric charge during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection of hospital urines infected with k pneumoniae p aeruginosa or s aureus total inorganic chloramines correspond to the sum of monochloramine nh2cl dichloramine nhcl2 and trichloramine ncl3 which each prevalence depends on the ph of the bulk solution 66 nhcl2 followed by nh2cl should be mainly promoted since ph values ranged from 5 to 6 during these disinfection experiments 6 nh 4 clo nh 2 cl h 2 o 7 nh 2 cl clo nhcl 2 h 2 o 8 nhcl 2 clo ncl 3 oh 9 clo hv cl o as can be observed different behavior in the evolution of chloramines was observed during the electrodisinfection and the photo electrodisinfection tests the concentration of chloramines continuously increased with the applied electric charge during electrodisinfection tests with a significant influence on the target arb specifically maximum values of 0 070 0 039 and 0 011 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 were obtained at the end of each test 0 423 ah dm 3 for the urine matrices infected with p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively opposite to that the chloramine s generation showed a negligible influence of the target arb studied during the photo electrodisinfection tests initially a greater accumulation of chloramines was generated until reaching maximum values around 0 035 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 at 0 278 ah dm 3 after that the concentration of chloramines started to decrease toward 0 020 mmol cl nhxcly dm 3 at 0 423 ah dm 3 showing a typical profile of an intermediate compound in this context the competitiveness of hypochlorite to attack bacteria or to degrade organic urine compounds for the release of nitrogen species could be helpful to explain the different chloramine profiles are observed in fig 4 it is noticeable that hypochlorite exhibits a higher bactericidal effect in comparison with chloramines because chloramines require longer exposure times to inactive microorganisms 67 additionally it is known that urine contains not only inorganic nitrogen from 17 67 mg dm 3 n nh4 2hpo4 but also organic nitrogen from n ch4n2o urea n c4h7n3o creatinine and n c5h4n4o3 uric acid in concentrations of 1554 00 61 88 and 16 66 mg dm 3 respectively 67 the soft operational conditions used for disinfection tests 50 a m 2 lead to a smooth degradation of these organics as summarized in table 2 the organic compound in a higher concentration urea exhibited the lowest removal percentages of 5 75 4 52 and 2 66 compared with creatinine 5 89 4 60 and 2 37 and uric acid 86 72 81 77 and 78 57 obtained during electrodisinfection tests of urines containing k pneumoniae s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively in this regard the degradation of organic compounds during electrodisinfection tests seems to be influenced by the presence of the different arb in the urine matrix in fact the higher the removal of arb args plotted in fig 3 the higher the degradation of organics from urine shown in table 2 due to the loss of competitiveness of hypochlorite in attacking arb instead of degrading organics furthermore as expected the highest removal rates of organic compounds were observed during photo electrodisinfection tests 68 70 a mean increment in the degradation percentage of 0 30 2 17 and 3 00 were obtained for urea creatinine and uric acid respectively compared with the ones obtained for the electrodisinfection processes the degradation of urea creatinine and uric acid leads to the release of nitrogen into solution herein fig 5 shows the evolution of nitrogen species as nitrite fig 5a nitrate fig 5b and ammonium ions fig 5c with the applied electric charge during the disinfection of hospital urines the degradation of n norg is known to firstly produce the highly reactive n no2 reaction 10 as shown in fig 5a 71 as can be observed it can be appreciated an initial zone with a null concentration of n no2 until 0 05 ah dm 3 from which n no2 concentration increased gradually for electrodisinfection tests up to around 0 13 mmol n no2 dm 3 regardless of the target arb studied 10 n org o 2 aq e no 2 nitrite may be considered a key intermediate nitrogen specie because it may be oxidized or reduced by many chemicals due to its intermediate oxidation state 3 72 nitrite has been reported to follow a disproportionation reaction in acidic media to mainly produce nitrate and nitric oxide and it may be also oxidized into nitrates due to the atmospheric oxygen moved into the aqueous media reactions 11 12 73 the nitrate profiles observed in fig 4b shows that n no3 concentration continuously increases during the electrodisinfection tests specifically maximum accumulations in the bulk solution of 0 109 0 080 and 0 069 mmol n no3 dm 3 were monitored at 0 423 ah dm 3 for urines containing k pneumoniae s aureus and p aeruginosa respectively in fact this evolution agrees the maximum accumulations observed for chloramines during electrodisinfection tests showed in fig 4 bearing in mind that nitrates are known to always evolve to ammonium ions as the final electrochemical reduction products reactions 13 14 32 71 73 the higher the accumulation of chloramines in the bulk solution the higher the efficiency on the removal of arb fig 3a since hypochlorite would tend to degrade organics in this regard final concentrations around 1 70 mmol n nh4 dm 3 were observed for each electrodisinfection test in fig 5c since the concentrations of ammonium ions monitored were not referred to the total concentration generated but those that have not reacted with other compounds thus accumulating in the bulk solution 11 3 no 2 2h 2no aq no 3 h 2 o 12 no 2 ½ o 2 aq no 3 13 no 3 6h 2 o 8e nh 3 aq 9oh 14 nh 3 aq h 2 o nh 4 oh a similar performance of nitrogen species may be described for the photo electrodisinfection tests although it should be highlighted the higher nitrogen release observed due to the higher degradation percentages of organics from urine as can be observed the accumulation of nitrogen species at 0 423 ah dm 3 ranges from 0 23 to 0 33 mmol n no2 dm 3 from 0 12 to 0 13 mmol n no3 dm 3 and from 1 75 to 1 88 mmol n nh4 dm 3 during photo electrodisinfection tests additionally uv light promotes the formation of nitrogen radicals from nitrite or nitrate reactions 15 16 which may contribute to enhance the efficiency on the removal of target arb during photo electrodisinfection 74 15 no 2 hv h no oh 16 no 3 hv no 2 o despite n nh4 concentration is observed to continuously increase with the applied electric charge during the photo electrodisinfection tests the concentration of chloramines started to decrease after 0 278 ah dm 3 fig 4 when the removal of arb was up to 6 logs fig 3a this fact could be explained considering the competitiveness of uv light between killing arb and degrading formed chloramines the depletion of chloramines under uv light exposure at 254 nm follows photolysis rate constants of 9 0 0 7 10 4 9 1 0 7 10 4 and 4 5 0 2 10 3 cm2 mj 1 for nh2cl nhcl2 and ncl3 respectively 75 in addition it has been reported the formation of chlorine and nitrogen radicals from the fracture of the ncl bonds in nh2cl and nhcl2 as a consequence of the uv light irradiation reactions 17 18 76 77 it is also remarkable that the formation of chlorine and nitrogen radicals can contribute not only to the bacteria killing but also to their args depletion which could explain the improvement in the disinfection efficiencies of the photo electrodisinfection process in comparison with electrodisinfection process as shown in fig 3 finally fig 6 illustrates the disinfection mechanisms that have been previously described during the electrodisinfection and photo electrodisinfection processes 17 nh 2 cl hv nh 2 cl 18 nhcl 2 hv nhcl cl 4 conclusions the antibiotic resistant strains of k pneumoniae p aeruginosa and s aureus were selected as target arb considering their prevalence to cause utis in patients from the university hospital complex of albacete spain the disposal of these untreated hospital urines would lead to outcome a significant sanitary and environmental risk a microfluidic flow through reactor mmo anode cb ptfe cathode was used for the electrochemical treatment of simulated hospital urines at 50 a m 2 attaining arb removals of 4 9 5 8 and 7 logs total disinfection at 0 423 ah dm 3 for p aeruginosa s aureus and k pneumoniae respectively the killing of arb takes place due to the formation of hypochlorite although it is not only a powerful disinfectant but also a powerful oxidant thus hypochlorite seems to develop competitive reactions between killing arb and degrading organics from urine which leads to release inorganic nitrogen species as nitrates and then promoting the formation of chloramines additionally the coupling of uv light to the electrodisinfection process significantly enhance the disinfection efficiency reaching the complete disinfection for each arb tested furthermore log removals of 3 70 2 25 and 0 82 were also attained for bla oxa 50 meca and bla kpc genes respectively these outcomes reveal the promotion of chlorine and even nitrogen radicals which contribute to enhance the disinfection efficiency of the target arb args in urine the following are the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 experimental setup of the microfluidic flow
